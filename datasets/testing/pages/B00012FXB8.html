The fact that 3/4's of our favorite surviving characters from Aliens is all eliminated before the movie even gets rolling was an immediate bummer. The overall depressing pace, color, texture, grit, taste and even the powerful musical score made one require an extra dose of their favorite anti-depressant after seeing the movie. That is my overall impression of the movie which I still give high points to.<br /><br />While the consensus of opinion is mixed I would have to agree with the statistics published by AMAZON which are flat and show no clear trend from a large population of Alien fans who were very disappointed in this movie. You can't fight the statistics. The fans just couldn't enjoy even a skillfully done Alien 3 with the feel of a death camp.<br /><br />I believe the main problem with Alien 3 is that the plot was developed in a series of steps by excellent people selected by the studio who picked up the job where it was left off by others. The studio assumed that it could be done that way if it had to be, and it just can't.<br /><br />As the numerous DVD extras include terrific and always interesting technical materials on the making of the movie I would recommend this DVD for all ALIEN fans. The two disk version has the original theatrical movie version as well as a longer version with a slightly different but no less depressing plot. This alternate version, which suffers from a poor sound track, was also interesting to screen when one has the time and inclination. The DVD provides the option of subtitles for interested viewers wishing to indulge their curiosity in an alternate version of Alien 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>With the Alien Quadrilogy set, I am not really sure where to even begin. Yes, all 4 films are here and all are presented wonderfully. But really, it's the extras here that are the star attractions for this release. By now, you have heard how large the extras are and how "exhaustive" they are. So wonderfully true. Going thru every disc and feeding on the special features that are here is an epic adventure in itself right along with the actual films. 9 discs in all!. Each film comes with a second disc full of all the bonus features. Almost every person imaginable is here and accounted for in the documentaries. There are featurettes on how the films got started, Pre-production featurettes, sketches, designs, trailers, differnt camera angle scenes, deleted/extended scenes, commentaries, photo galleries, special effects and creature designs, H.R. Giger, and so on. It seems endless. The bonus disc even has a new 64 minute documentary on the first film, a Ridley Scott Q&A and more. Seriously, you will be suffering from Alien overload once you are done with this set. You already know the films, so there is no real need to go into detail about every one. Each film comes in two versions - the original theatrical run, and a director's cut version. Some of those new cuts enhance the films(Aliens), some are unnecessary(Alien), and some just don't make that much of a difference(Alien 3 and 4). 1979's "Alien" is a classic masterpiece. Truly original and brilliant. The extras are great. Where is Yaphett Kotto and Ian Holm?. 1986's "Aliens" was one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron isn't as involved as other directors in the new features, but he is there. I find the documentaries and behind the scenes features here the most interesting. The demanding Cameron, the clashes with the London crew, and so on. Good stuff. 1992's "Alien 3" was where it fell apart. Fincher is a great director, and there are some good moments, but it was a major disappointment. The documentaries and features are far more fascinating. Once you watch them, you may feel for Fincher and how Alien 3 was an uphill battle from the get go. Fincher is also the only director who doesn't appear in new interviews for this set. 1997's "Alien Resurrection" was an improvement, but by no means was anywhere near as good as the first two. Writer Joss Whedon(of Buffy fame)has condemned the film every chance he gets. Resurrection is entertaining and has some good moments and factors to it. The film is not great, but it's not the unwatchable abomination Whedon thinks it is. If not that isn't enough, the set comes with a booklet that has a small overview of every film, and tells you where the extras are, what can be found on each disc, and their running time. The Alien Quadrilogy set is a mammoth experience that hasn't been matched yet. I can't imagine what it would take to even go further than this box set. The Alien films are batting 2 out of 4, but even the lesser films are better than a lot of other stuff that is out there. This is a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>This box is fully loaded.  Two versions of each movie.  I enjoy the director's cut versions more than the theatrical versions.  The first two movies are the best in my opinion.<br /><br />ALIEN- a complete sci-fi masterpiece.  The story, the actors, and the setting are superb.  The special effects were awesome for the time of 1979.  The chest thing messed me up back then!!  I love it.<br /><br />ALIENS- Ripley returns to aide in what she believes is a rescue mission but is mislead.  Jones stays home though.  More action packed as James Cameron takes the helm at this one.  Excellent sequel.<br /><br />ALIEN 3- Kinda wierd how she lands on a planet used solely for a mens prison.  The dog/alien mixture is pretty cool.  Is she with Child?<br /><br />ALIEN Resurrection- A new form of Ripley?  This fourth installment was quite enjoyable considering part three was stank.  Why does she play basketball good?  Alien blood?<br /><br />my review was kinda lacking on the info but believe me this box set is worth the price.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>I have been an Alien fan since I was like 3 or 4 years old.  These movies are my life (I know it's sad, but it's true).  This is the best DVD box set of all time for anything.<br /><br />Disc 1 - ALIEN<br /><br />Wow, what a good movie.  Very atmospheric and scarey.  The Director's Cut is still good, but no match for the original cut.<br /><br />Disc 2 - The Beast Within: The Making of Alien<br /><br />There are so much extras on this disc that it gives me a headache.  You know that there's enough special features when you haven't looked at them all after two years.<br /><br />Disc 3 - ALIENS<br /><br />My favorite movie of all time.  Awsome characters, great storyline.  The Special Edition has some great stuff added into it, but the original will always be the greatest movie ever.<br /><br />Disc 4 - Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens<br /><br />We couldn't ask for more extra features for this movie.  There are some excellent interviews and other things on the documentary.<br /><br />Disc 5 - Alien 3<br /><br />I love this movie, and I like the Special Edition alot.  They're both good and I don't know which one is better.  David Fincher needs to say something about this movie instead of being a wimp and ignoring it.<br /><br />Disc 6 - The Making of Alien 3<br /><br />They skimped out on some stuff for the documentary because of all the bad talk about 20th Century Fox.  There's still alot of extra things on this disc that will satisfy fans.<br /><br />Disc 7 - Alien Resurrection<br /><br />I really hate this movie, and I hate the Special Edition as well, but I can't lie that the new opening is interesting to watch.<br /><br />Disc 8 - One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection<br /><br />I can't lie.  This disc has alot of interesting stuff on it compared to how bad the movie is.  It's a worthwhile look into the making of the movie.  At least some of the people are honest and say that they don't like it.<br /><br />Disc 9 - Alien Quadrilogy<br /><br />Wow, the laserdisc archive is worth it alone.  Bob Burns is one of the coolest guys ever.  The trailers are so sweet.  We get all the Alien comic book covers on DVD-ROM.  Awsome...<br /><br />I recommend this to any sci-fi fan or anyone who can afford this box set.  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>I wrote reviews for the seperate Alien DVDs describing the new footage.  Now, here is my review for all the Alien films.<br /><br />ALIEN: This film is one of the greatest sci-fi films since 2001: A Space Odyssey and horror films since the Exorcist and the orginial Psycho. And this is Ridley Scott's best film to date (Gladiator was excellent too, don't get me wrong) this film started a legacy that will continue for centuries to come. The story is about seven space miners who find a mysterious planet (which is later named LV-426) and later go off to investigate. Then, one of the crewmembers (Kane) goes down a tunnel and ends up with a facehugger on his face. Little do they know that this facehugger has planted an Alien embryo inside of Kane. Then, after the chestburster erupts from Kane's chest, the merciless Alien kills five other crew members (well actually four, one was an android protecting the Alien so the crewmembers killed the android) and changed the life of the seventh forever. This outstanding, groundbreaking film made millons at the box office and earned itself an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The new DVD has two versions of the film: The orginial theatrical version, and a new "Director's Cut". Personally, like all other people, I don't mind this new Director's Cut. Ridley Scott reedited this version with exceptional skill, and the 4 1/2 minutes of new footage is easy to spot, but the 5 minutes of footage he edited out from the theatrical version is tough to spot. Still, the Theatrical Version is slightly better. It is 47 seconds longer than the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10<br />Director's Cut Rating: 9/10<br /><br />ALIENS: James Cameron's Alien vision is super intense, suspenceful, and matches everything ALIEN matched in the sci-fi genre. 57 years have passed since the destruction of the Nostromo, and Ripley now joins Colonial Marines to destroy the Alien species for good. This film earned 7 Oscar Nomnations inculding Best Actress (Sigourney Weaver), an incredible feat for a sci-fi film.  This film is the film in which Sigourney Weaver gave her best performance by far in any of her films she starred in. This DVD is the DVD debut for the theatrical version of this film, and it also contains the Special Edition, with 17 minutes of extra footage, making the film flawless in all ways.  The Special Edition of ALIENS is the best posible version of the film- because it has more action, suspense, story, and most importantly- character development. But that doesn't mean the theatrical version isn't worth watching. The theatrical version is outstanding- the special edition is classic. A must for sci-fi buffs.<br /><br />Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10<br />Special Edition Rating: 10/10<br /><br />ALIEN 3: The third film the the ALIEN QUADRILOGY is far worse than the last two- but still good. This film does not have the one-two punch of ALIEN and ALIENS, but has good performances by most of the characters, but a definite feeling of deja-vu hangs over the proceedings. The mediocre FX, the fact that director David Fincher shamelessly ignored the orginial Alien design (well at least they said it was different- but never gave a reason why in the film) and a nearly endless chase down a seemingly endless amount of tunnels. Still, a few scares are in this film, and other good things too. This film is the goriest, most violent, and most profane ALIEN film. The DVD of this film has two versions of the film: the theatrical version and the never before seen special edition (formerly known as the Assembly Cut or Workprint Version) this version adds 40 minutes of deleted, extended and alternate scenes to the film, extending its orginial run time from 114 minutes to 144 minutes. The Special Edition is better than the theatrical version because it makes more sense than the theatrical. If you watch both versions, and compae them, you'll see why. ALIEN 3 takes place in a prison facility that Ripley, Hicks, Newt and the destroyed android Bishop land in after two Alien eggs were laid, once attached itself to Ripley's face, and the other (to a dog in the theatrical version, and an ox in the special edition). This prison facility is a maximum security prison full of male inmates, a company man, a medical officer, and the warden. Ripley survives, and Newt and Hicks get killed. Then, the Alien bursts from an animal's chest and runs amok.<br /><br />Theatrical Version Rating: 6/10<br />Special Edition Rating: 7/10<br /><br />ALIEN RESURRECTION: The fourth and final ALIEN film is the worst of the four, but it's not that bad, since the monster effects are superb, but the film itself, has far too many plot holes, wisecracks and a script written by Joss Whedon- the worst script writer ever. The acting is OK- and the story stinks. Overall- it's OK- but is still the worst of the four ALIEN films. This film was directed by Jean-Pierre Jenuet- and he has little skill in the sci-fi genre. This DVD has two versions: The theatrical version and the improved uncut special edition, with 12 minutes (I think) inculding an alternate opening and ending and extensions of other scenes, making the films orginial running time 109 minutes to 116 minutes. This version is a little better, and I like the orginial opening much more than the theatrical opening. Jean-Pierre Jeunet only cared about the film critic's reviews from France, not the United States.<br /><br />Theatrical Version Rating: 5/10<br />Special Edition Rating: 6/10<br /><br />Overall Rating for all 8 Versions of all 4 films: 7.5/10<br /><br />Extras: There are SO MANY extras in this set, i will just put it this way: each film gets it's own three-hour documentary. On the movie discs, you will get commentaries for all four films for both versions of each film. Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver and others provide the commentary for ALIEN. (Unfortunately, this was the only ALIEN film Weaver did a commentary for.) for ALIENS, James Cameron and others do a commentary. For ALIEN 3, David Fincher didn't participate in doing the commentary (I don't blame him). Editor Terry Rawlings (he was also was the editor for ALIEN) and others inculding Lance Henriksen do a commentary for ALIEN 3. For ALIEN RESURRECTION, Jean-Pierre Jenuet and others do a commentary.<br /><br />Extras Rating: 12/10<br /><br />Overall Rating For Entire Set: 10/10<br /><br />Anyone who's anybody has to get this extradinary set. YOU WILL LOVE IT.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>If you're a sci fi fan and also demand the best of adio video then this set is for you .... I own both this and the 2001 Alien legacy series and WOW can you ven note the difference .... The Quadrilogy has tons of scenes and all the movies have been re-done and remastered ... while the other legacy DVD's are dark and moody, one of the problems they had in the original theater release .... these DVD's nothing less than spectacular and CRISP !!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>... the ALIEN 3 has been bashed for many years for being simply that; an inferior follow-up to two great first installments in the saga.  Certainly, everyone can concede that it would be extraordinarily difficult to match up to the sheer scare power of ALIEN or ALIENS, and ALIEN 3 deserves a second look on its own merits.<p>That said, this outing finds Lt. Ripley crash-landing onto a prison world, where she faces a cadre of lustful killers who -- in an odd twist of fate -- are already too late: a seed has been planted inside her, and it's her worst nightmare come true.  Ellen Ripley carries an infant alien, the next generation of horror, and thus ensues the race against time to battle both a full-size predator on the loose, the one germinating inside our heroine, and the evil forces of the company who've learned that there's still an alien out there for them to the world of business.<p>In one tidy little package, ALIEN 3 is a well-paced allegory for all that Ripley has feared.  Standing alone, it's a nice little film -- not a great one -- that probably has been stripped by fandom of its ability to be just that: one nice little scare.  Being part of a trilogy (well, until the next installment anyway) where the first two parts equal a sum far greater than ALIEN 3 could match, its swallowed up like prey.</p></br><a href="../users/A39VJRIW7HC5C0.html">A39VJRIW7HC5C0</a><br/><p>Although much-maligned by critics and fans alike, Alien 3 is a worthy movie that was hampered by all-too-high expectations raised by the unbeleivable first two movies.<br /><br />(Potential spoilers, but only things revealed in the beginning of the movie). A lot of the critisism that I have seen aimed at this movie stems from the fact that Newt, Ripley's surrogate daughter from the second film, was killed off.  Be realistic people, this movie was filmed six years after the second, there was no way of bringing back Carrie Henn, and killing her off was a much better proposition than casting a different actress.<br /><br />I really have no idea why this movie is so despised.  Although how an alien (or multiple ones) got onboard the Sulaco is shoddily explained at best, the plot is strong thereafter.  Ripley is in a decaying former prison, where there are no weapons because there is no where to go.  Ripley must overcome disbeleif and then fear as she tries to rally the hardened criminals into a fighting force (a fighting force armed with axes and scissors no less) and stop the alien.  There is also the added element of the ominous company trying to apprehend the alien and use it for their own, diabolical purposes.<br /><br />The sets on the dark, barely-functioning prison world are as good as anything seen in the first two films, and the acting may be the best of any movie in the series (there is no overacting Veronica Cartwright, underacting Winona Ryder, and the sometimes over-zealous Weaver seen in the second-film) and the music is good, if not great.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is the cancer of this series (well I suppose now that dubious honor has shifted to AVP), watch this film and enjoy it for what it is: a worthy and altogethor different entry in a great series.  It should be noted that the original movie is by far the better of the two versions.  Although the "Director's Cut" adds some interesting angles, shots, and ideas, the plotting is nowhere near as good and I sincerely reccomend the orginal<br /><br />Original: 7/10<br /><br />Director's Cut: 5.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Alien 3 has the unfortunate task of trying to live up to Ridley Scott's excellent Alien and James Cameron's equally thrilly Aleins. First-time director David Fincher was handed the reins by the Alien franchise's producers and tries to live up to the Alien franchise's pedigree.<br /><br />Fincher's direction of this third leg of the Alien Quadrilogy can't be faulted for this film's weakness when compared to the first two Alien films. Fincher's career after Alien 3 can attest to the fact that this man has very great directing skills i.e. The Game, Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room. I place the blame for this leg of the Quadrilogy wholly on the team of writers who decided to go away from the conclusion of Aliens go their own disastrous way. I would applud such a daring move if it made sense, but discarding of certain characters that became such a huge part of the franchise was just idiotic. These writers could have easily taken a look at the excellent Dark Horse Comic series that continued the Alien story after Cameron's film and set it on Earth. Now that would've been a film that I'd rather see have been made under Fincher's direction.<br /><br />The acting in Alien 3 is actually very good. Once again, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley becomes the bedrock upon which the rest of the cast rallies around. Charles Dance's inmate-doctor Clemens does a great job of creating an early repoirte with Ripley. But the stand-out of the film has to be Charles S. Dutton's character of Dillon: the spiritual leader of the prison colony of Fury. Dutton's portrayal of Dillon was very powerful and one could actually see the righteous anger seething just beneath the surface.<br /><br />The film's tone borrows more from Scott's Alien than Cameron's sequel. Right from the start the tension begins and once the Alien is born and starts hunting the prisoners and prison staff members, the film begins to start moving. The CG work on the Alien-dog hybrid looks dated when seen in this dvd edition, even after some digital remastering. But the close-ups puppetry and animatronics is as good if not better than what was in Aliens.<br /><br />The ending of the film does take abit too long to unfold when seen in the theaters, but when seen in the comforts of one's own home its easier to tolerate. Alien 3 is the most spiritual of the 4 films in the Quadrilogy, a very good scifi thriller and overall the film would've stood well if just judge on its own merits. But one cannot judge an Alien film without at least some comparison to the rest of the Quadrilogy's films. On that note, Alien 3 has to be the weakest of the bunch. I'd recommend this film for scifi and Alien aficionados, but for casual film fans I say rent it first and see what you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>A previous reviewer gave a brief description of the original Vincent Ward script for Alien 3.  In it he mentions that Ward had Ripley crash landing on a wooden planet inhabited by monks who rejected technology and therefore they had no capability to fight the alien.  The reviewer says that this script would have been &quot;amazing&quot;.  Yeah, amazingly stupid.  A wooden planet???  This idea not only sounds stupid but it physically impossible. As anybody that knows anything about celestial bodies is that there's only two types of planetoids.  Rock-based or Gas-based.  Even a water or ice-covered planet has a rock mantle.  If Alien 3 would have been made with this script, it would have been the laughing stock of an otherwise great franchise up to this point.<p>But as Alien 3 turns out with Fincher's eventual direction, it not all that bad of a film.  Yeah, the theatrical cut was a bit disjointed with loose ends and missing parts, but this is something that the new working print has supposedly fixed to some degree.  While still not a perfect film, anything is better than this original wooden planet idea.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After escaping from the alien planet, the ship carrying Ellen Ripley crashes onto a remote and inhabited ore refinery. While living in the ore refinery until she is rescued by her employers, Ripley discovers the horrifying reason for her crash: An alien stowaway.

Enter relatively new director David Fincher (the third director for the franchise) who had the misfortune of trying to meet the expectations of the fans, but also that of the studio based on the first two films quality and success.  However, success for Fincher and his film "Alien 3" was going to be relatively hard to come by as the studio reportedly tampered repeatedly with the script to where the cast and crew never knew from day to day what the overall story would be for the film.  This no doubt would make for a daunting task for any director, and an extremely uncomfortable and unsettling experience for a newcomer who could possibly destroy a franchise with one stinker of a movie.<br /><br />"Alien 3" finds our tough-as-nails heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash landing on Fiorina 161, a maximum-security prison planet.  Upon recovering from her harrowing experience during the last film, Ripley begins to suspect that there may have been another alien hidden onboard her ship.  Her fears soon become realized when the convicts that populate this dreary planet begin to meet gruesome fates, leaving Ripley with the one option that she knows all to well, face down the creature before it's too late.  As if the alien running loose wasn't enough to contend with Ripley is being plagued by a nightmare that she may have an alien inside of her body, but is it merely her mind playing tricks on her or is it a frightening reality?<br /><br />So after two highly successful entries under this franchise's belt, would "Alien 3"  be another terrific installment and make itself yet another success story for the executives at Fox to boast about or would it be devastating blow to a franchises future possibilities?  The answer, much to the dismay of director David Fincher (though not really to his surprise), "Alien 3" proved to be the least successful entry in the franchise and one that makes the audience wonder if this is a series that has already reached its peak potential.<br /><br />The story was an interesting one, and full of potential if handled properly; however, the reported tinkering by the studio (a concept that is hardly foreign in Hollywood) would cause this film to fall flat on its face in a heaping pile of unused potential and disappointment.  There are some neat elements to the story, the cameo appearance of Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and the final scene with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley coming to a shocking conclusion as to what she must do to save the remaining convicts of the planet are the biggest highlights of the film.  In the director's defense, he did film some other exciting scenes that did make it into a type of director's cut that was released to DVD, and the scenes though not all finished show how much better the film could have been if Fincher had been given a proper chance to make it right.<br /><br />The cast of the film, led once again by Sigourney Weaver (who seemed a bit bored in this installment), was relatively strong.  Though one does miss the energy of Bill Paxton and the intensity of Michael Biehn, but Lance Henriksen's appearance does help the proceedings.  The special effects were good, though not heavily relied upon, it appeared that Fincher was attempting to go for atmosphere much like Ridley Scott did with the original film; sadly the sets used to create the prison were too much alike and the shadows caused the audience (being me) to be confused as to what the difference was between different locations.  Leaving me to wonder at times which characters were where and who exactly was in danger of becoming the latest prey for the alien.<br /><br />The movie could have been another great entry into the franchise, but studio tinkering and too much confusion led to "Alien 3" not quite living up to the expectations of the fans and a less successful stint at the box office.<br /><br />"Alien 3" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>One of the greatest and most terrifying movies of all time, ALIEN made a legendary movie monster, made Sigourney Weaver a star & led to 3 thrilling sequels- ALIENS, ALIEN 3 & ALIEN: RESSURECTION.

Unfortunately, that is the only thing in this film that is three dimentional.<br /><br />If you liked Alien and Aliens, you probably will want this to get this film and Alien Resurection to have the entire set.

What else do you need? Weaver's first time out as Ripley had a lot more surprise in it, but this works well anyway. There's the initial tension of Ripley as the only woman among the inmates but, as one says, "I've taken a vow of chastity, and that includes women."<br /><br />There are lots of chases in this movie, through the tech/grunge corridors of the semi-abandoned facility. Some include the vertiginous alien's-eye view as he [she?] races across walls and ceilings. Right down to the end, there's always one more gotcha from The Alien. And yes, the corporate lords are still the manipulative slimeballs they always were - you might have a better chance with The Alien than with them.<br /><br />Despite the buzz haircut and sweaty tee-shirt, Weaver looks great. Ripley is all woman, but doesn't have to wear pink to prove it. She's also the baddest on the block, Alien and murderers notwithstanding. That makes it especially amusing to see Weaver's character in the spoof movie, Galaxy Quest, an almost perfect opposite. Hard to believe the same actress did both.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>Overall, I liked this movie. There was a lot of supsense, blood, & fighting, just like the first two, and I liked the way Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself so no one else would be attacked by Aliens. It was a noble and gallant thing for her to do. I also liked the many times the other crew members swore at each other, and the final and deciding fight with the final Alien. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because though it was good all in all, there was too much chit-chat and not enough intensity and battle. But it was still a pretty good movie. It gets 7 points out of 10. If you are bored and  have nothing to do, rent and watch this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>There is not a whole lot I can add when an item has 200 plus reviews.<br /><br />If you watch the films for what they are, most people will like them, and especially the new editions for Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection.<br /><br />As noted, this collection is packed full of extras, and I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews, especially for Alien 3, and resurrection.<br /><br />The Studio interference in Alien 3 is very evident, and the original cut is way better than the theatrical mess.<br /><br />David Fincher had a major problem as director, and that problem was the bean counters at the Studio.<br /><br />ALIEN is evidence of just what a visionary directory can achieve when given free reign, just as ALIENS is evidence of how a good director can make a film work WELL.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is excellent evidence of how a film can be rescued. Juenet has allegedly  said that he did not know why people went to the studio to be scared, well, his version of the film is trash compared to the 2003 cut.<br /><br />Sadly, this franchise was messed by the studio and showed how "too many cooks spoil the broth".<br /><br />Most importantly, the collection as it is here, shows that the story line is far from fished out, and I feel that an Alien 5 directed and maybe even co-written by Weaver, would be superb.<br /><br />This collection is worth every penny, and then some.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>The Alien series never broke out the way that Star Trek and Star Wars did--you don't see the presence of an Alien-worshipping subculture, the way you do with Roddenberry's and Lucas's franchises. However, the series has been far more inventive and varied than those two franchises. Explore the Alien movies (minus the abomination known as Alien vs. Predator) on this 9-disc set. Even though they are very different films which have little commonality, aside from the presence of those vicious monsters and the lovely Sigourney Weaver, they complement each other well, and collectors would be wise to pick up this boxed set instead of buying the movies piecemeal. Far from being simple horror films, the Alien movies are attempts to put into film the anxieties of the modern age, from the biological to the corporate, and the series is at its best when it exploits these anxieties.<br /><br />This is what the first entry in the series, Alien, does best. Directed by Ridley Scott, whose other work includes Blade Runner and Gladiator, this 1979 film pits a group of commercial astronauts against a foe which cannot be killed and will not be placated. With a cast that includes Weaver, Tom Skeritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm, this is probably the most impressively-acted of the bunch, and Scott has style to spare. Unlike most terror films, this movie derives its thrills not from continual pop-ups at the screen, but from building a sustained mood of dread--the alien could pop up at any moment. When it does come, it doesn't stay around for long. Perhaps the movie's greatest attribute is its allegorical simplicity--one is bound to reflect on what the alien represents? Perhaps it's a Rorshach Ink Blot to some extent, however, this movie is the perfect counterpoint to such movies as Independence Day--instead of taking off and kicking ass, in Alien, nothing we can do can protect us from the Alien. In our post-Iraq, post-9/11 nation, perhaps this film will have gained some resonance in its treatment of the subject matter.<br /><br />Aliens might be decried by some as a pure action film, but it is a bit more than that. James Cameron logically extends the concepts in the first film, and while it lacks the atmosphere and creepy suspense of the first movie, it is an extremely exciting and emotionally satisfying film. In this film, Ellen Ripley returns to the beast's planet with a squad of marines, which includes such personalities as the humane Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), the freaked-out Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton) and the macho Pvt. Vasquez (Janette Goldstein). Also in the mix are Paul Reiser as the personification of corporate malfeasance, and Lance Henriksen as a sinister-seeming android. Trivia note: Henriksen would be the only actor (aside from Weaver) to appear in more than one Alien film. Ultimately, this is a movie where the thrills come from stuff popping out at you, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief a little and come along for the ride, it is actually quite good for a genre picture, and became the benchmark against which the later pictures were compared.<br /><br />Alien3 is a film which never got a fair chance. Consider: a script which underwent more than a few major revisions, several changes in directors which actually produced the perfect man for the job (future Fight Club auteur David Fincher), a meddling studio and fan expectations which could not possibly have been sated. It was, in retrospect, a recipe for disaster, so one should not complain about how flawed it is, but rather realize just how good it is. Fincher manages to create a wholly convincing atmosphere of dread in a prison planet populated by monk-like inmates. It takes up the allegorical mantle again, but rather than the open-ended allegory of the first, this installment has overt religious parallels that anyone even remotely familiar with Western Civilization should be able to pick up on (even though some of the imagery is subtle). This set notably includes the Assembly Cut, billed euphamistically here as a "Special Edition", which is far closer to the movie Fincher intended to make. While there are any number of legitimate complaints against the film--the most sympathetic character dies halfway through, many of the inmates never really stick out, the final action sequence is too disorienting, high on gore but low on scares, etc.--it is actually a rather compelling film in its unedited form. Not perfect, but in terms of the plotting, main characters, and its insight into the mindset of the religious isolationist mindset, it is more than adequate. In terms of visuals and mood, no installment of the Alien series has been better. In my book, it's a good film with flaws rather than a flawed film with some good parts. The beginning and ending are contentious--watch the film and you will see why--but both serve the story, and the ending in Fincher's version is a surprisingly powerful one, as opposed to the theatrical version, which might have some Biblical undertones (the story of Jacob, specifically) but it feels more hollow. Overall, with this restored version, hopefully the movie will see an end to the backlash that has been pervasive since its release in 1992.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection is the final film in this group, and while it is less polarizing than Alien3 among fans, it is also less memorable. If the original film was about a post-Vietnam set of anxieties, then this film is about a post-Berlin Wall set of ironies, and it cannot be displaced from the culture from whence it came--a culture which prided itself on being so "over" everything. Yet another director, this time Jean-Pierre Jeaunet of Amelie, brings a different twist to the franchise. Armed with a screenplay by TV wunderkind Joss Whedon, and game performances from Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, et al. The fundamental problem is that the viewer never really connects with the characters, and thus isn't invested in their fates. This being the case, the movie then becomes a series of action setpieces which don't quite add up to anything. The visual style is surprisingly lacking here as well: I once heard Amelie described as a David Fincher take on a Meg Ryan film, so I expected memorable visuals. I instead discovered that Roger Ebert was right when he said there was not a single shot to inspire the imagination. While the production values are high, the grotesque violence, fast-paced editing, camerawork and lighting all come together to make one feel as though in a video game, and while that might work for fourteen year-old boys, it's a far cry from the film's heritage. On the other hand, the satirical aspects of the film are enjoyable, and it somehow was much more beloved in Europe--maybe I'm missing something. Ultimately, the film is either a standard-issue thriller or a savvy satirical deconstruction of a standard-issue thriller--I'm not entirely certain.<br /><br />The bonus features are interesting--commentaries on all the four films, featuring directors, cast members, and production staff. I guess that, given the amount of commentary tracks punctuated by uncomfortable silences, the folks over at Fox decided to cut to different conversations at different points during the films. There is a constant stream of information, some interesting and enlightening, other parts are funny (Bill Paxton's contributions especially), but the only one that is tough to sit through is Alien3's, which is unbalanced in favor of the technical side of the production and only has about 15 minutes of Henriksen and another actor. The documentaries go into great detail about all the films, essentially from the germination of the story all the way through to critical reception. Overall, it's a good collection of special features.<br /><br />Overall, as far as franchises go, the Alien films are one of the better bets out there. As a receptacle for millenial anxieties, a proving ground for new and talented directors, and just plain scares, this is a series which should appeal to most and I highly recommend this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>There's a LOT of stuff in this box set.  Almost too much, really.  You could spend a couple of weeks watching and reading all the extras, commentaries, script drafts, etc.  But by then you would have deconstructed the films so much that you have robbed them of whatever &quot;innocent viewing pleasure&quot; you enjoyed before you delved into the minutiae of the extra features.<p>So it is a double-edged sword:  Learn more than you ever thought you would about the 4 &quot;Alien&quot; films, but suffer having to watch them from then on and forever more through the filter of &quot;knowing too much behind-the-scenes info&quot; &amp; &quot;curtain-pulled-back-on-the-Wizard&quot; insider perspective.<br /><br />That said, it is a real treat to have this collection, even though the fourth film was abominably disappointing.  The packaging, which opens to a nearly five foot long foldout, is kind of neat but soon grows cumbersome and irritating.  When you unfold it the first time, it is like &quot;Hey, look what THIS thing does!&quot;.  But after a while, when you just want to retrieve a single disc for some occasion, it has evolved to &quot;Okay, okay, I get it - it's long.  Just gimme the stupid disc already!&quot;<p>For &quot;Alien&quot; fanatics, this is a must-have.  I don't own the &quot;Alien Legacy&quot; set, so I can't compare them.<p>I especially like the DTS sound on two of the films.  DTS always brings a new dimension to the listening experience that the still-great Dolby 5.1 doesn't.<p>Don't complain about the price, either.  You get your money's worth in spades, and you save on tax and get free shipping if you order it online (from the right vendor).  Besides, even if the price is a bit too steep for you, that amount of your money would have been lost to the sands of time soon enough anyway.  Might as well spend the money and have something cool to show for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>This box set has everything you ever wanted to know about the Alien franchise available on 9 discs.

Director David Fincher, known for making excellent cinematic experiences with lavish special effects and intense cuts does create a visually stunning picture, but does not have the ensemble cast or the script to produce and effective, intelligent, and respectable science fiction thriller.<p>Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on an all-but-deserted penal colony that is used for housing madmen, murderers, and rapists.  The acid-spitting, flesh-eating alien creature has, unfortunately (for Ripley, the crew, and entire viewing audience of this poor sequel), hitches a ride with our heroine and again the battle against extra-terrestrial evil continues.  Weaver is once again very good as the tough, charismatic Ripley, but she is not supported well by the cast.  She was extremely lucky to have great colleagues in &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;, but &quot;Alien 3&quot; proves that her luck has run out.  Dark, uninspiring, and an overall mess.  Loyal fans of the series will enjoy, but this film should not expect too many darkhorse followers--stick with the first two.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>This is a movie some did not like.  It was different.  But the tension is there.  Yes, i rounded down, because i didn't like that that Newt and the Lt were killed after we thought they had been saved.  Ripley looked pretty good for a dead babe... ya, i know, she gets that a lot.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Pre-Fight Club David Fincher directed this misunderstood entry into the Alien franchise. While it's a flawed film, it does touch on some themes that weren't done in the first two, and there are some effectively creepy moments.<p>The special effects quota reverts back to the original's modus operandi of not showing the aliens as much as James Cameron's &quot;everything and the kitchen sink&quot; trademark. Which is rather effective and creepy, utilising the old &quot;hiding in the shadows&quot; trick. And Sigourney Weaver is good as the tough-as- nails Ellen Ripley. Still, it's disappointing compared to the first two films, because the action is subdued, the characters are cardboard and the plot is very silly. But there is some good action, and while the nihilistic ending would have seemed to rule out the possibility of a fourth entry, Alien Resurrection carried on the story to bigger, and arguably better effect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>I'm bleary-eyed but exhilarated after watching over 50 hours of the stupendous ALIEN QUADRILOGY (Fox). A steal at even the suggested retail price, this extraordinary 9 disc set is a crowning achievement in the art of DVD authoring, assembly and presentation. <p>Encountering Swiss artist Giger's "mechorganic" demon in dark, labyrinthine, quarters far, far from home or help can still jolt our deepest fears of the unknown. <p>All four titles in the series are presented in both theatrical and or extended versions.  Besides commentaries, there's a huge treasure trove preproduction, production and postproduction extras.  <p>Although the sequels don't have the freshness Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN that began the series, Weaver delivers increasingly nuanced and intense performances as the storyline evolves.  <p>I especially enjoyed the much longer (over 40 minutes) restored work print of ALIEN 3.  Space does not allow for even the most simplistic listing of all the extras. You'll be astounded, it's graduate level film school in a box.  Highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>There is an understandable tendency to view this as the least successful of the Alien series.  I think this is more due to its curious handling of the entire alien plotline which cheerfully combines the usual, 'alien chases humans who then chase it,' fare with a startling mystical vision.  There is a great deal of symbol dropping, but the references to biblical myth never quite gel.  Director David Finchley never quite overcomes the hurdles that this aspect of the film presents, but he actually does quite well with everything else, so the film really deserves a second chance.<br /><br />Stanza three of this tale finds us momentarily aboard Ripley's escape vessel, just long enough to become aware that there is an alien with them and to see the ship crash on yet another grim, unpleasant planet.  Ripley is the only survivor and finds that here rescuers are the remnants of a prison colony.  When this colony of double y chromosome criminals was closed several years before, a small group that had found some comfort chose to remain along with a two warders and the prison doctor.  A rescue ship is due for her 'sometime' but the prison's unrelieved post-modern gothic setting is poor comfort to Ripley in the meanwhile.<br /><br />This film makes no effort to hide the awful truth.  Even as Ripley cremates her fellow escapees, we get to watch the birth of yet another of mankind's nemeses in the endless bowels of the prison.  Once again, a hungry alien starts treating humans as snacks.  Ripley attempts to alert the wardens but all is useless.  Her only friends are Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison medic, and Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the prisoner who doubles as one of the strangest religious leaders in interstellar space.  It isn't until it is clear that something awful is stalking the inmates that the cast settles down to fighting, running, and being munched.<br /><br />The story has quite a few twists as Ripley gradually realizes that the Alien is hardly the worst of her problems.  There are many opportunities for strong character acting and the cast makes the most of almost all of them.  Even the alien has it's moments.  With countless tunnels and dark corners the film has all the room it needs for plenty of action and the bloodthirsty won't feel the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />As I've already said Finchley has cast our hungry xenomorph as the Beast of the Apocalypse.  I can't say as how I blame him (the aliens do represent the end of life as humans think of it), but the imagery is so overstated that many viewers will be put off.  For one, I liked both the filmic and musical moments that were so redolent of monastic appearances.  But, while they added atmospheric depth, they never really advanced the plot, which focused more on the countless acts of heroism that made up the prisoner's defensive efforts.  For being society's dregs, they will quickly win your sympathy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Alien? is the worst in the series because of the studio. David Fincehr had a dark film in his mind but the studio cut it down. The film does have a few good scares and the cinematography is cool. But the film is very slowly paced and most viewers won't be able to take it.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>The redheaded stepchild, or in this case the shaved headed stepchild, Alien 3 you either love it or you hate it, you really cant be on the fence. Die hard alien enthusiast impaled themselves on Giger-esque protrusions the second this movie came out. I remember, before I had even seen the film hearing the critics take a big "queen" sized egg laying crap on it. I saw it, and although it isn't my favorite out of the three (number 2 is) I still loved it. I have to admit I was disappointed that Newt, Bishop and Hicks didn't make it seeing as how the entire plot of Aliens revolved around rescuing Newt in the end, how many people died trying to rescue her? Anyway, the complaints I have seen usually say that they shouldn't have killed Ripley, even though Sigourney Weaver helped produce this film and it was her idea to do it, I think it was entirely appropriate to kill her off and I will tell you why. The poor woman, if you think about it, from the first alien, to aliens to alien 3 has maybe spent a handful of days awake, its been years and years and years but to her its as if for two weeks she has seen nothing but friends and loved ones die, and fought these bugs with her whole being. Knowing, a queen was inside her, was the last straw. Impregnated by the one adversary who has ripped your life away from you must have been both horrifying and in a way a relief from all the pain. In the end she embraces her death, as well as her death bringer thinking she is ending the chain of tragedy. Just like when she brings Bishop back and he says that he would rather her just disconnect him than exist as a half being (or in his case a quarter) she would rather choose her fate than have the Alien choose it for her. The cast in this movie is amazing; I am especially enamored with Charles Dance who played Dr. Clemons. The first movie I ever saw him in was The Golden Child and he played "Sardo Numspa" Charles Dutton, Pete Postlethwaite, and many unknowns at the time make a kind of "Alcatraz monastery" in space, and they all give the bleakness and desperation and fear a face. No matter what you think, you cannot argue that there are good performances, the setting was awesome and that any Alien is a good Alien. My only complaint is the, of course, CGI effects in dealing with the Alien in action, it just hasn't aged well at all and they should update that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Here I go again. Gushing. But I can't help it. This nine disc set is the definitive DVD release for rabid Alien fans like yours truly.<p>I first saw Alien when I was eleven years old, from a projection booth at a drive-in. The sound was on a little speaker, the noise of the two 40's-era projectors a constant drone. The reels were being changed MANUALLY. But none of that mattered: I was sucked into the film so deeply it was like a hallucination.<p>I got that feeling again watching the first disc of this release. The picture and sound definition are so much better than the prior DVD release that it's truly astounding. It makes me wonder just how loose the THX quality "standard" is, since the original DVD was also THX certified. Obviously, the best available elements were used in mastering every film in this edition, and then digitally scrubbed to a high gloss.<p>Everyone reading this knows that only two of the four films are truly great. Numbers 3 and 4 in the "franchise" (I always hated that word applied to films) are problematic. But to a real fan that hardly matters. The Alien mythology, as it has developed over a quarter-century, is somehow larger, more captivating than even the films themselves.  The first Alien, to put it bluntly, was a B-movie wrapped in first-class art direction, cinematography, and performances. Even two questionable sequels can't dim its hold on the imagination.<p>If you're even thinking about buying this, you know the films pretty well. There is no need to go into detail about them. What may tip the scales and make you open your wallet is not only the crisp, detailed transfers, but a staggering (I use that word deliberately) amount of extra material that is intelligently produced and well thought-out. The hours of documentaries are not your usual promotional material; they are real, no-holds-barred inside looks at the making of the films - warts and all. For example, there is no attempt to gloss over the fact that Alien 3 isn't very good, or that the production was mired in meddlesome Groupthink almost from the beginning. Nor did the suits at Fox (to their credit) try to hide any of the legal problems and personal conflicts that plagued the first film (producers Gordon Carrol and Walter Hill thought Dan O'Bannon's script was a stinker - they actually banned him from the screening room during dailies and he had to sue them to get his name on the credits).<p>It's good stuff, all of it. The features on the special-effects are tremendous, with interviews galore - even with original Alien designer H.R. Gieger (who is well-known to be reclusive).<p>The only quibble I have is with Fox's desire to squeeze "special edition" versions out of all four films when only two of them really warranted the attention - the famous (and definitive) Director's Cut of the second film - Aliens - and the fascinating (if not exactly better) first cut of Alien 3, which has some problematic production dialog tracks that never got looped.<p>The first and fourth films were director's cuts as released. Nonetheless, for a die-hard fan, the first Alien's alternate version is definitely worth a look, as it contains the famous "cocoon" scene, as well as some other bits and pieces we've heard about, but never seen integrated with the film.<p>Alien: Resurrection's special edition is not even minimally special, as Jean-Pierre Jeunet is such an efficient director that there just wasn't any material to add, aside from a few trims and a brief scene on Earth. It's not really a bad film; there are some amazing ideas in it. Isolated sequences (like Ripley being carried into the queen's lair) are inspired. But it's marred by some ill-advised "humor" and a hammy performance by Dan Hedaya as a ruthless military commander.<p>Overall, the Alien Quadrilogy (questionable title notwithstanding) is a required purchase for card-carrying Alien devotees, even if they own prior releases. Buy it. Get lost in it. The hours you'll spend in the visionary world of these films (flaws and all), plus the avalanche of supplemental material, will repay the investment many, many times over.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>The Alien series is without a doubt one of the best ever pieces of filmmaking created on film.  Not only does it have an amazing storyline, a strong female lead, some of the scariest creatures ever created, as well as some great action sequences and chills to boot, but it also has real depth and a strong sense of perseverance.  The first two films are still the true gems, with both Ridley Scott &amp; James Cameron at the top of their game.  And the Extended and/or Director's Cut versions only make the films even better.  But Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are still very good installments.  Although most of us are still angry with the direction that Alien 3 took, more and more are admitting how strong a film it actually is today.  And with the resurrection of Ripley in the fourth movie, who knows where the series will take us?  Earth?  The original home of the Aliens?  Only time will tell.<p>I just finished looking at everything on the Alien Quadrilogy.  Took a long time too.  Lots of archival reading to get through.  Very thorough.  Enjoyed the special editions to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection a lot, though I preferred the original opening to Alien Resurrection and the original ending to Alien 3 from the theatrical versions.  The commentaries were pretty good.  Too bad Sigourney Weaver only participates in the original Alien and none of the other films (and even then, she doesn't say all that much) She does discuss ideas for Alien 5 with Ridley Scott towards the end (maybe she wants him to direct part 5?????).  My favorite had to be the &quot;Aliens&quot; commentary parts with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, and Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez).  Bill saying that he's not getting paid to record this commentary but is at least getting free beer and reuniting with his Alien costars, was a highlight.  The commentaries for the theatrical versions are the same as the ones for the director's cut/special expanded editions, only some comments are omitted here and there, except in Alien 3 &amp; Alien Resurrection.  Some additional comments are made at the end of the theatrical cuts of Alien 3 and the opening of Alien Resurrection, since significant changes were made to the films.  The segmented documentaries are also very detailed from the first film to the fourth.  Lots of great information!  The real empty feeling is the absence of David Fincher during the Alien 3 &quot;making of&quot; (except when you see him during the actual filming days) as well as from the commentary, since the director's from all the other installments participated.  Some disappointments were that not all the extras from the original Alien DVD Boxset were included in this new one, such as Ridley Scott's own personal audio commentary by himself along with another separate additional bonus audio track of different music cues by Jerry Goldsmith and some other cool things to listen to while watching the film (like the original audio track during filming where you can actually hear Ridley giving Sigourney direction as she moves about the ship towards the end.  The original featurettes from the first boxset are all missing too.  Plus the bonus 5th DVD from the original boxset that you had to mail away for to get in the states isn't featured here either, which is a bit surprising.  And for me, I was just surprised that the Aliens theatrical trailer was shown Pan &amp; Scan, when a letterboxed version does exist (I have it on my Big Trouble In Little China 2 DVD Special Edition).  I'm just glad I didn't sell the original boxset as I originaly intended.  I like retaining all the extra material made available.  Still a great 25th Anniversary Boxset Collection...</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>"Aliens", the preceding film in the series, ended with on a high note.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) succeeded in dispatching the deadly Queen Alien to the vacuum of space.  And this time she was not the sole survivor.  "Newt" a young girl, and "Corporal Hicks", part of the attack force survived as well.  Ripley, had also salvaged the torn remains of the android "Bishop" (Lance Henriksen).  All resided peacefully in their respective tubes as we faded to the end credits. <p>Alien 3 continues the saga, and quickly sets a somber tone.  An alien "face sitter" is loose on the ship, USS Sulaco.  Acid from the creature leaks out, causing a fire.  The emergency initiates the automatic collection of the sleeping tubes into an escape craft.  Released from the Sulaco, the craft falls into the atmosphere of Fury 161, a planet used as a prison facility, and crashes lands into what is presumably a body of water.  A rescue party reaches the craft, and upon breaking in, finds that only Ripley has survived.  The child Newt, and a bloodied Hicks lie dead in their tubes.<p>Alien 3, doesn't have the suspense of Alien, or the spectacular excitement of Aliens, but it does have a story that doesn't degenerate into pure rubbish.  There's even time enough for love.  Some things do remain constant.  The creature kills, and the Company wants it alive. <p>The maximum-security prison, operates with a minimal staff, with the inmates also running a mining operation.  Ripley's presence, sends shockwaves through the all-male population, and the presence of "lice" (where are they?) leads to the shaving of her head.  Sporting a reddened eye, she is emotionally crushed after learning that her friends are dead.  Medical officer Clemens (Charles Dance) becomes her ally, as she anxiously investigates, searching for evidence of the Alien's presence.  <p>Director David Fincher, keeps things dark and dreary.  Pacing is a bit slow, as Ripley's arrival is an unwelcome break in the peaceful monotony of prison life.  Prison superintendent Andrews (Brian Glover), seeking to maintain the status quo, has no time for Ripley and her "monster" stories.  In the matter of maintaining order, religion and faith, are factors too.  Prisoner Dillion (Charles Dutton) serves as a spiritual leader and enforcer among the men.  These futuristic events have a distinct "British" flavor, as Dance, Glover and many others, speak with accents, and use English slang.  <p>The creature begins its rampage, uniting the survivors in a common goal, as they confront the Alien without any weapons, in a broken down facility.  Ripley has her own more personal problem, discovering the presence of an alien growing in her body.  Computer generated effects are used extensively, resulting a faster moving, and more active Alien.  Led by Dillion and Ripley, the prisoners attempt to trap the creature.  Luring the Alien through tunnel, after tunnel, after tunnel, until it is trapped and killed.  Not very plausible, but still exciting.  The Company, conveniently arrives on the scene, with Bishop II (Lance Henriksen) making one last plea for the life of the alien inside of Ripley.  Ellen Ripley's death, would seem to have brought the series to an end, but then we all know better.<p>Alien 3 is not a great movie, but it is good solid SF that delivers some thrills, and should not be missed.  You see pretty much what you expect, and there are no big surprises, though the CG effects allow a more dynamic presentation of the Alien.  Solid performances by stars Weaver and Dutton, and the supporting cast, headed by Daniel Webb (prisoner Morse) and Ralph Brown (Warder Aaron).  It is a film that stands up to repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>...if I had it to do all over again, I believe I would have bought the movies one 2-disc set at a time rather than all at once in this box set.<p>Buying the box set is a bit easier on the bank account, and there is a bonus 9th DVD that can't be had any other way...but the 9th disc is more of an appendix and even the most hardcore &quot;Alien&quot; fan probably won't watch it more than once.<p>The problem I have with the box set isn't its content; the alternative versions of each movie alone make this latest reissue absolutely necessary...and as each episode in the series has an entire separate DVD's worth of bonus features, a viewer can literally spend an entire weekend watching a single movie.<p>However, the box set's composition is a serious let-down.  Its design means that it must be ceremoniously unfolded each time a disc is viewed.  This puts extra wear on the package, contributing to an early disintegration.  The rubber-based glue used to secure the plastic disc fasteners to the cardboard packaging is also of inferior grade; even the slightest temperature fluctuations cause the glue to lose its cohesive qualities.  The end result is that that the whole thing falls apart.  I'd expect a lot better from Fox, especially considering the fanbase for this franchise.<p>To make a long rant short, buy these reissues.  Even the ones for the chapters you might not have cared for previously; I promise you that they've all been done to the nines and are absolutely worth spending the time seeing again (sometimes as though for the first time).  But steer clear of the box set; Fox has given us a shoddy product in this guise and they must be held accountable by the fans of the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Of how not to make a sequel in contrast to Aliens (which is a perfect sequel in that it manages to both stand on its own and as a satisfactory continuation of Alien), Alien teeny-tiny 3 establishes itself by undermining its predecessor.  The decision to kill off the survivors of Aliens during the opening credits made a mockery of that film's intense climax which focused on rescuing the little girl.  Not a good move, when you are providing a follow-up to a comercial and critical hit, because then you have to make sure that this movie will be even better.  It also throws out the rules as to the nature of the Aliens.  In the previous movies the facehuggers would be unleashed only when a being is in proximity of the eggs. (It was clearly stated in Aliens that the two rogue facehuggers had been torn from their victims' faces.)  In this movie the facehuggers leave the eggs whenever they feel like it &amp; roam around free.<p>Clearly, the first two movies should be ignored when watching this one.  So, then, how does it stand on its own merits?<p>The answer is:  It doesn't.<p>The pacing is slow, the visuals are murky, the plot is muddled.  A leisurely, unpleasant tale of a lone survivor stranded on a prison planet plays like a bad, pretentious drama until the Alien finally arrives to start killing characters.<p>After watching this movie, the only question is: why didn't they go with their original instincts in Alien 4 and make this incoherent mess into a bad dream?  That is a move which would have tied in nicely to the last line of Aliens (Newt:&quot;Can I dream?&quot; Ripley:&quot;Yes, I think we both can.&quot;)</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>This is one of the most unnecessary sequels I've ever seen... To start, it was a TERRIBLE move to kill off Hicks, Newt, and Bishop. TERRIBLE. The story is only somewhat decent, I honestly kinda found it interesting that Ripley was impregnated with a queen alien, but at the same time I knew that it would have to lead to her death, WHICH I DID NOT WANT. Guess what? She died, too. So yes, killing of the entire cast of survivors from Aliens was an absolutely TERRIBLE move. AND, why did they feel the need to shave Ripley's head...? The suspense just didn't seem to be retained from previous Alien movies, either. This movie... Just no. No. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>Instead of watching bits and pieces of the film I watched it in it's entirety today for the first time. Alien 3 is more of a dialogue film and Weaver's portrayal of Ripley was much more sullen. She remained interesting however. I was disappointed that Newt, a mega relevant charactor from Aliens, never had her name mentioned. With all the rightly emoted heartbreak by Ripley at the death of Newt, she never uttered an "Oh Newt" which is strangely amiss.<br /><br />The scene with Ripley and Bishop was engaging but I longed for an entirely reanimated "synthetic person" for charactor interaction. Alien 3 is unique in that there is very little gunfire, especially coming off the raging gunfire of Aliens. That missing element was never successfully counteracted. In turn, Ripleys every line became strong, and any return from her scene breaks worthwhile. It was almost as if she could bring out more in one word than ever before.<br /><br />The charactors were more often thin and I felt little concern for them. The setting though, and stylistic nature of the film, was more than ample. The early 90s CGI was a detractor but it may not have been for movie goers of that period. In a few scenes the alien looked puny. The penal colonists running around closing hatch doors was dizzying and weak. Child like "you hoo" words to lure the alien were unrealistic in such a fear oriented situation.<br /><br />The film was a hybrid of past greatness mixed with what was to come of the Alien franchise. And what was to come wasn't good. Sigourney Weaver held Alien 3 together just enough to make the film oddly interesting. The film makers knew it had run it's course, hence the climax. After this film, everything has became what I like to call "junkified". Alien 3 is a nice little last piece of one of filmdoms greatest heroines, and monsters!</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>ok, for me ALIEN is a trilogy...This is where it ends...All that came after this is not remotelly close to the quality of the first 3 ALIEN movies...This 3rd part is actually really cool, with an interesting story...Well, this is where my interest for ALIEN ends, but i totally recommend these ALIEN movies that are really cool!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This Quadrilogy boxset gives us the four Alien films in theatrical and special edition formats, as well as some superb extras. The extras include `making of ` featurettes, photos, commentaries and much more. Each extra disc gives you another insight into the Alien films and philosophy. Then with subsequent viewings you can't help but see the extra details in the films with a fresh eye.<br /><br />`Alien' is a film that has stood the test of time remarkably well.<br /><br />Following a crew on a large mining space ship, we see what happens to them when they pick up a distress signal and encounter an alien life form. Despite the age of this film the special effects are still remarkably creepy and at times could still rival films of today. The sets are the parts of this film that seem the most dated, but even these add a certain kitschy charm. This film spawned a movie franchise that went on for decades, but this is the one that held the most suspense, despite later ones having more gore and violence. Re-watching it today I was surprised just how creepy and eerie it was compared to what I remembered.<br /><br />This is acted and directed well and the alien effects are still impressive and coupled with a good storyline this makes for one superb sci-fi/horror film. A classic that should be watched at least once in your lifetime.<br /><br />Set 57 years after the end of the first Alien film, `Aliens' sees Ripley returning to the Alien planet, now an off Earth Colony, to confront her old nemesis.<br /><br />After contact is lost with the colony Marines are sent in, with Ripley as a consultant to investigate. We meet Newt, a young girl who manages to survive by hiding in the air ducts, and who brings out Ripley's maternal instincts, and Bishop, an android who Ripley finds hard to trust. There is also a team of US marines with an annoying `in your face' gung ho attitude, but who serve a purpose in the fight against the acid blooded, parasitic aliens.<br /><br />This was directed by James Cameron after his success with `Terminator' and if you are familiar with this film the directional style will be very familiar, but it's a style that works very well for the sci-fi genre. This film is less atmospheric and creepy than the first film and is more action orientated, with lots of gun fights, explosions and shouting. This is also the film we see Ripley become the badass she has to be to survive the aliens.<br /><br />This is an excellent sequel to the original film and whilst it is louder and with more action, it adds to the story very well indeed and compliments the original perfectly. Some say this is the best film in the series and it is definitely a very credible, exciting film, with a great plotline. You'll just have to watch them all to make up your own mind.<br /><br />`Alien 3' is probably one of the weaker films in the Alien series, but saying that it is still a good sci-fi film and worth a watch at some point.<br /><br />When her hypersleep is disturbed and her pod is ejected into space, Ripley awakens to find herself on a penal colony surrounded by hardened criminals. She also finds herself facing her old nemesis once again after it stowed away on her ship.<br /><br />This film moves at a slower pace to `Aliens' and has none of the suspense or creepiness of `Alien', but it does move the story forwards in a credible way and introduces us to the Alien in it's four legged guise. This alien is able to run a lot faster and also scurry across ceilings in it's search for prey.<br /><br />The various inmates are clich&eacute;d and rather two dimensional and the only character of note isn't in the film long enough to keep it elevated. Weaver plays Ripley well, as always, and her shaven, harrowed look shows the stresses her character has been under perfectly.<br /><br />This is a decent, but not outstanding, sci-fi film and will always be the poor relation to the previous Alien films. It is well worth watching and is entertaining enough for the duration, just don't expect the suspense or high action of previous instalments.<br /><br />When Ripley is cloned to gain access to the alien queen inside of her, her genetic material became bonded with that of the alien. Giving her fast healing capabilities and super-human strength the Ripley of before is now supercharged and a formidable adversary to any alien she may encounter.<br /><br />`Alien Resurrection' is set 200 years after `Alien 3', but not much has changed. The company (in a new guise) wants the alien for military purposes and Ripley wants to stop that from happening, only this time she as split loyalties dues to her genetic mutation. Winona Rider is a member of a smuggling crew caught up in the melee and whilst she is ok in this film, her elfin image doesn't really sit with a hardened sci-fi action film.<br /><br />The direction is pretty good and Weaver is as good as she has ever been. She has a darker streak in this film and it suits her. The alien effects are also still good and in this film we see the aliens swim, as well as meeting a new incarnation that I won't say more about here to maintain the surprise.<br /><br />All in all this is a decent sequel in the series and I enjoy it at least as much as `Alien 3' but, like that film, it never matches the creepiness of `Alien' or the action of `Aliens'. Still, this is well worth watching if you have seen the rest and makes for a fairly decent sci-fi film.<br /><br />So, overall this is an excellent value-for-money boxset, giving you way more than many other boxsets of a similar or greater price and it offers up some classic sci-fi films to boot.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>My son had seen "Alien vs Predator" and didn't know the background of either creature so, realizing that we were remiss in his pop culture education, we bought the Alien Quadrilogy. This is a fantastic 9 DVD set that contains two versions of each movie and more extras than we will ever be able (or inclined) to watch. While not detailed reviews of each movie, here are my general observations:<br /><br />* Alien  - This is a great movie that contains all of the elements of a classic sci-fi\horror. Like several other reviewers, I prefer the original release over the extended version.<br /><br />* Aliens - Really good sequel which stays true to what made the original movie great. This time I liked the extended version better.<br /><br />* Alien 3 - Not nearly as good as the first two, but still watchable. I think the theatrical release is the better one (other reviews disagree), but the extended version is still interesting to watch.<br /><br />* Alien Resurrection - I really disliked this movie all around, it doesn't matter which version, but it still needs to be seen to round out the series.<br /><br />The box cover art is in an attractive holographic like motif that looks very nice on the shelf. The DVDs are kept in a somewhat unwieldy fold out arrangement, but they do take up surprising little room.<br /><br />Overall this a great value for all that is packed into this great set!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Talk about some imagination.  Where, oh where, do the caretakers of the Alien franchise set up the third installment?  To come up with an isolated, desolate planet harboring what was once a maximum security prison--a place where its inhabitants have virtually no defenses against a snarling monster--is sheer genius.  And that's exactly where we find ourselves as ALIEN3 unfolds its disturbing, claustrophobic story:  a spaceship crash, with Ripley--and of course, one of the facehuggers--as the lone survivor, on a planet with some very bad men who've done very bad things. . .and there's no place to escape.<br /><br />Count me in.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver really ups the tragic pathos of her beloved Ripley character; this is one depressed lady with some serious angst--and she's trying her best to convince her new associates that something very, very bad is about to happen to all of them.  In fact, something very, very bad is about to happen to Ripley herself, and it's this realization that adds an extra thread of tension as ALIEN3 rolls darkly to its climax.  (I must confess, the alien's demise was too over-the-top, but didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.)<br /><br />Once again, Weaver is joined by a strong supporting cast, including Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, and Danny Webb, to name but a few.  Lance Henriksen returns, briefly, as a severely damaged Bishop, then as greedy entrepreneur Bishop II.  Director David Fincher, following Ridley Scott and James Cameron, definitely had his work cut out for him, and for the most part delivers a grand seat squirmer, yet in comparison ALIEN3 falls a little short of its fantastic predecessors.  Having said that, and based on the horrific turkey that was to follow, the Alien series should have said adios here.<br />--D.

The only one to come off slightly Lesser than on previous views was, ironically, "Aliens" - often hailed as the best of the lot - although that had more to do with certain points that were easy to miss in among all the action but, on subsequent viewings, show up a couple of inconsistencies.  More on that later.<br /><br />  The original "Alien" was great the first time around, but is one of those movies that gets even better with the hindsight provided by the sequels.  One noticable upon the rewatch is that "Alien Vs. Predator" actually patched its prequel status in very well with the hints way back in 1979's original that the company that owned the salvage ship had been looking for something specific all along, and already knew what the Xenomorphs were.  Alien was revolutionary in the scale and realism of its effects, in its own way as groundbreaking as fellow 70s space smash "Star Wars", and revolutionary in blending the science fiction movie and the horror movie more perfectly than ever before.  The single alien creature immediately established itself as one of moviedom's most memorable monsters, and nothing about the deadly potency of that one creature has been diminished by follow-ups that featured swarms of the Xenomorphs.  All the previously excised bits that have been added back in fit extremely well and make the whole better.  The only potential quibble to be found is this: of all the remarkable traits displayed by the Alien, perhaps the most stunning was its phenomenal growth rate (I mean, how long did it take it to go from burstling stage to full-grown armored adult?).  And yet I can't remember any of the characters even really noticing the seeming impossibility of this, although a lot of time is spent covering such aspects as the Xenomoph's possession of acid for blood.  I'm not saying they should have taken that characteristic out, or necessarily even extended its time frame, but at least having some comments by the characters on the most extraordinary of the creature's lifecycle characteristics would have been a help.  Overall, it didn't do much to detract from the overall movie though.<br /><br />  "Aliens" amps the whole thing up.  After the original had a single alien take on a small salvage crew, this one has an entire space colony threatened by a veritable army of the creatures.  Ripley, having returned to Earth after 57 years in deep-sleep,attempts to settle into as normal a life as possible.  Some time later, the company officials who initially were very disbelieving about her claims of aliens and a crashed mothership out on that barren planet, comes to her.  A colony is located on that very world, and all contact has very abruptly broken off, and they want her, purely as a 'precaution', to accompany the team they're sending off to check it out.  "Aliens" smartly contrasted the overwhelming prescence of the Xenomorphs in the second half of the movie by an almost total lack of the creatures in the first hour or so, allowing everything time to build up nicely.  "Aliens" introduced some of the series's most memorable characters, including perrennial fan favorites Newt (the little girl survivor, played by Carrie Henn) and Bishop (Lance Henrikson).  The Cpl. Hicks character (action-sf stalwart Michael Biehn) also added a lot to the show.  Awesome special effects are a high point.  Biggest flaw: inconsistency.  Take the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs.  There are times when even a small amount can do hideous, lethal damage to a human, but at other times when the battles are raging and the heavy machine guns are firing all over the place, you've got multiple aliens exploding in close proximity to various characters and they don't seem to suffer significant damage.  You could counterargue that different 'castes' or whatever of Xenomorphs have different bloodtypes, but that seems a bit contrived; and that situation is symbolic of inconsistencies that crop up a couple of times to mildly hinder an otherwise excellent movie.<br /><br />  "Alien 3" is the most under-rated of the original quadrilogy, crashing a ship from the previous film on a remote prison planet where a bizarre socity complete with its own religion has sprung up.  It heads in the opposite direction of "Aliens", drastically reducing the Xenomorphs's numbers and leaving the human characters with only makeshift weapons (compared to the large high-tech arsenals of the space marines from "Aliens").  All the Alien movies are hybrids of various genres and styles, but if the first is the most 'science fiction'-al of them and the second fits neatest under the action movie banner, "Alien 3" is the most horror movie oriented of the collection.  Phenomenal effects, high-caliber acting and characterization and a whopper of a finale.<br /><br />  "Alien: Resurrection" is the most flawed of the lot but still a very good movie; I enjoyed it much more when I saw it again than when I first saw the VHS a couple weeks afer its release. Fewer people have seen Alien 3 than the first two and therefore might not know the ending, making it harder to comment on this one without giving away Part 3's surprises.  The movie focuses on the corporation finally getting hold of actual Xenomorphs to begin work on their ultimate goal of turning them into biological weapons.  It's probably not giving anything away to say that the project doesn't go as the company had hoped.  Instead of going more into the plot I'll focus on the movie's strengths and weaknesses.  Strengths: a continued pattern of strong acting and well-done characters, with Annalee (Winona Ryder) being especially effective; tremendous effects for the creatures (including a radically new breed); an unexpectedly potent follow-up to the thread from the 'hive' scene in "Aliens" that implied that there actually is an emotional bond between at least some of the Xenomorphs.  Weaknesses: pretty glaring inconsistencies and implausibilities in the action, much more so than in "Aliens" (I'd cite examples but I'm running out of wordcount).<br /><br />  Overall, Alien is 4.5 stars, maybe even 5; "Aliens" is four stars, "Alien 3" a 5-star, and "Alien: Resurrection" 3-and-a-half stars.  I should round my mark to four but it's hard to resist giving this a five.  Having them all together like this makes the whole even greater than the sum of its parts.  The packaging is great, there's tonnes of bonus features for those who like them (personally I don't like going behind the scenes and seeing how something is made, although I did enjoy the short director introductions before each film), and it's currently going for $30 for NINE discs, which is pretty bloody impressive.  An essential for fans of horror, science fiction and action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>The Alien Quadrilogy is, by far, the best boxed set of films that I own.

This traditional horror movie set in outer space simply made too darn much money for the studio to simply let it stand alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, he was determined to make a different movie rather than merely rehash the first. Thus, "Aliens" was adventurous, taking the story in new and exciting directions as an action-adventure yarn instead of another horror movie.<br /><br />Indeed, a number of critics feel "Aliens" is better than "Alien."<br /><br />But now comes "Alien 3 " - as unnecessary a sequel to a major movie as we've seen in some time. First-time director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror movie, attempting existential overtones as they make the alien in this film Ripley's "Moby Dick."<br /><br />But "Alien 3 " begins by changing the ending of its predecessor and knocking off nearly all the characters we cared about. Fans will recall that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the android Bishop escaped in a space ship at the end of "Aliens." But this film begins with their being ejected from the ship and crash-landing on a prison planet, which kills all of them except Ripley!<br /><br />On this maximum-security planet, where lice infestation requires everyone to be bald, Ripley finds that the lone surviving monster is still with them. Soon, she's organizing the prisoners to be on the alert, but since there are no weapons of any kind on the entire planet, they wind up playing hide-and-seek with the creature for most of the movie.<br /><br />There are a lot of problems with this film, but the worst are its dreary, dark motif; the lack of sympathetic characters; the unpleasantness of the film's premise, which has Ripley eventually discovering she has a queen alien growing inside of her; and a lengthy chase sequence that is so dark, and edited so chaotically that it becomes confusing.<br /><br />Those looking for thrills or some enhancement to the first films will be very disappointed. Those looking for a headache will have come to the right place.<br /><br />And why is it "Alien 3 (i.e. cubed) " instead of simply "Alien 3" or "Alienz" or "Alien: One of Those Slobbering Monsters Survived After All"? It's probably just a gimmick to get writers like me to ponder the question and give the film a little more ink. It worked.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I don't know if I've ever seen a sequel that makes so many bad decisions so fast and so early in.

In this one, Ripley--perhaps the universe's most unlucky astronaut--washes up at a penal colony that makes Alcatraz look like a Howard Johnson's at sunny Myrtle Beach. She's joined by a dour cast of British unknowns (a wasted Charles Dance being the major exception), which coupled with the pseudogothic production design, makes the film feel like a bad Henry James novel come to life. With hints--hints--at some deeper meaning, the story basically rehashes the first film; this time, though, the apparent innovation is that prisoners are picked off one at a time by a fast-moving alien that has combined with canine DNA. Masochists undoubtedly will enjoy scenes like the child from the previous film, Newt, being autopsyed, but most viewers will just shake their head at this relentlessly unhappy movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>The Face Hugger at the beggining in the EEV is a super-face hugger(shown from a distance in the extended Alien 3 version by a prisoner holding it up). It is much larger and has webbing in between its leg tentacles. The egg this face hugger came from was either carried by the queen and or laid by her at the end of Aliens. She doesn't need her egg sack to lay eggs, its just for extra protection for the eggs as they drop out. She could have even carried the egg containing the super-hugger on her back tentacle spikes, and left it on the drop ship(It never shows her from the back in Aliens until after she drops from hiding). Anyways, even though it is not fully explained in the movie, the script states that this super-hugger has the ability to lay a queen embryo in a host AND a warrior protector alien to defend her as she grows to her full size to lay eggs. So this super-hugger is unique and can produce 2 aliens instead of just the one. I know there are a lot of holes in this plot to cover, but this seems to be the most talked about one. Also, it takes days longer for the alien to pop out of Ripley because Alien Queens take much longer to grow before having all components to function on there own, without the warmth of a host. Hope this helps you understand the beggining. Not the best movie either, but light years ahead of Alien Ressurection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>After reading the enormous amount of negativity at this third entry in the Alien series, I feel highly compelled to step in here and defend this marvelous 1992 sequel to the 1986 predecessor "Aliens" entitled simply "Alien 3" and as I write this, I have to say that while this movie definitely has some troubling flaws, this is a very strong and amazing movie and one of my favorite science-fiction movies of all time.<br /><br />Ellen Ripley, who is now in cryogenic suspension on board the spaceship that she got on to escape the colonized planet after saving Newt from the alien that hitched a ride on board. Unaware of it though, the alien that she defeated was in fact a queen that laid a small egg in a hidden compartment onboard the ship. The alien that hatched onboard which happened to be a `facehugger' on board causes an acid spill which causes an electrical fire and the resulting fire causes the escape pod where the survivors of the previous movie to be separated from the mother ship. After crashing into the ocean on a desolate planet, Ripley finds herself once again the only survivor on a totally unknown world. After being revived in a high-security prison called Fury 161, Ripley finds herself being the only woman in a prison with a religious cult comprised of convicted criminals like former rapists and murderers. Now being imprisoned on the planet, she learns her greatest nightmare of all and how much of a big sacrifice must be made in order to destroy the aliens once and for all. However, Ripley has no idea that the alien isn't her only enemy anymore.<br /><br />The acting once again is top-notch. Sigourney Weaver once again scores another touchdown as the ever awesome heroine Ellen Ripley as she did in the previous two Alien movies. This time Ripley's journey is a lot more personal than ever before and Weaver perfectly brings out the emotional turmoil of Ripley. Charles Dutton brilliantly plays former murderer Dillon who leads a religious cult and makes a really action-packed fight against the alien creature in the climax of the film. I also really like British actor Charles Dance's role as the troubled character Clemens and seeing how he got to where he was as a doctor at the prison facility.<br /><br />The movie feels so much different from the previous two movies. I almost view this as almost like a return to the utter suspense of the first Alien movie and away from the tons of action that dominated the second entry in this series. The colors too are a lot more `orange' where as I often view the others having a more `greenish' look to them. This also has a much more of a Gothic industrial tone to it than the previous ones. The alien creature was also a lot different than in "Aliens" and that it was born from a dog (on the theatrical version) and runs on four legs and is much faster.<br /><br />While this is a great movie, this tends to suffer from some problems which likely has caused a lot of fans of the previous two to really shun this movie. While I can't blame them for killing off two important characters from the previous movie, my biggest problems are different. The greatest flaw with this movie is not it's storyline nor the deaths of Newt and Hicks but it's excessive used of dropping F-Bombs right and left. Swearing doesn't bother me necessarily but the F-Bomb is WAY overused here and it really tends to detract from the films enjoyability. I also wasn't too thrilled at the whole prospect of the prisoners being nothing more than just `live bait' for the alien to kill off one by one. However at the same time it was pretty interesting using the `no weapons' idea since the prison does not allow any weapons on it's premises.<br /><br />The "Collector's Edition" is fantastic in many ways. The deeply flawed theatrical release is much better in its remastered form but the "Special Edition" is light years ahead of its old theatrical counterpart. With the film being extended to two hours and thirty-five minutes, with some old footage replaced with previously unreleased footage, along with extended and previously unreleased scenes, "The Special Edition" of "Alien 3" really helps to mend a lot of the problems that plagued the original version and the result is a movie that is almost as great as the first two movies. It's darkly poetic, dramatic, intense and sheds new light on Ripley's fate and provides greater insight into the character Clemens. The only problem I had was the ending which where the climax scene had new CGI effects and the result in all honesty looked a lot more fake than it did in the original version. Despite this minor quibble, the "Special Edition" of this movie is light years better than the original and the result is a flawed movie that really is lifted much higher in rankings to rank up there with the 1979 original. It'll never top "Aliens" for me but "Alien 3" really benefits from it's revamping. To all of the people who strongly detested this movie to begin with, I would strongly recommend that if you have the time, watch the "Special Edition" because it really helps to correct a lot of the mistakes of the original and it makes the characters a lot more three-dimensional. I have come to appreciate this movie a lot more since seeing it on its newest form.<br /><br />The second disc is a real treat. The extras on disc two are really good and along with the first disc, warrant purchasing "Alien 3". I at first found that this was a movie that was not easy to digest especially due to its troubling loss of two of the main characters from the previous movie "Aliens" from 1986. However I have since over time have come to really enjoy this movie and have felt more sorry for the crew after seeing a deep insight into how troubled the movies making really was. You can also see the mixed reactions towards the finished film from the crew members who were involved in it's production. Perhaps the most memorable thing I learned even if it's not from the DVD itself was how much agony David Fincher went through when directing this movie. He was pushed into this movie's directing late into it's production and the result was enormous tension between him and other producers which resulted in agonizing almost non-stop work in directing this movie. Upon this I felt sorry for him that he had to go through all of this and that he was pushed into this late into it's production and how interference from Fox Studios really made things go awry for him. Perhaps it's why he hasn't embraced it since its release nor has he done a commentary on it but I have to credit him that his work on this is nonetheless absolutely fantastic and the result was worth it to me. The second disc also has a really spectacular time lapse shot of the crew building the movie set over a period of months. It's really a lot of fun to watch, seeing the studio ground going from looking like a concert stage being set up to nearing completion. There are even more where that came from too on this DVD.<br /><br /> To me while it isn't the best of the series by any means, "Alien 3" is a really excellent and satisfying conclusion to the storyline of Ellen Ripley and her war against the predatory alien creatures. To me, "Alien 3" makes a great conclusion to the Alien movie storyline. To me, this is the true conclusion to Aliens at the same time, I often think of 1997's "Alien Resurrection" as more like some wacky spin-off of some sort and a cash-in on the saga that had almost nothing to do with the previous three movies and I agree. While I'm not saying that it was terrible, it wouldn't have been a bad idea of they had simply closed the series on the third one.<br /><br /> I give the makers of this newest DVD two flaming thumbs up for doing such a great job at giving this misunderstood classic a second chance on DVD. The movie itself is a great film but the newest edition on this marvelous two-disc set makes this movie so much better than it was ever before. I strongly recommend that for those who enjoyed this film that you go and buy this DVD today. It's so awesome that it warrants trashing the old Disk and throwing the VHS into the local thermal depolymerization plant!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>David Fincher, the man who would later be responsible for Seven and Fight Club (two movies that are strongly recommended), directed this third installment of the Alien saga (which was supposed to be the last one).  Fincher lends what would become his trademark stylistic direction, but that alone can't save this film.  The first time I saw this I said to myself the series should have ended with Aliens.  Alien 3 takes everything built upon in the first two films and throws them out the window, and trust me thats not good.  Its played out like a horror/slasher movie, waiting to prepare yourself for the next big shock, instead of being an intelligent action/sci-fi hybrid we were used to before.  There's nothing but a lot of running, screaming, and cursing as the new (and poorly designed) &quot;dog&quot; alien hunts down Ripley and the prisoners.  Not to mention complete logic is disposed of, if you want to know what I mean read Jeff Bollen's review, and one of my biggest complaints is after all 2 and a half plus hours of Aliens where Ripley fought to keep Newt and Hicks alive, they are both dispatched at the beginning of the movie.  Alien Resurrection would follow later on, and would try to breathe new life into the series, but Alien 3 remains a landmark at how to ruin a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A23XVF23C7BHP0.html">A23XVF23C7BHP0</a><br/><p>This film is much maligned, but presumably this is more because of people's expectations of sequels and trequels than any inherent weakness. To properly appreciate Alien3 you should not have seen the original. It would seem that anyone except me who sees Alien and Aliens before this film is destined to make unfavourable comparisons. Sadly, to properly appreciate Alien3 it is also necessary to have seen its predecessors! The paradox leaves us with the sad result that this film, which is pretty good if taken on its own terms is almost always written off as a faded photocopy of Alien. This is unfair. David Fincher, a first time director understands what makes the Alien frightening, and using dark lighting and occasional glimpses of the monster weaves a claustrophobic spell on his audience. The film also has the benefit of a great cast, featuring Paul McGann (Later an effective Doctor in Doctor Who), Tetley Tea man Brian Glover (who wins the award here for the most effective use of a four-letter word in cinema history), Charles Dance, and of course Sigourney Weaver. She has never looked better than with her shaven head, and puts in a performance at least as good as in the first two movies. The script and direction keep us on our toes, and the ending is very satisfying, bringing the trilogy to a worthy conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO092BYA4VMU.html">ABO092BYA4VMU</a><br/><p>I give the theatrical release 3 stars, the more violent, profane and much more different special edition 3 1/2 stars and the DVD 5 stars! About 40 minutes was added into the movie, and they are described below:<br /><br />Chapter 3: One Survivor?<br /><br />This alternate scene is the reason why this version is so much different from the theatrical release. Since this scene was cut and replaced, Chapters 8 and 9 were also cut and replaced (only Chapter 9 was replaced)This is the orginial, alternate version of the prisoners discovering Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop.<br /><br />Chapter 4: The Facts<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon praying with the prisoners.<br /><br />Chapter 7: A Possible Contagion<br /><br />This extended scene has addtional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.<br /><br />Chapter 8: What Killed Babe?<br /><br />It's so obvious why this scene was cut: because the orginial, alternate version of the finding of Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop was cut, too. Another reason why this was cut was because in the theatrical version, a facehugger attached itself to a dog. But, the special edition, you saw an ox, something you never saw in the theatrical release. This scene shows Murphy and Frank dragging a dead ox and talking about having sex with Ripley. Then, Murphy discovers the facehugger attached to the ox's face.<br /><br />Chapter 9: A New Beginning<br /><br />This alternate scene shows the Alien bursting out of the dead ox. In the theatrical release, the Alien bursts out of a living dog.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Disharmony<br /><br />This new scene shows Dillon handling the situation with Boggs and Rains about their dislike with Golic.<br /><br />Chapter 11: New Temptations<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley about their religion.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Attracted In That Way<br /><br />This extended scene has additional dialogue between Ripley and Clemens.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Diced<br /><br />This extended scene shows Ripley and Clemens talking more after sex and Murphy's graphic death.<br /><br />Chapter 14: The Flight Recorder<br /><br />This extended scene shows the prisoners going through the bowels of the refinery complex.<br /><br />Chapter 15: High Priority<br /><br />This extended scene has additonal dialogue between Clemens and Superintendent Andrews.<br /><br />Chapter 18: Bishop Speaks<br /><br />This extended scene shows a prisoner finding Golic and then, Dillon and other prisoners grabbing him.<br /><br />Chapter 20: A Long, Sad Story<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene begins with a different angle of Ripley asking Clemens if there is a way to escape.<br /><br />Chapter 21: "It's Here!"<br /><br />This is the uncut version of Clemens's horryfing and graphic death, with more footage of the Alien and Clemens being brutally killed. It also shows Dillon praying with the prisoners and then cussing at everyone.<br /><br />Chapter 22: Who's in Charge?<br /><br />This extended scene shows Aaron cleaning up the bloody mess that the Alien caused when it killed Andrews. There is also additional dialogue.<br /><br />Chapter 24: Preparations<br /><br />This extended scene shows more footage of the prisoners preparing their trap for the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 25: Wait for the Signal<br /><br />This extended scene shows more killing of the prisoners when the trap misfires. Then, Junior, a prisoner who tried to rape Ripley earlier, heroically sacrifices himself to the Alien so the prisoners can trap the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 26: They Don't Want To Kill It<br /><br />This new scene shows Aaron and Ripley talking about killing the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 27: Cut Loose<br /><br />This new scene shows Golic begging Morse to set him free, and he finally does, then Golic hits Morse over the head unconcsious.<br /><br />Chapter 28: Permission Denied<br /><br />This new scene shows Ripley requesting permission from the company to terminate the Alien and they say "no".<br /><br />Chapter 29:<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene shows the deranged Golic going to where the Alien is, and he slits the guard's throat, opens the door and is instantly killed by the Alien.<br /><br />Chapter 31: Better Get Prepared<br /><br />This new scene shows Dillon and the prisoners having a meeting.<br /><br />Chapter 32: A Classified Code<br /><br />Ripley tells Aaron that the Alien won't kill her.<br /><br />Chapter 33:<br /><br />This extended scene shows more dialogue between Ripley and Dillon.<br /><br />Chapter 35: Plan B<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene has additonal dialogue by Ripley and the prisoners.<br /><br />Chapter 36: One Chance<br /><br />This alternate scene is the alternate version of the prisoners waiting for the plan to start.<br /><br />Chapter 37: It Started<br /><br />This extended scene shows a prisoner finding a bloody mess of another prisoner.<br /><br />Chapter 38: Improvising<br /><br />This extended scene shows Dillon telling Ripley that they are "Improvising".<br /><br />Chapter 42: Never Trust a Bishop<br /><br />This extended scene has additional dialogue between Bishop II and Ripley.<br /><br />Chapter 43: Ripley's Choice<br /><br />This extended/alternate scene shows Ripley hesitating for a moment before she falls. And, a different shot of Ripley falling into the lava, without the Alien Queen bursting out of her.<br /><br />The Special Edition is more violent and profane, yet it makes more sense because an Alien that size could NEVER burst out of a dog, but it could burst out of an ox.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>The movies themselves don't need an introduction but for the few out there who have never seen these imaginative sci-fi films, here are brief recaps (SPOILERS):<br /><br />Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979), is considered by many to be the best in the series (although some will argue "Aliens" is equally good). The film takes place in a massive space craft called "The Nostromo". The unsuspecting crew members receive a distress signal from a nearby planet named "LV-426", and decide to investigate. Upon landing, 3 crew members; Lambert, Kane and Dallas, venture off into the planets bleak, barren atmosphere where Kane, is attacked by a "face-hugging" spider-like creature which attaches itself to his face. Although he is in need of medical attention, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is hesitant in letting them back inside. Science Officer Ash, disregards Ripley's concerns and let's them in. And so the fun begins as the "face-hugger" dies and a silent, omni-potent killer quickly develops inside the unwary victim's chest, waiting for the right moment to make its grand entrance and to wreak havoc on board "The Nostromo".<br /><br />"Alien" is one of the best science-fiction films ever made. The acting from the ensemble cast is first-rate as is the script, direction and the film's pace is virtually flawless. Even during scenes in which nothing much is happening, the dialogue and interaction among the cast is crucial to the films plot. In other words, there is not a single scene that isn't relevant to the film.<br /><br />James Cameron's "Aliens" (1986) follows. This installment has Ripley being rescued 57 years after the events of the first film. Ripley's story of her alien encounter is met with skepticism since the "LV-426" has been colonized and the colonists have never come across any alien life-forms in the 20 years they have been on the planet but when communication from the Colony is lost, Ripley is asked by Carter Burke, if she can return to the "LV-426" alongside several Colonial Marines. Ripley turns them down at first but soon realizes that these creatures must be destroyed. In order for this to happen, she has to go back. Ripley is assured by Burke that their mission is to annihilate the aliens. Once there, they discover a desolate planet in ruins and one survivor; a young girl named "Newt" who Ripley takes under her wing but their struggle for survival is made even more difficult when Burke's egomaniacal plot is exposed and the hordes of vicious, blood-thirsty aliens come out to play.<br /><br />This sci-fi classic offers non-stop action, outstanding performances (Weaver and Bill Paxton are especially delightful) and the climactic finale is riveting. Definitely one of the best sequels ever made.<br /><br />"Alien 3" (1992) opens with Ripley and her crew, in cyro-sleep inside their ship. A "face-hugger" is among them and causes a disruption aboard the spacecraft. They are ejected from the vessel and crash land on "The Fiorina 161", a maximum security prison. Ripley is the lone survivor. She asks that an autopsy be performed on her crew members and when the autopsy shows no signs of alien contamination, Ripley is somewhat relieved. However, a "face-hugger" also survived and by using a new host, an alien queen is born. Despite being in a maximum correctional facility, there are no weapons of war-fare available, so Ripley and the convicts have no means of protection against the ever evolving species. When Ripley comes face to face with the alien invader, she discovers there is more at stake then she originally thought.<br /><br />"Alien 3" (1992) is not on the same level as it's predecessors but on its own, it's a decent thriller that delivers the goods despite too much talk and unlikable characters. Like all the films featured here, "Alien 3" is presented in both a "Theatrical" and "Expanded" version. The latter has over 30 minutes of restored footage which changes a couple of key elements of the "Theatrical" cut. I personally prefer the "Expanded" version.<br /><br />"Alien: Resurrection" (1997) takes place 200 years after the episodes of "Alien 3". Lieutenant Ripley is dead. Using her alien-contaminated DNA, a team of scientists decide to create a Ripley clone in an attempt to reconstruct the alien species. After cloning a near perfect "impregnated" Ripley, they extract the alien from inside her for studying and decide to keep the Ripley clone for further testing. The new Ripley has several unusual characteristics; abnormal strength, concentrated acid for blood, and she appears to have a close kinship to her alien broods. The aliens, on the other hand, are kept within securely built confinements, constantly being scrutinized by the scientists. These new breed of aliens are more intelligent and when left alone, they execute their escape plan. Fully aware that their acidic blood is capable of melting steel, they viciously slaughter one of their own creating an acidic blood-bath that eats right through the floor of their confinement. It is up to Ripley and the crew of the newly arrived "Betty" to try to destroy the blood-thirsty predators that are roaming within the ship.<br /><br />Despite having some ridiculous plot twists, the performances in "Resurrection" are up to par and the film delivers the gory goods. There are plenty of gruesome deaths, state-of-the-art visual effects and the aliens themselves are impressive, especially the "Queen" (her birth sequence is one of the film's highlights) but it's clearly evident at this point that the franchise has run out of steam and fresh ideas.<br /><br />This exquisitely packaged box set includes 9 DVD's in total; the 4 films, each with it's own bonus DVD and the 9th DVD includes even more bonus material. Each film is presented in Widescreen format in both a "Theatrical" version and an "Extended" version with "deleted" scenes restored and Audio Commentary. The films are given impeccable treatment in picture and sound. If that weren't enough, a booklet is also enclosed. Fans of the series should not be disappointed since this is one of the most comprehensive box sets ever released. They really did the series proud with this one; highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This film manages to produce a good, effective atmosphere and some good shocks.

It's sad.  That's the first event where Fox started to become the controlling greedy machine that it is now.  They do make the best movies, don't get me wrong, but the way they pushed David Fincher around was wrong.  He never had the whole script on the set at one time and a butchered version of the movie was released in theatres in 1992, but now the original vision is available for the first time.  It's the complete version of Alien 3 that was ment to be.  It's too bad about the audio for alot of the deleted scenes though.  The voices are all washed out.  I'm sorry, David Fincher, maybe some day you'll let someone interview you about the movie, because us fans would really like to here it from the director instead of anyone but.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>For those with lives, &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; is too massive to be experienced in full -- it's a black hole from which no free time can escape. The behemoth stands at the intersection of video obsession and science-fiction geekdom, a space nearly as creepy as any visited in the films. Not scared off? Climb aboard -- here's one long strange trip worth taking. <p>DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika (&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) has pulled together a quarter century's worth of &quot;Alien&quot; matter -- outtakes, production clips, art elements, promo materials, etc. -- somehow emerging with a coherent package. Some elements return from the series' fairly ambitious video past, but much of the content is new or unseen.<p>The set's backbone is what amounts to a 12-hour documentary, carved up into digestible segments of about three hours (and then again into featurettes, if the viewer chooses that navigation option). De Lauzirika weaves a tale populated by a Shakespearean cast of heroes, villains and martyrs, most of whom have their say in new interviews. Even the DVD docu itself is not without drama -- De Lauzirika pulled his name from the piece on &quot;the tragedy of Alien 3&quot; after the studio removed some of the more volatile material about the shoot.<br /><br />In addition to great-looking versions of the four original theatricals, &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; streams in alternate versions of the films, basically director's cuts, three of them new to home video. The directors briefly introduce the rearranged movies, and join key cast and crew members in new commentaries. Only director David Fincher of &quot;Alien 3&quot; is missing in action, a shame because his film went through the most radical renovation.<p>The &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; layout gives viewers a fighting chance, with a logical and uniform approach to content. Menus look good (and creepy), with little guesswork required. (Unfortunately, there's no main onscreen index.) Each title takes up two discs: one for the film(s) and another for bonus materials. A ninth DVD does clean-up with trailers and such. The films' release dates crack open a few Easter Eggs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>This collection of all four of the Alien movie series really does an excellent job of really compiling a very uneven movie franchise and packing it up onto one amazing, if imperfect, set with each of the individual movies having their original versions as well as ?Special Editions? of each one, with a ninth disc, and the result is a downright awesome DVD set.<br /><br />ALIEN (1979): This Ridley Scott directed classic broke so much new ground when it was released. A team of deep space pioneers are returning home from earth when a mysterious signal on a desolate planet is received by the crew aboard the ship Nostromos. When they are sent in to investigate where this mysterious signal came from, they have no idea of the horrors that they will find themselves up against. This one is incredibly groundbreaking and is very suspenseful. The special effects are extremely dated though but this is still a powerful sci-fi classic.<br /><br />ALIENS (1986): This one is easily the best one in my catalog. I can easily remember how much this movie scared me to death when it was released when I was only a toddler. In this one, Ripley is in cryogenic suspension for over 57 years and when she is awaked after all of that time, she is told that the planet that she escaped from after killing the alien there has been colonized. However, as the colony began to flourish, contact is suddenly lost?.completely?..and now a team of Space Marines is sent in with Ripley being the ?advisor? to the team and to rescue any possible survivors, but then realize that Ripley?s main enemy species has made it?s nest there and now they must destroy the nest and the aliens there and escape?if they can. This is easily my favorite of the bunch because of so many things. The acting is almost perfect by everyone. James Cameron?s directing is his best he?s ever done and the special effects even by 1980s standards are absolutely amazing and hardly even show their age.<br /><br />ALIEN 3 (1992): This one to me is one of the most unfairly criticized and underrated classics of all time. At the same time though, I sometimes felt troubled at some of the things that happened in this film in the beginning. Ripley finds herself on a planet after an alien in fact laid an egg onboard the spachship that she, Hicks and Newt were on and where the Queen Alien was defeated. An acid spill causes an electrical fire which causes the escape pod to detach and Ripley is the only survivor once again after the pod crashes into the ocean of a desolate planet where dangerous prisoners are held in a high-security facility called Fury 161. The prisoners however along with Ripley are being hunted by a much deadlier breed Alien like no other and they have No weapons to fight the creature. Ripley herself finds out that her biggest nightmare has come true and that the alien isn?t her only enemy anymore. I?ve always had mixed feelings towards this movie. The most troubling were that two of my favorite characters from the previous one are killed off and it was really depressing. The biggest problem I had with this was that it used the F-Bomb too much. A few such bombs are fine from time to time but sheesh, cut down on them please! Otherwise, this movie is nonetheless a strong entry. The extended cut of this is light years better and replaces some footage from the original version and replaces it while adding previously unreleased footage and extending the movie by over 30 minutes. The result is a much improved version that while deeply flawed no matter what, makes it a lot better than before.<br /><br />ALIEN RESURRECTION (1997): Easily my least favorite of the bunch, I nonetheless find it enjoyable to some extent due to it?s awesome special effects and action sequences. 200 years after Ripley?s passing, scientists from the company that wanted to quarantine the creature have managed to acquire both it and Ripley?s DNA and cloned both of them. The Alien species that her ?ancestor? had fought hard to destroy forever is now heading towards humanity?s home planet Earth and if the Alien makes it there, it could spell catastrophe for humanity. I?ve always had mixed opinions about this movie back when it was released and still do to this day. I?ve always felt that this was more like some kind of spinoff of some sort rather than the continuation of the Alien Saga but it interesting to take into account cloning her even if the samples have survived for over 200 years exposed to the elements. The acting except by Weaver herself of course was hammy and really dogged this movie. Easily the weakest but nonetheless enjoyable but only for Alien die-hards. For everyone else, the first three are more than satisfactory</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>glad i have this on dvd<br /><br />it will terrify me every time I watch it<br /><br />this one shocks you 2 times as much as Alien and Aliens<br /><br />quite a shocker<br /><br />humorous at times<br /><br />very shocking visuals<br /><br />they get more sick and disgusting trust me<br /><br />I almost puked at the dog mutating into alien scene<br /><br />I can handle that scene but will never eat again while watching that one scene. it's a real stomach churner<br /><br />interesting ending the movie has<br /><br />I mean that seriously<br /><br />I really like it from beginning to end<br /><br />it keeps you in suspense while wanting to learn more too</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>After escaping LV-426 in pretty horrendous condition, the remaining crew of the Nostromo (Ripley, Newt, our surviving Colonial Marine, and Bishop) run into a little problem in the crash landing department. This kills two of the three residents in their stasis pods right away and trashes the synthetic Bishop beyond salvageability, leaving Ripley sitting amongst the residents of a prison planet that has been tucked away and forgotten. Still, she's safe because there aren't any Xenos on this rock, right? Unbeknownst to her or the residents of this unarmed rock (unless you call a few flares, some flammable liquid, and some handtools having weaponry), however, she did bring a little bundle of joy into the fold here and, more importantly, she herself finds that perhaps, in this big misadventure, that she has finally managed to step into a pothole of enormous proportions. <p>As far as the Alien series (or Legacy, as the box set indicates) goes, this movie is oftentimes cast off as something that is worth forgetting. In many ways this is because it is a reversion toward the die cast in the first movie and forgotten in the second, where only one alien menaces a group of people instead of an armada of them and where the people find themselves without enough "heat" to "pack." Still, being a fan of the idea and of the furthering of the Alien concept, I didn't exactly see it in that light. Instead of seeing it as a reversion in any sense, I saw the storyline as something that explored the outskirts of the society that they had landed within as it explored how the people managed to get along and the power structure involved therein. This touched on their belief system, the fact that even a hairless (because of the little Lice problem that the planet has) Ripley can be considered a supermodel amongst a colony of forgotten "lifers," and that they find someone shouting "Xeno" much the same as anyone else would. Further, it explores the way the Alien adapts to its host, showing you the body difference in the beasties that come from the atypical human model vs. something that manages to come from an animal like a dog. With the dogburster this requires a little creative ingenuity and it looked pretty good, holding the characteristics of its kind and its host's bodytype quite nicely. <p>The only problems I had with the whole thing was that Newt, someone we had to watch salvaged from the jaws of a Queen in the 2nd installation, is dead on arrival and doesn't really give while the giving is good, and that the Alien's view is sometimes shot through its eyes. Personally, I thought this was something of an insult to the people that watched Ripley trudge through the depths of LV-426 for what amounted to futility, and I wanted to see something tragic happen besides drowning in a stasis chamber. Also, the view of the alien, while interesting when its running up walls, is something that you have to be in the mood for. It does add an odd prospective to the viewing, but I'd sometimes like to watch the man and monstrosity meet in an awe-inspiring puddle of fear-driven demise.<p>This is a movie that I like in quite a few ways, but that I know isn't exactly the most embraced chapter in the storyline. It doesn't involve the dripping of acidic blood in most of its chapters, the alien decides to check in and say hello when it feels the need, and you really don't get anything like you did in Aliens. So, saying that you will or won't like it is something of a rocky road. If you were a fan of the first two then I'd recommend you watch it, and if you like movies of this type then you should check it out as well. You simply have to keep in mind beforehand that the movies are different from one another and, although the gore emitted by the dooms of so many is a nice thing, the storyline is a little on the easily guessed side and there are some flaw in it. Still, its all about the engine of destruction and the doom it brings, and in that the Alien quite simply never disappoints!</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I purchased this set over three years ago and I never had a problem with it. Then again, I sold it because I never really watched the films. Ive been watching more movies lately and gave this set anther go round. Plus I have a surround sound, so that should be fun. Its probably the greatest box set ever because of the contents. While some movie box sets are good they always seem to forget something. Whether it be a movie because it wasnt made at the studio or extra features, there is always something missing. This set has nothing missing. All four films plus four director cut versions of the films and extra features that i'll probably never see it all in my life. Its a good boxset and it has never been duplicated. I wonder why.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>All the Alien movies have enough scares in them to keep you up at night.....

Poor ole widow.<br /><br />Hard to keep track of those crazy prisoners - Now who is the Company man?<br />The disbelief was very noticable until the prisoners were yanked up through the roof [or ceiling].<br /><br />Just a bit of a let-down in Ripley's character almost taking a back seat yet in keeping with the plot.<br /><br />The language was the most glareing fault I found with the whole thing - just increases the common use of the vulgarity [as in everyone uses it] Ha!<br /><br />Aliens 3 was in the line of the first two - for mature audiences only.  Makes a good trilogy - a little less watched as the Predator trilogy but a nice build-up to PvA [sorry guys this one is a lot better than A-3].<br />Don't tell me movies can't be made without vulgarity.<br /><br />No Recommendation - as this one has to be a matter of personal choice.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>An interesting entry for sure.

It was interesting to see Bishop, the real person who invented the Bishop cyborgs.

However the accting is okay and the film is alright, but it seems far too dull and will prove dissapointing and boring for some.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>So far my opinion on the first three movies have changed quite dramatically. Wasn't that keen on the very first one, thought the second one improved, and after watching the third, I really enjoyed it! I actually thought it was the best of the series so far! (Bearing in mind I haven't seen Resurrection at the time of writing this review.)<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is getting better with each movie, and quite possibly, making it the reason why I like the movies better. I didn't think she could have surpassed her portrayal in the second movie, but in this she did. We get to see a very different side of Ripley, as she discovers she's the lone survivor, losing her 'adopted' daughter, Newt, and landing alone, on a prison planet, where the men are rapists, child molestors, murderers etc, and haven't seen a woman in years. Cue much shock when a battered and bruised Ripley walks in. And then we finally understand where Britney got her inspiration from!!! (Sorry it had to be said!)<br /><br />The film is made to be very claustrophobic I thought. Especially in the last act, where the camera is filming upside down. It's also different to the previous movies, with Sigourney now made executive producer, and the Alien is not scary as such, but it's taken on different characteristics. Alien 3 is also a lot slower paced, considering the fast paced, action packed James Cameron previous work, but in no means is it a slow film. It builds up the tension in such a way that before you know it, you're at the dare I say it, (almost) cliffhanger ending. How the fourth one came about I don't know, and I'm dying to find out.<br /><br />For any Casualty fans (that would be) in the UK, look out for Clive Mantle, appearing in a couple of scenes. He appeared as Mike Barrett for 10 years in Casualty, and I remembered him very well, although I was originally distracted by the fact that everytime I got told there was a guy from Casualty, Pete Postlethwaite always appeared straight afterwards!<br /><br />If it wasn't for the fact each movie was a continuation, I would have skipped out the first one, because it has paled in comparison so far to the second and third movies. I am definitely looking forward with curiousity to the fourth chapter, and to see what finally happens.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>By now everyone knows who Ellen Ripley is - Sigourney Weaver.  Actually she's the heroine of this 4 film - 8 disc phenomenon called &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;.  This box set includes all four films in the series in revamped, modified, remastered and re-edited editions. Why? - primarily because number three and four in the series could really use the help - I'm assuming, but hey, it's a pretty good guess.<br />PLOT of all four films: A survivor of an alien attack - Ellen Ripley, goes back for more and more punishment against a really nasty looking aggressor from outer space that by the last installment looks more like a finger puppet reject from Jim Henson's muppet lab.  Okay, enough criticism on the special effects.  Seriously, though; my advice to anyone who wants the original masterpiece from Ridley Scott and James Cameron's brilliant sequel; wait till January when the films will be made available separately.<br />TRANSFERS: Near pristine.  &quot;Alien&quot; - the first film, is the real stand out.  Color balancing is superb. Flesh tones are richly textured. Blacks are black. The haze and related age artifacts are practically non-existant. Film grain has been greatly reduced over the previous issued DVD. The audio has been masterfully updated. &quot;Aliens&quot; - same transfer as before; Cameron didn't really see the need to update it.  Near pristine. All of the above criteria apply. &quot;Alien 3&quot; Pristine transfer - sorry excuse for a sequel - even in this re-edited form. &quot;Alien Ressurection&quot; - I'm going to sleep, just thinking about it. All of the above criteria apply to these transfers as well.<br />EXTRAS: I'm not even going to bother. Suffice it to say, that if you invest in this box set you will possess the largest compendium of useless information available to mankind on a digital format.  While the documentaries are a fantastic bonus, much of the material featured there is repeated in other &quot;extras&quot;.  There's also a lot of junket material that really doesn't enhance your movie going experience so much as it indoctrinates you into believing part &quot;4&quot; is the greatest horror/sci-fi of all time. Yeah, right!<br />BOTTOM LINE: Wait for parts one and two to become available on their own.  They're the only ones worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>Crash land of a planet for prisioners are all men, ripley thinks the alein is on board.

Halfway through it fell apart despite some genius scenes. Fox packaged all 4 films including special edition type films, and many other goodies for a set that is just massive to get through.<br /><br />Alien(1979): Ridley Scott directed the first one which is my second favorite. It had a really slow build and what freaks people out about it is the unknown. A creature who can blend into the architecture of the ship and it was a claustrophic and paranoid type of fear, like knowing something's there but not knowing when it'll appear. It has the legendary chestburster scene and Sigourney in those cute panties.<br /><br />Aliens(1986): James Cameron directed this one and it's my favorite. Again slow build but this one is more intense. More action and combat driven, arguably a gorier chestburster scene, a character's outcome which I can't help but feel sorry for(hint: he's not like his original counterpart) and a cool ending fight. The deleted scenes flesh out Ripley's character more and her relationship with Newt.<br /><br />Alien 3(1992): David Fincher directed this one and he practically disowns it from his filmography. It's not THAT bad but it does have weak storyline and script problems but it's great visually. The "alien vision" in the tunnels is cool but it has oddly bad CG.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection(1997): Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed this one and it's pretty bad too but the underwater chase is thrilling and the end gore scene is quite brutal but the script just seems too convenient or just odd(200 years for a Ripley clone? Who just happens to have all memories intact? And is pregnant no less?) Plus quite a bit gorier than the others which is interesting cause I always thought the series worked when there wasn't a lot of gore.<br /><br />There's 9 discs in all, one for each film in it's entirety plus the extended editions and commentaries etc and the 2nd disc delving into the making of the films. The 9th disc is stuff like trailers for each film and extra stuff. I doubt they would make a 5th considering the box office intake and just general lacklusterness of the last 2 but here's hoping it takes it into a good and new direction before it gets stale. But for now, marvel at the first 2, and just try to entertain yourself with the last 2.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>Despite what you may think of the last two films in this film franchise (I found them acceptable but certainly not on par with the first two), the ALIEN QUADRILOGY stands as a DVD benchmark in home entertainment.  One could argue that this package stands on par in stature to what THE LORD OF THE RINGS Extended DVD Versions have accomplished.  These discs (nine total) are filled with incredibly documented materials, including new documentaries exploring what went on behind-the-scenes while making each of the films as well as a semi-critique of the film series' impact on genre filmmaking.  If the discs have any shortcoming, I would say that the lack of true &quot;evaluation&quot; of Alien3 is missing from the supplementals; much of what is provided feels more &quot;promotional&quot; in nature and less &quot;substantive&quot; ... but that's a blip in comparison to the total package.  A sum total of nearly sixty hours of entertainment (films included), this QUADRILOGY makes for extensive viewing on aliens, filmmaking, and acting in scienc fiction films.  While the set boasts a hefty price-tag, I certainly felt my money was well spent.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>My title says it all.

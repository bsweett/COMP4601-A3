The Apollo program still intrigues me, and I still regard it as the greatest technological triumph in the history of the world. Before Ron Howard made this movie, most people had forgotten about Apollo other than knowing that men walked on the moon (though there are those that dispute even that now): some could recall Neil Armstrong's name, but few could remember anything more.<br /><br />Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did the world a great favor by reminding people of the human risk and personal sacrifice required by the Astronauts and their families. "Apollo 13" is not only a great work of cinema; it is a great historical document that will last long after the last of the Apollo Astronauts has passed on.<br /><br />The film itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking effects, and many scenes filmed in the NASA C-135 "Vomit Comet" parabolic flight "Zero-G" aircraft. This film stands the test for realism and drama. I am extremely familiar with the Apollo mission profiles, and am impressed by the accuracy of the production, although certain concessions to absolute accuracy were made to tell the story in two hours out of necessity, and many of the technical conversations include background information that the real participants would not have bothered with as it would be obvious information to them. Nonetheless, the film is very authentic looking, which I attribute to the Howard and Hanks authenticity requirements, as well as having Dave Scott as a technical advisor.<br /><br />The extras are great; I particularly liked the other Apollo 13 documentary, although I was a bit less enthused by the "Conquering Space" offering. The best extra is the commentary track with Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which explains what they like about the film, interesting backstory information, and occasional technical corrections from Jim.<br /><br />This is the best drama I have ever seen. Buy this one today: it's a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>Director Ron &quot;Opie&quot; Howard gets behind the camera and directs his best film ever....a dramatization of the near-fatal voyage of Apollo 13.

The attention to detail in this picture is staggering.  Howard and company didn't miss a beat when re-creating these events and their surroundings! <p>There's a fine music score to accompany the action on screen as well.  And it's nice to have this one on DVD, for the wealth of supplemental materials, as well as a fantastic Dolby 5.1 audio track!  (Crank up the volume for the Apollo launch sequence!  It sounds awesome in all its 5.1 window-shattering splendor!)</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>After his mega success with Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks scored another winner as Jim Lovell, commander of the ill-fated Apollo 13 launch.  Mr. Hanks shows why he is the Jimmy Stewart of his generation as just like Mr. Stewart, Mr. Hanks has the ability to play the everyman.  No matter what role he undertakes, we find Mr. Hanks believable and we can all relate to him.  He portrays Capt. Lovell with understated grace and charm and we really feel for him when he comes to the realization that he will never get his chance to walk on the moon.  In addition to Mr. Hanks the film boasts excellent performances by Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Bill Paxson as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert the other Apollo 13 crew members, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly an original crew member left out due to possible illness and Ed Harris as Eugene Krantz the head of the mission in Houston.  Ms. Quinlan adds the right amount of fear and worry to her character without becoming shrill and Mr. Sinise overcomes his initial bitterness to becoming an integral part of the crew's survival.  Above all, Mr. Harris gives the performance of his career.  He is commanding and powerful as he vows that the ship will not be lost on his watch.  Ron Howard had the always difficult task of directing a movie based on real life events. Everyone already knows what happens to the ship, but Mr. Howard expertly guides us through to the end.  He supplies the film with enough tension and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The filming of the space launch and scenes in space are amazing.  In one of the grossest oversights in Oscar history, Mr. Howard was not nominated for Best Director despite his film being so.  In fact Mr. Howard won the prestigious Director's Guild Award making the Oscar snub even more glaring.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>The movie Apollo 13 is a wonderful look into a disaster that became a triumph. Based on astronaut Jim Lovells book &quot;Lost Moon&quot; and directed by Ron Howard this movie takes you within the first 10 minutes from the tradegy of Apollo 1, and the deaths of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee, right into the Landing on the moon by Apollo 11. With that as a setting it will focus on the events leading to the disaster and through the heroics efforts of both the astronauts and the ground crew.<p>Based on a time when America had become somewhat bored with Moon landings (although this was only the third scheduled) Apollo 13 takes you step-by-step through the story. Starting with the 3 astronuats (Lovell, Haise. and Mattingly) training for their mission and displaying the type of teamwork that is so essential to a successful mission, it then leads you to the last minute replacement of Mattingly by Swaggart due to potential health concerns. From there it shows the concern of Haise and Lovell as Swaggart tries to fit into their style. Swaggart never quite accomplishes this which would lead to a confrontation with Haise during the flight. The personnel of Mission Control are the real heros here though, from the leadership of Flight Director Gene Krantz to the efforts of every single person.<p>The cast of Apollo 13 actually made the movie come alive. Yes, the special effects were great, but without the perfect acting jobs by the strong cast this could have fallen into documentry standards. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell displays the confidence that you would expect from the mission leader. Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly is wonderful, going from the excitment of pre-flight to the disappointment of being scatched from the mission to the results-driven savior. Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan round out a great cast.<p>Having read the book before seeing the movie it's interesting to note that while the movie is about a 50/50 mix of action between the astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston. Both approaches are correct. In book form the author can take the time to go into detail of all the heroic actions and efforts that the personel of Mission Control had to do to bring these men home safely. In the movie it's best to cover the essentials. However if this movie was interesting to you I would HIGHLY recommend the book. It gives you great insight into all that transpired.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>To truly appreciate this film it may be necessary to see the TV mini series, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. However &quot;Apollo 13&quot; stands  on its own nearly as well. It is the story of the Apollo 13 NASA mission to  land on the moon. It was to be the third landing, Apollo 11 with Neil  Armstrong being the first.  Unfortunately Murphy was at the helm and  anything that could go wrong did.<br /><br />While the film was based on  reality, it actually went fairly close to showing reality, (a once on a  blue moon event, ha ha). The only deviations, (determined after reading Jim  Lovell's account), were minor and for the sake of simplifying complex  situations or dramatizing an otherwise technical problem.<br /><br />The cast  was terrific. Tom Hanks as Lovell was at his usual brilliant best. He was  well supported by Bill Paxton, (who seems to get parts in a lot of great  films), playing astronaut Fred Haise. And I want to give a special mention  to Kevin Bacon, who played Jack Swigert, for a better than usual effort. He  is really starting to mature as an actor.  I am a fan of Gary Sinise, so it  would be remiss of me not to praise his work as Ken Mattingly, the  astronaut that is bumped from the mission due to a potential case of  measles.<br /><br />The whole film was created from scratch, that is to say  no old NASA launch footage was used. The quality of the effects makes the  film seem more real than actual space missions. The director, Ron Howard,  was advised by actual astronauts and assisted by NASA, (for an enormous  fee). Even to the point of using true free fall environments to film the  appropriate space sequences and as far as I know, that is a first in movie  history.<br /><br />I see no point in giving a blow by blow rendition of this  film, if your are interested, read a history text. Suffice to say that it  is not only educational but thoroughly moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>When oxygen cylinders violently outgassed aboard the ill-fated Apollo 13, one of the most dramatic events in space exploration history began to unfold. The entire world was glued to their TV sets as the story evolved, and what a story it was.<br /><br />Apollo 13 tells the story of this amazing rescue. It shows with great realism and detail exactly what happened and what steps the astronauts had to take to ensure their safe return. Over 5000 people on the ground were eventually enlisted in this effort, and if it hadn't been for them, the astronauts would never have made it home.<br /><br />A lot of effort went into recreating the look of the original launch command center, the lunar module and capsule, and Houston control. Former NASA experts were recruited to help with this, and during shooting in the command centers former NASA employees coached the actors on what to say and do. Toward the end of the movie, Jim Lovell makes a brief cameo as the Admiral aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima, which picked up the capsule, who congratulates Tom Hanks on their safe return.<br /><br />To recreate the weightless scenes, a cargo plane carrying the actors made 612 dives, collecting about 50 minutes of footage for the movie.<br /><br />Once the original accident occurred, the drama and tension is just non-stop until the very end. The astronauts battled deficiencies in oxygen, fuel cell/electrical power, increasing cold (it finally got to 34 degrees in the cabin), a nearly fatal increase in carbon dioxide (which was successfully averted). Astronaut Haise had a fever of 102 degrees from a urinary tract infection,  but still managed to pull his own weight during the long recovery process.<br /><br />I watched this movie just recently after seeing it for the first time in 1995, and it holds up very well. At this time Tom Hanks was coming off of back to back Academy Awards for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia, and he was arguably the hottest actor in the world at the time. But he followed it up with another great performance here. The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Ed Harris as the flight director, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Tom Paxton as Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. This is one movie that has stood the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>With Neil Armstrong (the first man to walk on the moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission) passing on today, it reminded me of the Apollo program and the great things the U.S. has achieved in its space program, from the Mercury program to the Gemini program to the Apollo program, to the shuttle program, the Mars program, and on and on.  Apollo 13 (1995) is a great cinematic achievement from director Ron Howard.  It really captures the essence of what happened with Apollo 13 in April 1970.  One of the few failed expeditions in the history of the U.S. space program, it reminds one of how dangerous space travel is and how things can go wrong.  Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Kathleen Quinlan, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinese, and Ed Harris star in this movie.  Quinlan was nominated for an Academy Award for her great performance.<br /><br />The musical score by James Horner is great.  The movie also contains popular songs from the time period.<br /><br />All right thinking Americans should salute Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (the other half of the Apollo 11 mission and the second man to walk on the moon) for their bravery and for paving the way to the future of space exploration.  Now the U.S. is exploring Mars with its rover called Curiosity.  One day the U.S. will take the next step when it comes to Mars.<br /><br />Overall, Apollo 13 is an entertaining movie that I highly recommend.  In my opinion, it was the best movie of 1995.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another routine space flight, until these words pierced the immense void of space, Houston, we have a problem. Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert fight a desperate battle to survive. Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly, flight director Gene Kranz and a heroic ground crew race against time, and the odds to bring them home. One of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic movie despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. "Apollo 13" is an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining movie, but is also a educational one.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Many people expected Apollo 13 to be a "routine" mission to the moon.  If successful, it would have been the 3rd lunar landing.  The mission did not, however, turn out to be routine.  About 3/4 of the way to the moon a faulty piece of electronics caused an explosion that put the three-man crew in great danger.<br /><br />This movie does an outstanding job of telling the story of the astronauts on this mission, as well as of the NASA ground crew that had to solve problem after problem in order to find a way to have a chance of getting the crew home safely.<br /><br />Why this film is great:<br />1) The acting is top-notch.  With actors like Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon, how could it NOT be?  The entire cast did an outstanding job.<br />2) This film is based on a true story that held the entire nation, perhaps the entire world, in its grip (and personally, I tend to prefer a good true story to a good fictional one)<br />3) The re-eneactements of the critical thinking and work of the NASA ground crew, scientists, and technicians added the realism needed to pull off a realistic telling of this story<br />4) I've visited the NASA Johnson Flight Center in Houston, and the original ground control room is still there (though there is now a new one that ground control uses).  I don't know if filming actually took place in that original flight control room, but it sure looked like it to me,  That also added to the realism.<br />5) The intertwined storylines, including the crew, the NASA ground staff, and the astronauts' families made for a gripping tale.<br />6) The music was awesome<br />7) Ron Howard is an AMAZING director.<br /><br />I can't really think of anything that would make me consider anything less than a 5-star rating for this amazing show.<br /><br />There is, you may want to know, a smattering of mild language scattered throughout the movie and a some innuendo, and one blurred shower scene  that I know I could have done without, adn that in my opinion didn't really add to the show.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a 5-star show through and through.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>It seems impossible to think that an Oscar-nominated film (in several major categories) could be considered "under-rated."  But this is certainly the case with Apollo 13.  Perhaps Ron Howard's best film, it is an exciting, harrowing, and ultimately rewarding film-watching experience that doesn't let you down on repeated viewings.  Howard brings out the most in his cast - the casual viewer will be surprised at the depth and nuance the performances of Gary Sinese and Bill Paxton.  This is also Kevin Bacon's breakout role (with Mystic River).  I would even go so far as to say this might be Tom Hanks greatest performance - yes, even better than "Philadelphia", "Forrest Gump", or "Saving Private Ryan" (it is most similar to the last, perhaps unsurprisingly as his Apollo 13 character is an Air Force officer).  But the performances are only part of the puzzle.  The filming - much of it in sets built for microgravity filming in a NASA training plane - is a remarkable feat of cinematic sleight of hand, and I am still shocked and dismayed that Howard did not win the "best director" Oscar.  There has never been a movie that uses special effects so effectively as this one.<br /><br />The story is likely well-known to most: the 3rd American mission to the moon suffers a catestrophic failure when a fuel cell blows up, leaving the three astronauts aboard with little power and no hope of rescue.  Howard dishes out the drama in stages, as first the oxygen tanks leak out, to the temperature dropping, to erratic course corrections, to gradual poisoning of the atmosphere on the ship by respired carbon dioxide.  He does not neglect the peripheral members of the NASA team, and pays special attention to Lovell's wife and family.  The IMAX version, some 15 minutes shorter, is also included on this Anniversary Edition.  It's instructive to note that the longer version is a more effective film, since he spends more time developing the relationships that allow us to care for the characters.<br /><br />For those that have seen the movie many times, I would direct them to the making-of features as a reason to buy this bargain-priced DVD.  Of most interest to me was the audio commentary by Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell.  He is candid about where the film fails to accurately portray either the science or the details of the actual mission, while Ron Howard's commentary explains why these changes were made cinematically (as an example - the film shows Mattingly in the simulator exclusively, while in reality there were three simulators and teams of astronauts working in them all simultaneously).  Lovell's wife Marilyn (portrayed by Kathleen Quinlin in the film) is also part of the commentary, and her input is equally valuable.  One amusing part is the discussion of miniskirts:<br /><br />Jim: "Hey, they dressed Kathleen in miniskirts through this whole movie.  Did you really wear them that much?"<br />Marilyn: "Well, it was the style at the time..."<br /><br />To sum up, this is a 5-star movie on a 5-star DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Apollo 13 is a good Ron Howard film, I just don't think it's his most accomplished work. Tom Hanks pulls off another excellent performance, the problem I have with this film is the pacing, it's slow but the ending more than makes up for it. Apollo 13 is a film every young adult should watch, good history lesson.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>A nail-bitingly tense and heroic tale of survival-against-the-odds based on the actual Apollo 13 crisis, Howard's Oscar-winning drama rekindles the exhilarating enthusiasm the nation felt during the first flights to the moon--and also draws on the collective anxiety that pooled in the wake of the Challenger explosion. Even without this context, "Apollo 13" is a grippingly authentic story, crisply helmed by Howard and superbly acted by a first-rate cast including Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Harris, and Gary Sinise--most of whom prepared with zero-gravity flights at the director's insistence.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Love this movie, would recommend it to anyone who would like to be grossly entertained for 220 minutes.

Usually, engineers and builders do their best to ensure that the technology to be used is safe.  However, mistakes can and sometimes do happen.  Such was the case during NASA's Apollo 13 moon mission that was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 11, 1970.  Intended to be the third landing and human exploration of the lunar surface, many people had lost interest in the program following the huge success of the previous two missions that included the first-ever manned landing on the moon.  However, such complacency was quickly replaced by fear and anxiety, as the fates of the three Apollo 13 astronauts were unknown following a potentially lethal accident.  These fears, anxieties and hopes were beautifully captured by director Ron Howard in his 1995, Oscar-nominated film aptly named "Apollo 13".<br /><br />In the film, the three Apollo 13 astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), have a flawless launch as they set out for the moon.  Jack Swigert was not originally supposed to be part of the Apollo 13 crew though.  It was supposed to be Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), but when NASA doctors thought that he might have the mumps, he was grounded and Jack Swigert replaced him.  This caused some minor consternation among all involved, but the mighty Saturn 5 rocket was launched on April 11, 1970 anyway.  Everything appeared to be going normally until April 14, some 205,000 miles away from the Earth.  Jack Swigert was instructed to mix the oxygen tanks, which, when he did, caused an explosion.  The explosion caused multiple failures on board making the Mission Control personnel initially think that there was simply a communications or monitoring equipment failure.  However, once Jim Lovell & Fred Haise regained control of the damaged ship, Jim Lovell reported to Mission Control those immortal words, "Houston, we have a problem."  Once Mission Control personnel realized the severity of the situation, they considered ordering the crew to turn back, but there was no way to know whether the main rocket booster had been damaged.  Instead, they opted for the safer, but longer route that would have the damaged ship go around the moon, then begin its return to Earth.  Since the crew had to shut off power and had no active guidance computer, the tension was very high as Jim Lovell & Fred Haise manually operated the lunar-lander's rocket to cause the ship to return to Earth.  Other problems included the intense cold (since there wasn't enough power for heat), having to adapt the square air filters from one ship to work in the round filter holes in the other so that they would not die from asphyxiation, boredom, not knowing whether or not the ship's systems would come back on properly, not knowing whether the heat shield had been damaged and Fred getting sick.  This was truly one of NASA's finest moments in being able to assist the otherwise helpless crew be able to return to Earth, including Ken Mattingly working hard on the ground to help ensure that the Apollo 13 crew would be able to turn on what they need with the little power that they had available.<br /><br />Other memorable characters in the film include Mission Control chief Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan) and Blanch Lovell (Jean Speegle Howard, 1927-2000).  For its overall realism, wonderful cinematography, engaging story and wonderful acting, I rate "Apollo 13" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  The film won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, but was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Art & Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.  Additionally, Ed Harris received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, as did Kathleen Quinlan for Best Supporting Actress.  If you have never seen the film, but aren't sure that you want to purchase a copy, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I don't think it matters whether you remember the story of the Apollo 13 space mission or not.  Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest.  And when the resolution comes it will command your emotions.<br /><br />Part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood.  Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.<br /><br />Ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship.  In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances.  A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look.  After all, they were engaged in the success or failure of the mission in the most immediate sense.<br /><br />I also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner.  When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that.  The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself.  It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.<br /><br />Although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound.  Perhaps the movie was considered too much of a purely commercial venture at the time (and because of the budget it was largely that of course), and perhaps Howard's direction and intention seemed very much by the book.  However I think the final result turned out to be more than some thought when it was released in 1995.  It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done.  Everybody worked hard for veracity and they certainly convinced me.  Nonetheless there is perhaps something missing here.  Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.<br /><br />See this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Apollo 13 is a well cast and extremely well directed movie that tells the story of one of NASA's finest hours. Even though the actual outcome is well known, the movie provides dramatic tension as the Apollo 13 crew and the people at mission control work their way through a most remarkable life threatening situation. The cast is outstanding, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise all giving wonderful performances. For me Ed Harris as Mission Control director Gene Kranz just about steals the movie. He is just incredibly good in this role , possibly his finest hour on screen.<br /><br />It is easy to take the technical aspects of this film for granted because they are so realistic and presented in almost documentary form but the effects and the atmosphere aboard the space capsule and lunar landing craft are extraordinary.<br /><br />This is definitely a film worth owning and one I pull off the shelf now and then and always enjoy viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>1995's &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is a well-crafted and truly inspiring motion picture, based on the actual events of the nearly-doomed Apollo 13 moon mission in April 1970.<p>Director Ron Howard guides this project with passion. A passion that seems to be equally shared by each and every one of his starring actors on screen -- Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris.  Plus, there's the ever-appealing Kathleen Quinlan, as Hanks' wife. Quinlan and Howard worked together more than two decades prior to this movie -- on &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (Kathleen had a very small role in that 1973 film, which starred Howard).<p>Three astronauts' lives hang in the balance during the last half of this finely-tuned film, as the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers a major &quot;problem&quot; on board. An oxygen tank explodes, crippling the craft and endangering the lives of the moon-bound passengers (Astronauts Lovell, Haise, and Swigert -- portrayed by Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon, respectively).<p>Some of the more dramatic dialogue-driven scenes on board the spacecraft are fictionalized, but most of this film (from what I've been able to discern) is derived from actual, true events. With much of the dialogue between Mission Control and the spacecraft being taken (nearly verbatim) from the official NASA tapes and transcripts.<p>This single-disc (and single-sided) Universal &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; DVD delivers the goods admirably IMO, with very good picture quality, excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround sound (with the rousing music score shining through especially well), and some nice bonus features to boot.<p>The film is presented here in its original theatrical ratio of 2.35:1. This is the perfect screen shape for this film, in my view -- nice and w-i-d-e!  And it looks great via this anamorphically-enhanced DVD transfer.<p>DVD Special Features include a very informative and extremely fun-to-watch Making-Of documentary, &quot;Lost Moon&quot;.  This feature, which runs 58 minutes, begins with a nicely well-preserved clip of the real three Apollo 13 astronauts being introduced by Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (circa May 1970). Director Ron Howard, and the cast members, add much insight into the making of this technically-challenging motion picture, including stories (with film clips) from rehearsals inside the KC-135 aircraft (a modified Boeing 707 jetliner) known as &quot;The Vomit Comet&quot;, which was used by the filmmakers to simulate weightlessness.  Interesting stuff here. <p>Also on tap on the DVD are two Audio Commentary Tracks (one of them by Director Howard), the film's Theatrical Trailer, and some extensive text notes.<p>This DVD package also contains a multi-page (fold-out type) paper insert, which contains Production Notes, Chapter Lists (for both the film AND the nearly-hour-long documentary, which is broken down into 13 &quot;chapters&quot; itself), and some photographs.<p>Plus -- Don't forget about the really cool &quot;Easter Egg&quot; on this disc.  Well, I guess you could say it's not really an &quot;Egg&quot;, being that it isn't really &quot;hidden&quot; here. But it isn't an &quot;advertised&quot; bonus on the packaging, at any rate. -- By just popping in the disc and getting to the &quot;Main Menu&quot;, you thereby get to the unadvertised bonus of the &quot;Complete Musical Score&quot; to the film, which will play non-stop to its end by just leaving the Main Menu on the screen.  Pretty nifty indeed.  An excellent idea, I think, for incorporating an &quot;Isolated Music Score&quot; onto a DVD.  I wish more DVDs had this nice musical feature.  The music score can be &quot;advanced&quot; to the next &quot;track&quot; (or music segment) by using your remote's &quot;Skip&quot; or &quot;Chapter Advance&quot; key. (You can only go &quot;forward&quot; in the score, however. The &quot;Skip Back&quot; button has been disabled for this bonus feature; at least it has been on my player.)<p>&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is a good film to re-visit occasionally -- and this well-done Universal Collector's Edition DVD makes doing just that even a greater pleasure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>There is plenty of praise worthy of this film, &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; directed by Ron Howard.  Not only is it surprisingly attune to the facts of the ill-fated moon mission, it still makes you care about the astronaunts who flew:  Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swaggert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton).  The film also features Gary Sinese has Ken Maddingly, the astronaut kept out of the mission.  Their woes began when an oxygen tank exploded and they had to rely their lunar lander in order to get home.  But they were aided by NASAs' impassioned crew back on the ground led by team leader Gene Kranz (Ed Harris).  Plenty of risky improvising insues to get them home, such as using socks and suits to help make an air filter and turning off their navigating computer in order to save power.<p>Even throughout all this tenchnical and historical clutter, director Ron Howard still keeps the filming flowing fluidly with white-knuckled scenes aboard the spacecraft.  And the production design is incredible.  Most likely modeled after the actual Saturn 5 rocket, the exquisitely detailed sets serve to give the film an added sese of realism, and isn't the truth more interesting than almost any fiction?  It should be said however that the film is also augmented by a sharp script that keeps the movie exciting as well.  However, more importantly Howard instills a tangible human element that lifts the film even higher.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RRBPUGD7UOSP.html">A3RRBPUGD7UOSP</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that really makes you think. The events in the film (for the most part) are as they actually happened. <p>This film follows the crew of the Apollo 13 lunar mission, when something goes terribly wrong with the spacecraft, threatening the mission, as well as the crew's lives.<p>The actors in the film do an excellent job, and with good reason. Many of them have been nominated for oscars, and some of them have won. Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon are just two of the high quality actors in this film.  Ed Harris and Gary Sinise play supporting roles, but do it flawlessly. The acting is so good, that parts of the film make you feel as though you are there in the capsule with these men.<p>This was the first DVD I bought after getting my DVD player, and saw how crisp and clear the picture was. I was a bit fooled by this, as a lot of DVDs aren't this good. The picture and sound are crystal clear.<p>I recommend this movie to everyone with a DVD player. It is acceptable for children, and might even teach them a thing or two about the history of manned spaceflight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>In April of 1970, flights to the moon seemed very ordinary, so no one was excited about the Apollo 13 launch, except for the astronauts and their families... Little signs of bad luck appeared here and there - the unlucky number 13, which was not only included in the spaceship's name but in some time points of their crucial events, an astronaut being bumped off the flight because he might have caught the measles, and the commander's wife losing her ring the morning before the launch. But nothing major, and definitely nothing scientific... Even their broadcast from space was not aired - not interesting enough, probably...<p>Up until a few minutes after the broadcast, that is - when a routine operation on the oxygen tanks caused a loud bang - and pretty soon not only the landing on the moon was cancelled, but also the landing back home seemed in geopardy. Thruogh the heroic efforts of the crew - both on the spaceship, but mainly in mission control - and many not-too-standard improvisations, the space shuttle landed on earth.<p>The quality of picture and sound were great, and the extra material is excellent, especially the commntary of the real Jim Lovell and his wife...<p>Even though not all of the little detail were exact - Jack Swaiggert was a very competent pilot who even wrote the emergency procedures for the CM, and the crew were only worried about his ability to work the ship while they were not on it but on the LEM. Also, an interesting fact I've read in Jim Lovell's book is that using the LEM as a lifeboat is an idea that they got on one of the practice flights they had before the actual lift off... But nevertheless, this is still is a great reproduction of one of the most succesful failures ever...</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>Others have remarked well enough on the virtues of _Apollo 13_ as a film.  What makes the Special Edition DVD worth its purchase price, however, are the tons of extras that you get.  The story of the making of _Apollo 13_ is  at least as interesting, if nowhere near as harrowing, as the actual  moonshot itself, and this DVD gives you hours of material to walk you  through that process.  <p>Anyone who's interested in filmmaking will be  riveted by both the Ron Howard running film commentary and the hour-long  &quot;Making of&quot; documentary.  Perhaps even more intriguing is the  Marilyn and Jim Lovell audio track, in which you get to hear how Lovell  feels about Howard and Hanks made his movie.  This is made all the more  interesting and informative for the filmmaking student in that _Apollo 13_  wasn't just the retelling of Lovell's real-life experience, it's also the  film version of his book.  Getting his perspective both as narrative object  and storyteller is fascinating, as are Marilyn's observations on Kathleen  Quinlan's Academy-nominated performance.  <p>Combine all this with the  superb technical brilliance of the encoding here, and you've got a DVD  that's entirely worth the surprisingly modest price.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KT1GWCW8F80.html">A1KT1GWCW8F80</a><br/><p>&quot;Failure is not an option!&quot;. So says mission-control director Gene Kranz, played by Ed Harris, as mission control devises a way to get the astronauts safely home. Although initially viewed as a disaster (explosion in spacecraft which forces cancellation the the moon-landing mission), in reality it is a story of success due to resourcefulness. The astronauts must return to earth and splash down safely with only enough electrical power to run a coffee pot.<p>Probably the best of director Ron Howard's movies, it is well acted by stars Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell), Kevin Bacon (Jack Swigert), and Bill Paxton (Fred Haise) as the three space-bound astronauts, Gary Sinise (mission-bumped astronaut Ken Mattingly), Ed Harris (mission control Gene Kranz), and Kathleen Quinlan (Marilyn Lovell). The movie was nominated for 9 Oscars including best picture, writing, supporting actor (Harris), supporting actress (Quinlan), music, and visual effects, and won for editing and for sound. <p>There are a lot of special effects thoughout the movie, including the entirely-recreated lift-off sequence from a bird's-eye viewpoint. The weightlessness scenes were achieved by filming in a KC-135 airplane that did a series of parabolic climbs and dives, allowing about 25 seconds of filming at a time.<p>An exciting 220 minute movie about one of the most-watched successful rescues in history, the DVD contains a good &quot;making of&quot; documentary, a commentary by director Ron Howard, and another by Jim and Marilyn Lovell. &quot;Bill Paxton's home movies&quot; were never located, and the &quot;comparison with NASA footage&quot; and the &quot;extensive exploration of special effects&quot; were brief parts of the &quot;making of&quot;, not separate items. Text-based production notes and cast/crew blurbs, and a trailer. Undocumented feature is the isolated score which plays in its entirety at the main menu (can skip forward, but not backward, however). The 2.35:1 wide-screen movie has 56 (!) chapters. Highly recommend for fans of any of the actors listed above, the space program, or adventures in general.<p>&quot;With all due respect, sir, I believe this will be our finest hour&quot; - Gene Kranz</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>This is a long movie, and it certainly seems like it. Perhaps its Tom Hank's typically low-energy acting, or just that the movie doesn't recreate the suspense over 30 years after the incident, but I just find it heard to sit through this movie. At times, it starts to seem like the Tom Hanks show.<br /><br />If there is any redeeming factor to the movie, it's the fact that it later led to Tom Hank's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0GYD2">From the Earth to the Moon</a> television series, which is excellent. That series focuses on the entire Apollo program and has a great set of actors [the series includes an episode on Apollo 13, but it also isn't very good]. I would actually give <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225733">Apollo 13</a> an extra star just for leading to that series. On its own, the movie just isn't very satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Those words are the tag line for every fictionalized account of space exploration disaster, but the one time they were spoken in earnest makes all the fictionalized accounts wane like the setting moon. <p>APOLLO 13 is a great film. Tom Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, spacecraft Commander of the aptly-named "Odyssey" really deserved an Academy Award for this one (and might have gotten it, had he not already won previously, two years running).<p>The film recounts the terrifying ordeal of astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), their families, and their ground-based support crew, after an oxygen tank explosion on the third lunar landing mission forces an abort. The three men have to reduce their spacecraft to barely livable conditions in order to survive a quarter-million miles from home.<p>Director Ron Howard captures the tension of the event perfectly, and also recaptures the ambience of NASA in 1970, a mixture of energy, technical competence, and frustration, when it seemed the American public had just about forgotten it's once lionized space program in the wake of moon missions so successful they seemed absolutely boring. <p>For anyone old enough to remember those fearsome days of Apollo 13, as I do, this movie sparks memories. For a moment in time, the planet was united: besides the Western Powers, the Soviets, the Red Chinese, the North Koreans and North Vietnamese set out rescue vessels to retreive the returning men.<p>With barely enough electricity to run a toaster, limited water, no heat, and hardly any oxygen, the three astronauts faced almost certain death. Ron Howard captures their understated emotion, as well as their phenomenal resilience and test-pilot cool, without making them seem miraculously superhuman or unassailably cold-blooded. <p>Bacon's Swigert, a last-minute replacement to the crew can't help but gloat over his good luck, and then becomes increasingly waspish as the disastrous mission winds on. <p>Gary Sinise, as Ken Mattingly, grounded for an illness he'd never contracted, is at first embittered, but later becomes an enthusiastic fourth crew member as he unstoppably tests out rescue scenario after rescue scenario in the NASA simulators. <p>Bill Paxton plays an increasingly ill Fred Haise with such conviction that the viewer shudders with compassionate sympathy as Fred's flu and fever make him both less able to contribute and less willing to give in to his sudden illness. <p>Kathleen Quinlan, as Marilyn Lovell, and Ed Harris, as Gene Krantz, both turn in true-to-life performances, both of which capture the hopes and fears not only of Mrs. Lovell and Flight Controller Krantz, but of the rest of the hundreds of people involved in the rescue effort on the ground. <p>Without becoming "documentary" the film uses clips of actual news broadcasts to underscore its reality. What's particularly surprising is the low-tech state of the Apollo; a digital wristwatch of today has more computing power than the entire Apollo space vehicle. This movie is also a very watchable, almost completely accurate history. There are a few moments of Directorial license in the telling of the tale, but not many. The story doesn't need additional drama. I recommend Jim Lovell's excellent book LOST MOON (or APOLLO 13), to sort out the occasional changes.  <p>As it was, the technology of Apollo both failed and succeeded beyond reckoning. As spectacular an accomplishment as a moon landing is, it pales besides the importance of the human drama. <p>"I don't care what anything was designed to do," barks Krantz at one point, "I only want to know what it can do." It  seems that Jim Lovell's mother has the answer: "If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it."<p>APOLLO 13 is a great testament to the human spirit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Perhaps no single event in the history of spaceflight (save for the horrible "Challenger" tragedy) was as humbling as the near-catastrophic saga of Apollo 13. When an oxygen tank ruptured and exploded in the service module as the three-man crew of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were within 50,000 miles of a touchdown on the surface of the Moon, not only was the lunar landing scrubbed, but there was the strong possibility that neither they nor their ship would last long enough until re-entry.<p>Ron Howard's gripping 1995 epic shows us how the tragedy unfolded before an America that had become complacent, and also how some very sharp minds at Mission Control ensured that this most perilous spaceflight had a triumphant conclusion. Based on the book "Lost Moon" by Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, APOLLO 13 gets great performances from the three-man team of Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon, as well as first-rate support from Gary Sinise (as Ken Mattingly, the initial command module pilot who was beached because of a feared rubella infection that never materialized), Kathleen Quinlan (as Marilyn Lovell), and Ed Harris as flight director Gene Kranz who urges his Mission Control team on by telling them "Failure is not an option."<p>APOLLO 13 gives credit to both the crew and the entire Mission Control staff for having made the flight come to a successful conclusion when it could have ended in irreversable tragedy. Scientifically accurate special effects and James Horner's Copland-influenced music score are the icing on this, one of the best movies of the Nineties.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I have seen where others have had some problems with loading and the menu.  I didn't have any issues at all.  Perhaps the loading was a touch slower than normal but I have seen much worse.  This is a great movie that really stands up to the test of time; it has legs.  I prefer to focus on the quality of the remastered release rather than plot summary and my opinions on acting(which was great all around).<br /><br />The video transfer to Blu Ray on this release shows just what can be done if those in charge of the transfers put their minds to it.  The picture quality couldn't get any better with beautiful colors and deep details throughout the entire movie.  At no point did I see any grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.  The video is completely demo disc worthy for those who have the system that can show it.  I think that sometimes people complain about a disc simply because they are using cheapo blu ray players or who have sound systems that are simply not up to par.  For me, it was like seeing the movie on a brand new master shown for the very first time in the theater. Never the less, the video quality of the Blu Ray is a huge jump from my previously owned Standard Def DVD.<br /><br />The audio transfer, DTSHD 5.1 MA,  also shows what a good transfer and proper audio editing can achieve.  Hope you have a good sound system as it will certainly get a strong workout in many parts of film.  Your subwoofer will have its boundaries explored both during the early music score as well as in many areas of foley effects.  There is great use of the discreet channels with, when appropriate, marvelous directionality and panning around the front and rear sound stages.  Even small foley fx are clearly delineated to their correct audio channels.  All audio is precise, properly leveled and enveloping when you should be enveloped.<br /><br />While I haven't watched them all, there are some very interesting and historical extras and footage in addition to the Standard Def extra DVD for your tablet or computer and the regular commentary which accompanies most movies on disc.  Thank god there weren't a dozen previews of upcoming movies and advertisements that we see on so many discs taking up room on the DVD.<br /><br />For my part, this is one transfer to blu ray that makes having a hi end system worth having.  A great addition.<br />Hope this review is of help to you, and if so, please check the 'helpful' button so I know I am on the right path with these reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Ron Howard is right in his comfort zone in this dramatic retelling of an early NASA near-disaster, with a bevvy of strong characters to play with, volatile situations to work through and nostalgic heartstrings to tug at.

Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively.

Yes the astronauts do survive, although one died several years later but still the movie manages to be thrilling.<br /><br />Late 1960's, everyone was in awe as NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, blowing people's minds that we could do that and also satisfied that America was there first before Russia. However, that awe is starting to wane so when the Apollo 13 mission is announced, it's almost not even worth a mention.<br /><br />Early 70's, Apollo 13 takes off and everything's fine until an explosion cripples the shuttle seriously and the crew have to fight to stay alive while the ground crew fight to figure out a way to bring them home with very little power. Helping out the ground crew is Ken Mattingly, the former pilot who was ousted for Jack Swigert days before launch for medical reasons.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes in the film and probably a good indicator of what the film can do, is when the crew fires it's engines in hopes to pick up some speed and return home quicker. They take a simple idea of keeping the Earth in a window and make it quite exciting. And it's what the film does best: it takes the simplest things or the most well-known event and makes it suspenseful, almost making you forget they'll be fine.<br /><br />The human drama scenes are nicely played but it's the suspense scenes and the neat-as-hell space shots of the shuttle that look the most impressive but still the film is a good watch.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Everything about this movie is five-star, the direction, the cast, the story, all working together to produce the recreation of real-life high drama!<p>All the pieces of the story are tightly woven together to tell a riveting tale that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and takes them on an emotional roller coaster.<p>This is a story that had to be retold, and a movie that had to be made!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This movie is a little longer, but the time flies.

I wonder how audiences will react to it 50, 100, and 500 years from now?  It is a great story, and should continue to entertain audiences for generations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>just to think that this was baste on a true story.  the whole space ship was junk.  just to see the movie is something but to think how it was for the guys was another thing.  the way way they got back home was using the moons gravity to shoot to earth.  this is a movie for everybody to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I want to Like this movie A lot I really do but I can't stand Tom Hanks' Mug and Kevin Bacon's And Ron Howard has always left me with a bad taste,nonetheless despite my personal biases towards the cast and also the length of the movie,It has some enjoyable parts and attempts to tell the story,My favorite parts though are the Cameo Appearances of Corvettes throughout,I wish the 1969 Riverside Gold/w Black(made especially for the Previous Apollo Astronauts which is why it's not in this movie-427/390hp Corvette Coupe)would show up in this movie or any,The Apollo 12 "AstroVette"(not the concept car Astro),but that's a minute detail and hardly something that should make or break this movie,I just think it drags on and at times so technical despite being done in a way for most to understand,cut it down an hour and get to the point,I preferred the Movie The Right Stuff which Ironically is Longer than this melodrama of a flick..Would Have been nice to have someone like Clint Eastwood instead,but I digress I ask too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Houston, we have a problem.  Those five words sent chills through the NASA space center in April, 1970.  Apollo 13 had just lifted off on its voyage to the moon.  On board were Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Approximately halfway through the voyage, an explosin rocks the ship.  One of the oxygen tanks  burst as it was being stirred. The explosion crippled the ship and left the astronauts unable to land on the moon, and put their return to earth in jeopardy.  Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), and Kevin Bacon (Swigert) give riveting performances as the astronauts, and Ed Harris gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Gene Kranz.  Gary Sinise is also excellent as Ken Mattingly, originally scheduled to be on the misson, but was kept off due to  exposue to the measles.  However, Mattingly still played an important role in bringing the astronauts back to earth by working in the simulator to develop a plan to conserve the engegy aboard the L.E.M. so the computers could be powered up for re-entry.  Ron Howard does an excellent job with state of the art special effects which bring this apollo mission to life. Combining excellent acting, historical correctness, and edge-of-your-seat excitement, Apollo 13 is worthy of inclusion in any video collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>I enjoyed watching this film, showcasing the troubles of the apollo flight to the moon. i dont think i can add much more than what others have said, but will just say that it skillfully combines a great story with suspense and deep characterizations. <p>Overall, well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>"Houston, we have a problem." Apollo 13 was treated by America as just another "routine" space flight until Cpt. Lovell (Hanks) uttered those words. Crippled in space and running out of air the team at ground control race against time to bring them home. Ron Howard's love and care for this story shows in every frame. The acting by the supporting cast is superb! Ed Harris as Gene Kranz was a perfect casting call as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly. This is great movie and a tribute to American pride, know how and never say die attitude of the U.S. space program!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A wonderful transfer of a 15 year old movie!

Instead of the profound experience I expected of man going to the moon I got some jokes about the constellation Urine, some lines like, "Mommy, you're squishing me", and family scenes so schmaltzy they are practically unwatchable.<br /><br />  The film should be considered well done except for these family scenes which dumb it down so much.<br /><br />  To me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience.  I hope man one day returns to the moon and onto Mars instead of spending trillions of dollars on war.  I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, "Moonwalk One" that's shown sometimes on NASA TV.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is told in a textbook fashion that makes it all the more believable, chronicling the harrowing saga of three men trapped in space on their way to the moon, and the courage and heroism of the people back on Earth who struggle to bring them home. Everything from the storytelling and directing, to the special effects and score, make this movie an epic that rises to heights of fame because the story it tells is a true one, done equal justice by the filmmakers. I stood up and cheered for this movie, which is one of the most accurate historical accounts I've ever seen. <p>We're first introduced to each of the astronauts who will take the fateful trip: Jim Lovell, the project leader, and his partners Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise. Originally scheduled to take a later space flight, the crew of the Apollo 13 mission is unable to take on the task, which bumps our three astronauts to the mission. No one thinks too much of the mission, it being just another in a long line of space explorations, while Jim's wife, Marilyn, has her own superstitions about the number &quot;13.&quot; Another glitch hits once Mattingly is grounded with a supposed case of the measles, forcing Jim to place Jack Swagert into the pilot's seat. <p>Nonetheless, the launch goes off without a glitch, but things go from hopeful to disastrous once a powerful explosion cripples the spacecraft and leaves the astronauts stranded in space, without any apparent hope of return. But the astronauts and the ground crew refuse to believe that this is the end, and their efforts become a thrilling race against time as they devise a plan to bring them home, while their families pray for their safe return and the world watches in sheer wonderment at the events at hand. <p>The movie rides to success on many things, but the most important of the elements is the impeccable acting from a terrific cast. Jim Lovell is played by Tom Hanks, who is optimistic and a leader once the going gets tough. Together with Bill Paxton as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swagert, their scenes together are some of the best of the film, as they refuse to play their characters as one sole person. They must be strong and defiant of the possibility of death, while at the same time realize the danger of the situation they're in, and the three bring out these emotions wonderfully. <p>Supporting actors also add to the movie, the best of these being Ed Harris in his performance as Gene Kranz, the flight director stationed in Houston, Texas. His sternness and unrelenting attitude towards his crew and the new mission objectives prove to be effective, inspiring a sense of heroism in his character. Kathleen Quinlan portrays Marilyn Lovell, playing her as a woman who refuses to break down or entertain the notion that they astronauts will die. She comes off as strong and forceful, which is most evident in her refusal to allow a news crew into her house. Gary Sinise is Ken Mattingly, who proves he is intelligent and noteworthy as an actor by providing his minimum onscreen time with a performance that plays a big role in the story advancement. <p>While the acting is intrical, the setting for the majority of the movie is also very important, and the special effects do a tremendous job in bringing space to life. The technical effects for the spaceship are meticulous, while space itself is seen as a vast black expanse that requires no gooey aliens or monsters to be truly frightening. These effects are seamless, creating an ominous atmosphere that surrounds the characters as well as the audience with an overbearing sense of lifelessness and possible death. <p>The musical score also adds greatly to the overall effect the story has on us as an audience. Composer James Horner employs the vocals of Annie Lennox to bring a mournful and melancholy tone to slower scenes, while a vocal ensemble, strings and percussion combine to add intensity to faster sequences; most noteworthy is his piece for the spacecraft's re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. The music has a patriotic feel to it that keeps in sync with the movie's historical feel. <p>Director Ron Howard treats the story with a passion for accuracy, taking us on a journey into history to look at one of the most well-known events in our history. There is immense attention paid to the sequence of events as well as the obstacles that stand in their way. There is a nice flow to the story that never stops moving nor bends from its storytelling standards, which keeps the movie entertaining and enjoyable while never becoming boring or tiresome. <p>&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is definitely a modern epic which stands out as an impressive achievement in filmmaking. The story is a true one made believable by the efforts of the director and the cast, and made excellent by the seamless special effects and the musical score. For me, it's a feel-good adrenaline-pumping movie which tells a brilliant story of heroes and a race against time.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Recently my wife and I sat down to watch a series of documentaries focusing on the various NASA missions from the beginning stages of Project Mercury all the way through some of the space shuttle missions. For people who aren't entirely familiar or were just somewhat familiar on the events, but were maybe lacking some of the details, these documentaries that aired on the Discovery Channel were most informative. As a result, the experience left my wife and I wanting to watch some space related movies, and first on our list was the 1995 box office hit "Apollo 13" from director Ron Howard ("Ransom"), starring Tom Hanks ("Forrest Gump"), Ed Harris ("National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets"), and Kevin Bacon ("Death Sentence").<br /><br />"Apollo 13" chronicles the fateful mission that has been dubbed the "successful failure" by NASA, which had all of America holding its collective breath as it wondered if the mission would end in disaster or would it become one of our finest hours. When the space craft transporting Astronauts, Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon), and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), to the moon suffers a catastrophic accident, the mission and the lives of the Astronauts are instantly changed. Now, the once moon-bound ship is left severely crippled, and what began as a seemingly routine mission to the moon has now become a rescue mission as the Houston-based members of NASA's Mission Control are racing against time and almost impossible odds to return these three men safely to Earth.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard had established himself as a fairly solid director in the early 90's with hits such as "Backdraft" and "Far and Away" under his belt, but it wasn't until the release of "Apollo 13" that he was able to firmly cement himself as a much sought after, critically-acclaimed director. Relying on state-of-the-art (as of 1995) special effects and film tricks and techniques to simulate weightlessness, along with an incredibly emotional and compelling story written by William Broyles, Jr. ("Flags of Our Fathers") and Al Reinert, based on the book written by Astronaut Jim Lovell and co-writer Jeffrey Kluger; Ron Howard has crafted one of the best and completely realistic movies I have ever seen to focus on one of NASA's missions in space.<br /><br />The cast of "Apollo 13" was an assortment of top-notch talent, such as; Tom Hanks, who made this film on the heels of his smash hit "Forrest Gump", Kevin Bacon ("Death Sentence"), Gary Sinise (who had co-starred alongside Hanks in "Forrest Gump"), Kathleen Quinlan ("Breakdown"), Bill Paxton ("Tombstone"), and Ed Harris. Each member of the cast portrayed these real life Astronauts, their wives, or the people in Mission Control perfectly, easily handling each emotional high and low throughout this inspiring story of survival.<br /><br />The well-written screenplay, expert direction, and extremely talented cast brought to life not only this harrowing journey in space, but also gave audiences a glimpse into what NASA life is like for the Astronauts and the loved ones left behind on Earth awaiting their safe return. Thanks to the painstaking length to which Ron Howard and company went to in order to make this a movie that is so incredibly realistic on every level, "Apollo 13" serves as a fitting tribute to the brave men and women that endured the situation by overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, and also to the ingenuity and will power of man to set their sights on a goal and to never give up until it was achieved.<br /><br />"Apollo 13" is rated PG for language and peril.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>There were a few "hollywood" inaccuracies that bothered me. For example, it was Meniere's disease, not an ear infection that plagued Al Shepard. Furthermore, it wasn't Menieres that kept him off Apollo 13. It was an administrative decision based on the need to give him and his rookie crew more time to train.<br /><br />Other than those minor nitpicks, I REALLY enjoyed this film. I didn't obsess over the missed details, mind you. This is, after all, a hollywood adaptation of Jim Lovell's recounting. Facts are going to be skewed a bit here and there. As entertainment value goes, it was wonderful! Suspenseful, emotional and, all-in-all, pretty close to the reality of the situation.<br /><br />As historical movies go, it actually wasn't too bad on accuracy. And what it lacked in accuracy, it more than made up for in sheer entertainment value.<br /><br />Jim Lovell's cameo in the end was the icing on the cake.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Apollo 13, Ron Howard's 1995 recreation of the star-crossed April 1970 manned mission to the moon, is a riveting and stirring film about courage and ingenuity in the face of great peril.<p>Starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan, Xander Berkeley and Ed Harris, Apollo 13 begins with a flashback sequence set in January of 1967, when the three crew members of Apollo 1 died in a tragic launch pad accident.  As Walter Cronkite does a voiceover, there is a quick segue to Houston July 1969, where veteran astronaut Jim Lovell (Hanks) is throwing a moon-landing party to watch Neil Armstrong be the first man on the moon. (According to the director's commentary, this scene was written and shot to introduce the major characters of the drama and to give the viewer some idea of what life was like in the astronaut community during  NASA's Apollo heyday.)  <p>After a tender moment with his wife Marilyn (Quinlan) and a scene at Cape Kennedy in which Lovell explains to a skeptical politician the necessity of continuing the manned moon landings at least up to Apollo 14 (a mission he is slated to command), fate intervenes.  Al Shepard, the commander of Apollo 13, is grounded when an ear infection flares up, and Lovell and his crew, lunar module pilot Fred Haise (Paxton) and command module pilot Ken Mattingly (Sinise) are moved "up the slot" to take over.<p>For Marilyn, the news is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, she's aware that this will be her husband's final mission in space, so she's proud and supportive.  On the other hand, she has a bad feeling about this flight, and her anxiety comes to the fore in this exchange:<p>MARILYN:  Thirteen.  Why does it have to be Thirteen?<br />LOVELL: Because it comes after Twelve, hon.<p>Lovell might have been nonchalant about the mission's "unlucky" number, but Apollo 13 was dogged by bad luck even before it lifted off the pad at 1313 hours on April 10, 1970.  A few days before liftoff, command module pilot Mattingly was grounded when another astronaut came down with the measles (he'd never been exposed, so ground controllers were afraid he'd get sick in space).  Lovell was forced to choose between flying with a replacement, Jack Swigert (Bacon) or holding out for Mattingly and being "bumped" off the flight altogether.<p>There were other little omens of ill luck involving Lovell's Corvette and Marilyn's wedding ring; critics later lambasted Howard for coming up with such "hokey" scenes, but according to Jim and Marilyn Lovell in their separate audio track, these events actually did occur.<p>Despite some minor errors in the details and a few things done intentionally for dramatic license, the depiction of an Apollo moon shot is about as accurate as a movie made for entertainment can be.  Hanks and Quinlan even stayed with the Lovell's to capture their characters' qualities and motivations.  Bacon and Paxton are wonderful as Lovell's two crewmates, and Ed Harris portrays Flight Director Gene Krantz as a logical and determined engineer/administrator.  Watching him go from grim realization that the mission has been jeopardized by an explosion ("We just lost the moon.") to firm decisiveness ("We've never lost an American in spaceflight and we sure aren't going to lose one on my watch.  Failure is not an option.), one sees that the moon landings depended as much on the ground controllers and engineers in Houston as they did on the astronauts in the spacecraft.<p>With a stirring score by James Horner and top notch special effects, Apollo 13 is one of director Howard's finest offerings.  It is fast paced, incredibly well-written and acted, and it is a fine tribute to the men and women who worked for a decade to get us to the moon and back.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>This is the greatest SPACE movie of all time, without any reasonable doubt. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan ALL give superb performances. I really like the way they were able to make an old story exciting without taking much dramatic license. This movie actually makes you FEEL as if you're with Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert in their desperate battle to stay alive in their crippled space craft 200,000 miles from safety, or with Lovell's wife and family as they sit by and hope for the best, or with Gene Kranz and other mission control ground crew members struggle to bring them home. This is still Ron Howard's best film as a director. Anyone who wishes to see an historical adventure movie should look no further than APOLLO 13. It'll make you feel great, trust me! Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>At some point in the publicity surrounding the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot; I had occasion to hear the real Jim Lovell say the word's &quot;Houston we have a problem&quot; that signaled to NASA that a routine mission to the moon had become a life and death situation.  If you did not know what Lovell was saying I doubt that you would be able to tell any difference in his tone from anything else he said during the mission.  With that baseline in my mind every time I have watched &quot;Apollo 13&quot; since then I have been aware that Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon as astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are a lot more emotional then than their real world counterparts.  However, that does not take away from my enjoyment of this film.<p>When I was in the first grade when my father was stationed in Orlando, Florida, we would go outside and watch the Mercury missions take off from Cape Canaveral.  We were in Japan when Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, an event that we were able to watch on Japanese TV.  So the idea that going to the moon was &quot;routine&quot; is inherently offensive and I easily picture a universe in which Fate cripples Apollo 13 as reminder to humanity not to take sending men to the moon in a small capsule for granted.  <p>The best part of Ron Howard's film takes place on earth as the NASA team headed by Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) has to deal with the disaster and the potential of losing the crew.  When one of the adminsitrators declares that this could be the worst disaster NASA has ever faced, Kranz insists, &quot;With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.&quot;  Indeed, watching NASA literally true to figure out how to get a square peg into a round hole is the most captivating part.  After the explosion cripples Apollo 13 the three astronauts spend most of their time waiting in their freezing lunar module for the few times when they can actually do something while former crew member Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), pulled from the mission because he was exposed to measles, tries to figure out how to turn on the capsule's power without using too many amps (Stop and think about how weird that is to have as a tense situation).<p>The space shuttle disasters with &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; are a subtext for this movie because those two times there was nothing NASA could do.  By the time they knew there was a problem, the astronauts were gone.  This time, there is things that can be done, and despite all the rocket scientists running around the place, it is good old fashion American problem solving that matters here.  As Kranz says at one point, &quot;I don't care about what anything was DESIGNED to do, I care about what it CAN do,&quot; and there is a sense in which NASA jury rigs a final solution.<p>Kathleen Quinlan plays Marilyn Lovell, the wife who has to suffer while her husband's mission is ignored (the networks will not show the crew's television broadcast) and then as the entire word waits to see if he and his crewmates are going to die in space.  However, the bit role I like is Jean Speegle Howard as Blanch Lovell, Jim's mom.  Blanch is in a retirement home and is not always clear on what is going on; when Marilyn assigned Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to distract her from the worst predictions of disaster on television as Apollo 13 heads back to earth she wonders if they work with her son.  But when Marilyn and the kids first tell her about what is happening with the mission and she notices her granddaughter is scared, she tells her: &quot;Don't you worry. If they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.&quot;<p>Much was made about what the cast and crew went through to make &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; during zero-G dives in an aircraft containing a capsule set to film the weightlessness scenes.  But as much as the film and the story about technology, both really come down to the human beings.  Harris and Quinlan were both nominated for their supporting roles and the film was up for Best Picture, but was one of those rare nominees that directed itself (i.e., Howard was not nominated) and won Oscars for Film Editing and Sound.  If you watch &quot;From the Earth to the Moon,&quot; produced by Hanks, you will find the episode of Apollo 13 takes a different tack from both this movie and the rest of that series that is rather interesting as well.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>On April 13th, 1970, Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert, are sent to the moon for a lunar landing to gather moon rocks for scientific study. The race for the moon is over, and America isn't even interested anymore in `routine' flights to the moon anymore. That is until reports come in that there is major trouble going on on the spacecraft. As the pilots are on their way to the moon, an explosion happens somewhere inside their ship. Major problem after major problem begins to happen. The routine mission to the moon has just become an intellectual fight for survival... and now a mission to get home. 250 thousand miles in space inside a ship that feels like the size of two phone booths, Jim, Fred, and Jack use their brains and their guts to fly to the dark side of the moon to slingshot themselves hopefully back to earth. Power is diminishing, Carbon Dioxide is building, engines are failing, and the freezing cold is piercing. The true story of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Never gets old. No matter how many times I see this movie, it just never gets old. I've probably seen it at least 5 times now and I'm still glued to my seat. How is this a real story? Honestly it's so miraculous and incredible the things that happened and the things that were done to get these guys home that it seems fake. But it's not. It's crazy to think how close to death these guys were in such a foreign area such as space. Even the guys in Houston were having a hard time believing that so much was going wrong at one time. At one time the crew had to sit in the lunar lander to fly home. The thing about that is that most of the walls are just a millimeter thick (not even that much). So they had to watch where they stretched out so they didn't puncture a whole in the wall and suck themselves out.<br /><br />Ron Howard's direction of the movie was incredible. Not once did I get bored. Everything was done just right. From the story, to the characters, the little jokes here and there, to the action, to the suspense. It's got it all. And with a cast that consists of Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), Kevin Bacon (Swigert), Gary Sinise (Ken Mattingly), and Ed Harris (Gene Kranz), how could you really go wrong? Every performance was littered with emotion for the story or for who they were playing. It seemed like everyone wanted to do their best to make this movie memorable for us as the viewer, and more importantly for the people who they portrayed and the story that was being told.<br /><br />After the movie was over this time, I was still caught up in the story so I immediately pushed play on The Making of Apollo 13. I HIGHLY recommend watching this. There was a LOT of real footage used in this documentary. From Nixon's speech to seeing the actual ship that exploded float off to space while we get to see the actual damage. Incredible. Also it's really neat to see how spot on the movie was to the actual event that happened. While the doc is going on, parts of the movie would happen, and then we'd see or hear the actual events happen (or vice versa...I can't remember). It was really cool to hear "Houston we have a problem" from Lovell himself. And while they do show a lot of actual events, they also show some really funny stuff too. Watching how they did the floating in space parts was really cool. I've known about airplane flights that take you up and then drop real fast to give you the zero gravity feel. I actually looked into doing last year but it's a tad expensive (like a thousand bucks...eesh). I just didn't really think they would do it. But they did. A lot of the shots are actually in an airplane doing this and the actors all did it. It was funny to watch them floating around and then hit the bottom of the plane when the plane would come up from the dive.<br /><br />In the end, I highly recommend this movie for anyone. Incredible movie on an incredible true event in America's history.<br /><br />P.S. What happened to Kevin Bacon? Like he looks like a normal guy in this movie, but man he's starting to look a lot like Skeletor in more of his recent movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This movie is a dramatized version of the real life near-tragedy of Apollo 13.<br /><br />Apollo 13 was the third mission to land men on the Moon and the Apollo program's first aborted mission.  An explosion in one of the oxygen tanks crippled the spacecraft during flight.  The Lunar Module (used only to land on the Moon) was used to provide emergency propulsion and life support after the loss of the service module system.  The crew was forced to just orbit the Moon and return to Earth.<br /><br />Here are the facts of the Apollo 13 (AS-508) mission:<br /><br />(1) Lunar Module: Aquarius<br />(2) Command and Service Module: Odyssey<br />(3) Crew: Commander Jim Lovell, Command Module pilot Jack Swigert**, Lunar Module pilot: Fred Haise<br />(4) Launch: April 11, 1970<br />(5) Landing site: near Fra Mauro (one of the Moon's craters)<br />(6) Returned to Earth: April 17, 1970<br /><br />** The initial pilot Tom Mattingly was removed 72 hours prior to launch due to presumed exposure to German measles.  (He later flew on Apollo 16.)<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has taken these bare facts (and the book "Lost Moon" co-authored by Jim Lovell who served as technical consultant on this movie) and made an unforgettable adventure, drama, and history movie using state-of-the-art special effects and ingenious movie-making techniques.<br /><br />There are actually three stories in this movie:<br /><br />(1) The astronauts struggle to stay alive<br />(2) The controlled chaos at NASA who try to solve the numerous problems caused by the explosion<br />(3) The trauma faced by the astronaut's families<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Tom Hanks as Lovell and Ed Harris as Mission Control Director Gene Kranz give especially good performances.  Also look for the fine performance of Gary Sinise as bumped astronaut Ken Mattingly.  Ron Howard does not make the mistake of letting the special effects upstage these terrific performances.  (Ron Howard's real-life mother also has a role in this movie.)<br /><br />Another highlight of this movie is the actual historical news footage that was used.  Look for people like Neil Armstrong (the first person to set foot on the Moon in July, 1969) as well as Jim and Marilyn Lovell among this footage.<br /><br />The movie ends with Hanks as Lovell summarizing the "seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13" and he ends his summary with this statement:<br /><br />"I look up at the Moon and wonder when we will be going back and who will that be?"<br /><br />Finally, the anniversary edition DVD is flawless with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.  The most notable extra is that the entire movie is also presented in IMAX.<br /><br />In conclusion, be sure to see this incredible movie and see why it was nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture!!<br /><br />(1995;  2 hr 20 min;  widescreen;  2 discs)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I will always remember those tense three days in April 1970 when the Apollo 13 astronauts seemed suspended in space, and this was well before the days of 24-hour coverage by CNN and Fox. For those who have yet to purchase this movie on DVD, the tenth anniversary two-disc set is a must-have for any adventure film-lover, especially for those like myself who were obsessed with the nation's space program in the 1960's and early 70's. Ron Howard, the director, came of age with this thrilling recreation of the aborted Apollo 13 mission, as defining a moment in NASA's history as the tragic Challenger explosion. The 1995 movie was a faithful depiction of what went wrong with the flight and how the mission changed dramatically to one of saving the three astronauts from being marooned in space forever. One would think that knowing the ending would rob the viewer of the suspense factor, but Howard does an amazing job in making the story feel fresh by guiding us through the heroic acts both in the capsule and at NASA's Mission Control in vividly realistic detail. He also evokes the atmosphere back then with emotional and visual accuracy, showing how anti-climactic the mission was perceived in light of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon just the year prior. A rupture in the oxygen tank changed things completely as the movie illustrates a desperate attempt at survival with computer systems turned off, the capsule moving toward freezing temperatures and the three men relying on their gut instincts to maneuver the capsule home.<br /><br />What I appreciate most about the movie is that Howard does not derail the basic story with unnecessary subplots or flourishes of melodrama. He realizes the real story is more than enough to engage the viewer and that the attention to detail, often technical in nature, is not off-putting.  Howard even creates blood-pumping suspense out of the ground effort to jerry-build a scrubber to clean carbon dioxide from the capsule's air supply.  This kind of film is all in the details, even the more predictable home scenes where family members try to confront their increasing sense of fear. The movie has a solid testosterone-heavy cast - Tom Hanks stalwart as always as Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell; Bill Paxton as Fred Haise; Kevin Bacon as last-minute substitute Jack Swigert; Ed Harris as determined flight director Gene Kranz; Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly; and bravely leading the homefront is Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Marilyn. Even though the move is full of familiar suspense elements and the characters' interactions are often just officious, there is hardly a wasted dramatic moment in the entire film, pretty impressive given its 140-minute running time. This is a superbly done real-life adventure film and docudrama and aside from Philip Kaufman's 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff", probably the best movie about the space program.<br /><br />The smoothly edited, 116-minute IMAX version (produced in 2002) is on the second disc, and the widescreen orientation coupled with the enhanced sound makes for great viewing as well. There are three documentaries included spread across both discs: the comprehensive making-of feature, "Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13 - The Making of Apollo 13", which has interviews with Howard and the cast, as well as insight into how the space shots were created; "Conquering Space: The Moon and Beyond", a 48-minute general overview of the race to the Moon and the exploration of Mars, produced mainly for the uninitiated; and a twelve-minute NBC Dateline feature called "Lucky 13: The Astronauts' Story", which contains interviews with the astronauts and members of Mission Control for the Apollo 13 mission. There are two alternative commentary tracks, the first with Howard who is extremely knowledgeable and highly infectious in his descriptions of the shoot, the other with Jim and Marilyn Lovell providing valuable insight as to how it really felt as the events were unfolding. A truly excellent package.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Ron Howard's flag-waving, spirit-boosting APOLLO 13 is a very well done and convincing movie.  Relying on the intensity of the real life dangers, Howard eschews overwhelming special effects or inappropriate sidebars.<br /><br />It's interesting to remember that in 1970, we had just come off of landing a man on the moon, so what could possibly overshadow that?  Indeed, in 1970, space travel was so mundane or 'unexciting' that when the astronauts gave a live broadcast from their capsule, the networks did not even run it; they said it wasn't dramatic enough.  However, when the crew and program became jeopardized, television couldn't get enough of it.  A prime example of the desensitized, ratings-craved television world.<br /><br />The performances are excellent throughout:  Tom Hanks gives his usual stalwart performance as Jim Lovell--the thing about Hanks is he makes his characters believable and displays a wide range of emotions, sometimes with just the look on his face:  Bill Paxton calms down a bit to play Haise, the more "cowboy" astronaut; and Kevin Bacon is good as the last minute addition to the crew when Gary Sinise is ousted because he was exposed to measles by one of the backup crew.  Sinise's disappointment is captured in his understated performance.  Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director, a man who keeps his cool and faith in the catastrophic conditions.  Kathleen Quinlan does well as Marilyn Lovell, Hanks' on screen wife, who bravely tries to get her family through the crisis.<br /><br />An intelligent script, special effects and Howard's assured direction combine to give us a heart pounding realistic view of the endangered space program.</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Almost nine years after have watched the movie for the first time and nearly 34 years since the events it inspired took place, the movie "Apollo 13" seems even more captivating.  The story of Apollo 13, for any who have followed the space program and especially for those who witnessed it, is as gripping a story as has ever been told throughout American history.  It is fraught with drama, intrigue, plot twists, and thrilling danger.  What's more, it all really happened!  In April of 1970, the American public was already viewing the amazing accomplishment of landing on the Moon as pass&eacute; and could not have cared less about the Apollo 13 mission.  Interest was so apathetic that the astronaut broadcast as the ship was about to enter lunar orbit was not even carried on television.  The fickle public certainly had its interest piqued when, not long after the unwatched broadcast, a simple house-cleaning maneuver (stirring the oxygen tanks) exposed a deadly flaw that led to a tremendous explosion.  That explosion sent Apollo 13 flying out of control, ended any hopes of landing on the Moon, and left fate of the three astronauts (Commander Jim Lovell, LM pilot Fred Haise, and Command Module pilot Jack Swigert) very much in doubt.  The heroic efforts put forth by the members of Mission Control, as well as the astronauts themselves, the bring Apollo 13 safely back to Earth is one of the greatest stories ever told.<br /><br />Acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw this and, inspired by Lovell's own personal account of that mission crafted one of the truly great historical films to ever hit the screen.  "Apollo 13" is a true cinematic achievement.  It re-ignites the imagination and wonder that the space program held in the 1960's and early 1970's.  Using cutting-edge special effects in service of the story (as opposed to in place of it), Howard is able to give audiences a true up close view of the entire Apollo mission.  Using archive footage to craft the special effects scenes, the director is able to make launch seem lifelike, as if the viewer is standing atop the tower watching the rocket about to lift off.  The scenes in space are well crafted and extraordinarily realistic.  When the astronauts are forced to shutdown much of the lunar module, and all of the command module, to conserve power, the abject cold and forlornness that these men were forced to endure is felt by the audience.  The true mark of this film's greatness is found in the fact that, even though we know from history that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the final moments during re-entry, as played out in the movie, are still incredibly gripping and tense.  Then, the emotional release that comes knowing they made it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical, hard-hearted viewer will get choked with emotion.<br /><br />The storytelling and effects of "Apollo 13" are great, but the film would likely have still fallen short if not for the tremendous cast hired to perform these roles.  Tom Hanks is solid as the unflappable Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who seems to always find a way into every blockbuster) is good as the trusted, but untested rookie Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon gives an accurate portrayal of last minute replacement Jack Swigert.  Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, the astronaut Swigert replaced due to fears of a measles infection, with appropriate melancholy.  The other truly standout performance is turned in by Ed Harris, who plays the no-nonsense rock of a flight director, Gene Kranz.  Harris truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him to have won the award over eventually Supporting Actor winner, Kevin Spacey.  "Apollo 13", itself, was a strong contender for Best Picture honors, only losing out to the worthy "Braveheart".  The one baffling question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the Best Director nominations (he would have to wait 7 more years before receiving his due for "A Beautiful Mind").<br /><br />"Apollo 13" is not only a great thriller; it is also a telling history lesson.  It enables us to remember those wondrous days of the quest to reach the Moon, as well as the drama of that imperiled flight.  These days, it is disheartening to realize how the space program has stagnated since those heady days.  "Apollo 13" proves, beyond a doubt, that we still have the men with the will, knowledge, and courage to take this space exploration to places beyond imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>Am I the only person who believes that Ron Howard was ROBBED out of not just an Academy Award nomination for this movie, but he should have WON IT??  Sure 'Braveheart' was good, but how often did Mel Gibson have to film in zero-g for 20 seconds-at-a-time? I think pulling that off alone was an amazing feat worth recognition...but the Academy felt that Ron apparently hadn't quite EARNED it--YET.  How unfortunate.<p>This movie inspired me like no film I have ever seen has.  I went out and purchased a copy of 'Lost Moon' (the novel on which the movie was based by Jim Lovell) and immediately was lost within the pages of this truly amazing adventure.  If you think that these three astronauts nearly bought the farm in only as many times as was described in the movie, think again.  They had several other life-threatening situations just as frightening as any put in the movie, but due to the constraints that filming a movie can cause, they were only able to include just a FEW of the horrific moments that marked one of the most dramatic situations that has ever occurred in space.<p>The astronauts and NASA were very aware that there would be no way to send a rescue to a failing spaceship almost 200,000 miles from earth...HOW would they be saved?  That is what makes this an incredible adventure of the highest order.  What brought these men home was a marriage of everyone who knew anything about the Apollo Missions working together in one of the most amazing cooperative units in recorded history.  Sure, there have been many other instances where cooperation has worked to help build or make something great, but the enormous difference here is that these folks had to work together F-A-S-T.  Time was of the essence, and failure was too frightening to think about, in fact as Mission Leader Gene Kranz was famous for saying: 'Failure Is NOT an option!'  Nobody was more thankful for the successful efforts of this impressive group than Jim Lovell and his companions.  Cinematically this movie is absolutely stunning, with special effects that are incredibly realistic without going overboard--effects so good that during the screening of the movie Gene Kranz asked where Ron Howard had gone to restore the footage of the launch of the giant Saturn rocket that was featured only to be totally surprised when he was informed that it had all been manufactured in a studio.  You KNOW its good when you can fool the Launch Director...<p>I STILL view the landing on the moon as the single greatest achievment of the past century, and although today it seems totally foreign to send living humans to a gigantic rock a quarter-million miles from earth, I for one would welcome a return to the moon with open arms.  It would completely re-energize NASA and the entire country (if not the world), and who knows?  It might end up being a first step towards sending a probe with humans to Mars...?  <p>Aside from the truly fantastic film this movie is, all of the extras that come with the DVD version are ALL so very worth passing up the VHS version entirely.  Commentary from Jim Lovell himself, comparison of the movie footage with actual footage from the ill-fated flight of Apollo 13--if you are looking for a reason to purchase a DVD player, I submit that this movie allows you THE PERFECT excuse to grab one today.  My absolute HIGHEST recommendation.  (grab a copy of Apollo 13 the book, too--truly inspiring)</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Talk about rolling snake eyes.  To begin with, your mission is numbered &quot;thirteen.&quot;  Then the pilot you've trained with is grounded prior to lift-off because he's allegedly been exposed to the measles; he's replaced by a young buck still wet behind the ears.  Once you're within spitting distance of the surface of the Moon an oxygen tank explodes.  Obviously, it takes oxygen to breathe, so now what?  Shut down everything in the command module, of course, shiver in the lunar module, and hope the gravitational tug from the Moon will slingshot you back home.<p>And I thought I had my bad days.<p>Yet the problems mentioned above merely scratch the surface of the true trials and tribulations of APOLLO 13.  Director Ron Howard recreates this gripping, compelling story, right down to beehive hairdo's and computers the size of Mt. Rushmore.  The drama, the sense of urgency--on the part of the astronauts, and the NASA staff in Houston frantically trying to save them--is so powerful and vivid I felt I was watching the actual event itself.  To magically weave the viewer into the story is a crowning achievement for any filmmaker, and here, Howard succeeds like a wizard waving a wand.<p>Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise headline a stellar cast in a grim race-against-time that had the entire world transfixed in April of 1970.  I remember being glued to the TV watching Walter Cronkite broadcast around the clock to give us the latest developments of the Apollo 13 story; I remember the relief and joy I felt when that banged-up capsule was retrieved from the ocean.  To relive the triumph--and near-tragedy--of this event is an awesome experience, and APOLLO 13 is awesome, indeed.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Are you old enough to remember the space race and the first time an American set foot on the Moon? The Apollo 11 crew achieved that feat in July, 1969 and were followed by Apollo 12 in November, 1969. Apollo 13 attempted the trip in 1970, but an accident early in the mission prevented the landing. Instead, the mission became one of survival. Would the three astronauts make it back to Earth?<br /><br />Jim Lovell (Hanks), Fred Haise (Paxton) and Ken Mattingly (Sinise) were set to make the trip, but Mattingly was replaced by Jack Swigert (Bacon), because it was feared that Mattingly might develop the measles on the trip. Gene Kranz (Harris) was in charge of Mission Control on the ground.<br /><br />I remember the broadcasts of the Apollo 11 trip, but the American public were not particularly interested in seeing live footage by the time the Apollo 13 mission took place. We see the crew filming each other for TV, but they don't know that the pictures aren't being shown live. That all changed the moment the accident occurred. Instead of being a boring event, lives were suddenly at stake. TV crews scrambled to cover the unfolding events.<br /><br />Hanks, Harris, Paxton, Sinise and Bacon are at their best in Apollo 13. We see the importance of trusting in the overall ability of the team, both in space and back in Houston. Director Ron Howard does a good job of showing how events aboard the ship affected things on the ground. The accident gave both teams several problems to overcome and it wouldn't have happened if either team had failed to contribute.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine three men sitting in a confined space holding our attention for over two hours, but that's exactly what happens. You may not know how the original events unfolded, but the tension builds effectively even if you know how the story will end.<br /><br />The overall look of the movie feels authentic. Shots of space are particularly effective. It's almost impossible to listen to the sound of the launch without feeling moved in some way.<br /><br />The movie is structured in such a way that we feel that the three astronauts have something to lose other than their own lives. The first 30 minutes show Lovell interacting with his wife, Marylin (Kathleen Quinlan), and their children. We also see other crew members and it gives us a glimpse of their personalities. This segment is so effective and adds a lot to the remainder of the movie. Howard makes us feel as though we are back in 1970 and that we are part of Lovell's family or immediate friends.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release isn't bad. Picture quality is adequate and the sound, particularly during the launch, is up to the task. I'm glad I upgraded.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Ron Howard<br /><br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade.<br /><br />Running Time:  140 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG for language and emotional intensity.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard's emotionally draining "Apollo 13" surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Captain James Lovell (Tom Hanks), John L Swigert (Bill Paxton) and Fred Haise (Kevin Bacon) to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.  Using computer graphics, the infamous "Vomit Comet", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft. The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket. Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness. There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission. The movie is a "behind-the-scenes" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.<br /><br />Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.  Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.  Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.  Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz and was robbed of a Best-Supporting Actor Oscar.  Although some of his lines of dialogue are very "all American", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.  Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.  Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from. Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension. No one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for "Apollo 13" because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals in front of the camera rather than the guy behind it.  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end. The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  A true Hollywood feel-good production and one of the better films of the year.</p></br></body></html>

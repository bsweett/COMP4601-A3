First, this is not the kind of movie that anyone thought would win Oscar's in the first place.  Second, people who REALLY want to see it will do so regardless of what anyone says and third, I had never seen the first two.<br /><br />However, I do feel it's worth noting that there were fits of surprising competence in the film, which plays like THE ROAD WARRIOR meets...well...a video game.  Despite the utter unoriginality of the story, it managed to be a fitfully entertaining, action packed, gore fest.<br /><br />I'll admit right now that I never totally understood the powers or backstory of Milla Jovovich's lead character.  Is she a human or a robot of some sort?  A clone?  She appears to have psychic (psionic) powers...but they were undefined for the uninitiated.  I certainly wouldn't have objected to a more thorough recap of past events then we're given...but I certainly had no trouble understanding that except for a few isolated pockets, zombies have taken over the world.  Evil quasi-government/industrial agencies are trying to affect a cure...but it's tough to tell what their motives are.  It's hard to believe they expect to make a PROFIT by marketing a cure...since there isn't an economy in place any more...yet they sure don't seem to be doing their research to benefit anyone but themselves.<br /><br />Jovovich's striking-looking lead character is reintroduced to the viewer as a loner, riding a motorcycle across an endless desert.  She stops at a ruined radio station, because she's picked up an SOS broadcast.  Apparently, she wants to help, but it turns out to have been a trap.  She's captured by a group that we so often see in these kinds of movies...the bikers who've gone bad.  They capture her and are prepared to feed her to a pack of zombie dogs...for no reason other than their own amusement.  The scene plays out like a sequence in a video game...but Jovovich's escape is well staged and sufficient to get the blood pumping.  The movie has gore, but doesn't dwell on it.  (I'm not saying it's for little kids...but I've sure seen worse, too.)<br /><br />Later, Jovovich meets ups with a rag-tag group of survivors, led by Oded Fehr and Ali Larter, looking pretty tough herself in her khakis.  This group could be the same folks Mel Gibson let to "the promised land" in ROAD WARRIOR...they've got reinforced buses and heck, even a gasoline tanker!  Too bad that gas has become nearly impossible to find.  The realize that they will have to brave a "big city" because they've drained all the gas in the small towns.  But big cities are where the zombies have congregated the most, naturally, so we anticipate a bloody showdown.<br />And the film delivers one.  They arrive in Las Vegas and immediately unleash hundreds of the hungry creatures.  Lots of shooting, lots of creative ways of killing zombies, lots of sad moments as one beloved character after another falls under a swarm of the flesh-eaters.  There is no originality to the idea...but again, it is staged with a sincerity and a visceral quality that make it work.  (An earlier scene, involving an attack by a flock of infected ravens shows more originality, and also works well.)<br /><br />So the action is good.  The "quiet" scenes of dialogue are pretty hokey...but the actor's play them about as well as anyone could.  The movie doesn't "wink" at the audience at any time, nor does it have any "in-jokes."  It is a straightforward videogame brought to life.<br />The final scenes, involving a confrontation between Jovovich and a diabolical doctor...are perfunctory and not as fun as the scenes earlier in the film.  If we had more invested in this character, I think it might be different, but just because she's now starred in three films doesn't exactly make her the fleshed out person that, say, Hellboy has become.<br />Jovovich is well suited to the role.  She looks great in her silly costume.  And even though a few of her stunts clearly benefit from the aid of wires...she mostly looks like she could be doing what she does without help.  Larter matches her well, and Fehr (THE MUMMY RETURNS) is always a striking figure.<br /><br />The movie is far from the embarrassment I thought it would be.  While I can't simply heartily recommend it...I do think if you're looking for some good, "clean" zombie killing action...you could do worse!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This series has reached mediocre. Maybe there will be a fourth to pull it out of the rut it is headed for now. The acting, effects, and music are good. The story on the other hand lacked something to give it that edginess the first two movies had. Cloning our hero or making the big bad Umbrella guy a monster didn't seem surprising. A couple good scenes including one that you will say looked like it came right out of "The Birds" will make you perk up and say, now that was cool. In fact had they pursued more wildlife gone bad it probably would have made a better overall movie. I didn't mind that it borrowed from "Road Warrior", "The Birds", and "Coma", it just needed a better overall theme. That and it upset me they killed off two characters from the last movie that I thought should have survived this nightmare. Good quality DVD and fair replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>The Resident Evil games, developed by Capcom, is probably my favorite franchise of the "survivor horror" genre since they were actually fun to play whereas series like Silent Hill or Fatal Frame were just simply fun to watch someone else play. The Resident Evil films, largely overseen by Paul W.S Anderson, are probably the only real decent videogame adaptations since you can enjoy them with your brain turned off whereas ones like Doom or Dead or Alive don't make the movie any better. The third film, Extinction, is just as polarizing as the 2 before it as a lot of it doesn't feel like the games yet it mentions stuff from it yet it's somehow enjoyable. Why that is, I'll never know.<br /><br />Despite the destruction via nuclear missile of Raccoon City, the T-Virus escaped and infected the rest of America and the rest of the world, leaving many turned into zombies and the lands barren wastelands. Alice, on the run since the Umbrella Corporation can track her whereabouts via satellite, is roaming the lands trying to help those in need and she comes across Claire Redfield and Carlos Olivera from Apocalypse, travelling via convoys for supplies, ammunition and a haven. But Umbrella and one of its scientists, Dr. Isaacs, wants to contain the virus and the only way to do that is by killing Alice and using for a vaccine. With hopes of an isolated haven, Alice and the others try to stay alive in the harsh heat and hunted by more deadlier enemies.<br /><br />Let's face it: the films tonally just never meshed with the games. Whereas the game franchise was built on eerie, creepy atmospheres, the films have heavy metal music, over-editing and big action scenes. But like when you were a kid and you got those cookies in the shapes of your favorite characters, it doesn't really matter what they are as long as they had familiar faces so when Carlos and Claire pop up, it's more cooler but then again the basic feel of the films feel different from the game so there's the issue. From plot holes to barely-written characters to flimsy dialogue, there's stuff to like but it's nestled right alongside tons of stuff to loathe.<br /><br />The first film is probably one of the better made of the series (again, saying the series, not film in general) but Apocalypse had more familiar fanservice nods to the games such as Carlos, Jill Valentine, Nemesis and the Ashford family and Extinction is similar and acting-wise this is never meant to be actor showcases of talent, we just need faces for our story and with Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr and Ali Larter playing Alice, Carlos and Claire, it's easy for fans to get attached to it; it's just what the film does with it and how much you like it or hate it is the key. The effects are more seamless, the scope is more bigger, and thankfully there's more action so for the most part, if you liked the other 2, it's a good chance you'll like this one as well.<br /><br />Included with the film is a commentary as well as trailers for the games Umbrella Chronicles and Devil May Cry 4, the CG film Degeneration (which looks awesome), deleted scenes and a decent making-of on the film. It's not as stacked as most high-profile releases but it's not as barebones as most are so at least there's more stuff to dig into. As for the film itself, like a lot of videogame adaptations, it's fun to a fault and with flaws galore, they're still fun to watch...if only you could figure out why that is.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>this one was just another good addition to the resident evil series. these movies are explosive, all of them. my kind of movies. nothing beats the first one, no doubt, but they just keep getting better and better. i was not disappointed, and i honestly didn't expect to be. everything was good, the acting, the story, and all of the undead. the action was tops, and alice is sweet kicking all kinds of azz all over the place. man, milla jovovich was born for this role. can't nobody do it like her for real. she gots that hard core in your face appeal that you can't forget. the rest of her crew goes a long way as well. okay, if you don't know what it's about it's a continuation of the virus. it spread all over the world now, and there doesn't seem to be any stopping it. alice, as always is the key, and she's on the run. with only few survivors, who must fight and keep on the move to stay alive. while all the while the umbrella corporation needs alice to see if there is a way to reverse the infection. the battle continues, and there are to many undead and undead birds as well. nice part. new fighters are introduced, old friends reunite, and above all love is finally revealed. an action ride, with a little blood, some intense moments, and casualties that you just wish wouldn't have happened. blend it all together and you got an emotional flick on all these different levels. everybodies fighting one way or another. some of the scenes on here are pretty sweet. her main squeeze and action man, oded fehr, is once again dazzling. very nice. he does action like second nature. great actor. ali larter she kicked it here too. she gets down. ashanti, brief but good, and let's not forget mike epps. always nice to see a funny face. and milla jovovich was in her own world. all in all, i could see it over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>This is the third film adaptation of the series. Milla Jovoich (sexy girl) reprises her role as Alice; the film is directed by Russell Malchy. This time the plot focuses on Umbrella's failure to cover up its crimes and contain the virus it manufactured.  The virus then infects the entire United States as well as the majority of humanity.  It's up to Alice, one of Umbrella's former experiments to sort out the situation and put the living dead to rest in a world gone mad. Meanwhile an official of umbrella discusses plans to implement an antibody for the virus, hoping to give the zombies more intelligence/domesticate/keep them under control, Alice is the final ingredient to this plan. Alice joins with Claire Redfield and the members of stars and heads for what they hope is a safe haven in Alaska. Little do they know they are carrying an infected passenger with the lot of them.<br />The film if a bit gory, exciting, enjoyable and just long enough to get your fill of this type of genre movie.<br />One other thing about this movie in the series is that the special effects have improved tremendously and the acting was believable and fun to watch.<br />As video game to movie goes, this is one, if not the best I have viewed.  Doom sucked, so did Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, as did Street Fighter.  This was so good it was get another one added to the series-maybe next year??</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>When they set such a high standard in Part 2, you would expect the producers to come up with something better for Part 3. But no, instead we get a brown-sand and brown-tone saturated film with absolutely no direction, except to let us glimpse one final shot at the end that tells us that there WILL be a Part Four.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of the first two parts, it seemed to me that things were finally coming together for the whole franchise. Milla Jovovich, normally a great actress, seemed to be having trouble getting into the skin of her character but there were moments in Part Two where she seemed more at ease being the superhero she was supposed to. However in Part Three, the 'Old West' spin on things reduces the film to a caricature of itself, and there were points where I could not believe they would commit such hilarious segments to screen. There is one exceptionally poorly choreographed scene here that is an absolute rip off of the '50s cowboy flicks, with Milla playing 'gangsta'. Even on paper, this looks ludicrous, but when you watch her fighting and mouthing these inane one-liners, you can't help but wonder where it all went wrong.<br /><br />Prime problem is the casting. Ali Larter (the psychotic blonde from "Heroes") has no business being in this film. Her role could have been played from anyone as clueless as Lindsay Lohan to Paris Hilton. That's how vaccuous the character is. And then there is Ashanti. Does anyone even remember Ashanti anymore? How on earth did she land a movie role? Thankfully, she is killed halfway through the film, in one of the more intentionally gory sequences, and yes, the movie did get a little better after this.<br /><br />Oh yes, and then you have the 'hero' who 'gives up his life' to 'save the world'. Are we not tired yet of this theme? In this particular scenario, he turns out to be a romantic interest for Milla Jovovich, but yes, parting is such sweet sorrow, so he says goodbye to everyone (a humungously long sequence that reminded me of some sordid Bollywood saga) and drives his vehicle into the zombie lair to explode the entire arena. That is not a spoiler, really, just a statement of how dumb this movie gets as it goes along.<br /><br />Sadly, the Milla connection does not work here. And what was up with her face? EVERY SCENE that Milla's face is in is digitally 'touched-up' so that it looks like she stepped out of a L'Oreal Commercial. We are supposed to believe the woman looks this gorgeous all the time, when in fact the character is a filthy desert renegade, with biological problems to add to it. There were closeups of her that even had glitter and you could see how they tried hard to cake her face up with foundation. Everyone else looked really rough though. What was going on?<br /><br />Part Three of the Resident Evil Franchise is easily the WORST part of the series so far. I think Part Four should be better, because honestly they could not have sunk lower. The best part of this film was the opening when Milla is trapped in the facility and tries to break free. The revelation of the clones were interesting, but it all feels like I've seen this before on some vapid TV Show. Currently, I would rate the video game and its' bare-boned storyline higher than what they tried to do here.<br /><br />Very Disappointing. Back to the old drawing board, I guess.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Having now gained ever-increasing psionic abilities, Alice (Milla Jovavich) roams the apocalyptic, desert wasteland created by the Umbrella Corporation (UC).  Survival, that's it.  Nomadic in nature, Alice must "stay off the grid" to avoid the genetic testing being done by UC, who wish to harvest Alice's genes (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J0AQ">The Matrix</a>) in order to domesticate the zombies who have taken over.<br /><br />Part <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305075379">Mad Max</a>, part McCarthy's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OV2GRE">The Road</a>, this version of Resident Evil is a bleak look at the final stage of humanity's end.  Despite the minimal philanthropic endeavors of the UC, there is nonetheless still a very evil feel about the corporation, particularly its head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen).  When Alice links up with a ragtag caravan of survivors from the Raccoon City incident whose intentions are set on Alaska, the plot is set.  Good versus evil, survivors versus zombies - with support from UC.<br /><br />The biggest problems I have with Resident Evil: Extinction - other than the fact that the zombie genre has been somewhat saturated recently - are the complete ineptitude of the UC and the ridiculous measures they used to protect their desert base.  First, the UC somehow can create these incredible underground fortresses, facilities so advanced they are unfathomable; manufacture the T-virus, a deadly infectious disease that has nearly eradicated humanity; and programmed a life-like, holographic image that can best deduce the options for humanity's survival; yet they can't find a single person, Alice, even though she is controllable via satellite?  Huh?  The other problem with this film is simply a major plot hole.  Numerous times throughout the depiction of the barren wasteland we are shown the top level of a facility (ostensibly the UC headquarters) that is nothing more than a few buildings surrounded by chain-link fences to keep the horde of zombies at bay.  Yet throughout the film we see the same zombies ripping cages and doors off of hinges.  Huh?<br /><br />Overall, however, the direction from Russell Mulcahy is crisp and David Johnson's cinematography is not necessarily unique, but nonetheless refreshing.  The writing from Paul W.S. Anderson is boring, loose, and predictable, but honestly, what else is expected from the third installment of a zombie flick?  The special effects, makeup, and action are the highlights of the film, as numerous supporting actors are nothing more than zombie fodder.  One of my favorite scenes - let's call it Hitchcock on steroids - displays all the merits of this film in one neatly wrapped package.  Overall a worthwhile effort, will be enjoyed by fans of horror or zombies.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This is the third installment to the Resident Evil Trilogy which is an action packed visual effects feast for the eyes. It is years later and the virus has ravished the whole planet affecting flora and fauna, as well as killing off millions of humans. Those who are healthy keep moving and usually keep to the roads unless they need food or gasoline.<br /><br />The Umbrella Corporation still exists with different factions in major countries. They are all working together to produce a cure. Unfortunately that involves cloning and disposing of many likenesses of Alice. The evil scientist, Dr. Isaacs, from Apocalypse is still around in Extinction and he's obsessed and awed with Alice and bit on the crazy side. As with most experiments, chaos ensues.<br /><br />I jumped a lot thanks to a lot of well placed sound effects and scary decaying zombies. My only complaint was all the landscape panning. I had to look away often because it was making me nauseous.<br /><br />It was nice to see Oded Fehr again as Carlos Olivera and Ali Larter, from the television hit Heroes, was a welcome addition as the leader of a band of survivors. The film didn't really answer any questions this go around. It was more about surviving the virus and zombies, finding a cure and exacting revenge. And of course Milla Jovovich kicks a lot of zombie butt in the form of man, dog and bird.<br /><br />In my opinion, although it's been said there will only be three films, they left it open for the possibility of more. Overall, I loved it and am looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Reviewed by M.E.

The mutants and zombies are well done, the action sequences get better and better, despite some of the lacksidasical characterization.<br /><br />But if you are a gamer, and not a hardcore reader, and like above average B-movie zombie action/adventure type movies - then Extinction will definately fill your bloody bill!<br /><br />Mulcahy's directive style is truly unique, both in scenic beauty and savage bloodlust. The movie is paced very well, with nary a dull moment.<br /><br />And the ending is different, along with new powers that Alice is embued with, and a stand-off with the lead mad scientist played by the same actor in the last 3 installments.<br /><br />Bottom line is: For both fans of S. D. Perry's fun novels, and for the gamers who still think the movies are still too different than the games, both audiences will agree that Extinction mixes both medias well, and truly stands alone as just a fun and exciting and top-notch zombie action movie.<br /><br />Let's hope for another stunning sequel. The movie is smart in leaving it wide open for one. And with solid writers, actors and directors like this onboard, then the thriving audiences of this franchise will follow...</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>If you want to get at the heart of what keeps all three films in the RESIDENT EVIL series from being very good it is this:  the assumption that surface is everything.  The mark of good movies is the number of subtexts that they generate, but with the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, there is a powerful resistance to subtext.  For instance, even if you want to do an analysis of the tropes that attach to the main character of Alice, you will find resistance at every point.  Why?  Because the film itself has lingered in every frame on surface alone, completely resisting imbuing the film with more than just a succession of glittering images.  There are entire visual sequences that have no function whatsoever but to merely paint a pretty picture.  As a result, human elements are left entirely aside.<br /><br />This obsession with surface and spectacle is unfortunate because Alice is potentially a fascinating character.  Very occasionally the films in the series almost begin to toy with character development, but always pull back immediately after toying with it for a brief second.  At the hand of more gifted filmmakers, Alice could have had the potential to become a poor man or woman's Ripley or Buffy or Max Guevera.  At the hands of only moderately gifted filmmakers, we get little or no sense of her character, no real idea of what makes her tick, utterly no hint of what she wants, and very, very little about how she feels about things.  Milla Jovovich is so gorgeous that she manages to make us forget how poorly drawn her character is.  But the weak writing and poor direction never allows the films to ascend above slick spectacle.<br /><br />These first two movies tell the first two parts of Alice's descent into her own nightmare land.  The Alice in Wonderland imagery is reinforced at several points, not least in the original by naming the Hive's computer The Red Queen.  And in the third movie in the sequence, EXTINCTION, a version of "White Rabbit" by Collide plays over the closing credits.  During these films Alice, who initially suffers from amnesia, first learns from physical memory that she is a surreally gifted martial artist and weapons user, then recalls that she was head of security at the Hive, and later learns that her blood bonds to the virus that is killing everyone else, enhancing her strength, reflexes, and senses to absurd levels.  What keeps the series from being very good is that the films continually focus on what these powers mean for what she can do to the bad guys, never on how it is affecting her.  Contrast this to the way that this would have been done by any of a number of men (and why is it always men -- why haven't women helmed movies or TV shows with female heroes?) like James Cameron, Joss Whedon, Luc Besson, Ridley Scott, or Ron Moore.  Under any of these there would have been as much or more about what all of this was doing to Alice.  But then, all of these writers/directors/producers are more (or at least as much) concerned with the inner as the outer.<br /><br />In short, these are extraordinarily superficial films.  All surface, no depth, no interesting characters (mainly because of no character development).  Having said that, the film does present superior surface.  Once you accept that the films have nothing to offer but sheer surface, you can moderate your expectations and just go with that.  Once I realized that these films would not/could not be more than a succession of spectacles, I surrendered and moderately enjoyed them.  Was I ever truly entertained?  Of course not.  Was I bored?  Not really.<br /><br />This third film in the series is a genuine change of pace from the first two.  The first was restricted to the somewhat claustrophobic locale of the Hive.  The second moved out of the Hive into Raccoon City.  The third moves into the deserts of Utah and Nevada.  Much of the action takes place in a Las Vegas that has been reclaimed by the desert.  I haven't played any of the games so I can't comment on how closely they adhere to game play, but the real influence on this third film is the second MAD MAX film, better known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Though Alice isn't as cynical and certainly isn't amoral like Mel Gibson's Max was, like Max she is an unredeemable loner who can only enable others reach the Promised Land, without going there herself.  Unlike Max, there is clearly something that she has to do, namely deal with the hierarchy of the Umbrella Corporation, as well as distribute a cure for the virus that has rendered most of the world's populace zombies.  And if the ending of the film is accurate, she'll be engaging an army of her clones to achieve her goal.<br /><br />There is also one of the best raven attacks since Hitchcock, as a huge flock of ravens, turned flying zombies by eating off infected flesh, attack the convoy of humans led by HEROES's Ali Larter.  This and other scenes set in the ruins of Vegas give this film a visual energy somewhat lacking in the first two.  All in all, the film sustains what started in the original:  providing flashy, entertaining, but ultimately empty entertainment.<br /><br />I will add one last observation.  The three films that make up the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy (soon to be a quartet, with the addition of RESIDENT EVIL: DEGENERATION) easily comprise the most interesting films ever made based on video games.  That would be a more impression achievement if there had been some really good movies based on that source, but it is unlikely for some time that another game will produce such a film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil: Extinction: is a good entry in the trilogy.  Milla Jovovitch returns as Alice (I still don't know her last name) who is riding on a motorcycle through the desert wasteland of Nevada like Mel Gibson in "Mad Max."  The world has been destroyed by the T-virus.  Now, she travels solo, attempting to help those in need as she searches for gasoline which is in very short supply.  Also, the T-virus has given her telekinetic powers.  She, like a caravan of survivors, are looking for a safe haven, as do many survivors of apoocalyptic, end-of-the world movies.  She encounters a group of hillibillies who have been capturing anyone who answers their distress calls and throwing them into an arena of mutant dobermans.  There is a great scene reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds."  Crows infected with the T-virus attack survivors of a convoy.  "Extinction" is much darker and more depressing than the first two.  There seems little hope for mankind's survival.  This time around, Alice battles zombies who have been genetically engineered to be much more agressive.  She also discovers another underground, hive-like laboratory owned by the Umbrella Corporation.  When she enters it, she encounters the most diabolical mutant of all.  Like its predecessors, "Extinction" has a "Twilight Zone" ending.

Among them is Alice (Milla Jovovich), the genetically altered hero and renegade experiment of the Umbrella Corporation, who searches for survivors.  Also among the zombie-ridden wasteland is Claire Redfield (Heroes' Ali Larter), who travels in a survivor-filled caravan with Alice's old mates Carlos (Oded Fehr) and LJ (Mike Epps).  As they attempt to make a trip to Alaska, where the virus has supposedly not reached, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) prepares a final plan to lure Alice back to continue his research.  More than likely the final live-action film based on the video game series, Resident Evil: Extinction is by far the best of the film series, boasting the most action and bloody violence.  Paul W.S. Anderson once again writes, while this time around Russell Mulcahy (the original Highlander) directs with plenty of visual and enough visceral flair.  Also featuring Ashanti, Spencer Locke, Linden "Johnny Cage" Ashby, and Jason O'Mara as Wesker (!), Resident Evil: Extinction also manages to pay the most homage to Capcom's video game series more than any of the previous films to boot.  That alone should be enough for you to check out Resident Evil: Extinction if you haven't already, as fans of the previous films and the games both should be more than satisfied with what they get here.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>In "Resident Evil Extinction" Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in the same way as the first installment, naked but discreetly covered by plastic sheet. It looks like someone has clicked a reset button at first, but writer Paul W. S. Anderson gives us a few nice twists to the earlier part of the story. After that, however, the third "Resident Evil" film goes on the same road as the previous two "Resident Evil" films as well as past classics like "Mad Max 2."<br /><br />The actions themselves are impressive even though they are getting less and less original. Milla Jovovich does her best as film's cool heroine Alice and the Mexican location gives an authentic touch to the post-apocalypse world with the fine production designs by Oscar-winner Eugenio Caballero ("Pan's Labyrinth").<br /><br />But what does Alice have to survive? Not much. She reunites Carlos and L.J. (Oded Fehr and Mike Epps, both returning to the series), but they are not given any particular place to go, traveling from one place another looking for gas, and this is not a very exciting premise. Moreover, the people at Umbrella Company (responsible for the mass destruction of the world) are very slow to discover where Alice is. In short, we have to wait for the action to start, and the wait is long and new characters by Ashanti, Spencer Locke and Ali Larter have little to do in it.<br /><br />Here is great material out of which someone like Paul W. S. Anderson himself, who knows this genre more than anyone, might have made a better film. As it is, it is just an OK film with increasingly tired story about zombies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>This is a SERIOUS niche film: the third installment of a zombie film based on Capcom's "Resident Evil" games. Talk about a narrow audience! And, even as a member of this small group, I entered the film with low-expectations (it is always difficult to please this type of viewer). Sure, I was thrilled to see the addition of Ali Larter (Final Destination, Final Destination 2 and "Heroes"), but I refused to allowed myself hope.<br /><br />Maybe this is why I found the film a pleasant surprise (yes, it had its rough areas ... I'll address that in a second). The premise is relevant (the world has been completely ravaged by the T-virus, the entire planet is an acrid wasteland of undead). The writing is clever (plenty of unpredictabilities ... even down to a guy who can predict the contents of label-less canned-goods ... odd talent). The acting is convincing (some reviewers here found Jovovich's acting "wooden" ... I feel like they may have forgotten that the storyline dictates she is no longer entirely human). The setting is fantastic (so perfectly desolate). The cinematography is impressive (gorgeous color! very saturated!). For me, there is very little TECHNICALLY about which to complain. In fact, I was thoroughly engaged from start to finish. For me, it was gratifyingly tense (especially the scenes in Las Vegas)!!<br /><br />Rough areas. Okay, let's delve into some of the deeper issues. I was a little perturbed that the heroes of the film were all women ... especially when these women are desperate to transport a group of children to an uninfected area. It is, perhaps, a little too obvious. Yes, Oded Fehr reprises his role as Carlos, but it is pretty clear that Claire (Larter) and Alice (Jovovich) are the leaders (I mean, Claire's team is NAMED after her AND she is their tactician). Likewise, that all members of the Umbrella Corporation council are male is equally as frustrating. I would have liked to have seen a little balance here. Similarly, the treatment of the sole black male lead (L. J. played by Mike Epps) was disconcerting. Rather than provide huge spoilers, I will only note one small aspect of his character that may prove disappointing: his "smoking" habit. At first blush, this seems amusing, but ultimately it can be viewed as little other than stereotypical (still, Epps does wonderfully in his role ... I do not want there to be any confusion about that!) But, these troublesome areas were not glaring enough to pull me out the film. These were thoughts for the ride home.<br /><br />All of this aside, maybe I'm not the best person to persuade you one way or the other. I've been a gamer since I was five, I've been a zombie (zombi) enthusiast since I was eight, and I've always loved Capcom's "Resident Evil" series. So, I guess I'm not particularly unbiased. What you need to do to enjoy this film: you should have seen Resident Evil and Resident Evil - Apocalypse (for your sake and those around you), you should love zombie films (hey, who doesn't?!), and should dig gaming (so that you can look at your friend and say "BOSS FIGHT!"). If you fail to meet this criteria you may still enjoy the work, but I have a feeling you will only be frustrated.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>The Resident Evil franchise sparks a lot of debates; some love it and others simply hate it and see it as far inferior to the games they were inspired by. Make no mistake the Resident Evil films will never be mistaken for a George Romero movie and quite honestly the films will remain known only thanks to the video games. The day the games fade away I'm willing to bet so will the movies.<br /><br />But with that said I will admit I have so far enjoyed this franchise for the most part. The movies aren't classics by any means, but they do make for some mindless fun and quite honestly sometimes that is all that is needed. But the Resident Evil films aren't without their flaws and the major flaw with the series is one person in particular. Paul WS Anderson. He's despised by legions of people, but he's really not that bad of a filmmaker. He's not very good, but he can produce and direct an enjoyable even if lackluster movie. But his writing is just simply horrendous.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction was once again written by Paul Anderson who wrote the previous 2 and directed the original. This is a Paul Anderson screenplay you should know what to expect by now. I've never thought he was very good with the character development, but with the Resident Evil films he's at his worst. While neither this one nor the previous 2 were poorly written per se, they did feature very weak characters and if not for the actors brining more to the characters than maybe they deserved they would be a total waste. I can't help, but feel it's more of Anderson being lazy and knowing he has an audience thanks to the games.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Extinction might be the weakest written of the three, but also the best written as well. The characters all lack depth and nothing is really explained. Ali Larter was excellent as Claire Redfield, but my question who is the hell is she? I don't care if it's explained in the game. This is a feature film and not a video game. Her character could be developed in the game, but she also has to be developed in the movie. It almost seems like when Anderson writes his first draft it ends up being the final shooting script.<br /><br />I think plot wise this has a little bit more going for it, but with that said the story itself isn't very good and knocks off other movies, but the dialogue was overall far better than Resident Evil 2, which at times was cringe worthy. If not for Alexander Witt's decent directing, Resident Evil 2 could have been terrible, which is does borderline at times.<br /><br />Oded Fehr returns as Carlos Olivera and Mike Epps returns as L.J. and both of them are very much wasted. Since both survived the previous part and since both were free it seems they were brought back for the hell of it. While their characters weren't very much developed in the 2nd, here even less is done with them. While both actors make a little more of their characters they are simply there just for the hell of it. Carlos is given a little more to do than just to be there, but L.J. serves no real purpose. But at the end of the day neither character was very crucial to the movie.<br /><br />I would love to see this franchise continue without Paul Anderson; I think there is some potential for this series and while I have enjoyed all 3 for what they are just mindless fun, but Paul Anderson's weak writing hurt what would have been a much better series of films. As I stated before as a director he's not bad, he's not very good, but he can craft a movie that is enjoyable, but at the end of the day forgettable. The original Resident Evil really wasn't so bad, the script was very weak, but it did have some fairly good action scenes and was enjoyable, but again we go back to the script you'll be hard pressed to remember anyone's name. Faceless characters and that's what Anderson does best.<br /><br />As a writer Anderson, well let's just say he needs to take a few classes on how to write a screenplay. One of the clear influences on RE3 was George Romero's Day of the Dead; note to Anderson; pay attention to what Romero did with the screenplay and break it down and maybe one day you'll fully understand how to write a movie. I hate to totally trash someone and I've pretty much bashed Anderson non-stop in this review, but he deserves it. He isn't the worst writer and I'll admit I do enjoy some of his work again he can deliver a decent flick, but very forgettable, but I don't hate Paul Anderson like many people seem to do.<br /><br />Director Russell Mulcahy does a fairly good job at keeping the pace going forward, which isn't an easy task when you're directing a movie based off of a Paul Anderson script. But he mostly keeps things interesting and does deliver some solid action scenes. The poor CGI does hurt a little bit, but they're still good enough scenes so they may not annoy you too much. Of all 3 Resident Evil films this is probably the best directed, but also has possibly the weakest and better script of the 3. So therefore I won't place all the blame on Mulcahy for the flaws.<br /><br />The biggest problem with Resident Evil 3 is almost the whole movie was shot in the daylight. Movies like this barley work when shot during the day. Would all night scenes made this scary? No of course not, but that isn't really the point, but if anything it might have added a little bit of suspense and tension. I don't think night scenes would make this movie much better, but I think it would have helped a little bit.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns as Alice and is the brightest spot of the movie; honestly I really like her a lot. She's a fairly decent actress, but does make for a very cool heroine. Milla Jovovich is the franchise and brings a lot to a very poorly developed character. Quite honestly she's the main reason I keep coming back to the series.<br /><br />Overall Resident Evil: Extinction is a very flawed, but fun movie; by no means is this movie a classic at all. It's quite forgettable, but again it's a fun movie and a fun way to kill 90 or so minutes. My review may be a lot more negative than positive, but I do enjoy Resident Evil: Extinction, while this doesn't come highly recommended it does serve its purpose as a good popcorn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>The Umbrella Corporation, a veritable Wal-Mart mixed-bagging it with Boeing, has unleashed something that will eventually murder the world. Unfortunately for the human race, it was not the cross-species horror that demolished hope or the bony fingers of the undead that picked away the last shreds of civilization. It was the fact that the Earth was a victim, too, and this process of victimization left the world a desert with humanity flickering in the breeze.<br /><br />As far as a continuation, I found the movie likeable and hope people understand that this is a sequel work off information passed down from a prior sequel. Accordingly, it is not Resident Evil and it does not have Raccoon City to work with anymore. Raccoon City is actually a tomb now, nuked for those who omitted it from their mental radar, and the spread of the T-virus follows what any layman would register as a "catastrophe and then some." This means that the world went from the happy tinge of forests and foothills and turned a shade of red, infected and to the point that humanity had lost. This means that people survive by not following conventions: Instead of stopping they avoid planting roots and have developed a convey system. Instead of raiding big depots of their former lives they always avoid large cities, hoping to stay away from concentrations of the dead because even a forest of bullets could not keep that many teeth at bay. Fortunately for them, this has worked in some ways and the little towns they scavenge have kept the tired convey rolling. Unfortunately for them, they also face another threat --- Umbrella is far from dead and needs Alice.<br /><br />On the plus side of the movie, everyone is here. Our comedian, our shout-out to the videogame, our Alice; every loose end is here and in play. Everyone save Alice has built a convoy and is practicing the "stay on the move" philosophy. I missed some of them, too, and was glad to see that they were all seen as important. The main players are here as well --- the dead are out and in force because food is probably harder to get a hold of and they really mean something. They look purty as well and that was equally important --- without some sexy undead, where would the world be?. On the downside, the story is somewhat weak, the dress of the people does not make me think "one bite means I'm dead!," and the bird portion of the movie is - well, if you watch it you'll know what I mean. I also saw a piece of the movie that was taken from Day of the Dead and wondered if this was incidental, but also had to ask myself if Umbrella might think this way.<br />Following all the games and the movies, I would have to answers with a resounding "yes."<br /><br />If you liked the other movies, then you might like this one. Just remember that the focus is Alice, that the quality is lower in some ways, that you will lose some people you like, and that this is a videogame franchise. If you can deal with all of that and still say, "it sounds good," then you have plaything. I liked the movie BUT I like a lot of stuff so this isn't the focus. The focus is zombies, sexy little zombies and the T-virus that made them, and that makes me feel HaPPY inside. If it makes you feel, too, then perhaps we could get together and sing Imagine with an undead John Lennon.<br />Or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Watching this third installment of Resident Evil is like watching The Empire Strikes Back without having seen any other Star Wars movies.  The T-virus has devastated the world and Alice has escaped from where she was et the end of the second movie.  Everything is dying and there are few remaining survivors.  Alice meets up with a convoy of survivors while the Umbrella Corporation is trying to find her to further their own research.<br />Alice knows some of the people in the convoy and there is a history.  There are references to events not in the previous movies.  Alice exhibits some new talents.  But in the end it seems like very little has happened or been resolved.<br />I really enjoyed the first two movies but was at a loss with this one.  I am convinced that in order to appreciate this movie you have to by the two-movie edition of the first films that includes the important linking story.  I wish they had included it with this movie as I don't feel like buying the other two a second time.  This movie is set in the desert and the daylight thus giving it a different feel than the other two.  But it is the lack of a complete story that is its downfall.  With no real beginning or end this is just a snapshot in time.  I can't really recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie contains good action and special effects. There's nothing new about the plot. It's worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Pretty good, I thought. Not as good as the first two, in my opinion, but certainly entertaining enough for the discriminating gorehound. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION returns us to the world become ruined by the T-Virus, which had given rise to zombies and other beasties. As the film catches us up, we learn that five years had elapsed since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767834739">Resident Evil - Apocalypse (Special Edition)</a>, and apocalypse indeed has arrived. Most of humanity has been eradicated, having been infected and become the shambling undead. The virus has now spread virtually all over the world, with even the forests and oceans having been tainted.<br /><br />Mobile pockets of humanity struggle to survive. The best way to stay alive is to be constantly on the move. And so, an armored caravan passengered by frightened survivors, led by hardy but beautiful Claire Redfield (a character pulled from the video games Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil, Code: Veronica), ends up in a deadend desert motel in blighted Nevada, in dire need of replenishment. It's there that they meet Alice, whose motorbike had just "collapsed." It's not all new faces for Alice as she reconnects with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr, THE MUMMY) and L.J. (Mike Epps), who are now part of Claire's security personnel.<br /><br />A journal found by Alice states that Alaska remains uninfected and thus provides possibly the last refuge on earth. I don't know why or how an anonymous journal becomes so believable to a pack of strangers, but, never mind. Alaska now becomes the new goal and hope for the weary and desperate survivors. But not if the Umbrella Corporation has a say in the matter. And it does. Yes, a powerful vestige of the Umbrella Corporation yet exists and still claims an immaculately attired staff. Numbering among that staff is one particularly manipulative, despicable, sick son of a - well, he's a scientist. And he dearly craves Alice for further experimentation as her blood has somehow reached an accomodation with the T-Virus. Cloning of her has thus far proved fruitless and a continuing waste of sexy red dresses. Thus paves the way for the unleashing of even more zombies!! Cor!<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION, this time stirring in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max element, satisfies with its short on dialogue but long on horror action theme. There's enough clipped exposition to explain the essentials, then it's on to the gross zombie slicing, chopping, and back-of-the-skull explosions. The film is typically brutal in its high body count. There's an air of bleakness found here, although it's not as extreme as in Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8L9">Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)</a> (now that one was really grim).<br /><br />The difference, of course, is that in this end-of-the-world zombie saga, there boldly strides Alice, an honest-to-gosh superwoman onto whom we can latch our hopes. The stoic, ultracapable, and resilient Alice (now making full use of her psychokinetic gifts) can handily dispose of mutated deathhounds, backwoods lunatics, and flocks of predatory zombiefied crows, although it should go without saying that the main staple on her maiming menu is still human zombies. Milla Jovovich sexily graces the screen and has now imprinted on my mind as Alice to such an extent that any future role by Milla wherein she plays a mere love interest would render me severely discombobulated. And, mind you, I really liked her in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBM">Kuffs</a>. Her role as Alice doesn't really call for any acting stretches, but she full out commits to her character and imbues her with enough soul and sensitivity that you do care for her. And, once again, Milla proves her physicality by once more doing her share of the stunts (she underwent training in the use of the intimidating kukri blades).<br /><br />This movie provides us with three strong and independent female role models: Alice, Claire, and Nurse Betty. Ali Larter (FINAL DESTINATION, HEROES) as the group's leader Claire and Oded Fehr as Carlos lend credibility to their scenes with a full investment into their roles. Ashanti doesn't wow me with her acting skills but her Betty does show great courage in the face of horrific adversity.<br /><br />But we all came to see harrowing monster action, and we get gory bucketfuls of the stuff. Impeccable CGI blends with nifty stunts. Throw in the hard-charging rock music to rev up the audience, and it's a can't lose recipe. On the downside, I must admit to feeling disappointment with the super zombies, who didn't seem all that "super." Other than one sequence in the lab in which one super zombie works a cell phone and shoots a camera before he goes berserk, I didn't feel that this breed was a marked improvement over the generic ravenous undead. As well the big monster villain near the end (a Tyrant-model from the video game) could've benefited with more screen time, to allow the audience to feel more invested in his eventual showdown with Alice. For sure, he gave her all she could handle, and then some.<br /><br />If this is indeed the last of the series, then, as a fan of horror action and post-apocalyptic adventures, I count myself content.<br /><br />But I do wonder if Alaska turned out to be uncontaminated after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Project Alice, activate": these words were spoken by Iain Glen at the very end of "Resident Evil: Apocalypse," and it set into motion the premise behind the next chapter, "Resident Evil: Extinction." Or at least, it set into motion one of the premises, which is somewhat annoying. This is an action/horror/science fiction film that's overly condensed and needlessly complicated, with an intricate structure that was improperly handled. What we have here is a rare case: a movie that actually needed an extra thirty minutes for every plot point to be clear and resolvable. There's no point in criticizing the heavy stunts, the excessive gore, and the unrealistic story; I expected nothing less from an adaptation of a video game. But when it comes to character development, pacing, and stability, there is something to complain about.<br /><br />The film opens the same way that many films starring Milla Jovovich do: by her awakening half naked in a strange place, confused but able to stay in control. Her character, Alice, now finds herself lying on the floor of a shower, wearing nothing but a plastic curtain. She then dons a red dress and attempts to escape; based on the sterile hallways and the advanced technology, it's clear that she's once again being held at the Umbrella Corporation's research facility, a laboratory built deep under Raccoon City. As she reaches a doorway, she's gunned down by a cleverly hidden booby trap. We're meant to think that the main character has already been killed off, but wait a minute--her body is dumped in an open grave filled with Alices, each one wearing the same red dress. Somehow, our genetically altered heroine has been cloned, and the ones that die end up in a mass grave.<br /><br />At this point, we're given an insightful (if brief) update as to the state of things, courtesy of Alice's narration. Apparently, the Umbrella Corporation's attempt to quarantine Raccoon city and eradicate the dreaded T Virus failed. It actually managed to spread throughout the entire world. Remember that the T Virus can re-animate dead tissue and mutate living tissue, in essence turning anything it infects into a flesh-eating zombie; an epidemic of this scale has collapsed governments and laid waste to heavily populated cities. The virus has also destroyed plant life and lakes, meaning that the earth is now a planet of desert continents. The world as we knew it is over.<br /><br />Those that survived have learned to stay on the move, because remaining in one area will only attract the infected. This is how we find Alice; she travels alone across the deserts of the Western United States on a motorcycle, stopping only for gas, weapons, and an encounter with a sadistic family of mutant-dog owners. We also meet a mobile group lead by Claire (Ali Larter), a dedicated, efficient young woman. Joining her are "Apocalypse" survivors Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps). They reunite with Alice as they're being attacked by a swarm of infected crows; it would seem that her genetic modifications have allowed for supernatural powers, such as forming force fields and spreading fire. How these powers developed is never adequately explained, but whatever the reason, she uses both abilities to save the remaining group.<br /><br />That's when they decide to head for Alaska, a state so isolated that it's possibly not infected. But before they can make such a long, difficult journey, they have to stop for supplies. And since every small town has been drained of its resources, they're forced to rely on a major city, which is most likely swarming with zombies. They settle for Las Vegas, which has since been consumed by the desert.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the Umbrella Corporation, the overdriven Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is desperately trying to track Alice down. Because her body has been able to tolerate the T Virus, he believes that her blood is the key to finding a cure, one that may be able to "domesticate" the infected. Unfortunately, his slew of Alice clones has failed to be effective. Effective in what way, I'm not entirely sure; I still haven't figured out why they were needed in the first place. There might have been an explanation hidden somewhere in the film, but with a story this dense and meandering, I can't help but believe that I missed a couple of things.<br /><br />Such with the way with "Resident Evil: Extinction," an overly ambitious film that tried to fit too much into too small a space. The battle sequences are fun, and the makeup effects make for more than a few genuinely frightening moments. Milla Jovovich gives yet another decent performance as an action heroine (although I'm beginning to wonder if she's capable of playing any other role). Missing from the equation is a cohesive, well-developed story, something adequately suited for a film only ninety-five minutes long. When the fourth film is released--since the end of "Extinction" makes it clear that Alice's story is far from over--I can only hope that the vague plot points and unanswered questions will be dealt with. Of course, I'll also be wondering if the story will ever come to an end; movies like this prove that words like "extinction" have no finality to them whatsoever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>This movie lacked alot of things.

It's surprisingly well done even if it is Mad Max with zomibies. I'm sure Ebert & Roeper still would've ripped it apart but really not that bad at all. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is back and is one of the only living humans on earth. Everything is deserts now and of course there's tons and tons of zombies around. Alice and a group of other survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr of the Mummy movies) fight to survive.<br /><br />  While underground scientists experiment and make clones of Alice for reasons I'm still not sure of lol. I'm not sure why the Statue of Liberty and eiffel tower are in Las Vegas in the film either unless there's replicars of them there that are unknown to me. Still though this is an enjoyable B-movie and Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter are both good at being tough chicks. Ali Larter has especially been in good Sarah Connor form since Heroes. She's actually pretty good as a tough chick in Heroes and here as well. This still isn't a fantastic movie but it's superior to the last two and if you expect an awful movie you might be surprised by it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Here we have the third installment of Resident Evil. The survivors of the Raccoon City catastrophe travel across the Nevada desert, hoping to make it to a place of safety. Alice (Jovovich) joins the caravan and their fight against the ever-present Umbrella Corp and of course zombies. They are following a note that has them traveling to an infected free zone. After all this is a zombie movie with our heroine played Jovovich doing what she does best. Plenty of zombie fighting action is here and this time in the great outdoors in daylight. She seems able to be able to control hear mental powers a little better now as you would expect, but its use does affect her. Alice seems to be gaining more knowledge about what she is capable of; and I am sure more will be revealed in part four. I do not play the game, so I do not know if this is a progression from it or something the scriptwriters came up with. Oh, you noticed I said part four. Yes, this movie does not look it be the end of a trilogy; I expect another one will be on its way. Now if you are a big Resident evil fan or a fan of B-movies as I am, you will enjoy this.

I would not recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>From the start, this film had me completely surrendered to it's gripping narrative, fantastic cinematography and hugely entertaining action scenes. Unlike the first two films in the franchise, "Extinction" brings the next gen gore of the video games "Resident Evil 4 and 5" to the big screen. No more fast cuts, discreet angles or dark lenses... This is a hardcore, zombie killing action-fest. Aside from this new development, the characters are all written with much more attention to characterization and emotion. There are many scenes in the film where you find yourself GENUINELY caring what happens to the characters. On top of everything I've mentioned, the musical score by Charlie Clouser WAY outclasses the previous two scores and is both effective and well produced. If I had one negative thing to say about this film it's that it ended as soon as it did!</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>Considering the Resident Evil movie universe, this third entry into the series is probably on par with the first movie, if not better.  I know many people aren't fans of this series, but I do get a kick out of them.  I thought the second one was a bit of a disappointment, but the series came back with Extinction.  Alice is back, along with a couple of characters from Apocalypse.  Humanity is on the brink of extinction now as the virus continues to grow and grow.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is not exactly a unique take, but where else would they go with it?  If you like the Resident Evil movies, definitely check this one out.  If you didn't like the first one, you should probably steer clear.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I was rather bored with this film. Gone are the elements from the first 2 that relate to the games. Gone is any form of character development (I know there wasn't lots in the first 2 but there was some). Gone (and I felt the most important) is the dark element from the first 2. Yes, I do mean as in lighting but more so that sense of hopeless foreboding. After all, these films are zombie films and any good zombie film has that underlying hopelessness as let's face it, a zombie outbreak begins....you're pretty screwed once it's out no matter what you do.<br />In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The Umbrella group's plan is to control the undead and train them in ways that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell with the human survivors. This is something I don't understand. Why try to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new world?<br /><br />Bravo to Mr. Anderson for actually wanting to have more daytime settings this time around but it just didn't work.....and what's with the virus making everything baron wasteland? It's dull to look at. There is one city shot near the end and this is what I wanted more of. Where was the harm in continuing the story from where number 2 left off?<br /><br />What we end up with is the makers of the film saying 'you know the premise, we're just going to try and dazzle you with action set pieces and hope you're all in your teens in order not to notice that all we've done is make a poor film but robbed you of the entrance fee' I'm not in my teens and therefore not fooled. They still managed to fail in the action areas for so many reasons. Paul WS Andreson said after the first film he would like to make a trilogy. He should have stuck to that and used this as the opportunity to find a fine balance between the first 2 films to have the series go out on a bang....but he didn't and now we are faced with the prospect of a 4th film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Extinction (Russell Mulcahy, 2007)<br /><br />Sometimes I have to remind myself that there was a time when I liked Russell Mulcahy. Razorback is low-budget and cheesy, but it's loads of fun, and Ricochet is watchable, if dated, when I'm in the mood for such things. His music videos, of course, are legendary (he was behind the lens for some of the most popular videos from Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Billy Joel, among others). Something happened, though. Maybe it had to do with him landing Highlander II, one of the silliest movies ever to come down the pike. 'Cause it was after that that things started going to pot pretty quick. The most recent evidence of his slide into eternal celluloid [censored for Amazon consumption] is the third (and, please God, the final) Resident Evil movie, Extinction.<br /><br />I loved the first Resident Evil, and still consider it one of the two or three best movies in the odd, quirky subgenre of the action-flick videogame adaptation. The second wasn't nearly as good, but still had some fun with the franchise and was a movie that was worth watching a second time. This one follows the same formula: put Milla Jovovich in something sexy (in this case, olive drab short-shorts), give her a fair-to-middling-known, but excellent, right-hand star (in this case, Ali Larter of Final Destination), unleash some zombies, throw the Umbrella Corporation in there somewhere, and away you go. It worked in the first two, but you know that Mulcahy and scriptwriter Paul W. S. Anderson (and why he allowed this to happen to his baby is beyond me) decided to take it in a slightly different direction. Kinda. And so the first five minutes plays like a rehash of the action scenes from the first movie. They added a few details to let you know you weren't in an actual flashback, but still. The we get to the actual story, which has Alice (Jovovich) out on her own, having abandoned the group she was with at the end of Apocalypse, and Carlos and L.J. (The Mummy's Oded Fehr and Roll Bounce's Mike Epps) tagging along with a band of survivors led by Claire (Larter). The two bands happen to bump into each other in the desert, where, of course, despite needing to avoid cities because of the ravenous undead, they decide to go try their luck in... Las Vegas!<br /><br />I could forgive that you can see the end of this movie coming five minutes into it. I could forgive the impossibly contrived and painfully linear plot. I could forgive the general stupidity of a storyline that allows almost all of its characters to suddenly disappear with almost a half an hour left in a ninety-five minute movie. (Okay, no I can't, but it sounds good.) I could forgive it all if there were one, just one, good thing about this movie to balance it all out. Larter fills the good-actor-balancing-out-the-rest-of-this-marginal-acting role (filled by Michelle Rodriguez in the first movie and Jared Harris in the second) nicely, but Mulcahy never pushes her, and honestly, she doesn't have enough screen time to really do much. There's just enough character development to make me wonder why there was no character development; even the characters we've seen before come off as gold-leaf-thin. The new ones? Forget it. Even that might be permissible if this movie started with the action and then never let up, but no; the first half of the movie seems to have been set aside to give us some insight into these characters, and we never get any. Mulcahy uses it to move all his pieces into place, and that's exactly how he treats there characters-- as pieces. It really feels like the entire movie were designed around someone saying "hey, wouldn't it be cool to build a set of a ruined Las Vegas?". The worst part is, they never actually take advantage of most of the set, with all the Vegas action taking place in one small area. The entire palette of special effects was lifted from the first movie. The direction is competent, but barely more than that; the same with the cinematography, which stuns me given a desert setting and an Australian director (the Aussies grow some fine cinematographers, especially when working with sere canvasses; Mulcahy, however, brought on UK lensman David Johnson, who does fine work with small, cramped spaces, as he did in the original Resident Evil, but doesn't seem to know what do do with himself once he gets outside).<br /><br />And please, for the love of god. I knew someone would eventually break down and use a cover of "White Rabbit" in one of these movies, but I was hoping it wouldn't happen until after I died. Oh, well. Too late. And it's a bad cover, too. (The impact was only slightly lessened by my seeing a trailer for the upcoming Iron Man movie, which it seems will feature the original Black Sabbath track.)<br /><br />The twenty-first of September, 2007, was a banner day in film, with America seeing, for one of the very few times in the past thirty years, a wide theatrical release of a David Cronenberg film. Me? I got to the theater ten minutes after it started, so I went to see Resident Evil: Extinction instead. I wish I'd saved my money. *</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Running Time: 1 hour, 34 min.

Not much I can say, but the women are atypical stereotypes of the aggressive females; long on angst and short on acting skills. Laughable plots and more laughable are the actors trying to reach out "acting". If you like sci-fi action flicks (there are boring sequences), this is pretty good.

Lots of blood squirting from zombies heads going in all directions as they were viciously killed, a plot that's relatively easy to follow because if you've played the games you more or less know what to expect, and characters that were MUCH better than the poor acting skills that many reviews of this (and other) RE films led me to believe.  Everyone says the acting is bad in these RE movies, but I have to disagree.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the film involved lots and lots of infected crows! haha. That scene right there is really awesome. The segments that involved trying to find out how intelligent the zombies were was pretty good. Of course you already know what's going to happen when you try to tame an infected zombie as a way to find out how well they can communicate with normal people- death soon follows for the poor unfortunate people that happen to be near when the zombies suddenly flip out and lose control.<br /><br />One thing this movie didn't do that lots of OTHER zombies frequently do is this-<br /><br />When someone got bitten by a zombie, you know what happens- it's only a matter of time before they themselves turn into a zombie. Well that happens in this movie, but the other team members didn't seem concerned that one of their members just got bit by a zombie and acted like it wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />If I remember, in other zombie films, once a zombie is able to bite through the skin of a normal person, they WILL become infected, and that person has to be killed immediately. The people that got infected in this movie weren't killed immediately for whatever reason. Perhaps a flaw with the storytelling, or perhaps the other team members already knew what to expect and how to control the zombie-morphing when it eventually happened, so everyone was well-prepared for it.  Still, when the one guy eventually turned into a zombie, it caught everyone by surprise, so I'm led to think it was a storyline mistake on the part of the writers.<br /><br />Anyway, other parts of the film that I loved were the vicious blood-covered diseased dogs. They looked and acted VERY similar to the way they were in the older RE video games, and I appreciate that.<br /><br />Overall, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of hot babes playing main character roles, haha. I really liked this movie. Just please understand that turning the Resident Evil video game series into an action movie is the most effective way to win over the majority of the people, since most people out there prefer action films over survival horror (which requires a greater attention span to follow). It's just more satisfying watching some vicious looking creature get shot to death instead of watching the main characters crawl through quiet places with hardly no action to satisfy most peoples needs.  It build suspense sure, but that's not what most people want.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>I didn't really enjoy this one as much as I did one, two, and four.

Rumor has it that the infection hasn't reached there yet.  Soon, the Umbrella Corporation is targeting Alice and messing up the group's plans.<br /><br />"Resident Evil 3" is better than "2", but not as good as the original.  This time around, things seem more tame, with less blood and gore.  That will upset some die hard fans.  There is plenty of action though.  Milla Jovovich seems to be enjoying herself as alice, and although she has said that this is the last film in the series, the ending opens up infinite possible sequels.  This film is for fans of the series only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Resident Evil: Extinction is 2007's best movie, and if you don't like it you obviously like all things craptacular and uninspired. Extinction takes place years after the Umbrella Corporation destroyed Raccoon City with nuclear weaponry to cover up the infection, but as you've probably guessed by now, they weren't successful. The whole earth has basically become a barren wasteland with few people still alive surviving only on the road or underground in Umbrella laboratories. Main protagonist Alice is still being hunted by the Umbrella Corporation because of her involvement in the outbreak in the first Resident Evil movie, and her unique powers that she obtained by being injected with the T-virus (the virus which has ravaged the world). The whole story basically goes on about how Alice is trying to evade capture, meeting up with a group of survivors which include people she knows on a journey to Alaska on the possibility that the infection has not reached the area, killing hordes of zombies by means of guns and machetes, explosions, a mad scientist who tries to track down Alice, secret Alice clones that Umbrella makes to replicate the abilities of the original Project Alice, and you will be in awe of the gorgeous action, science-fiction, spectacular gore, and the awesome storyline all woven perfectly together. If you enjoy movies and despise the crappy animated movies released these days, endless s***ty comedies, uninspired and boring horror movies, and the stupid and incredibly lame, who the hell knows why it was made, High School Musical, then please, On January 1 buy this spectacular, superb, mind-blowing, super-freakin'-awesome, one helluva ride movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>Ok, I know the Sci-fi channel had nothing to do with this.  I'm obviously using their reputation for fine film making (tongue firmly in cheek) as a measure of this films quality.  Is "Resident Evil; Extinction" really that bad? No, it's not THAT bad, but it's not so good either.  To understand where I'm coming from, let's quickly rehash my thoughts on the first 2 films;<br /><br />Resident Evil:  Original, edgy story, (despite cheesing off the video game crowd), creative visuals and fair characters combine to create a surprisingly good zombie, action, horror film.  The Director did a nice job with a relatively tight budget.<br /><br />Resident Evil; Apocalypse:  A simple story that appeased the video game fans, goofy monster effects and big budget explosions combine for an in-your-face silly action movie.  Gone is the great tension and visuals of the first film; still fun in a stupid way.<br /><br />This brings us up to date on where I stand in the Resident Evil series... ...until now.<br />"Extinction" suffered with, what I call, CREATIVE CONSTIPATION!! Dun, Dun, DAHH! (Very dramatic, I know).  Let's get down to it...<br /><br />-BEST OF BOTH MAKES WORST OF ALL<br />This film had elements from the first film that I enjoyed a lot (i.e.; the laser room; very cool) and elements from the second film (goofy monsters) that combined to make a more confused film than either of the first two.  As much as the second film disappointed me it was, at least, consistent in its mood and values.  As pleasantly surprised as I was with the first film, its best elements don't work when out of the context of the edgy story and creative environment.  The only thing that translated well was the theme music, which is still effective at setting a mood.<br /><br />-CAN YOU SAY; DERIVATIVE<br />I can forgive copying in the context of homage or as a respectful nod, but the "Road Warrior" theme came off as derivative here.  Certainly, in the context of a dying planet, copying "Road Warrior" would seem a logical choice.  However, did they really need a skinny bearded guy with big teeth and a strange hat (i.e.; the helicopter guy in RW)?  Of course, like most zombie films, the entire series pays respect to George Romero's zombie rule (infection by blood, head shots required, etc.),  and clearly is borrowing concepts from Romero as they make sense (i.e. ; experimenting on zombies, domesticating zombies) without ever raising the social questions.  Regardless of the intent; this film depended so heavily on past work that I could not help critique its lack of originality.<br /><br />-HOW DEAD CAN YOU GET?<br />The thing most frightening and disturbing about zombies is that they once were normal people.  In the first film, with a lesser budget, zombie makeup was limited mostly to grey face paint, prosthetic wounds and an emphases on good zombie acting.  This is the kind of zombie I appreciate the most; still human but lacking their humanity.  These are the zombies that give me the creeps because they seem somewhat plausible.  "Extinction" definitely had too much money to spend on makeup, because these zombies were so latex heavy that they lost all humanity and became monsters.  Also missing was the attention to detail where zombie acting was concerned; just a bunch of people in masks running around and attacking people.  More makeup does not mean more dead; just less human.<br /><br />-IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY "WTF!!!"<br />Here are a couple things that I had to sneer at (SPOILER ALLERT for those interested).<br />-In one of the least surprising moments in a film ever to be presented as a revelation, Alice (Mila) finds out that she is the savior of all mankind.  If you didn't figure this out in the first film; shame on you.  The ability to fry circuits in space WAS a surprise; ugh!<br />-Apparently, too much vaccination can cause otherworldly mutations in humans infected with the "T" virus.  When I say otherworldly, I mean you will be able to instantly heal, use bad breath as a concussion weapon and grow tentacle fingers capable of shooting across the room.  This is amazing since it never did more than stop zombification before (sometimes it didn't help at all).  The worst part is, the mutation looked pretty bad.<br />-You shouldn't drive heavy trucks and Hummers in a post-apocalyptic world; fuel mileage will be a bit of a problem.<br /><br />-IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE...<br />So here's a list of things I thought were cool or interesting but only as stand-alone ideas that could not make this a good film on their own:  (some more SPOILERS, beware.)<br />-Zombie Crows; a scary proposition.<br />-I liked the main characters for what they're worth; not great, but not bad either.<br />-A zombie bomb (drop a dumpster full of zombies) was kind of clever.<br />-The laser room (sorry, it's just so cool!!)<br />-I give Mila credit for her ability as an action Heroine.  She is very capable.<br />-There was nothing inherently wrong with the production values.<br /><br />-HOW CAN I WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT SO LITTLE?<br />Yea, really; this film did not warrant such "deep" analysis.  I thought the first RE film was very creative and creepy.  I thought the second was crude and dumb but entertaining on a basic level.  This third film was visually better than the second but lacked the cohesiveness and creativity of the first.  As a result, you get a mish-mash of a film.  Big Budget production values with a less than enthralling story.  I can only recommend this for fans of the game and completists who must have the whole series.<br /> -Visuals......4 stars<br />-Characters...3.5 stars<br />-Story.........2.5 stars<br />-Monsters....2 stars<br />-Fun/scares..2.5 stars<br />Average.....2.9 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich reprises her role as Alice in this latest installment of the RESIDENT EVIL franchise.  The disaster of the Raccoon City experiment by the Umbrella Corporation has caused a worldwide outbreak of the deadly T-Virus.  Those who haven't been infected find themselves constantly on the go moving from one location to another.  Alice moves and works alone.  That is until she rescues a caravan of survivors under attack from a swarm of mutated crows in the deserts of Nevada not far from Las Vegas.  The group includes former friends of Alice's, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) and the leader of the group Claire Redfield (Ali Carter).  Alice has evidence of a possible safe haven in Alaska and convinces the group to go there.  But first they have to get gas in Las Vegas and the things in Vegas don't necessarily just stay in Vegas anymore.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed by RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION.  I was looking forward to an epic battle between the survivors and the zombies or at least between those at the Umbrella Corporation.  Actually, I would have settled for just a bunch of cool action sequences. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of that going on.  There are a few minor skirmishes here and there.  There's also a lot of build-up to what's supposed to be a huge battle, but it never happens.<br /><br />I had assumed that RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION was going to be the final film in this video-game based trilogy, but the movie is so heavy on character development and ends with such a strange twist that at least one other film must be planned.  The film does have a decent amount of blood and gore for those who like those things, but it isn't as excessive as it is in the video games or previous movies (there's violence, but not just as much).<br /><br />Those who have seen the previous RESIDENT EVIL films will probably at least want to watch RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION.  Also, even though she doesn't have too much screen time, the movie is worth watching for Ali Carter.  Of course, there's also Milla Jovovich, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>As with Live Free or Die Hard, this movie will come to dvd in an unrated format.

Its a given this movie will come out unrated. I thought the movie went by fast and the story didnt seem to gel. I still enjoyed some scenes but it does seem a bit rushed. Enjoyable if you dont follow storys and want violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>So, just how many super-secret, super-huge, underground, scientific lairs does the evil Umbrella Corporation have??  And will they never learn?  Playing with zombies is very dangerous, and could very well mean the end of humanity as we know it.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is the third installment in the RESIDENT EVIL series of zombie flicks.  Picking up approximately 5 years after the end of RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the deadly virus created by the Umbrella Corporation has escaped containment and turned the world into a barren waste land. Humans, dogs, birds, rats, and all other living creatures have been turned into mindless, flesh-eating zombies.  The remaining humans who have survived the virus are in a constant battle for their lives, banding together in roving caravans.  Our hero Alice wanders the planet on her own, killing zombies wherever and however she can.  In answer to a distress call, she rejoins some old friends, and together they make a break for the last known, virus-free outpost.  But Alice's powers continue to develop and grow, and the Umbrella Corporation wants her back...at any cost.<br /><br />As with RESIDENT EVIL and RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is a monster-killing, gore-filled zombie flick that is unexpectedly entertaining, and is perfect for an evening of mindless relaxation.  I never imaged I could enjoy this series so much.  The pace is fast and bloody, the plot is a bit more substantial than the previous two installments, and the acting is standard for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  And the special effects in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION out do themselves for the title of Best On Screen Decapitation Ever, clearly besting the previous title holder, the original RESIDENT EVIL.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is bit of a departure from the modern day B-movie genre of the first two movies.  There is a little less camp, and lot more "jump out of the dark and go BOO!" in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION, taking it more toward the horror genre.  Still, my husband and I had a really good time watching this this.  The ending is a perfect set up for the next flick, which promises to launch the most formidable zombie destoying army yet.

But no, instead we get a brown-sand and brown-tone saturated film with absolutely no direction, except to let us glimpse one final shot at the end that tells us that there WILL be a Part Four.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of the first two parts, it seemed to me that things were finally coming together for the whole franchise. Milla Jovovich, normally a great actress, seemed to be having trouble getting into the skin of her character but there were moments in Part Two where she seemed more at ease being the superhero she was supposed to. However in Part Three, the 'Old West' spin on things reduces the film to a caricature of itself, and there were points where I could not believe they would commit such hilarious segments to screen. There is one exceptionally poorly choreographed scene here that is an absolute rip off of the '50s cowboy flicks, with Milla playing 'gangsta'. Even on paper, this looks ludicrous, but when you watch her fighting and mouthing these inane one-liners, you can't help but wonder where it all went wrong.<br /><br />Prime problem is the casting. Ali Larter (the psychotic blonde from "Heroes") has no business being in this film. Her role could have been played from anyone as clueless as Lindsay Lohan to Paris Hilton. That's how vaccuous the character is. And then there is Ashanti. Does anyone even remember Ashanti anymore? How on earth did she land a movie role? Thankfully, she is killed halfway through the film, in one of the more intentionally gory sequences, and yes, the movie did get a little better after this.<br /><br />Oh yes, and then you have the 'hero' who 'gives up his life' to 'save the world'. Are we not tired yet of this theme? In this particular scenario, he turns out to be a romantic interest for Milla Jovovich, but yes, parting is such sweet sorrow, so he says goodbye to everyone (a humungously long sequence that reminded me of some sordid Bollywood saga) and drives his vehicle into the zombie lair to explode the entire arena. That is not a spoiler, really, just a statement of how dumb this movie gets as it goes along.<br /><br />Sadly, the Milla connection does not work here. And what was up with her face? EVERY SCENE that Milla's face is in is digitally 'touched-up' so that it looks like she stepped out of a L'Oreal Commercial. We are supposed to believe the woman looks this gorgeous all the time, when in fact the character is a filthy desert renegade, with biological problems to add to it. There were closeups of her that even had glitter and you could see how they tried hard to cake her face up with foundation. Everyone else looked really rough though. What was going on?<br /><br />Part Three of the Resident Evil Franchise is easily the WORST part of the series so far. I think Part Four should be better, because honestly they could not have sunk lower. The best part of this film was the opening when Milla is trapped in the facility and tries to break free. The revelation of the clones were interesting, but it all feels like I've seen this before on some vapid TV Show. Currently, I would rate the video game and its' bare-boned storyline higher than what they tried to do here.<br /><br />Very Disappointing. Back to the old drawing board, I guess.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>As a movie lover and gamer I have watched 14 total zombie movies in my lifetime: Night of the Living Dead, 1978 Dawn of the Dead, 2004 Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead, Evil Dead 1,2,3, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, 1937 Revolt of the Zombies, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, and now Resident Evil Extinction. Out of all these zombie films I've watched I can honestly say Resident Evil: Extinction is my favorite mostly over the fact is has more story to it than most of these other zombie movies, and it has the spectacular amount of gore of Land of the Dead with the action at par with 28 Weeks Later and Evil Dead with hints of many of today's superb science-fiction action titles. Milla Jovovich is still really hot and her combat moves have never been so sexy since The Fifth Element. The storyline will keep you intrigued because of how interesting it is and the zombie looks have vastly improved since the first two movies and look like the zombies from Land of the Dead with the running capabilites of the 28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later zombies. If you truly like movies and you can't stand the endless comedies, uninspired horror flicks, and the crappy High School Musical, then this is definitely for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I really liked the first Resident Evil movie.  It managed to find its own voice in a venerable first-person shooter horror franchise with Mila Jovovich. She brought a cool sensibility to a Alice, who by all rights should only be eye candy.  The film's script was respectful without slavishly adhering to the original series, which rarely made much sense anyway.<br /><br />The second Resident Evil movie was a mess of whip cuts, blurry action sequences, character stereotypes, and a paper thin plot. All is forgiven with Resident Evil: Extinction.<br /><br />Extinction picks up right where Resident Evil: Apocalypse left off. The zombie plague continues to spread, the Umbrella Corporation still plots in its burrowed-out secret lairs, and Alice is still an out-of-control killing machine. Extinction starts out just like the first installment, with Alice in a red dress wandering a plastic-wrapped mansion, and for a moment her confusion is palpable - I thought we had recorded the wrong film at first. But then it becomes clear that a diabolic experiment is taking place with Alice at its center.  In that regard the movie plays like a Resident Evil greatest hits: There's the creepy little girl! There's the rabid skinless dogs! There's the laser mesh death trap!<br /><br />But now that the infection has spread to the world, Resident Evil shifts gears to another popular horror staple: the zombie apocalypse.  All this testing takes place in a military facility surrounded by zombies, reminiscent of Day of the Dead.  Alternating between Umbrella's fiendish plans is the survival of most of the characters from the first film. Making up for the absence of Jill and her miniskirt is Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes fame), who leads the ragtag band of survivors that struggle day to day with issues of food, fuel, and morale. And then there's Alice, the supersoldier with trust issues.<br /><br />Alice, Umbrella, and the survivors all eventually collide in a winner-takes-all battle for survival. This film is not afraid to kill off beloved characters and it gives them a suitable sendoff. The final monster battle is mitigated by the concluding scene, in which Alice promises revenge against Wesker and all of Umbrella. It's a memorable shot that's worthy of the Resident Evil franchise.<br /><br />There's a whiff of devil-may-care in what was supposed to be the final installment of the Resident Evil series. It destroys the established Resident Evil universe, taking it in a completely different direction from the game.  And that's how you revive a franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>This is still a watchable film, and it entertains. Much of these ideas have been done before. We have govt experiments gone disasterously wrong, the world laid waste like a mad max movie, throw in zombies, zombie animals, warrior babe, Tk abilities, mad scientists, mad scientist run amok, bloody gore, cloning, world revelations, mix this all in a pot set to boil, and you have a movie! Not terribly original, but entertaining none the less</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>The t-virus has spread across the world, turning not only zombies into humans, but every animal species. Alice is leading a nomadic life, searching for the secret bolthole of the Umbrella Corporation. Together with a small band of survivors, she attempts to penetrate the bolthole, where stashes of the anti-virus are held. But inside Project Alice and Project Nemesis are there to stop them. A great improvement over Resident Evil Apocalypse, with a stronger plot and greater social commentary, but it still doesn't rise to the level of the original. Which is a shame; there are many facets that could have been explored further, such as the true reason the t-virus exists, and the humanity of the post-human creatures Umbrella has spawned. Still, it's an enjoyable installment in the Resident Evil series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Although I wasn't a fan of the first two films in the series, I decided to get this because it was recommended to me by a friend. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed. If you're after a popcorn "horror" flick with a difference then this is certainly the film for you.<br />I placed the word horror in quotation marks for a reason. I use the word horror in the classic context of something that is genuinely menacing, intimidating and is destined to give you nightmares e.g. The first Nightmare on Elm Street. This wasn't one of those movies that really sent the shivers down your spine, but it did have its moments where you would jump out of your skin and this is obviously something that is considered horror by todays standards.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich returns to the series as Alice who is now on the move through the desert because she has learned the Umbrella Corp can track her location by satellite. After the incident in Raccoon City in the previous installment the Umbrella Corporation was unable to contain the T-Virus. It quickly spread across the world drying up all the lakes and rivers and turning almost every living thing into a Zombie. The Umbrella Corporation seem to be the only organised group of humans not in a Zombified state. In an attempt to try and create a cure for what's left of humanity, Dr. Sam Isaacs is using Alice clones in an attempt to create a cure and help tame the zombies so as to create a viable work force.<br />All is not so sweet however as a group of roaming Raccoon City survivors lead by Claire Redfield are attacked by a huge flock of ravenous zombified crows. 5 are killed in the incident, but it could have been more if it weren't for Alice incinerating the flock by using her psionic powers which were gained from her bried imprisonment in the Umbrella facility.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good film and one of those popcorn flicks that you can enjoy with your friends. Although this isn't entirely based around the game storylines it's still a good stand alone movie and if the rumours are true, I can't wait for the fourth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Resident Evil was originally a video game that enjoyed much succes and it made the jump from video games to movies with "Resident Evil" in 2002 to mixed reviews.Nothing left hope for a second film.A sequel followed "Apocalypse" in 2004 wich left quite a few disapointed and wondering.Forward to 2007 when the third Resident Evil movie is released,"Extinction".Lets just say that "Extinction" is not anything fabulous but is still enjoyable and very entertaining,it's not a movie that you HAVE to buy,still it has its share of action,zombies and twists.If you have ever generated any interrest in either the video games or any of the two first movies then you probably should watch "Extinction".It has its flaws but it does manage to keep your interest and if you don't expect too much of it then you will like it more and if you set your expectations too high then this will seem mediocre to you.Actress Milla Jovovich who plays main character of Alice returns delivering possibly her best performance of the Resident Evil movies,at least that's something good.<br /><br />Here's a little resume of what happened in the first two movies.In the first Resident Evil the Umbrella Corporation develops a T-Virus intended to be a biological weapon,turns out that millions of people are turned into zombies.Alice wakes up confused and tries to form a team to search for the survivors.They also search for any information ainvailable on the T-Virus.Now,in the second Resident Evil Alice wakes up in a lab,most specificly the lab of the Umbrella Corporation.The corporation builds a wall around the town so that no one can leave.The virus is making its way to Racoon City.Alice and a qualified team for the job try to find a girl and a way to save the town.All three movies have something in common,Alice wakes up in each naked or mostly,now you judge if its good or bad,i won't!<br /><br />In Extinction things have gotten far worst.The entire world is now affected by the T-Virus and now even the water and soil are affected,forming a mostly deserted planet rich in one thing only : zombies!It has affected even Alice,but in a good way.This film has a few returning characters from Apocalypse and they team with Alice to take on the zombies.Meanwhile scientist Dr.Issacs of the Umbrella Corporation finds a cure for the T-Virus.Of course it is tested on an actual zombie and the results were that the zombie now had memories.When Alice speaks with Issacs he tells her that the cure might just be her blood.It ends with thousands of once again naked Alice,but this time clones.This leaves you wondering what has just happened and you realize that this wasn;t much of a movie it was a sub-movie to prepare us for the inavitable fourth Resident Evil movie.Of course there is lots of blood,zombies gets killed and a few characters won't be alive by the end of the film but it was to be expected.<br /><br />The biggest disapointment with Extinction is that it doesn't go anywhere except that it is setting things up for a fourth film.I expected better and I will admit that I was disapointed as many were but it was still watchable and it did entertain me for the film's length.You don't have to be a fan to watch this,neither do you have to have played the video games.It isn't anything great be advised and it is worth a rental in my book,only if you are interrested.There are good features with the "making of" featurettes and the commentaries but nothing really special worth mentionning.I rank it three but its pretty close to two and a half stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Although hardcore fans of the Resident Evil video game have complained about this movie series from the beginning, I gave the first two (2) Resident Evil movies very high marks for being a good modernized variation on the whole Zombie genre.<br /><br />With this third installment, I must now say it looks like it is time to end the series.<br />This third movie seemed less like Resident Evil and more like a combined tribute or "homage" to ...<br /><br />Road Warrior<br />The Birds<br />Day of the Dead<br />Matrix<br />and The Sixth Day<br />.... all wrapped into one.<br /><br />This film seemed to have a hard time finding it's center and just seemed like a mish-mash of random elements tossed in to give Alice an excuse to overuse her two curved battle swords.<br /><br />I bought the first two Resident Evil movies on DVD for our collection, but we have no plans to order this 3rd film.<br />We would never care to watch it again.<br />It was pretty flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I remember back in 2002 when Resident Evil came out how skeptical I was about a video game transfer to the big screen. But you gotta hand it to Writer/Director Paul Anderson on that one; he made a great, Action- Horror film.<br /><br />Then along came Resident Evil: Apocalypse (RE2) in 2004. Anderson wrote the script, but turned the directing reins over to noob Alexander Witt...and you see Witt's inexperience all over the movie. RE2 added an amateurish hokeyness that wasn't present in the original.<br /><br />In 2007 the series returns to straight-up Action - Horror with Resident Evil: Extinction (RE3). RE3 is not as dark and creepy as RE1, but it's a lot better than RE2. Anderson again wrote the script, but relied on vet Russ Mulcahy (remember the cult 80s hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005RYL2">Highlander</a>?) to direct. For RE3, Mulcahy went back to a lot of the basics that made the original so good.<br /><br />RE1 and RE3 have good old fashion scares, tons of action and stories that never get boring. RE2 was entertaining and had its own share of action, but the story and the 'horror' lacked compared to 1 & 3.<br /><br />The story is pretty consistent throughout all three movies. The deadly T-Virus is accidentally (or not) released by the Umbrella Corporation, and it's up to Milla Jovovich to save the world from its effects: zombies, unthinkable mutations (man and animal alike) and the psychotic minds of the Umbrella Corp.<br /><br />It's certainly not necessary to watch all three to understand what's going on in the individual releases. In fact, you don't even need to watch them chronologically. But if you're into the Action - Horror genre, and you haven't seen the first two, I recommend just starting from the beginning and enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of Milla Jovovich. But I must say I also don't cut her much if any slack if her movies stink. I liked the first Resident Evil movie and thought the second one was just plain horrible. I had heard from several people and from several reviews that this movie basically was a dog. I must say that after watching it that I thought it wasn't that bad and was superior to #2. I liked Milla's action scenes and though the movie wasn't as good as the first it was entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>The first two movies only deserve 1 star. This one should get a 3. It's a big improvement but far from perfect or even what a Resident Evil movie should be. It's light on the horror and suspense and heavy on the cheese. Everything from the costumes to the dialog is just so cheesy that it ruins any kind of terror you might experience in one of the games. I think Silent Hill got it right in it's film adaptation. It was more on the dark and creepy side while this is more bright and almost a comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This movie has a few things going for it: shambling virus-ridden zombies, evil corporate types in neckties and English accents, and Milla. Well, maybe just one: Milla.<br /><br />The franchise continues, and the uninfected survivors have dropped to a handful. As you expect, the "uninfected" and "survivor" groups both drop even more through the movie, amid festoons of gore. Also as you expect (or at least hope), the worst of the baddies get theirs in the end. It's not wholly a splatter movie, though: a heavy-handed tribute to Hitchcock appears partway through.<br /><br />The real attraction is Jovovich being the baddest badgirl on the block. Maybe the chilliest, too - someone should give the poor lady a blanket, or at least a camisole. (Come to think of it, Milla in lack of a wardrobe is an attraction, too.) Then, at the last minute, we get some sequel-bait that promises more of Ludmilla in some forthcoming follow-on flick. Lots more of her, lots and lots.<br /><br />Set your expectations low enough, and this movie will rise to them or beyond. It's a movie adaptation of a video game, fer cryin' out loud - what did you expect?<br /><br />-- wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Reviews are funny things: you should really only pay attention to the ones written by people with the same mindset as you.  If you're not sure if this one qualifies, I'll say this -- I, a fan of the first two flicks, went to this movie with a friend who had never seen any of the Resident Evil films and who wasn't intrigued in the least by any descriptions of them.  "I fully expect to fall asleep," was her response when we bought the tickets.<br /><br />Turns out, she enjoyed the film.  I did not.  That should tell you something right there.<br /><br />For those of you, like my friend, who don't know the Resident Evil mythos, a recap:<br /><br />THE FIRST MOVIE:  Umbrella Corporation.  Owns everything.  Run by men hungry for both power and money.  But mostly power.  They develop something called a T-Virus, designed initially as a biological weapon.  It turns people into zombies.  Whoops.  It gets loose in their top-secret research facility.  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up, confused and mostly naked.  After gaining her senses and enough clothes to be reasonably decent (by gamer standards) she leads a team of security personnel in an attempt to gather up the survivors and any possible information that may lead to a cure for the T-Virus.  Alice makes it out of the hellhole and into the arms of Umbrella Corporation lackeys who immediately shoot her up full of drugs.  Before she can say thanks, she passes out.<br /><br />THE SECOND MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked, in a lab in Raccoon City, home of the Umbrella Corporation's top-secret research facility.  Whoops.  The virus has spread into the city.  The Umbrella Corporation has erected a large, unbreachable wall around the city, and everyone is shut inside.  The town is ordered to be nuked; they'll tell the rest of the world it was a fluke accident: someone left a fork in the microwave or something.  Alice leads a team of highly trained military personnel in an attempt to find a little girl and a way out of the very dangerous, very doomed town.  Along the way, she fights a critter named Nemesis, who is mostly made of neck.  She wins!<br /><br />THIS MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked ...<br /><br />Okay, so I like zombie movies.  There's little left in movies that really scares me anymore, but zombies almost always do the trick.  Maybe it's the metaphor of their mindless persistence.  Maybe it's the blood-soaked personification of herd mentality.  Maybe I don't like the idea of anyone or anything that operates independently of reason.  Whatever it is, since Romero first shocked the world with his Living Dead series, I've been a fan.  (And 2004's remake of "Dawn of the Dead," for my money, is the most disturbing zombie film out there.)<br /><br />But RE:E?  Well, I'm not sure what to call it.  Zombie movie?  Eh.<br /><br />Sure, the T-Virus has spread.  The whole world has been infected.  Also, guess what?  It affects the soil and the water, too, so now most of the planet is desert.  It gets in the crows, and they go all bug-eyed.  In heavy doses, it causes rapid mutation.  And Alice?  Why, she's chock full of the stuff!  But in a good way.  In the kind of way that makes her able to do things that David Blaine can only dream of.<br /><br />Although they couldn't be called good cinema, the first two films were at least reliably dependant.  Maybe it's because they adhered so closely to the games upon which they were based.  Okay, so the formula is so rigid, viewers might find themselves looking for Life Remaining bars on the screen, but at least there were solid motivations, obstacles, and some level of sense.  Yes, some.  I don't cotton to the viewers who whine when the movies depart from the game script (seems a little odd to me, to seek theatrical validation for something you've spent hours memorizing on your own at home), but I do understand how those games can be the life blood of what is essentially a brain-dead premise.  Or maybe the games, in this metaphor, would be the T-Virus.<br /><br />Nevermind.  The point is, RE:E goes nowhere, and it goes there with as much herky-jerky senselessness as its undead cast.  A convoy of survivors is wandering the North American wasteland, basically driving away the time until they die.  Alice, alone, is doing likewise.  Dr. Issacs, a scientist at the Umbrella Corporation, is still running experiments, trying to find a cure for the T-Virus.  That seems like a pretty noble task, but the script goes to great lengths to establish him as a ridiculously evil person.  When he finds out that Alice is still alive, does he simply go to her and say, "Look, hey, sorry about all of the trying to kill you stuff.  And the zombie dogs.  And the neck monster.  Heh.  Guess we got carried away.  But, hey, the cure to it all might be in your blood, actually, and I was wondering ... uh, can I borrow a drop?"  Of course he doesn't.<br /><br />This is the movie's central conflict.  You might think it's about the convoy of survivors.  You might think it's about a possibly uninfected corridor of Alaska where everyone can go to find peace.  You might even think it's about a cure, a resolution, or some kind of curtain call on the whole dismal affair.  No.  What it's really about is a fourth film.  By the final frame of "Extinction," you'll realize what I did: you just watched a two-hour prologue.  And it's not even that great of a prologue.<br /><br />If you're like my friend, maybe you'll see a kind of interesting flick with some neat fight scenes, one or two cool ESP moments, and an ending that is as canned as the food served to the convoy's dwindling members.  At least you'll see something that's better than bad, which was what my friend was expecting.<br /><br />If you're like me, with hopes a little further north, prepare to be let down.  This film is full of the false scares and sudden bangs that make up all the cheap thrills of most horror films; I'll admit I jumped a few times at the start.  But by the end, the thrills were gone, and all that was left was the cheap.  I'm not sure what this means for the next film coming.  Although I'll bet it starts with Alice waking up, confused and mostly naked.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Resident Evil: Extinction" is great!

This is the third outing in the movie franchise.  As players of the game know, Alice was never part of the video games.  She was created wholly for the theater crowd.  However, Alice has been paired up with characters featured in the video games.<br /><br />This time Alice co-stars with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) from the video games as well as Claire Redfield (HEROES' Ali Larter).  Both "game" characters are given a large share of the screen time.  The villain, Albert Wesker, is also from the games.<br /><br />I pushed the DVD in with no real expectations other than to have a rollicking good time with special effects, martial arts, gunplay, and mindless violence.  You just don't walk into one of these films wanting any kind of serious message.  There are no serious messages in the games, unless you count, "Don't get bitten by zombies."<br /><br />I had a great time with the film.  The action started out early and maintained terrific forward momentum.  Some of the characters lived and some of them died, which I expected.  And some of them even died that I truly didn't expect.<br /><br />Jovovich's martial arts sequences are some of the best she's ever done.  Ali Larter was outstanding as the leader of a convoy of survivors she was trying to take to safety.  There's not a lot of character to put on display in a film like this, and everyone connected to the production wisely allowed the violence and special effects take the lead.<br /><br />One of the best - and most chilling parts of the film - was the opening.  I watched breathlessly as Alice awakes and tries to get out of some kind of institution.  She barely escapes death trap after death trap and ends up (surprise!) getting killed.  Then our villain orders her body dumped and we see her corpse get thrown into a trench outside the facility.  The trench is filled with other dead "Alices" and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand they're clones.<br /><br />The facility is an underground complex.  The visual representation showing that facility is one of the movie's coolest graphics.  I also loved the way the zombies were kept outside of the aboveground facility by a tall fence.  But the image jarred me a lot too because it's too much like comics scribe Robert Kirkman's zombie title THE WALKING DEAD.<br /><br />The action shifts over to the real Alice and she's immediately in danger from survivors who try to kill her.  I was a little troubled by the fact that the killers didn't seem to be properly motivated, but when they set the zombie dogs on Alice to kill her, I promptly pushed that out of my mind and simply enjoyed the action sequences.<br /><br />The zombie crows later in the film were terrifying.  Kind of like Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS on steroids.  The huge cloud of them attacking the convoy was totally amazing visually, as was Alice's attack on them with the mind-controlled fireblast spewed by the flamethrower.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION got an R rating, but there wasn't a single F-bomb I remember hearing, nor any other egregious language.  The rating seems to be totally derived from the violence and the appearance of the zombies.  Personally, I think a PG-13 rating would have sufficed.  You can freely watch this one with your older kids.  I watched it with my ten year old and he had a good time with it.<br /><br />The Resident Evil video game franchise continues to pump out new entries.  EXTINCTION is rumored to be the last live-action movie, but I hope that's not true.  A motion-capture film called, for the moment, RESIDENT EVIL:  DEGENERATION is already in the works.<br /><br />The two-disc set and Blu-ray edition carries a lot of extras that fans will want to have.  The audio commentary, the making-of featurette, and the sneak peek at RESIDENT EVIL:  DEGENERATION are all worth making time for.</p></br></body></html>

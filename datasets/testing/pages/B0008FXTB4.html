Both movies are based on novels by acclaimed crime author Elmore Leonard.<br /><br />In "Get Shorty" gangster Chili Palmer comes to Hollywood to collect a debt and ends up falling in love with the movies. In "Be Cool" he has become a big Hollywood producer who is now bored with it all. After a friend in the music business is murdered, he becomes involved in a war between various factions of hip hop music. Along the way be becomes involved with a beautiful woman and guides to career of a talented young singer.<br /><br />The movie's big problem is that the satire is not fresh. The jokes about movie sequels, stars and hip hop music aren't that funny. Even the in jokes about Travolta and costar Uma Thurman's movie classics don't work.<br /><br />Rather than buying or renting "Be Cool" [which isn't], I suggest you reach for "Get Shorty" [which is].</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>One and a half stars actually and that's only because of the very funny Vince Vaughn and a humorous turn by the Rock, apart from that this movie is total rubbish. John Travolta shouldn't wonder why he's not getting any good roles lately if this is the kind of crap he thinks is worth his time. This movie is 100% recycled from the excellent original and offers nothing new but a ridiculous singing pipe dream story and far fetched bad ass John Travolta moments. Everything that worked and seemed fresh the first time around seems tired and stupid this time around. Fully unnecessary and unforgivable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>When you have a movie like Get Shorty, base on the book by Elmore Leonard, and it is good, the first thing you want to do is capture the success of that and run with it.  Well...first off all, they took too long, and the zest that was the buzz for Get Shorty had already started to wan.  So they say . . . Hey, let's throw John Travolta & Uma Thurman together and they'll dance and it will be like a f*cking Pulp Fiction reunion and people will dig that.  No.  The problem inherent in Be Cool is that it tries way too hard to be funny.  Where Travolta's original Chilli Palmer was cool and smooth and likable...it's now just really f*cking annoying.  You wanna smash his skull in with Steven Tyler's old shriveled lips!  Could this movie have succeeded five years ago.  Maybe, but the writing is strained and some of the nostalgia has worn off and even Danny DeVito isn't his usual creep-charming self.  Altogether a colossal waste of PG-13 time.  Sequels rarely transcend the brilliance of the original and this one couldn't aspire to lick the its boots.<br /><br />Deal with it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Be cool proves that a big cast full of big names do not make a good movie. With so many actors, you'd think it would be a good movie. There a very few funny scenes, and the plot is boring and long. It really goes no where in it's 120 minutes. A potential movie turns to mush.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>Travolta, Uma, Cedric and Vince put in good performances, but you'd expect that. What I didn't expect was for The Rock to be so good. His role was basically to make fun of himself, and he did a good job. Its worth watching this movie, especially if you liked the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Be Cool opens with ex-mobster Chili Palmer (John Travolta) scorning sequels, as he says "But sometimes you have to do it the studio way."  The irony in this scene reflects on the notion that this is the sequel to Get Shorty (1995) where Chili travels to Hollywood in order to collect money and to his amazement discovers that the film industry has close resemblance with the workings of the underworld.  This time the audience quickly learns that Chili has grown tired of the movie industry and wants to revamp his career.  Through an incident where his friend Tommy Athens (James Woods) is shot in broad daylight by the ruthless Russian mafia and an altercation at a nightclub he decides to enter the music industry.  This is a business that unfortunately has claimed several artists' lives such as Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, but in this version the audience will experience a highly amusing gangster tale in the music world.<br /><br />Chili is the epitome of coolness as he always says and does the right things at the right time.  He never fails for a second, as he continues to stay two steps ahead of those who move in on his turf.  Calmness surrounds his persona that never budges to pressure or threats, as he pursues his new career as a producer in the music industry.  Several characters comment on Chili's aspirations as a new up and coming music producer, and they all say his ideas are too lofty and will never work.  Yet, Chili gains peoples trust and interest through his cool existence, which always remains polite and helpful even at gunpoint.<br /><br />Through careful management of people, Chili quickly climbs the ranks as a music producer, as he signs his first talent Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who he simply frees from another record company.  This however draws bad blood between him and those who wants to keep Linda under contract.  In particular, there is a minor co-producer with an inferiority complex called Raji (Vince Vaughn) who pulls his self-denying gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock) into a messy situation where he attempts to find a way to get Chili out of his way through any means possible.  To further complicate things Chili also finds himself inheriting Tommy's debt of $300,000 to Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), a money hungry music mogul, and the Russian mafia wants nothing else than removing Chili from the face of the planet.<br /><br />In this intriguing jumble of comical side plots, music, and guns it will bring the audience through a guilty pleasure of laughter and amusement that keeps the wink in the eye.  Ultimately, Chili ties it all together with his cool presence, as he continues as if it was business as usual.  Much of the enjoyment rests with in F. Gary Gray's direction that makes another funny and intriguing tale.  Another element that elevates the film's quality is the wide range of music in the film as it uses country, rap, rock, and much more.  The film also offers several interesting cameos that will elevate the film's cool feeling that film tries to induce.  Be Cool might not measure up with his debut film Friday (1995), or The Italian Job (2003) when it comes to action, but he will definitely offer something to laugh about while leave the audience entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>What's worse than a s#@!^y low budget movie?A s%*&#y big budget<br />movie!This movie just straight blows!I thought KRAFT had a lot<br />of cheese but this takes the cake, from the stilted direction<br />to the mugging of the screen,to Uma Thurman's dialog(just tell<br />me that dream on is not the greatest rock'n'roll song ever made.<br />I'll tell ya!Right in your face,god that made me sick)it's one<br />thing to see a movie and say that just sucked!But it's another<br />when you see a movie and it makes you angry,like this pile of<br />S#*T!The biggest reason why I'm angry is I think John Travolta,<br />Uma Thurman,Vince Vaughn,Steven Tyler & The Rock have all done<br />something I've enjoyed from one time to another,but this?I'd<br />rather watch Police Acadamy 12.Best scene,when the ending credits came up.Total trash avoid at all cost.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>what a waste of film&time? this film made no sense at all.Get shorty was cool but this is pure junk from start to finish.nothing made any sense to me whatsoever.this film has no flow&I wasn't feeling the Humor at all.seems like a bunch of ideas thrown up together.avoid this clunker.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>All "style" and no substance.

Be cool? Isn't that what all movies with big name stars are about?<br /><br />This one seems to be a parody of Hollywood and its fame machine, but is limpid in its portrait of that parody. It is also said to be a comedy but I cannot recall once laughing during this film.<br /><br />This movie has one thing going for it: it is magnificently shot in wonderful lighting. Every scene makes the actors appear breathlessly beautiful. You can see every hair in its place (none are out of place) and every wrinkle is gone. These people look better than movie people have ever looked.<br /><br />But,even in Hollywood, looks alone are not enough. It takes something more, some unknown power to make a movie a hit. This one doesn't have it. If looking at a lot of big stars and beautiful people in good lighting is enough for you, this is your ticket. Otherwise, move on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  F. Gary Gray<br /><br />Cast:  John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Steven Tyler, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, Paul Adelstein, Debi Mazar, The Rock, Harvey Keitel, Danny DeVito, James Woods.<br /><br />Running Time:  118 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality, and language including sexual references.<br /><br />After conquering the movie business, Chili Palmer (John Travolta) grows weary of the cinema, and switches over to the music game when he gets a chance to team up with a friend's widow (Uma Thurman, entering the film in a very memorable way) to run a record label. After finding gold in a talented young singer (Christina Milian), Chili must first retrieve her recording contract from her shady manager (Harvey Keitel), outwit a dim, thugged-out-whiteboy wannabe producer (Vince Vaughn) and his homosexual, aspiring actor bodyguard (The Rock), negotiate a settlement of debt with a Suge Knightish producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and his gang (including Outkast's Andre Benjamin), and try to outsmart some Russian gangsters who are hot on his tail. All in a day's work in the record industry.<br /><br />It has been 10 years since Chili Palmer last graced the big screen (has it been that long?) in the Elmore Leonard adaptation, "Get Shorty." Impressed with star John Travolta's performance, novelist Elmore Leonard took it upon himself to write a sequel novel, which is the basis for "Be Cool." Chili is arguably Travota's finest role, utilizing the actor's rarely used gifts for deafeningly calm coolness and charm. "Be Cool" also reunites Travolta with Uma Thurman, his dance partner in both love and heroin in "Pulp Fiction." Their chemistry is terrific, providing the backbone of the film while every other actor gets to run around chewing the scenery. It's tremendous fun to see Travolta in this role again; however, in those 10 years, there have been many personnel changes in front of and behind the camera, which occasionally disrupts the Chili fun of "Be Cool."<br /><br />"Be Cool", more so than its predecessor, leeches shamelessly and excessively off "Pulp Fiction", which by now is as common as imitating bullet-time from "The Matrix". What's sad is that "Be Cool" depends entirely on leeching off of "Get Shorty" while neglecting to develop its own plot; what you get is a short-lived sense of nostalgia sugar coated with some manufactured "oohs" and "ahs" you get from seeing the Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler on screen. While such technique may make for a nice 5-minute music video or Coca Cola promo, it doesn't make for proper storytelling. "Get Shorty" created much more tension with a lot less color, with the beef among rival mobsters playing out like a well choreographed dance of opposing chemical elements. "Be Cool" is more like a chaotic late afternoon preschool where all the kids are fighting for attention, sacrificing classiness for distracting noise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>The purpose of some sequels seems to be to remind the audience what a great film the original was.  Get Shorty was a great film; it was smart, quick, and funny.  Be Cool wants desperately to be like Get Shorty.  The problem with the novel Be Cool was that it was too similar to Get Shorty and the filmmakers have only made it more so.  The lines from the first film get echoed, not once, but over, and over, and over again.  They recycle all the jokes, and situations, and dialogue from the first movie.  Granted, there are a few new additions to the film: in the book, Linda Moon was in a rock band, but in the movie, she's more of a Beyonce Knowles rip-off.  Vince Vaughn works the hardest at his role as Linda Moon's manager, who thinks he's a pimp.  The Rock stars as the James Gandolfini character in this one.  Of course, the problem with going through all the motions of the first film is that Be Cool suffers by comparison: it seems long and boring.  It just makes you think, "What a great picture Get Shorty was."</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>There is one reason and one reason only to see Be Cool: the outrageous performance of Vince Vaughn as Roggie, a would-be music producer/manager who thinks he's black. Seriously. Between the Burberry jogging suits, gold chains, played out slang, and Pimps Up Hoes Down attitude I was almost amused enough not to notice that the rest of this movie was absolute [..]. Almost, but not quite.<br /><br />So if you're going to watch this movie, go ahead and fast forward to all the scenes with Roggie because the rest of it is more or less useless. That's my two cents.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This movie suffers a bit because it is a sequel to the very much better film, "Get Shorty".  I know that some hate this film and for a variety of good reasons.  However, this movie is not nearly as bad as some have claimed.  There are a few really good scenes, a number that really work nicely, and then there is that crummy dance scene.  Without that (or a shorter version of it), this would have been much more likeable.  It just goes on too long and adds nothing much to the film.<br /><br />The Rock gives a very engaging performance as the bodyguard who is gay, but doesn't quite seem to admit it to himself.  Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job with a despicable character.  When I see Robert Pastorelli on screen I am still upset that he killed himself with an overdose.  Cedric the Entertainer and his Gangsta Crew also add quite a bit to the story as do the Russians.  Harvey Keitel seemed to be phoning it in a bit.  Uma is good, but doesn't glow here.  And Chili Palmer is just fun to watch on the screen, so you gotta like Travolta for giving the character life.<br /><br />So, not a great film.  Not even a very good one.  But it is an ok rental entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Chili Palmer (Travolta) is back in this sequel to 1995's "Get Shorty".  Since making it big in the movie business, he has grown tired of the cinema, and is thinking of geeting into the music business.  After spotting the talented Linda Moon (Milian), he relieves her of her current deal with Nick Carr (Keitel), and uses his friendship with the owner of a recording company, Edie Athens (Thurman) to get Moon going on the path to stardom.  Chili faces two problems though, Carr really does not want to let Moon go and hires a hit man to clear up the situation, and Athens owes Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer) $300,000, which she does not have.  What follows is a series of double-crosses that get to be just a bit too over the top.<br /><br />I really wanted to like "Be Cool", and to some extent I did.  "Get Shorty" was a great movie, and a sequel was inevitable, especially once Elmore Leonard wrote the sequel novel.  The problem this time around is that the talent of the large cast is less than the sum of its parts.  "Get Shorty" had four leads, and they were all on top of their game.  "Be Cool" has arguably nine leads, and more does not mean better.  Sure, Cedric the Entertainer and The Rock are the standouts of the group, but Travolta's Chili is just a bit too cool.  We never really believe that he is in any danger.  Thurman's casting is just a stunt to get her and Travolta dancing to recreate their famous "Pulp Fiction" scene.  Vaughn is amusing as the white guy who thinks he is black, but that grows tiresome by the time the movie is half over.<br /><br />All in all, "Be Cool" is not a bad movie, but it is not as good as it could be, and never lives up to the standard set by its predecessor.  I would recommend it, but wait for DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>This sequel to the 1995 adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty finds F. Gary Gray in the director's chair this time around, as Be Cool finds former loan shark turned movie mogul Chili Palmer (John Travolta) looking to leave Hollywood and try his luck in the music industry.  Upon the death of a colleague (James Woods), Chili teams up with the widow (Uma Thurman) to sign a young up and coming songstress (Christina Milian) to their fledgling record label, which owes quite a bit of cash to an Ivy League gangster-rap executive (Cedric the Entertainer).  In the mix of all this is Milian's wanna be black former manager (Vince Vaughn, perfectly cast), his gay bodyguard (The Rock), and Vaughn's sleazy boss (Harvey Keitel); all of whom are soon gunning for Chili.  While Be Cool doesn't aspire to the greatness of Get Shorty (far from it), it's slickly produced Hollwyood entertainment that, for the most part, serves it's purpose.  Travolta is as great as ever, Thurman is wasted, and Vaughn and the Rock are undoubtadly the best things about Be Cool.  Danny DeVito, the only other returning cast member from Get Shorty, offers nothing more than an extended cameo, which is supremely disappointing.  That aside, Be Cool is a worthy mainstream distraction, just don't go into it expecting something special like Get Shorty.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...Chilli Palmer, the Get Shorty conman/movie producer, decides to go into the record producing business when a record label owner is shot in broad daylight by a toupee wearing Russian mob hit man. Events unfold synchronicitously (is that a word?) around him and Chilli gets things working in his direction like some kinda ultro hip Zen Shaman. Or mebbe he has the instinct to be a record remix producer, who knows. Actually, Travolta is playing straight man to these assorted zanies--Vince Vaughn as a wanna be hip-hop manager, The Rock as a gay/wanna be in movies (Send Me Your Head Shot), Cedrick the Entertainer as the Ivy League educated Shug Knight styled rap artist mogol, said Russian mobsters, and Keitel playing a smarmy type he's known to do well. Do not expect any standout performances here, all are equally effective. Whatch out for Ced's Mr. Demille Close-Up performance. Eye candies Uma Thurman (most recall her performances in the kicka** Kill Bill) and Millian give the guys a visual feast.

John Travolta (Basic, Pulp Fiction, Grease) reprises his tough guy role as Chili Palmer who wants to quit the movie buisness and go into the music business. His friend Tommy, played by James Woods (Diggstown, Scary Movie 2, Virgin Suicides) gets whacked by the Russians. He wants to make Linda Moon, played by singer Christina Milian (Man Of The House '05) a star. So, Chili visits Woods' now widow Edie, played by Uma Thurman (Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction, Tape) so they join together and make this girl big but she has a contract with the rival Nick Carr, played by Harvey Keitel (National Treasure, U571, Pulp Fiction). Keitel's two henchman are played by The Rock (The Rundown, Walking Tall, The Mummy Returns) and Vince Vaughn (upcoming Wedding Crashers, Made, Swingers). Vaughn plays Raji..his real name is Roger...he thinks he's black and The Rock plays Elliott a gay bodyguard who's looking for a bite in the movie business. Cedric The Entertainer (Man Of The House '05, Lemony Snickets, Johnson Family Vacation), Outkast member Andre Benjamin Ice Cold 3000 (Hollywood Homicide), Danny DeVito (Death To Smoochey, Batman Returns), the late Robert Pastorelli (Bait, Eraser, Tv's Murphy Brown), The Black Eyed Peas and Steven Tyler and Aerosmith also star. Cameos by Kobe Bryant, Gene Simmons (of Kiss), Fred Durst (Of Limp Bizkit) and Seth Green (Knockaround Guys, Tv's Buffy and Angel) who plays a music video director named Shotgun. The cast look good especially Thurman but Christina Milian is not the best choice for the role as Linda Moon..I read the book. I didnt like the Music Video awards segment, I thought that was too corny. Vaughn got some of the highlights but he overblows his character way too much. The Rock also had some moments along with Andre Ice Cold 3000 ("Dont give me no gun"). Doesnt give off that much really....could of been better....with a different director...I mean you take a look at Get Shorty and you take a look at Be Cool and sometimes they connect but othertimes they dont. Very, very upsetting for me. Based from Elmore Leonards novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IKOYZVFHO1XP.html">A1IKOYZVFHO1XP</a><br/><p>In October 1995,John Travolta delighted audiences as Ernest "Chili" Palmer in the megahit GET SHORTY. Nearly a decade later,in this film,we see Chili moving from the movie industry to the music industry. The only other GS cast member to appear in this film is Danny DeVito as film actor Martin Weir. The first encounter between Chili and Martin is at a nightclub called the Viper Room. Chili was on his way in and Martin was on his way out. At the club,Chili discovers a singer named Lynda Moon(Christina Milian) with her group called The Chicks. Chili personally appoints himself as Lynda's new business manager. But Lynda's current manager(before Chili's self-appointment) and his bodyguard are at the club also watching The Chicks in action. Lynda is currently under contract which will not expire for another five years. But Chili revokes the contract and has Lynda under a new one. Throughout the film,Chili discovers various R&B,rap and hip-hop artists and manages them. Chili's love interest(Uma Thurman) has an Aerosmith tattoo between her back and buttocks. Vince Vaughn plays Lynda's old business manager. In a later scene,Lynda is singing CRYIN' with Aerosmith(Steven Tyler,Joe Perry,Tom Hamilton,Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford). That song was one of the band's hits in 1993. Thurman's character told Chili in one scene that she once played tennis with Hamilton. She never met the other four Aerosmith members until Lynda's performance with the band. Tyler appeared in several scenes by himself. Previously,Aerosmith appeared as themselves in 1993's WAYNE'S WORLD 2. This movie was filmed over a year before its March 4,2005 theatrical release. The late Robert Pastorelli,late of TV's Murphy Brown,plays some kind of tough guy in this film. Pastorelli committed suicide in early 2004. His previous film credits include BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 and FOLKS!. Also in one of the last scenes,Lynda wins a Grammy for a song she wrote and recorded. Great performances by Cedric The Entertainer and The Rock also. I'm sorry to say that this film unlike GS,was a box office disappointment. I think it's because no one from the first film except DeVito appeared in this film. Gene Hackman,Dennis Farina,Rene Russo and David Paymer,who all appeared in GS,were all written out(their respective characters). There should be another sequel where Chili goes into the television industry. Personally,I enjoyed the film and it deserves another sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is back after ten years and he is looking sleeker and sharkier than ever in his latest film, "Be Cool." Unfortunately, the entire film around him is flat and uninspired, except for a couple of scenes that make you wonder: what happened?<br />Most of the time, Travolta seems to be acting in a different film than his fellow actors. But when he connects: he connects big time as in his scenes with Edie (the glorious Uma Thurman):  his tango-mambo-Sergio Mendez-cha-cha-cha dancing scene with her is absolutely surreal and beautiful. Why/how did director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) go so astray?<br />Another gorgeous scene is Cristina Milian's (Linda Moon) singing onstage with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. But other than these two scenes it is dullsville.<br />There are a couple of chuckles involving The Rock as a gay bodyguard/chauffeur to music mogul Raji (Vince Vaughn) but mostly this film inspires nothing but yawns. The question here is: with this cast how did so much go wrong?<br />First of all the pace is too slow, the editing is slack and boring and the writing is poor at best. Even Billy Wilder would have trouble putting this lame script across.<br />"Be Cool" could have been...but it just isn't.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>When will Hollywood see the error of its ways and at long last learn the lesson that they should attempt to capitalize, at least not too much, on the stupidity of the general movie-going public? Yes, it is more cost-efficient for the movie industry to develop upon successful franchises or potential franchise, churning out sequel after sequel as quickly and cheaply as possible, without having to further extend the production budget. If this means lowering the film's rating from an `R' to a `PG-13', reducing the script to a minimum level of intelligence and sophistication, and dumping leading actors and actresses then they'll do it for the bottom-line. Thankfully this is often only used as a last ditch effort by studios to make a little extra money on the side with a franchise they feel has the potential to make some money in the market but is not one that they feel they have to throw all their cards into to get it done properly. Unfortunately this is becoming more of a common oddity then in the past, which does not bode well for audiences.<br /><br />The story once again follows Chili Palmer as he navigates his way through the world of organized crime, Hollywood movie moguls, and music industry competitors. Chili Palmer, once so enthusiastic and engaged with the then-budding film making business, has grown tired of making movies in Hollywood, in not maintaining the proper creative control of the product he had before. Now he wants to take the time to return to the music industry and after a music mogul friend is whacked during the middle of a lunch meeting to discuss a new script, he takes this opportunity to make a career change. Not only does he have to deal with his friend's widow wife now in charge of the independent record label and a young pop-star in training but also a music industry competitor desperately trying to get to her first, an Eminem-esque manager and his queer bodyguard with stars in his eyes, the Russian mafia, and gangster rappers with three-hundred thousand dollars owed to them by the record label. As they say, you never quite know who is attempting to kill you because in the music industry, it could be anyone. The genius of Get Shorty was the concept of the perfect stylized satire to the Hollywood film making business, which is in severe contrast to Be Cool, its long-delayed and vastly inferior sequel, that is truly nothing more then a trumped up gangster flick, not the classic kind, with the occasional medley for filler. One of the script's major flaws, and there were quite a few of them to choose from, was the lack of back-stories included with any of the film's supporting characters, most importantly that of Linda Moon. Any information that the audience receives about her, beyond the clich&eacute;d "dead father was a musician too" excuse, is minimal at best. There is no motivation, for either the audience to root for her or an understanding of the characters actions, in her attempting to make it within the music industry.<br /><br />Here we have John Travlota in the same tried and true cool, collective character that has been so overdone, with fault falling largely on himself, in the course of the last decade or two which is quite difficult to watch such a sad state of affairs. Where is Quentin Tarantino when an old friend desperately needs him right now? Speaking of Tarantino, Uma Thurman went from Kill Bill to this? True, there are risks taken in the Hollywood business but does it necessarily have to be a suicidal one such as this? Not surprisingly, Vince Vaughn, along with The Rock, easily steal the show in the roles of Raji, Moon's white manager who talks and acts as if he were a black man ala Eminem, and Elliot Wilhelm, Raji's queer bodyguard with aspirations to become an actor, which is a real surprise for everyone in the audience (sarcasm intended). In spite of the fact that their characters and the jokes involving them get quite old by the time the credits begin rolling, the moments that do work are the saving grace of this picture from being an absolute waste of time and money. There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that Christina Milian is quite possibly a sweet girl and honestly has the true motivation to get involved in the motion picture industry as an actress, but history would prove otherwise. If past experience has taught us anything it is that singers should stick to what they do best, singing, while performers should remain with what they are best at, in particular cases this only has to be assumed and not true to fact, with no crisscrossing in between the two separate entities. Why did the screenwriters feel it was their prerogative to have James Woods' character killed off at the beginning of the movie? Did James actually read the script and secretly paid the writers to have him whacked off early enough in the feature that audiences would not recall him? For those who happen to be fans of the actor's respectable career in the movie industry this is an assumption that should be gladly accepted. And why is Danny DeVito features on the film's poster if he only has two, if not unnecessary or unexplained, appearances throughout the film's entire two hour time-length?<br /><br />Moving on, let us get straight to the heart of the matter which is to discuss the rather insane amount of superfluous cameo appearances in this film. Anybody who is anybody, or perhaps more appropriately anyone who has the connections to spend a day shooting a quick scene in order to keep that limelight bulb flickering for a few years longer, makes an appearance in this disaster. Despite not speaking a single line of dialogue and appearing only briefly, quite possibly by accident, could Fred Durst's cameo have been timed more perfectly with the release of his sex tape? What a marketing genius! Beyond Steven Tyler, the rest of Aerosmith, most notably Joe Perry, cameo in this feature, and even when the material stinks and the dialogue given isn't worth the price of the paper it was written on, they are still the greatest rock band in the world. It would be stating the obvious to say that the Black Eyed Peas are a joke and can not sing worth a lick, but who would have thought that they were even worse when onscreen? Other appearances include Gene Simmons, Rhumba Bums, the Pussycat Dolls, Dub MDs, and Sergio Mendes. And who could forget, in case you missed her, Anna Nicole Smith's memorable kiss with Danny DeVito at the Lakers' game? Honestly, why is she even in this film to begin with? Does she not have a horrendous enough reputation that she need soil it further with a lousy film career, not involving the porn industry that is.<br /><br />Overall, Be Cool itself may be the true reason as to why Chili Palmer is so vehement in his efforts to get out of the movie business. As he himself said in the film, it has become too commercialized, restrictive, controlling, lacking in proficiency ... the fact that this project got the go-ahead from studio executives proves that they either did not bother to read the script or failed to pick up the writers' hidden message. In any event, who needs satire or parodies when you have a film out there that is willing, intentionally or not, to make fun of itself at the expense of others? The question has to be asked as to how extensive of a production budget this feature had. Why? There's enough glaring product placement in this walking-talking train-wreck to make even Adam Sandler cry. It was once understandable for MGM Studios to do this sort of thing but did they not just get bought out by the Sony Corporation? The average movie-goer does not pay eight bucks per person, along with the ever escalating prices for popcorn and drinks, to have ten to twenty minutes worth of advertising thrown into their face only to have an entire feature film throw around corporate logos like they were out of style. Capitalism is a tremendous valuable endeavor but there comes a time when marketing tends to exceed its `natural' limits, and this may be one of those times where it has to be stopped. As was said before, Get Shorty was the pinnacle of Hollywood satires upon itself but those big-wig executives enacted their revenge with this monstrosity. Okay, perhaps it was not at the level of `Michael Moore'-esque conspiracy theories, but after witnessing such disasters as The Whole Ten Yards, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, and Exorcist: The Beginning you have to wonder why studios would intentionally ruin viable stand-alone films. Sadly, Hollywood is Hell-bent on riding the sequel wagon for all its worth and it is going to take a lot more then a few duds that cost them practically nothing, possibly even gaining a profit thanks to product placement, to deter them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Let's get right to the point, it sucked!  The Rock as a Homo?  Dwayne Johnson, are you that desperate for money?  Please don't do any more movies like this!  You've been warned!</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>When I told friends that I would be attending a sneak preview of the sequel to GET SHORTY, every single one said the same thing (in more or less these words):  "Was there really any demand for a sequel?"  They had a point, since I must confess that although I remember more or less enjoying GET SHORTY, I can not remember a single thing that happened in the original.  I remember it starred John Travolta, Danny DeVito, and Delroy Lindo, but not much else.  Having said that, I must admit that I enjoyed BE COOL.  It is not a masterpiece, and very likely I won't remember much of it a few months after having seen it, but for the hundred or so minutes that I watched it I found myself laughing much of the time, and all in all having a good time.<br /><br />Basically, BE COOL sets out to be an enjoyable light comedy, and it succeeds.  It features a large and largely excellent cast having a pretty good time.  The only real returning cast member from GET SHORTY is John Travolta (though Danny DeVito has a few cameos) as Chilli Palmer, former shylock turned movie producer, and who now wants to get into the music business after having become disenchanted with the movies.  He gets his opportunity when a friend (played briefly by James Woods) tells him about a great young musical talent he wants to get into the movies, and who on Woods's death becomes his charge.  Well, more or less, for much of the movie revolves around who is going to be Linda Moon's (played appealing by Christina Milian) manager.  There are additional plot elements involving Russian gangster, the efforts of the Ivy League educated manager of a gangster rap group (played by Cedric the Entertainer) to get the three hundred thousand dollars that Woods owed him, and other odds and ends, the kind of details that tend to fade in the mind after having seen it.<br /><br />I don't want to pretend that this is anything other than light-handed fun.  It is one of those films that is fairly predictable even if you can't predict what is going to happen.  But I did find it fun.  Vince Vaughan was good for some laughs as a black talking/acting music manager, but I enjoyed even more The Rock, playing his body guard.  I had more or less dismissed The Rock as someone who could ever interest me for more than a nanosecond, based on the utterly dreadful string of previous roles he had undertaken, but I loved how he played against type in this one, showing more of a sense of humor than one might have anticipated.  Though a body guard, he is a gay who will pulverize anyone who calls attention to his sexuality, and is pretty funny in a music video where he performs the Dolly Parton classic "You Aren't Woman Enough to Take My Man" and in a scene where he briefly auditions by performing two female roles from the cheerleader pic BRING IT ON.  Mind you, he isn't one of the world's great comedians, but unlike his action films, he was actually fun and his character interesting.  He was, by the way, almost unrecognizable at first, because he actually had hair for a change.  The rest of the cast is solid, though no one produces what could even remotely be considered their best work.  John Travolta and Uma Thurman have a romance of sorts and even have a dance number together, but by and large they fail to reproduce the chemistry they had in PULP FICTION.  I was pleased to see Debi Mazar get a small role, an actress I've always liked, but have never gotten to see in any good roles.<br /><br />So, I can mildly recommend this if you are looking for a fairly funny flick and go to see it with minimal expectations.  If you are looking for a truly great film, go see SIDEWAYS instead.  I personally have always subscribed to the theory expounded by Harvard philosopher Stanley Cavell that you don't truly love the movies unless you like most movies.  I like this one just fine, though I doubt if in six months I will be able to tell you a single thing that happened in it.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>The title Be Cool is ironic because the film isn't as cool as Get Shorty. Be Cool, unlike Get Shorty, takes a while to get going. But when it does, Be Cool is a very funny movie. Being a much bigger film fan than a fan of the music scene, I got more of the jokes in Get Shorty. Still, it's a worthy sequel.<br /><br />I do miss Rene Russo, Gene Hackman and Dennis Farina from the original. Russo is still sexy at 51. Hackman is one of the finest actors in film history, able to do comedy and drama equally well. And Farina always adds greatly to whatever project he's in. But Uma Thurman, Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel do an admirable job in essentially the same roles (Thurman's first scene, in a skimpy bikini, is sure to arouse any man with a pulse). Vince Vaughn is pretty funny as a white guy who thinks he's black although the routine gets tired by the end of the movie. And the late Robert Pastorelli, in his last role, is as funny as usual as a mob hitman who makes eating cole slaw one of the most nauseating experiences imaginable.<br /><br />However, The Rock steals the show from just about everyone as Vaughn's musclebound gay bodyguard. I didn't like The Scorpion King at all and wondered what all the hype regarding The Rock was about. After seeing Be Cool, I understand. The Rock hits all of the right notes in a role that is essentially self-satire, right down to the raised eyebrow. He creates a very likable character without becoming a buffoonish oaf. In fact, a couple of the biggest laughs in the film are The Rock's towards the end of the film.<br /><br />But of course, the film succeeds primarily because of John Travolta's ultra-cool reprise of Chilli Palmer. Played by a lesser actor, Palmer could come off as cocky and arrogant and immediately lose the audience's sympathy. However Travolta, as he did in Get Shorty, finds just the right tone to project Palmer confidence without sliding into arrogance. My only complaint is that Travolta is still smoking -- something you definitely don't need to do to be cool.<br /><br />Hopefully, in the next film, Chilli Palmer will take on the television industry. Reality shows alone will provide enough comic material to carry a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I, having seen the movie Get Shorty and having loved it, was excited about this movie. That was until I saw the lame previews. The Rock didn't look funny nor did Vince vaughn but I decided to give it a shot. I was right. It was a major letdown with some good laughs but the movie seemed boring, stupid, and just weird at times. The Rock playing a gay bodyguard wasn't funny, Vince Vaughn acting black wasn't funny, and the rest of the cast wasn't that good either. The movie has an all star cast with over 10 actors I'm very familiar with. That's weird but cool. But, it just wasn't funny. The plot is about Chili Palmer who leaves the Movie business for the Music business. He then finds a good prospect in a young singer. The movie has some good laughs but mostly nothing. If you want to laugh, watch get shorty and not this. Believe me, it's not funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Be Cool has been getting some terrible reviews, but it isn't really that bad. Yes - the move has some problems - it's about 30 minutes to long, it steadily loses focus towards the end, and some of the plot resolutions are not as imaginative as they could be - but in general, Be Cool offers some good laughs and is by and large an entertaining mish-mash of ridiculous and outrageous fun.<br /><br />Viewers don't need to have seen the first movie Get Shorty to appreciate Be Cool. This movie more than readily stands on its own, and continues the story of Shylock Chili Palmer (John Travolta) and his efforts to become an influential force in the music business. The movie begins with his best mate Tommy Athens (James Woods) getting violently gunned down by a helmet-headed Russian mafia hit man with a bad toupee. Tommy and his gorgeous wife Edie (Uma Thurman) ran NTL, a previously successful record label that has secretly been floundering. They have desperately needed a hit player.<br /><br />Chili visits Edie who is sun baking on the porch of a glamorous house, high in the Hollywood Hills. Chili tells her about Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a young singer who wants to be break into the industry. She's talented and gifted, but Linda is presently under contract with Raji (Vince Vaughn) and Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) of Car-o-Sell Records. Edie who obviously has a soft spot for Chili is more than willing to allow him adopt the role of music manager and court Linda. Edie also lets him protect her from the various scoundrels harassing her for Tommy's debts.<br /><br />Tommy died owing Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer) about $300,000, and now Sin is harassing Edie for the money. Sin, a wealthy and prosperous music manager, travels around Los Angeles in a collection of oversized Hummers threatening people with a posse of silver gun slinging rap stars called Dub MDs (including Andre Benjamin). Chili in an effort to "be cool" tries to play off the various sides and come out on top; he also wants to escape from the clutches of Raji. Raji, in turn, works with muscleman Elliot Wilhelm (a riotous The Rock). Elliot is a gay actor who Chili keeps pacifying with the promises of an audition.<br /><br />The story keeps pummeling along as each party tries to outwit and double-cross each other, but amongst all this Chili stays unruffled using his amazing powers of persuasion and influence to get his way. He confronts black gangland rap killers, a collection of mafia-like Russians who run a hockshop that masquerades for the headquarters of their criminal enterprise, while also managing to charm Steven Tyler (who looks strangely like Joan Rivers) from the rock band Aerosmith.<br /><br />It's obvious that Be Cool is a satire on the Los Angles music industry, and it generally succeeds. But most viewers will have had enough by the end of two hours and this viewer was thankful that it ended when it did. Travolta, Thurman, and The Rock are the main reasons to see this movie. They give the strongest performances, with the whimsical flirtation between Chili and Edie sustaining a good part of the picture. Their cute, innocent, and sexy dance together proves that they are the ones who own the movie. The Rock is also terrific as Elliot, proving once again that he is a man of many talents.<br /><br />Be Cool is entertaining enough and there are certainly some good chuckles and outright laughs along the way; there's also some good shots of Los Angeles, especially along Sunset Blvd and some nice aerial shots from high on the Hollywood Hills; but all too often the movie seems to go astray, wandering in search of the next funny moment or the next over-the-top scenario. Mike Leonard March 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>You can tell within the first two minutes that Be Cool isn't going to come close to living up to 1995's Get Shorty, which actually embodied the titular sentiment of this limp sequel. Director Gray and screenwriter Paul Steinfeld waste no time in winking at us, joking about how lame sequels are, and stupid compromises made to get a PG-13 rating. But instead of getting us to laugh, it only shows how desperate they are to please.<br /><br />The plot has Travolta's hustler-turned-movie-producer Chili Palmer getting out of movies and into music when he discovers a talented young singer (Milian), teaming up with Edie (Thurman), a record executive's widow. Chili is beset by a colorful cast of lowlifes: Cedric the Entertainer and the Rock make the most of their roles, but Vince Vaughn is unbelievably grating as the white-guy-who-thinks-he's-black.<br /><br />While Get Shorty had no trouble selling Chili's love of movies, his love of music comes across as contrived, designed only to pimp the acts (Aerosmith, Black Eyed Peas) who've been paid to show up. Memorable lines from Get Shorty are recycled ad nauseam, and Travolta and Thurman dance and try to re-create Pulp Fiction's magic. There are one or two funny lines and enough stars to guarantee everyone at least a moment of pleasure. But a moment is all you're likely to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Ok this movie is low on plot with the little plot it having being lame. Plus basically it just jumps from one thing to another. Still though I don't know how Roger Ebert could just dismiss it with a * 1/2 review. The supporting cast is hilarious and they make the movie very enjoyable. John Travolta and Uma Thurman are just cool in their roles and add some class to the movie. While everyone else is having a good time goofing off and getting paid for it.<br /><br />  The Rock is great as a bodyguard who wants to be an actor and who's also just a little....fruity. In his movies you just think of him as...The Rock. Here he blends in as an actor with guys like John Travolta and Vince Vaughn. He shows his comic talents and shows he has a much brighter career ahead of him than just being brainless action films. Vince Vaughn is also very funny as a wannabe hip-pop gangster named Raji.<br /><br />  He's fighting with Travolta over the contract of a new talented singer. So that's what the whole plot is basically. Chili Palmer "Travolta" decides he wants to get into making music instead of movies. He finds a new singer and decides to make her a star. I found the movie plot in Get Shorty to be better. Shorty is just a better movie because it's more original and better made. I find most of the music scenes to last too long because they aren't the strong points of the film or what make it good. You feel like saying ok stop singing I  just want to laugh more.<br /><br />  This movie has a lot of funny and odd ideas and the cast pulls them off great. I mean the Rock has the best and weirdest material I've seen in a movie in years. His character won't admit he's gay yet he does a music video singing a Dolly Pardon song. Also when he auditions in front of Travolta he chooses to reinact a cheerleader scene from Bring It On. The Rock is a gonna be big and he shows that here. I mean Vin Diesel makes a joke out of himself by trying comedy in the Pacifer. While the Rock shows here he can do whatever he chooses to do and he can handle it perfectly.  Plus Travolta is also better than he has been in years here. Is sad though that all him and Uma get to do after awhile is bob there heads to a song they like. So don't see the movie just to see them reunite because you might be disapointed. This is a weak character for Thurman especially after being so damn good as the Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Just go if you want a good laugh from the supporting cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Streetwise mobster-turned-movie producer Chili Palmer is back, but this time Chili has abandoned the fickle movie industry and veered into the music business, tangling with Russian mobsters and gangsta rappers and taking a talented, feisty young singer named Linda Moon under his wing. From the recording studio to an Aerosmith concert to the MTV Music Awards, he manipulates events to watch them play out the Chili way, using his signature blend of wiseguy skills and negotiation tactics. It's a dangerous business, and everyone's looking for their next big hit. Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>I usually review movies in a certain way, but for this one, I'm just gonna get right down to why I think this movie is pretty darn good. I was actually shocked to see it rated as low as it is. I know it's a sequel to Get Shorty (which I remember being good...but I just can't remember it), but it honestly feels like its own movie. It feels like it has almost nothing to do with its predecessor. I'm going to actually tell you 10 reasons why I like it.<br /><br />1. John Travolta plays Chili Palmer perfectly. I love how he's a smooth tough guy with a brain. He gets just about anything he wants, and can totally out play anyone by reading who they are perfectly.<br />2. Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson is hilarious. I've liked Dwayne since he was The Rock on WWF. He was always funny, even when he was supposed to be on the bad guy side. You couldn't help like his cocky demeanor. Here though, he plays a tough guy (supposedly) body guard for Raji. Oh and he's gay. He loves looking good and loves acting and singing.<br />3. Vince Vaughn is amazing as the music manager Raji, a white guy who acts and dresses in a black guy pimpish kind of way. Hearing him talk is priceless. I love when he starts talking like he's a bad mutha, but then quickly backs down when confronted.<br />4. Cedric the Entertainer plays Sin LaSalle, a music recorder/mixer. A very educated black man, that is great at what he does. I love the fact that the first time you see him, he's acting more like some goofy rich white dude. Then you see his crew role up in hummers with spinners and loud music, and guns stuck in their very low riding jeans, and you know how he truly is. He's a gangsta in sheep's clothing.<br />5. Andre (from the rap group Outkast) is Sin's cousin, Dabu. He's a straight up thug, who always loud and just wants to kill someone and doesn't care who. At first he was kind of annoying, but I was wrong, he's funny.<br />6. Stereotyping is rampant in this movie. I don't like racism, but I do think jokes about stereotypes are funny. Which is why I think Carlos Mencia can be funny, as well as Dave Chappell who I think is a comedic genius. Even Chris Rock. Those guys know how to spread it around, to make you feel like you are not being singled out. That's kind of how this movie makes me feel.<br />7. The story itself, even with some definite holes, is a lot of fun. Watching how the back stabbings unfold is great. Especially when Raji gets called out by Sin. Hilarious.<br />8. Christina Milian is not a great actress, but she sure doesn't hurt my eyes.<br />9. This list isn't going to make it to 10 things.<br />10. Did I mention Vince Vaughn and the Rock? Seriously, they were amazing in every scene they were in. I laughed hard a lot when they were on.<br /><br />Though I really liked Be Cool, it sure wasn't perfect. Probably my biggest gripe was the god awful blatancy of the product placements. I don't know how many times we had to see the Honda Insight car or the T-Mobile Sidekick or all the other name drops in the movie to get it in our heads that they were in there. I laughed one time when the camera was slightly zoomed in on the back of the sidekick while somebody was texting someone. T-MOBILE SIDEKICK. Ugh... it was horrible.<br /><br />So in the end, I really liked the movie. I don't even think of it as being a sequel to Get Shorty. I laughed a lot and am definitely glad I own this movie. Give it a try.<br /><br />P.S. - I love when Raji and Elliot (The Rock) are talking about getting some chicken. I don't think they said the whole name, but you can tell they were talking about Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles...hehe. I've always wanted to eat there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments.<br /><br />However, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.<br /><br />An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.<br /><br />F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>CHILI PALMER [JOHN TRAVOLTA, ALWAYS PUTTING IN A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS ALWAYS] DECIDES TO LEAVE THE MOVIE BUSINESS FOR THE MUSIC BUSINESS.

At first, it's quite amusing watching Travolta's suave Chili Palmer character interact with white boy hip-hop poser Raji (Vince Vaughn) or with widow turned record label exec Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), as it was very apparent that the actors in this film all had a great time working with each other, especially between Travolta and Thurman who's eagerness and willingness to work together is obviously there (although I`d have to say their big dance scene was a little disappointing). But the problem with Be Cool is that after so long, you become used to this bright chemistry between the actors, and you realize that there really isn't much of a skeletal structure behind this film, and that's it's all flesh.<br /><br />In between the only moderately funny parts in Be Cool, this movie almost kills you with boredom. I mean, there is some pretty funny parts here and there, but it's rather uninteresting story line about a young female singer's rise to the top of stardom and the murderous plot between everyone who wants control the rights to the star seems a little contrived with all the setups and with this person wanting to kill this person or this person owing someone else a lot of money and blah blah blah. The story really tries hard to maintain it's head above water, but somewhere in it's complexity, it just really fails to maintain its audience, dragging the audience and the rest of film down with it like an anchor to the bottom of the ocean.<br /><br />On more of a positive note, there was a part I found especially amusing in this film that happened in the opening scene where Chili is talking about the film industry and how if you want to maintain a PG-13 rating when making a movie, you can only use the F word once. So Travolta lays on a big "F*** that!", exercising his right use the F word in a PG-13 movie. Or how he's always bashing sequels in this movie, when in fact this movie is a sequel (sort of but doesn't really feel like one) to Get Shorty. There's a ton of this self-referential comedy in Be Cool, and I'm a total sucker for self-referentialism.<br /><br />So all in all I would to say this is a pretty boring and uninteresting movie, but it's sense of self-referential comedy and colorful characters just barely make it doable.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>F. Gary Gray's pointless sequel to 1995's "Get Shorty" has John Travolta reprising his role as lone shark turned movie producer, Chili Palmer. This time around, Chili wants out of movies and into the music industry. His first prospect is the gorgeous and talented Linda Moon (played by R&B singer Christina Millian) who is being mishandled by her current managers. In attempting to acquire her services, he goes up against a serious of outrageous bad guys including a gangsta rap honcho and his misfiring associate, a goofy Caucasion pimp, a gay bodyguard, and some Russian assassins. "Be Cool" has some amusing moments but it is way too watered down to be useful. Gray opts to play the film more like a big-budget Hollywood sequel with tons of big stars and goofy cliches than to give Elmore Leonard's style the attention it deserved. Previous attempts to adapt Leonard's work (Out Of Sight, Jackie Brown) were home runs because they played their humor more smooth and subtle where "Be Cool" tries too hard to be a comedy. Travolta doesn't bring anything new to the table in his portrayal of Chili and the script has the usual rehashed material that comes with sequels. If "Be Cool" had half of the character and style as "Get Shorty", they might have had something but unfortunately, it offers nothing more than a few assorted laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I haven't read Elmore Leonard's follow up to Get Shorty, so I am unsure of how closely the movie follows the novel.  But what we have here in the movie is actors trying too hard to make you laugh.  It's a funny set up that's not executed right.<br /><br />Chili Palmer, having left the Shylock business to produce movies in Get Shorty has...left the movie business to produce music in Be Cool.  However, the music business is just as cut throat as the movie business apparently as Chili finds himself the target of a gang, the Russian mafia, crooked music execs, a gay body guard (the Rock who is probably the only truly funny person in the movie), and a hitman.<br /><br />If you've seen Get Shorty, this will seem very familiar.  And that's because it is.  The only difference is that instead of being in the movie industry, we're in the music industry and instead of being consistently funny, we are only semi-funny, some of the time.<br /><br />There are a couple homages to the first movie, bill boards, Danny Devito's character, and similar situations (like Uma and Travolta waking up in the middle of the night because they hear the TV on downstairs), so it was kind of fun to catch those little touches.<br /><br />I'm really at a loss of what to say, it's kind of like when they made the Whole Ten Yards, they are trying too hard to be just like the original that they fall flat.  For those who haven't seen Get Shorty, it MIGHT be better.  For those who have seen Get Shorty, I wouldn't bother with this movie.  The best way I can describe this movie is that it's Get Shorty if Get Shorty weren't directed or written by the same people.  And the people that wrote it weren't very funny.  It's a shame because with all the talent that's in the movie, you'd think it'd click.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie tremendously. This is laugh out loud good. The movie about shylock Chili Palmer who's burnout after the sequel to his movie was a bust. Decides to get into the music businesss after discovering Linda Moon played by Christina Milan who is terrific as a actress and singer. The cast of characters in this movie are terrific. But the standouts are Cedric the Enterainer and Andre of the group Outkast. Also the part when Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing is great as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>You get John Travolta and Uma Thurman.  You get a bunch of solid supports like Vince Vaughn, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre Benjamin, Harvey Keitel, James Woods, The Rock, Robert Pastorelli, Christina Milian, and Danny DeVito.  You get amusing cameos by Steven Tyler, Sergio Mendes, and many others.  Plus you get the original book of Elmore Leonard.  And then you get just OK 'Be Cool' unexceptional comedy drama.  In short, you don't have anotherr 'Get Shorty'; you only get short-changed.<br /><br />Chili Palmer who was seen in 'Get Shorty' comes back, and in this sequel he wants to move into the music industy.  But as you know, finding and promoting talented artists could be a tough job.  Even if you find one, the job could be killing you when your record company is in heavy debt, and some gangsters are after you.  But Chilie would be always cool, no matter what happen.  He could also get gorgeous Edie played by Uma Thurman -- cue to them on the dancing floor ala 'Pulp Fiction' -- and see a basketball game with Steven Tylor, one of the many, many cameos.<br /><br />In Elmore Leonard characters are everything, not the story, so I can forgive the complicated plot of the film.  I admit some characters are interesting, especially The Rock's Elliot, a thug who wants to be a movie star.  Stragely, the supports like Vince Vaughn and Andre Benjamin are more impressive than the two leading stars.<br /><br />[OFFBEAT? NO JUST FLAT] There is a fine line between being off-beat and flat, and if 'Get Shorty' belongs to the former, 'Be Cool' is described as the other.  In spite of some funny moments, like The Rock parodying his public image, director F Gary Gray overdoes it.  See how Elliot raises his eyebrow twice, while once is enough.  See a Russian mafioso's wig blown away twice, not once.  See Sin La Salle, the gangster played by Cedric the Entertainer acts before his lovely daughter as a good father ... twice.  No wonder the film runs 120 minutes.<br /><br />But actually, only one example would suffice to prove that 'Be Cool' needs Tarantino's skills.  There is a scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together.  When they are in the same frame, everyone expects that, and yes, that happens.  And though the tension is not as high as the now classic Jack Rabbit Slim scene, the chemstry is there.  Sadly, however, the director ruins it with cut, cut, and cut, giving emphasis to God knows what.  That's when I missed the hand of Tarantino, who knows what he is doing, and knows what is going on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C7BWPATO40VA.html">A1C7BWPATO40VA</a><br/><p>I'm never looking at commercials again...<br /><br />This movie wasn't HORRIBLE, it just wasn't that great. Was sort of boring and dull. Not as good as I thought it would and disappointed. Only watched it once. Its worth the watch if you're curious, so rent it instead of buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'Be Cool' continues the Hollywood adventures of Chili Palmer, played by John Travolta.  The story starts in 'Get Shorty,' in which Chili moved west to Los Angeles while following one of his clients that skipped on debt owed to Chili, a former loan shark.  While in LA, Chili, a fan of classic movies, got into the movie business.  Now, in 'Be Cool,' Chilie has begun to tire of the movie business and attempts to break into the music business after a friend, played by James Woods, that happens to be a producer in the business, gets gunned down by Russian gangsters.<br /><br />This movie, like 'Get Shorty,' is adapted from the novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard.  In many ways, this movie is better than the novel.  For one thing, Chili and company have much more direction in the movie.  They don't sit around waiting for things to happen, or waiting to see how things will turn out.  In the novel, Chili got into the music business just to get ideas for a new movie.  Not so in the movie.<br /><br />There are some other differences between the novel and the movie that contribute to the movies success.  For one, Linda Moon, played by Christina Milian, is a white rock star in the novel, and a black pop artist in the movie.  This was a good change for the movie because it kept things more focused and it was easier to bring the movie up to date.  Some roles, such as Sin Lasalle (Cedric the Entainer) that were minimal, or nonexistent, in the novel have been expanded to worthy additions for the movie.<br /><br />'Be Cool' is wonderfully self referential.  Take note at the beginnning of the movie when Chili is in his car talking about movies, specifically the difference between an R rated film and a PG-13 rated film, and how many times the F word can be used.  Then count the number of times it is and check the rating of the movie.  Also, make special note of the conversations with Steven Tyler of Aerosmith as he discusses what a rock star would and would not need to do.<br /><br />Overall, 'Be Cool' is a worthy successor to 'Get Shorty,' but not quite as good.  It suffers from some of the complained of deficiencies of sequels that Leonard voiced in his novel.  Uma Thurman has a fun role (which is somewhat unusual for her as of late), and is a great addition to the film.  The Rock fans should get a good laugh out of his performance as Eliot Wilhelm, who just won't come out and admit he is gay.  Vince Vaughn turns in a great performance as a wannabe gangster/manager that pretends he is black.<br /><br />Leonard fans and fans of 'Get Shorty' should enjoy 'Be Cool.'  Travolta fans should be pleased as well.  Don't expect a comedy that will have you falling out of your seat laughing.  Make sure to check out the DVD extras, especially the gag/blooper reel.<br /><br />Overall:  4.25 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I want to begin this review by stating that "Be Cool" is based on the novel by Elmore Leonard and is the sequel to "Get Shorty."<br /><br />This movie has all the makings of a bad sequel. Different director, different screenwriter, 98% different cast, take a dialouge driven comedy and make the sequel a comedy. Etcetera, etcetera. Having said that, I did like this movie. I've seen<br /><br />"Get Shorty" twice, have read the book and read the book "Be Cool" as well. I knew going into this film it wasn't going to be as good as "Get Shorty" and it's not. GS was a great movie, with fantastic dialouge and an interesting Elmore Leonard-like story line. This movie has an all around different mood to it and the dialouge isn't bad, but it isn't as good. Be Cool is essentially a comedy, at least that's what it's billed as. Not every joke hits and in fact most fall flat. I liked this movie cause I did laugh a couple of times and seeing John Travolta and Uma Thurman together is great. The two have great screen chemistry that they haven't been able to show off on screen since 1994 when they made "Pulp Fiction". Be Cool is about former shylock-turned movie producer Chili Palmer. Chili has been getting sick of the movie business after making a flop sequel to his hit film "Get Leo." Chili is at a sidewalk cafe talking to his friend (a music producer) Tommy Athens. Tommy tells Chili about a movie idea and also about a talented young singer named Linda Moon. Tommy is shot and killed by a russian man and Chili goes looking for Linda Moon. Linda (Christina Milian) works at The Viper Room singing in a girl group and is under management by Raji (Vince Vaugn, very funny) a wannabe black man. To top that off Raji has a gay bodygard named Elliot (The Rock) who wants to be an actor.<br /><br />Chili becomes Linda's new manager and with the help of Edie Athens (Thurman) he gets her to perform at an Aerosmith concert.<br /><br />Also in the movie is Cedric the Entertainer and Harvey Keitel as<br /><br />a gangsta rap mogul and Raji's boss. Both characters play fairly funny characters, CTE is better. It's nice to see Harvey Keitel, since he's rarely in a movie nowadays. Now as far as being faithful to the book it's probably 80% the same. The 20% is only minor things like Linda Moon had a band called Odessa in the book. B-.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Be Cool" is unmoored from reality - it envisions the music business as a creation straight out of Wyatt Earp's Tombstone - hired guns, rote murders, amiable cops tossed aside in favor of street enforcers. It is, thankfully, a funny movie in bits and pieces, which is as much a testament to Elmore Leonard's book, upon which the movie is based, than anything the performers or director F. Gary Gray bring to the production.<br /><br />The movie is a sequel to "Get Shorty" and reintroduces us to John Travolta as Chili Palmer, the Brooklyn wiseguy who in the first movie exercised his brute charm and mob connections to a career in the film industry. "Get Shorty" was a smarter, dirtier film, with a coherent plot and a director (Barry Sonnenfeld - where'd he go?) wise in the ways of black humor. "Be Cool" has been cut off at the knees - PG-13 goes with gangster like Tang accompanies filet mignon - and features one of those detached, bemused Travolta performances where he sags on the couch, squints and lights cigarettes.<br /><br />Chili is ushered into the tune game rudely - he watches a buddy (James Woods, in cameo) get blasted by a Russian loan shark. Seems the buddy was trying to get cash to buyout the contract of one Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a tiny black diva managed by a giant white fool named Raji (Vince Vaughn). Raji, played with mixture of goof and childlike menace by Vaughn, is one of the chief pleasures of film, a wannabe pimp so far lost in hip-hop lingo and gesture that he seems to forgotten the completely perfect bowl of hair smeared in sweat to his head. So is The Rock as Raji's gay bodyguard, one eye on Linda, one on the kind of showbiz career Chili can promise.<br /><br />There are at least three other sides to this overstuffed cast: Cedric the Entertainer is is a Suge Knight type with a Harvard degree; Andre 3000 as the Suge-type's bodygurard; Harvey Keitel is a record label owner playing both sides; and Uma Thurman is the dead guy's wife. What an odd role for Thurman to accept - a fraidycat former groupie, opposite completely from her "Kill Bill" series. At least she looks fab.<br /><br />"Be Cool" knows very little about the real music business. The day will not come when a girl without a single skimps onstage with Aerosmith for a Steven Tyler duet. Dueling record moguls don't stand around on street corners issuing ultamatums for a wad of cash when a lawsuit would suffice. This is the cartoon version, and the cartoon characters - Vaughn, The Rock, Andre 3000, even Steven Tyler - stick out. The mellower gang of Travolta, Thurman and Keitel drag. And Milian, as Linda Moon, can belt a note, all right, but "Be Cool" does not reveal her as a movie star.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was hilarious; it's one of the most entertaining movies I've seen all year.  Maybe if I had seen Get Shorty, I would have felt differently about this "sequel," but I really don't think so for the simple reason that funny is funny.  John Travolta is still the coolest cat in town, but it's the entire, star-studded cast that really makes Be Cool something I consider rather special.  I think about half of Hollywood appears somewhere in this film, and no one gets in to the spirit of self-parody and hilarity more than The Rock.  Truly, this is The Rock as you've never seen him before.  Vince Vaughan is just ridiculously funny as a white gangsta music manager sporting Sweet Daddy's hand-me-down threads, but even he can smell the kind of unforgettable comedy The Rock is cooking in his scene-stealing performance.<br /><br />I'll admit the movie doesn't have a particularly compelling plot, but this is one case in which plot really doesn't matter all that much.  For what it's worth, though, you have Chili Palmer (Travolta) moving into the music business, trying to make a star out of an obviously talented young lady named Linda Moon (Christina Milian).  Chili happens to have a strong connection to Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), and the timing is perfect for putting the moves on Edie because she has recently become a widow (an event for which Chili had a really good seat).  There's a problem, though, because Linda is under contract with a slimeball named Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel).  Vince Vaughan plays her ludicrously pseudo-ghetto manager Raji.  The Rock is Raji's driver, but he's also a singer and an actor looking for stardom.  I'm telling you, you've got to see this movie just for The Rock's performance alone - he's hilarious, and just wait until you see his character's music video.  But I digress.  You also have some Russian mafia guys running around, and Cedric the Entertainer adds even more to the movie as a music producer/gangsta who brings the whole crew when he rolls up to get in somebody's business - including his wife's cousin Dabu (Andre Benjamin), who just doesn't quite fit the role of a young gangsta.<br /><br />This isn't Pulp Fiction or even Get Shorty.  Don't go looking for Tarantino because you won't find him here.  Be Cool plays solely for laughs, and it got almost two hours out of laughter from me.  It's the kind of movie you can't really describe - it's just too kooky.  I know a lot of viewers hold the movie in low regard, but I would urge you to at least give it a chance.  It really is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time.  And, for the record, I also thought it was pretty darn cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>I was plesently surprised that I enjoyed this movie. I loved GET SHORTY and I really wanted to see BE COOL but the bad reviews kept me away at first. But it was a boring saturday afternoon and we decided to hit the movies and this is what we picked. I found BE COOL charming and funny. Is not laugh out loud funny but witty and lightweight. This is a great film to watch just to pass the time. Overall BE COOL is relaxing entertainment and if I may... cool.<br /><br />Plus Uma and John are wonderful in a lovely reunion to PULP FICTION.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>This is the official sequel to the movie Get Shorty. I don't remember seeing it when I was younger, but if it was even a bit popular, I probably just forgot about it. Don't know the premise or anything, but I just finished watching this so I'll get into describing it a bit.<br /><br />This movie at heart, is a comedy. There are over half a dozen scenes that try and get you to laugh. More or less, they succeed. Especially when Cedric The Entertainer beats a wary opponent with the spatula he just used to cook his lovely daughter some pancakes! There were many serious parts to it to which took me by surprise a little.<br /><br />Linda Moon (the beautiful and somewhat talented Christina Milian) plays the tried and true starlet trying to make it in the music business. She has the pipes and she writes her own songs. You can't beat it really! John Travolta's character tries to get her signed to Uma Thurman's label. It takes a while (they find a mixer, try to get Linda's contract away from the "snake" of the movie and some of the plot takes place in between. Some of it mindless, some of it bearable.<br /><br />Anyway, there are many, MANY well-known actors that play in this movie. You probably know them already, but I'm gonna regurgitate the main names:<br /><br />Starring John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Danny Devito, Christina Milian (she's SOOOO pretty) Andre 3000 from Outkast, The Rock from WWF (right? I don't watch that rubbish. It's fake! >_>), Steven Tyler from Aerosmith (Pink is awesome), Cedric The Entertainer and Debi Mazar (whoever she is >_>).<br /><br />This movie was directed by F. Gary Gray, who I know absolutely nothing about. But he helped create a mildly enjoyable film that's half comedy and half drama (I guess, not sure what else to call it!).<br /><br />The white guy trying to be black had his moments, but was probably off-putting to some, hence the low 2.5 star rating the movie has at the moment. I think the movie overall was slightly better than that, but not by much.<br /><br />Some of the music brought back memories (especially the song that was later "sampled" and made into that one song by Mase and others. You know the one! It came out in the mid 90s, I believe).<br /><br />But the rap music in this movie (which there wasn't much of, Thank Goodness), minus the rap song at the end, was a different story; it royally sucked. There was one song where you just kept hearing the "B-word" over and over again, until you were ready to puke. It was very generic (yes, even more pointless than most "rap" you hear on the radio stations these days, and that's saying something. *looks at T-Pain* *pulls his own hair out at the travesty of the thought* I am no rap fan in the slightest and it must be said that the rap songs here were terrible. Mindless isn't descriptive enough.<br /><br />This movie gets 3 stars from me. I can tolerate comedies to a certain point, but that's not all this was and I'm happy things turned out that way! =D<br /><br />My two favorite scenes are first, where John and Uma's characters dance to the Black Eyed Peas song, which is my favorite by them, and is so underrated, Sexy, from their first CD that had Fergie on it, Elephunk. Fergie had a washboard stomach and made a short cameo with the other group members.<br /><br />Half-heartedly recommended.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />John's character was very smooth. People pointed guns at him 2-3 times in the movie, and he managed to talk his way out of the situations all but one time.<br />Christina Milian sings her heart out. I also think that "Believer" was a song she wrote. She also makes for a very charismatic actress. She also sings, "Crazy" with Steven Tyler!<br />It's a comedy that has serious tones to it.<br />The Rock is SO hot in it! But sometimes he overdoes the gay act. >_><br />Mild replayability.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It's a comedy. >_><br />Most of the rap songs are horrible.<br />Sometimes it's not all that funny.<br />The gay guy gets back stabbed. v_v<br /><br />3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HWD9PTM7RBXN.html">A2HWD9PTM7RBXN</a><br/><p>I am amazed at all these bad reviews.  Whereas maybe it was not on the same level as Get Shorty, there wre some captivating scenes.  John Travolta and The Rock alone make this film reasonable.  The back and forth hustles by all these hitmen can get a bit annoying.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the laughs and a decent storyline.  Nothing that is going to win acadmy awards but certainly a nice light movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>If you saw the previews for this movie you saw the best parts. Trouble is, with all the senseless filler in between the "funny parts" aren't funny anymore.<br /><br />Waste of such a talented cast, especially The Rock, his part should have been bigger. Not worth buying new, get a used copy if you must.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Get Shorty was one of the greatest comic crime movies of all time, created from the Elmore Leonard novel of the same title.  In fact, the movie introduced me to Leonard's unique brand of crime fiction, and I have been a fan ever since.  Upon seeing Be Cool, I was dismayed that Leonard didn't have a hand in it...and then imagine my surprise upon finding out that he did write a follow-on novel that the movie was based on!  It seems like we're missing all the macro-scale comic justice of a Leonard novel, and instead just getting some cheap laughs with an all-star cast.<br /><br />I will admit that there are some unforgettable characters in here, namely Vince Vaughn as a wanna-be black gangster, and The Rock as a gay Samoan bodyguard.  Uma Thurman is beautiful, to be sure, but she's not in her prime like Rene Russo and Gene Hackman were in the original movie.  John Travolta's performance is, of course, spot-on.  It's like Leonard wrote the character of Chili Palmer for him.  No one else could pull of the gangster-smooth charm with old-school movie and music knowledge.<br /><br />The sequel pays homage to the original in several scenes, namely Chili's renting of the "Cadillac of hybrids" and two scenes in which bad guys break in and alert the homeowners to their presence by turning the TV or stereo up.  For hardcore fans of Get Shorty, this is worth a viewing, but it isn't a masterpiece like the original.</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>When is John Travolta going to find a screen role worthy of his talent?</p></br></body></html>

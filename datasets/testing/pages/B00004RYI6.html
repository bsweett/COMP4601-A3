Directed and co-produced by Alex Proyas (The Crow; I, Robot), whose original story he adapted into a screenplay with David S. Goyer (Batman Begins) and Lem Dobbs, Dark City follows John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), a man who wakes up in a dark hotel bathroom with no recollection of how or when he got there. Before long, he's the lead suspect in a murder investigation led by detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and he's being contacted by a mysterious psychiatrist named Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland). To make matters worse, as he searches for his wife (Jennifer Connelly), he also must evade a strange group of creatures called "The Strangers," who have perpetrated eternal darkness on the film's city and have the ability to change its landscapes and put its inhabitants to "sleep" at will. Proyas' vision is a terrifying one that exhibits similarities to other sci-fi works such as The City of Lost Children (which would have made the list had the list been longer), and served as a mild influence for The Matrix trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>John Murdock(Rufuss Sewel)is in trouble. He just woke up in a motel room, and has no memory of how he got there. To make matters worse, there is a dead woman next to him, and he soon discovers that he is the prime suspect in a murder investigation involving prostitutes. He is being chased on both sides of the law. Inspector Frank Bumstead ( William Hurt) is a skilled cop that never gives up. He only believes in what he sees, and in his eyes, John is a murderer. But things are about to get a lot worse when John discovers his other pursuers. &quot;The Strangers&quot; are a mysterious group of beings that possess the ability to stop time and alter reality. John is now determined to solve the riddle of why the city is always different day after day, why it's always dark, and why they are after him. The only problem, is that the truth could be fatal... <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of the best Sci-Fi films that you will ever see. The story is in a gotham like city set in the 1940's. All of the costume and building designs are outstanding. Next, the story is extremely original. The idea of being able to alter reality, and keep it from an entire city is actually interesting. Alex Proyas did a great job with how he worked the characters into the story. All the main characters play an important part, and help to further develop the plot. Rufuss Sewel was outstanding as John Murdock. His determination to find out why he's so special is unreal, and when you find out why the &quot;Strangers&quot; are targeting him, you will be very surprised. Jennifer Connelly is great as John's wife. The emotion that she shows is very realistic. Nice chemistry between her and Sewell. Kiefer Sutherland gave my favorite performance. He is the wild scientist that helps &quot;The Strangers&quot; with their mission. It was definately a different role for Sutherland, but still great. William Hurt was great as Frank Brumstead. Plays the typical cop who only believes in rational explanations. &quot;The Strangers&quot; themselves were excellent and actually frightening. <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of my favorite films. The settings, acting, and extremely original story make it a masterpiece in the Sci-Fi genre. The DVD does not have much in the way of extras, but it still the best choice because of the quality and the fact that it is extremely affordable. Definaley a must own!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>I love this film!!  Alot of people dont get it.  They complain that it has no substance and it leaves them feeling cold. I disagree this film is a send up of my favorite genre of cinema-FILM NOIR!!!!  Proyas uses almost every element from that genre in his Dark City.  WE have the femme fatale, the miss-guided male lead, the cloaked bad guys and the worn out detective who just wants a break.  IF you truly love film noir every in-joke in this film you will catch and the city inside a city idea is brilliant and the Matrix owes it's box office to that fact.  I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office but it is one of the best films ever made and needs to be seen by everyone who loves films</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>I saw Dark City when it first came out in 1998 and believe it is a five star sci-fi thriller. Dark and colorful, it is another story of circumstances totally out of control masquerading as possible paranoid delusion.  The ending reminded me of the Matrix, but it was very interestingly done.<br /><br />It appears that the overused theme of an individual (or individuals) suffering from paranoia underwent an increase in usage in middle of the 90's in movies. Fortunately, it was pretty clear almost from the outset of the movie that this was not the case.  The atmosphere of the film was dark, brooding and always troubling, until its Matrix like ending.  John Murdoch is "the one"!<br /><br />This film had absolutely terrific special effects, and featured some good performances of an interesting theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>As a film, I think it is best to say that this is a more defined story along the lines of THE CUBE.<br /><br />It is not until the big reveal at the end that you discover why things are so undeveloped, and why no-one can remember when, specifically, they last saw the sun.<br /><br />This is a great film to watch, and like all of Alex Proyas's work I know of, it is a very fulfilling story... at least on an entertainment level.<br /><br />All the actors are well crafted in their roles, and fulfill  their acting roles in superb  form. Lots of material left to the imagination ... both visual and ( not in a pretentious manner) literary in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It always happens in cinema: a film comes out that wows critics and audiences love...but it went absolutely nowhere. Which is why it's great that films come out on DVD and you can sort out the good ones from the terrible on your own, without it disappearing a few months into their theater runs. Dark City was one of those films, and although it drew a lot of comparisons to the Matrix, this film actually came out a year earlier since this was 1998 and Matrix was 1999. Oh well, it's a great film anyways and shows The Crow wasn't Alex Proyas' beginner's luck. By the way, fans prefer to turn off the sound during the opening narration so my suggestion is the minute you see Keifer Sutherland's character on screen, turn it back on.<br /><br />John Murdoch wakes up in a bathtub, confused and disoriented. In his apartment is the body of a dead hooker with odd looking wounds on her chest. To make matters worse, he's being chased by guys in black coats known as the Strangers. I don't want to spoil the rest (because that opening narration would do it for me anyway) but it's a great film with some familiar scenes with a unique twist, including one twist late in the film that caught me off guard.<br /><br />The film is very much inspired by film noir as probably 97% at least is entirely at night or in poorly-lit buildings. It's a really cool looking film, including one scene where we have a chase while the city goes through a little change. Chase scenes have been done before but this at least makes it unique. It's obvious this is done by the director of the Crow and that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />The special effects, such as Roger Ebert's slightly I'm-so-movie-savvy commentary says, is it's actually about the story and it's not just a case of "look what we can do" which was a problem I had with films like the Star Wars prequels and the 2 Matrix sequels. It's funny how he says there's a charm to effects that look slightly obvious which to me is the opposite: it takes me out of the movie when I notice bad compositing or unfinished looking textures (I'm looking at you King Kong).<br /><br />I would very much recommend this film but like I said, skip the opening narration with the sound off until someone appears on screen, it'll make it much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>+++++<br /><br />This thought-provoking movie begins with the following narration by one of its major characters, a scientist named Dr. Daniel Poe Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland):<br /><br />"First there was darkness, then came The Strangers.  They were a race as time itself.  They had mastered the ultimate technology: the ability to alter physical reality by will alone.  They called this ability "tuning."  But they were dying.  Their civilization was in decline and so they abandoned their world seeking a cure for their own mortality.  Their endless journey brought them to a small blue world in the farthest corner of the Galaxy-our world.  Here they thought they had finally found what they had been searching for..."<br /><br />The actual story then begins with John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakening in a strange hotel room where he finds that he's wanted for a series of murders.  But the problem is that he can't remember a thing.  Pursued by the police led by Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) and haunted by The Strangers, he tries to discover the riddle of his identity.  But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth proves to be a major challenge.<br /><br />The viewer is kept guessing for the first two-thirds of this movie and its in the final one-third that all answers as to what exactly is going on is revealed.<br /><br />A highlight of this movie is the fantastic visuals brought about by mind-boggling special effects.  I thus really believed that The Strangers could alter physical reality (as mentioned in the above narration).<br /><br />Many people did not like Kiefer Sutherland's acting where he gave the scientist character a breathy, almost Peter Lorre type voice.  I, however, liked his performance.  Also look for the fine performance by William Hurt as the police inspector.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD is practically flawless in picture and sound quality.  It has a host of interesting extras, including an audio commentary by Roger Ebert.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a thought-provoking movie that truly "sets a bold new standard in science-fiction."  Be sure to see it, and find out why Roger Ebert named this movie in 1998 as best movie of the year!!<br /><br />(1998;  95 min;  double-sided disc; widescreen/full screen;  16 scenes)<br /><br />+++++</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>For such an original idea this movie didn't do that well in theaters which I am surprised at considering it had good performances by Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and Rufus Sewell. Anyways Dark City focuses on this man named John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who awakens in a strange motel and can't remember a thing. On top of that he is wanted a for a series of murders. Under the Dark city lurks, these creepy underground dwellers who have the power to stop time and alter reality. They switch people's memories and create new ones as well. John Murdoch struggles to unravel his twisted identity but realizes that unraveling the truth can be fatal. Overall a very different original Sci-fi movie, amazing special effects, good acting. As for the dvd two solid commentaries and some comparisons on Fritz lang's "Metropolis" which isn't all that bad, but I guess since this movie wasn't that popular it won't be getting a special edition anytime soon. If it does come out I will deff. be purchasing it, well worth the extra money.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>A $28 million budget art house film that features several actors who have now ascended the ranks of stardom beat The Matrix to the punch in presenting many on screen concepts that questioned what it is to be human.  Very underrated, constantly drifting on the edge of obscurity, Dark City is a magical film that transcends many levels of modern filmmaking with questions of human nature and interactions.<br /><br />The story follows John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who wakes up in a bath tub at the scene of a murder where he soon finds himself pursued by a mysterious group of black clad, pale fleshed men lead by Richard O'Brien (you may know him as the creator, writer, and co-star of the midnight screened, all-time cult favorite musical The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and John must receive aid from a man claiming to be his doctor (TV's 24 star Kiefer Sutherland). Discovering that the black-clad men (referred to as Strangers) control all that is within the city it is up to John to discover the secret of the city, the Strangers, and why the city never sees daylight. To do this he must discover the location of Shell Beach; the place everyone knows about, but no one seems to remember the directors to.  In the process he'll have to face the strangers, discover the secret to the eternal night, and the true extent of the Stranger's plans for the inhabitants...then he must find the strength hidden within him to free everyone from the stranger's hold.<br /><br />Dark City has over the past 11 years become a cult-favorite, starring actors who have risen in status in recent years, starring film-cult-figure Richard O'Brien, and being the immediate follow-up of director Alex Proyas' critically acclaimed adaptation of The Crow (which starred the late Brandon Lee who died from a technical accident during filming) and Proyas continues to dazzle with low-budget visual flair in this film-noir masterpiece that earned the title of being Roger Ebert's top film of 1998. Alex Proyas may be used as a corporate tool now, having his style severely cut back by studio control (see: I'Robot, and Knowing, both of which are severely different than Proyas' original ideas) but Dark City remains a great film that shows what a dedicated director can do with limited budget and limitless imagination.<br /><br />DVD to watch: I strongly recommend the director's cut over the theatrical cut, not so much because of content, but because the pacing of the director's cut is infinitely superior to that of the theatrical cut.<br /><br />The director's cut DVD also comes with commentary tracks by director Proyas and film critic Roger Ebert (essentially the last audio track the critic did before cancer took his voice) both of which are very insightful into the story of the film (okay both gave commentaries for the theatrical cut as well, but these are even better).  Proyas of course gives more technical facts when commentating while Ebert (as the critic) is more on noting Proyas' visual choices and story points.  Both are must sees for fans of this film!<br /><br />"Sleep now~"</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>When it comes down to it, a large part of who we are comes from our collective experiences, from our past, from our memories. But what if our memories weren't our own? What if all of our experiences were generic? What if our pasts had been manufactured? Would it then be possible to manipulate us through our memories? Luckily, no one has that power... or do they?<br /><br />John Murdoch awakens to find himself naked and vulnerable. He has no memory of his past or of his own identity. The only thing he knows is that he's lost in a mystery, a mystery that only deepens when he finds a dead woman's body in the hotel room where he is staying. He quickly dresses himself and checks out (wouldn't you?). But things only become more complicated when eerie people begin to pursue him, accusing him of the murder. Soon he comes face to face with a startling realization: every night, at midnight, the world stops and time is frozen. During this nether hour people's memories are altered, the city literally reconfigures itself and alien beings known as "Strangers" control everything. But John Murdoch has powers too. Will he master them before he is destroyed? Will he use them to liberate the dark city or to enslave it further?<br /><br />Director Alex Proyas (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059XUO">The Crow</a>) creates a gothic, expressionist metropolis in this mind-bending thriller. He utilizes his strong sense of visual direction but also creates an intriguing tale of identity. The issues touched upon are timely. What makes an individual? Do people control their own fates or are we slaves to a higher power? Can mankind redeem itself? Is time just an illusion? What makes Dark City so unique is that it raises serious questions but, for the most part, leaves the answers to the viewers. It's interesting to note that this film came out about a year before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K19E">The Matrix</a> popularized thought-provoking sci-fi films.<br />Some critics have complained that the acting is stiff (which it's meant to be), while others panned the film for simply being too bizarre (which is why I love it). Regardless, it's obviously a misunderstood film. As for the acting, the performances recall old noir films from the 1940s. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly would all be right at home in an old-fashioned detective movie. Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, seems to be a combination of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Victor Frankenstein. As for the Strangers, they seem to be an offshoot of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers' drones. The acting is appropriately awkward as none of the characters are fully realized. They are drones programmed and reprogrammed every night, never allowed to evolve or develop. The screenplay was written by Alex Proyas, David S. Goyer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780624890">Blade</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a>) and Lem Dobbs (Kafka).<br /><br />The original DVD release features both Widescreen & Full Screen versions of the film, two audio commentaries, numerous essays and reviews, etc. Also included is a hilariously BAD game, Find Shell Beach, which features some of the worst video graphics I've ever seen. But overall if you dig freaky fantasy films, dreary detective tales or surreal sci-fi then Dark City should appeal to you.<br /><br />Just after writing this review, I became aware of an upcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O4YT0">Dark City (Director's Cut)</a> edition that will be available July 29 2008. This means that there will be two different versions available in the retail market. Although I have reviewed this version of the film, I also suggest giving the new edition a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Set in a gloomy always nighttime city where no sunshine shines during the day set somewhere in time and space, a race of malevolent beings called The Strangers who come from another dimension called "The Strangers" who have unique powers to make people go to sleep, take their memories including implant them into other people as they even feed off others memories to survive and even transform the city into any style of city from the decades. John Murdoc (Rufus Sewell) has woken up from the bathtub only to find himself losing his identity and his memories as he has a gift similar to the strangers only it might even be as powerful and has been accused of a murder he didn't commit. However with the help of a so-called wife (Jennifer Connelly) and a Doctor named Schriber (Keither Sutherland), he must try to find his identity and battle against these beings to bring light back into the world.<br /><br />Brilliant and criminally underrated Sci-fi horror fantasy film noir combination from director Alex Proyas (The Crow) puts all those genres in one amazing cocktail that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The film is smart and visually stunning at the same time with a clever original storyline, This movie has always been a dream project for Mr. Proyas. William Hurt with Richard O'Brien with sexy Melissa George co-stars in the labyrinth of a movie that keeps you thrilled, entertained and even brain-teased that predated The Matrix only i think this is superior. The Matrix is excellent but this one is even more brilliant as i enjoyed loving this movie since i saw it in theaters at age 15 turning 16 since i've always been a Sci-fi/fantasy/horror junkie all my life.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers incredible picture and sound quality that makes it perfect. This offers an even better director's cut version that improves on the original movie as well as the original theatrical cut, five commentaries, director's cut fact track, Text essays, featurettes, production gallery, Neil Gaiman review of Dark City and trailer. It's a must have Blu-Ray for Sci-fi, fantasy and film lovers everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I noticed the 440+ reviews here are for the film - not the Blu so I at least wanted to answer some common questions about this cut.<br /><br />The director's cut is 111 minutes with the already mentioned changes listed here and everywhere - including the removal of the beginning narration, more character development scenes, etc. The transfer looks phenomenal (compared to how I saw it prior - even upscaled). I played the title on both a Panasonic plasma and a Bravia via a 80 GB PS3 and Sony BDP301. I paused the film in over 34 spots of action, dark contrasts, bright colorings and various hue changes. Virtually every frame looked excellent, especially the scenes with Jennifer Connelly singing; the majority of the colorings were in her scenes until those last beach sequences.<br /><br />The special features are the same between the DVD and Blu with the exception of one of the commentaries. The 7.1 DTS HD sound was enjoyable, even though two of the channels were primarily used in the large machine sequences only.<br /><br />A worthwhile Blu addition and I did not see too many failings in the grain reduction/transfer issues I had read about.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>When I saw Dark City in the theater, I turned to a friend after it was over and told him this movie was either a triumph or a total disaster, I just didn't know which.  After sleeping on it for the weekend, I finally came to the conclusion that this movie was indeed a triumph.  If The Matrix did not upstage this movie a year later, I firmly believe people would still be talking about it.  I do not agree with Roger Ebert that Dark City was the best movie of 1998, but I do admire director Alex Proyas' efforts to dare the audience to actually use their brains.  Dark City is not filled with pointless car chases or endless gun fights.  It is instead filled with something better - ambitious ideas that force us to question the very nature of reality.  Are the memories we possess really ours and organic in nature?  Or are they synthetic and subject to the whims of chance?  For that matter, does reality exist in and of itself or is it an artificial construct?  Is human consciousness real or do we just think it is real?  Am I the same person I was yesterday or was I someone else?  Do not get the idea, though, that this movie is the visual equivalent of a staid classroom lecture.  Dark City also functions as an exciting movie in its right by combining the best elements of sci-fi and film noir into an engrossing mystery.  Just think of Dark City as a good movie with more of a brain that you might be used to.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>Incredibly imaginative, ground-breaking visual effects, terrific acting, heavily atmospheric, crisply paced and written... it just works on every single level and it works brilliantly. Seeing this in the cinema the first time, my mouth was agape for a goodly portion of the film, particularly the "tuning" of the city sequences and the very memorable climax. This simply in one of the great Sci-Fi films of all time, and also goes into history with films like DARKMAN and THE MATRIX as the best comic-book films that weren't comic books, which is mostly due to Proyas' direction and the co-writing of David Goyer, who wrote the BLADE films, co-wrote BATMAN BEGINS, and has worked on several different actual comics over the years. Great, great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Cult films don't come much more groundbreaking than "Dark City" -- it was bending reality before the Matrix ever did.<br /><br />At first glance, Alex Proyas' movie seems like a basic sci-fi little-man-against-evil-aliens flick. But it isn't. Instead, it's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion. This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />Our hero John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and the police hunting him for brutal murders that he is sure he didn't commit. And worse, hes being pursued by  the Strangers, without even knowing who they are or why they're after him.<br /><br />And then he starts seeing past the Strangers' illusions. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and the sun never appears. As John searches for hints to his past, he finds that the places he knew never existed -- and it's connected to the Strangers. Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City -- and of why the Strangers want John.<br /><br />It's not surprising that "The Matrix" and "Dark City" are often compared. They deal with an illusionary "real" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys. But "Dark City" is very much unique -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir.<br /><br />The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, big cogs and giant clocks. Proyas gives all these scenes a creepy feeling, which is only increased by the fact that there are so few people in the streets and houses. Even everyday things like eating soup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written ("You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place"), and very spare. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is well-suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers.  Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub-singer wife. Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, "Dark City" is a unique and compelling sci-fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot. Definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Dark City is an extremely interesting experiment of blending futuristic settings with an oddly 1940's style of society.  Its dark atmosphere surrealistic imagery contain murky allusions of dread and foreboding, making a visually stunning treat for the eye.<br /><br />John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) awakens in a bathtub in a strange place, and staggering from his seedy hotel room sees a murdered woman lying on the floor.  But John has absolutely no memories of who he is or why he was in the room.  Even stranger is the fact that when he emerges from the hotel, the entire city has stopped moving and everyone but him is asleep.<br /><br />With John having already fled the scene, Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) arrives to investigate, noticing that though there is a dead body in the room, the killer saved a goldfish from a shattered bowl, placing it in water before he left.  Bumstead has inherited the string of murder cases from fellow cop Walenski (Colin Friels), who has gone mad and been dismissed from the police force.<br /><br />Also looking for John is Doctor Daniel Schreber (expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland), who reluctantly works for `The Strangers', peculiar pale and bald guys who run around in Pinhead/Hellraiser type costumes.  The Strangers have the ability to `Tune', shift the shape of any material matter, and Dr. Schreber has discovered that John Murdock has mysteriously developed this ability also.<br /><br />With his memories gone, Murdock tries to discover the truth behind who he is, believing that he will find the answers at a place called Shell Beach.  The only problem is, there seems to be no way to Shell Beach, and Murdock realizes that it seems to always be nighttime.  Murdock convinces his wife Anna that something is wrong, and along the way enlists the unlikely help from Inspector Bumstead, all the while running from The Strangers and trying to avoid the bizarre Dr. Schreber.  The Strangers are looking for the human soul because their breed is dying, and believe that the inhabitants of Dark City hold the key to their immortality.<br /><br />Dark City is indeed a dark movie, any dark sci-fi/fantasy fan will appreciate the atmosphere and spectacular special effects in this edgy, creepy film.  Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt give excellent performances, Sutherland performing especially well as the lazy-eyed, limping, breathless, haggard looking Dr. Schreber.<br /><br />I liked The Strangers, even though they were a bit of a crossbreed between `Hellraiser' and `The Hidden', with slimy jellyfish things coming out of their heads at times.  I loved the special effects and the overall sinister feeling presented in the mood of the film, but the ending left me feeling a little let down and...well...cheesy.<br /><br />On a special note, simply because my mind is sick and twisted, I had a couple of laughs in this dark movie, produced strictly from associations my warped little mind made.  With The Strangers all having names like Mr. Book, Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Sleep, Mr. Rain...I kept waiting for Mr. Hat to pop up, from South Park.  I couldn't stop envisioning that.<br /><br />Also, when Emma Murdock sings `Sway' at the very beginning, I had to pause the DVD from laughing so hard at the memory of the hilarious scene in `Out To Sea', when Brent Spiner was singing `Sway' while Walter Mattheau and Rue McClanahan did their hilariously funny dance.  The Creep indeed. (chuckle)<br /><br />Overall, Dark City is great movie for horror or sci-fi fans that adore gothic style darkness combined with strangely modern or old-fashioned visualization, interwoven with some nice action scenes and great effects.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>What if everything you knew and thought about yourself was false? Even further unnerving, what if a highly evolved alien race from another world lurked in the unseen shadows cleverly manipulating our daily activities to suit their own collective whims? A race so advanced that they can literally alter our reality with their minds through a process called "tuning."<br /><br />One man, Mr. Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens from a bad dream, or maybe better put awakens into a bad dream and has seen `things' he doesn't understand. If he survives what lies ahead he just might see the world as it truly is.<br /><br />`Dark City' released in '98 was truly the prototype for the reality bending `Matrix Trilogy' that was to follow one year later. As the film title indicates, this is a very dark film dealing with a subject matter that generally would appeal only to a small and specific viewing audience. It is also a movie that elicits a strong emotional response from the audience at both ends of the spectrum. Whether you like it or not its images and storyline will remain with you for a day or two. Leave a light on if you must.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Time for something meatier!  And that something is "Dark City." From the mind of Alex Proyas, director of "The Crow," comes the twisted tale of a world that is anything but what it appears to be. In a city without light, everyday people go about everyday tasks, leading everyday lives, completely unaware of the puppet masters who are pulling their strings. Deep beneath the mysterious city lies an underground world of manipulation and exploitation, as alien creatures from parts unknown carefully reconstruct and rearrange the lives of their pitiful experiment subjects above, the human race. One man shines as a beam of hope for the victimized humans, but only another man can show him the way. Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, the miracle man with the ability to "tune" the world around him the same way "The Strangers" do, and who has suddenly become aware that something about his world is just not right. As lost and out of place as the rest of his kind, marked with false memories of a life he never lived, and in danger of being given a whole new set of memories if he is captured by the agents who pursue him, John is forced to find a new escape route at every turn as he attempts to discover the truth about the Strangers and the Dark City.<br /><br />Dark City is sci-fi film noir at its best. As dark as a movie can be without becoming lost in its lack of light, Dark City paints a perfect picture of a society lost in every other possible way. Rufus Sewell is excellent in the lead role, but Kiefer Sutherland is the man that steals the show with his creepy portrayal of a "Peter Lorre meets Claude Rains" scientist walking the line between good and evil. Jennifer Connelly, back when she looked more stunning than weary, is fantastic as the sultry nightclub singer who holds the glazed look of someone unfamiliar with her own life. William Hurt is equally superb as a man thrust into the role of a classic noir detective trying to figure out what is real and what is madness, even from the mouth of his now disturbed partner, played wonderfully by Colin Friels. Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, and a host of cronies, even some terrifying children, give nightmare inducing performances as the emotionless "Strangers." And this wouldn't be a classic Monty Moonlight review if I didn't mention the character of May the prostitute, played by Melissa George. I would not be at all surprised if her picture was printed next to the word "gorgeous" in an illustrated dictionary somewhere; absolutely breathtaking. One cannot forget the city itself, either, which is as much a character as any human actor onscreen. The filmmakers have done a wonderful job here of blending various 20th century decades to create a world that seems very familiar, but somehow is not.<br /><br />Dark City on DVD has a nice bit of extras. Most interesting are the comparisons to Fritz Lang's 1926 German Expressionist film, "Metropolis,"  and the commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and the creators of Dark City. There are also some set design galleries, a theatrical trailer, Neil Gaiman's views on the film, cast and crew bios and filmographies, and some sort of interactive game that I was clueless about. In this case, however, the extras are incidental. This film on its own is a work of art that belongs in every film buff's library!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>First off, it is gratifying to see such a high, collective  rating for this film.  For the longest time I thought I was with a select few who appreciated this gothic Sci-fi tale from director Alex Proyas.  Alex Proyas also directed &quot;The Crow&quot; which has a similar ambience.  But &quot;Dark City&quot; is a different animal, altogether.  Take the gothic texture from &quot;The Crow,&quot; add an eerie touch of &quot;Hellraiser,&quot; just a dash of &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and a vague understanding of this film begins to emerge.  The title character played by Rufus Sewell is searching for his past, constantly pursued by &quot;The Strangers,&quot; and slowly the mystery unfolds.  I've heard some say that they knew what was happening long before the end, but when I saw this in the theater I had no idea what to expect so I let the story play itself out.  Eventually I was rewarded for my patience with a superb plot revelation.  As for the acting, Rufus Sewell is excellent, almost single-handedly carrying the film.  All of &quot;The Strangers&quot; are memorable, particularly the lead characters who bring a seriously evil feeling to these nightmarish beings.  Jennifer Connelly is passable, seeing that she really has nothing to work with here; that, and she can't lip-sync to save her life.  William Hurt is good here, adding a slightly cynical perspective and depth to the grand mystery.  But the eye-sore of the film is Kiefer Sutherland.  He overacts in every scene, apparently gasping for air...between...every...word(or phrase)...he...says.  It gets annoying fast.  As for the visual effects, some are outstanding while others need a little more work.  The look of the movie, from the costumes to the dark city-scape, are all well-thought out and memorable.  &quot;The Strangers&quot; are some of the creepiest creations in recent memory: pale incarnations walking slowly after their prey while wearing long, black trenchcoats and black hats.  More than once they hover and fly through the air, other times wielding switch-blade knives.  All in all, this is a worthy edition to the Sci-fi genre, very nearly (at least in my mind) achieving Cult Film status.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>Jeff Shannon is a moron.<br /><br />Theatrical Viewing:<br />This it the greatest film I've seen.  I experienced it the first week it came out in the theater, and on my way home was filled with giggling, weeping, and joy -- I was so happy Proyas hadn't compromised his artistic instinct enough to destroy such a vision.  Dark City deserves to be seen as a film, in a theater, and I  refuse to watch it on a television.  Roger Ebert's review of it has sustained my hope that not all movie critics are totally unlike me.<br /><br />Director's Cut:<br />09/28/10 Bluray<br /><br />I'm astounded how right on target the original cutting style was to what I'd wished it had been in the theater, where the cuts were a little too tight, too rhythmic, too MTV, too commercial advertisement in spots.  Too much brevity.  Not only does getting rid of that awful intro voice-over help (I didn't see that in the theater, as I came in slightly late as we move down into the city), but bringing back Jennifer Connelly's voice better suspends disbelief and the flow & development of everything is drastically, monumentally improved.  The story and concepts, admittedly some of them borrowed from alien abductions and noir-ized for artistic sake here, all are thoroughly fleshed-out, paced, and called back appropriately.  The rushed, abbreviated version was a truly great achievement, but this a mind-blowing &uuml;ber masterpiece.<br /><br />I did not experience any issues with sound, but I will say the Bluray is still lacking in what the theatrical prints portrayed.  There is some noticeable generational degradation and some video processing-induced motion blur in some of the footage used from the theatrical telecine, which appears to be from the same HD scan the original DVDs were downres'd from.  They seem to have just remastered that original telecine (not rescanned an interneg or interpos, let alone the original negs) with some unfortunate edge enhancement to further "spoof" its apparent quality.  It ends up looking almost embossed in spots, PAL-conversion-like motion blurry in others, and generally inconsistent in inherent fidelity of the visual information.<br /><br />Comparing the theatrical footage intermixed to the newer transfers of the added or extended footage that they co-exist with, you can see marked differences in fidelity from moment to moment.  It does look superior to the DVD, yet is still vastly inferior (not just resolution or visual dynamic range) to the brand spanking new print I saw in an enormous auditorium when it first came out.  The contrasts will certainly improve with plasma screens, OLED, pro grade CRTs, or if you make prints from this disk and show it in a pitch black room.  But there is more lost here than just what is the result of your budget LCD display.<br /><br />I would hope one of these days the money is spent to re-scan the negatives and do a new digital intermediary, digital composites of the virtual effect plates, and not only bring that out on Bluray (or whatever the standard is at the time) but back into the theaters.  This film never had the appreciation it deserved and this intended version is one of the few instances where the "director's cut" is not just some unnecessary, drawn-out indulgence that lacks elegance.  It had that elegance before it was tampered with.  Test screenings and executives meddling: for shame.  You cut and alter a film down to the lowest common denominator, and the result is less, not more.  Most people are tasteless, moronic sheep who would just assume gas you under Hitler's orders or be spoon fed Britney Spears & endless Michael Bay sequels for the rest of their lives.  Art requires purity.  Don't expect great art to have mass appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />"Dark" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.<br /><br />A quick note on the Blu-Ray: it's 15 minutes longer with mostly developmental scenes from the early part of the movie added.  The transfer is excellent, too, so it is definitely worth the purchase.<br /><br />Story-wise, it's the usual alien nonsense but with some interesting twists you certainly haven't seen in other movies, like the city re-shapes itself every night.<br /><br />Because of that, the set designs and special effect are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been 10 years), which shows a city with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too.<br /><br />There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still a somewhat ugly, sordid story.  Yet - at least with me - it draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film.

Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, a man who can't remember who he is, and why he's being accused of murder.  But what John does know is something is not right with the city, and the people he meets on his journey looking for his home, change his life forever, and his ultimate discovery changes everything.  To say this movie is a mindtrip is saying it lightly.  Alex Proyas has a very vivid sense of direction, the sets and cinematography are like none I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention the storyline was the most original story at it's time (The Matrix takes a page from it), add that to great performances from Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, and William Hurt, and you have a very special movie that only comes along not very often.  The special effects are a very nice touch too and add to the experience even more.  In my view Dark City is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, it beats The Matrix, Star Wars, Star Trek, and every sci-fi franchise in great measure.  The ending will haunt you for a while and leave you breathless when the climax unfolds.  All in all, this is a sci-fi classic that should be seen by everyone whether they love sci-fi movies or not.

"At first, there were the strangers . . ." says the narrator of the begining. Slowly, but gently, we are taken into the world of John Murdock, a man who has woken up to find that he doesn't know who he is nor where he came from. Aside from that, he doesn't know why the whole city faints and sleeps at midnight. Plus, the sun doesn't seem to come up. Freaked out? So was he. This darkly telling of suspense and mystery has the perfect period piece; the 1950's. The entire plot concept is something described as explosively imaginative. But this movie, even though it broke even at the box office, is a rare gem of gems in the world of sci-fi. I've never seen a science fiction movie that incorporates Film Noir. It's pure genius. This movie deserves it's own genre. Call it dark revelation cinema. It's good. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Has it really been ten years since writer/director Alex Proyas (The Crow, I Robot) first unleashed the highly influential, groundbreaking, and underrated Dark City?  Yes it has, and to celebrate being a decade old, Dark City has finally been re-released as a Director's Cut that preserves Proyas' original vision.  Upon first viewing this director's cut of Dark City, you will notice some subtle differences, all of which help make Dark City even better than it was before.  Gone is Kiefer Sutherland's opening narration, leaving the viewer to attempt to figure things out for themselves before the plot exposes itself.  The special features carry over the commentaries from the previous release (including the one with film critic Roger Ebert, who called Dark City the best film of 1998), as well as some new featurettes that find Proyas and co. retrospecting about making the film.  As for the film itself, I won't go into story details since you can find them on this page, but let it be said that Dark City is a film you will not forget.  Innvoative for it's time and pre-dating anything The Matrix would do by a year plus, Dark City is a spectacular science fiction feast for the senses.  If you've never seen the film, you are indeed doing yourself a disservice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>&quot;Dark City&quot; is the intellectual sibling of the action oriented &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  The film deals with similar subject matter (just what IS reality, anyway?) and has an even gloomier visual style than  &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  There the similarity ends as &quot;Dark City&quot;  explores the darkest depths of the imagination.  The visuals are stunning,  the acting is superb (biggest revelation, Kiefer Sutherlan CAN act) and the  ending is quite satisfying.  This is a sci-fi film for those who spend  their time reading serious sci-fi novels rather than &quot;Star Wars&quot;  serials.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>Alex Proyas's Dark City is a dark, sensual tribute to both German Expressionism (think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007L4MJ">Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)</a>) and Film Noir. It follows the alien Strangers as they seek to possess the one thing they covet the most: the human soul. The Strangers suspend time each night to implant humans with fabricated memories and new lives, changing the layout of the city with each Tuning. The only human immune to the Strangers' induced sleep is Dr. Daniel Schreiber (Kiefer Sutherland channeling an asthmatic Peter Lorre), a fearful, battered psychologist who is in charge of creating and implanting memories.<br /><br />However, one of Schreiber's subjects resists implanting. We see amnesiac hero John Murdoch come to in a cold bath, wet and naked as he enters the world. Those with observant eyes will note that Murdoch's room is 614; on the included commentary by Roger Ebert, the Biblical reference to John 6:14 states "When the people saw the sign he had done, they said, "This is truly the Prophet, the one who is to come into the world," hence, a fitting entrance for our hero, who is indeed a sort of prophet against the Strangers. John discovers the brutally mutilated body of a murdered prostitute, and panics, fleeing the dingy hotel.<br /><br />Meanwhile, hardboiled, detail-oriented detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) is on the hunt for the serial killer who's been murdering prostitutes; he's fingered Murdoch for the crime, and pursues him relentlessly. His former detective partner, Eddie Walenski, is perhaps the only other human to figure out what's going on with the Strangers and memory implanting, and the knowledge has driven him insane. Murdoch's supposed wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly, A Beautiful Mind, Labryinth) is a bombshell torch singer in a smoky jazz club and also wants to make contact with John, for different reasons (her two lip-synched songs, Sway and The Night Has A Thousand Eyes by Anita Kelsey, are available on the Dark City soundtrack). Dr. Schreiber desperately tries to reclaim Murdoch, to no avail; Schreiber may be broken spiritually and physically, but he knows much more than he lets on to either the Strangers or other humans. The rest of the film traces John Murdoch's gradual discovery of his true nature and of the grim intentions of the Strangers.<br /><br />There is an unrelenting suspense that threads throughout the film as more of the Strangers' chilling plan for humanity is revealed. The dark, dissonant score and masterful use of sparse lighting sets a dark, pessimistic tone.<br /><br />The film's dark, lavish visual style borrows heavily from German Expressionism in the unusual camera angles (tilt shots, combining horizontal and vertical in the same frame) and set design (many nods to Metropolis), as well as an homage to Film Noir (the hardboiled detective, the bombshell torch singer, 1940s costuming and locales such as Automats). The sets of alien technology are retro and futuristic at the same time, with sparse lighting and carefully composed shots.<br /><br />The extras add the icing to the cake; two excellent commentaries by Roger Ebert and director Alex Proyas, cast and crew bios, comparisons and original 1926 critical reviews of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the original theatrical trailer, stills of set design sketches, and an interactive trivia game round out the bonus materials. There is talk of a director's cut of Dark City being released, but until then, this is an excellent film that lovers of science fiction and Film Noir should check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>One of the most pervasive cinematic formulas is film noir.  There's something intriguing about a dark urban landscape, about characters who pose and speak profoundly, about plots that always involve murder and mystery, and of course, about beautiful women.  Dark City is a noir machine, literally.  It exposes the world as manufactured, genre and artistic formulae as constructed from bits and pieces of the real world.<br /><br />Many American dreams and nightmares seem to merge in noir.  I think Dark City also shows that science fiction captures the imagination much like noir.  Science fiction allows us to explore unknown horrors as well as unknown hopes.  It's rare for a film to be working on so many levels.<br /><br />If you aren't interested in the genres Dark City is working with, you might be missing a good chunk of the film, but you could still enjoy the variation on the "last man alive" plot.  The movie does an excellent job of placing the viewer in the position of the protagonist.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Kiefer Sutherland's performance as the mad scientist is a bit over the top.  He takes you out of the film and you feel like you are watching Sutherland be weird and not an actual character.<br /><br />The DVD version has commentary by Roger Ebert.  The only other film Ebert has done commentary for is Citizen Kane, so he thinks rather highly of Dark City.  I do, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A23L2BR07AOBG1.html">A23L2BR07AOBG1</a><br/><p>The DVD contains both formats of the movie with two commentaries: one by the filmakers and one by Roger Ebert.  It's very interesting to listen to. The other features are somewhat scimpy.  I really don't get the game about shell beach and I've never been able to get that going. Whatever, the film features a terrific supporting performance by William Hurt as the detective and a creepy Kiefer Sutherland performance to good effect.  Rufus Sewell does a good job in the lead, but his character is more or less an effect of the environment rather than an individual character for most of the film.  William Hurt's character has more individuality throughout even though he doesn't have the special power.  At any rate, it's a classic of escapist sci-fi and truly creates a world where the individual can make it anything he wants and isn't that the message that we're always trying to convince ourselves of? That we can change the world to fit our own desires, which are to the benefit of the entire world would be a goal that anybody would have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>This is a near-great movie, with fantastic production values and decent acting.  What keeps it from being among the truly greats is its somewhat trite mind-control storyline. The consensus rating of 4.5 stars is about right; l gave it five because Amazon does not allow half-star ratings. <p>&quot;Dark City&quot; would make a great double-feature with &quot;The Truman Show,&quot; also released in 1998.  Both movies deal with manipulated realities, and Dark City's Shell Beach, which John Murdoch is so eager to find, is a dead ringer for the idealized town that Truman Burbank is trying to escape from! <p>PS: Amazon's listing for &quot;Dark City&quot; notes that people who bought it also bought 12 Monkeys, Donnie Darko and Blade Runner.  I am one of those people (I own all three, although I didn't buy them from Amazon) and &quot;Dark City&quot; is definitely in the same general quadrant!</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I finally watched this film after years of being curious about it. It was really pretty cool. Visually, it's stunning; a sci-fi/noir hybrid similar in tone (at least aesthetically) to "Bladerunner".<br /><br />Although the film is visually provocative, as well as intelligent and interesting, the main weakness is that none of the characters are really particularly engaging or well-rounded. So once you get past the nifty visuals and heady plot twists, there's not much to hold onto.<br /><br />It's interesting that this film came out so close in time to "The Matrix" because there really are a lot of similarities. Both films explore the idea that the mundane, everyday world around us is really all a ruse, and that some other force is using modern-day humanity as a pawn to advance their own agenda. And in both films, the main character is a unique man who has the ability to transcend the illusory game he's been plugged into and create his own destiny. I suppose both films are just modern takes on the age-old "free will vs predestination" dillemna.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Dark City" is a beguiling movie for its first half - it's one of those movies that looks great until it hits a point at which it has to start telling its story, one which never quite matches the almost literally absorbing location.<br /><br />"Dark City" is as much a place as a moment frozen in time.  The occupants of the gritty metropolis go about their busy lives, not realizing that it's always night.  Daytime memories are invented and inserted by the city's true masters - an army of deathly gray old men, malevolent "Strangers" with the power to bend the very structure of the city to their will, and traffic in the memories of its oblivious residents.  The Strangers have a plan - one that requires that they understand us and how we're shaped by our whacked out memories.  Every night at midnight, The Strangers put the entire city to sleep and activate a huge, thought-controlled machine which re-makes the city.  Dowdy waitresses become sultry cabaret singers; blue collar families become uppercrust society clans; the innocent become the hunted guilty.  The last of these is Rufus Sewell, implicated (within the continuity of the city's human population) a murderer.  But Sewell proves uncannily immune to the Strangers and their machines.  Sewell's character receives unlikely help from William Hurt, one of the city's detectives, Jennifer Connelly as the sultry object of Sewell's affections, and Kiefer Sutherland as a human in an uneasy league with the Strangers.  The city is the star of the movie, fluid yet consistently beguiling - it terrifies and tantalizes at the same time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the city is so compelling that none of the movie's human stars can match it - and most of the juiciest performances belong to "The Strangers" and Kiefer Sutherland's mysterious Peter-Lorre-like scientist.  Unable to fashion out a plot in which the city can retain its enigmatic character while Sewell takes on the Strangers, "Dark City" boils down to a conventional sci-fi thriller with a disappointingly sunny ending that makes you forget its cool and gritty subject.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>I don't think anyone went to see this at the theatres, which is a shame.

I recommend this movie to anyone, not just Sci-Fi fans.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Personally, I am sufficiently interested in style that should a film have plenty of visual flair, I don't care really care much if it hasn't got a great plot or interesting and/or likable characters.  Of course, it's best to have both, and 'Dark City' does a better job of combining bravura style with compelling plot and characters than almost anything else that I've seen.  This is a truly great flm, and at only 10 bucks you've simply gotta check this out.<br /><br />The film opens with a monologue by Dr.Schreber, which reveals the basic premise: aliens with fabulous telekinetic powers, referred to as the Strangers, have abducted numerous humans, and conduct experiments on them in the dark city, where they mix and match their memories while altering the design of the city in hopes of understanding humanity.  Shortly thereafter, John Murdoch, an experimetee who is revealed to have powers similar to the Strangers', awakes in a hotel bathtub, without any clear memories, and a dead hooker on the floor.  Natrually, the rest of the film involves his flight from both the cops and the Strangers, and his attampts to learn who he is, and the nature of the city he inhabits.  Other than those 2 there are only 3 other main characters- Emma, his supposed wife, Bumsted, the cop assigned to John's case and Mr. Hand, the Stranger who leads the search for Murdoch.  As you may imagine, there isn't all that much actual plot.  For the most part we simply have the main plot fleshed out with more details and specifics.  This may not sound terribly exciting, but they work a lot of good stuff out of this setup, and it allows for a number of revelations which I found quite effective.(though more astute viewers will likely see them coming)  Perhaps most significantly, I find it quite personally involving, and think the major positive characters to be extremely symphathetic.  This is largely because I find the major thematics elements behind the film to be quite important.  At the risk of becoming too philosophical, I feel that the loss of a sense of reality or self is just about the most terrifying notion there is, which makes me naturally symphathetic to these characters, as this loss is precisely what they're dealing with.  Though what it says about humanity isn't necessarily profound (though not much ever is) and perhaps a bit heavy-handed at times,  but it's significant enough to me that I don't mnd much.<br /><br />The acting is generally excellent, and those who may suggest that some of the characters are a bit to cliched are missing the point entirely.(though I will say that I think Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Schreber a bit too affected, but the film is strong in general.)  Also, the casting is absolutely perfect, particularly Connelly, Hurt and O'Brien as Emma, Bumsted and Mr. Hand respectively.  They look exactly the way they should.(and give fine performances, too) While there really isn't all that much too them, I think the bald, pale Strangers make fine villains.  I'm particularly fond of the sadistic Mr. Hand, and the creepy little kid stranger, Mr. Sleep.<br /><br />Visually, 'Dark City' is like little else your likely to see in modern film.  Stylistically, it is what is commonly referred to as 'tech-noir', naturally combining science fiction elements with extreme grittiness, darkness and urban decay of the noir film.  Obviously, it's a very dark film, all black and brown and bronze or faded, sickly green, the indoors bathed in shadow, the outdoors dank and wet, lit by little more than the neon lights.  Visually, the city itself it manages to fall in an area where things don't necessarily look utterly phony, but they don't really look real either.(And this is exactly as it should look)  The shots are beautifully composed, with a strong sense of harmony and balance.  It is very frantically edited, frequently cutting between a few static shots repeatedly, but in a way that isn't annoying, and is decidedly appropriate thematically.<br /><br />The film fails slightly during the climax.  It goes a bit too far over the top, and goes on too long.  Still it's a minor failing.  Fortunately, the denoumont is quite strong. (spoliers ahead)  I have only a slight streak of sentimentality in me, and this is one of the few films that can exploit it.  But what can I say, I want things to turn out well for John, and it's just an absolutely great moment when  the sun finally rises over the city.<br /><br />Well, you just have to see it.  Do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>This movie reminds me of the same city like landscape that the Matrix holds. I think the same cinematographer worked on both of those films but that's my opinion. This movie is really good and the story is worth watching the movie and finding out exactly what is wrong with the town. The main character is excellent at portraying his innocence when he is the one with the true power and starts unlocking deep secrets held in the most darkest places of the town. Cool movie and worth the pick up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>I worked at a video store when this movie came out and ridiculed everything from the title to the plot on the videtape slipcover, that is until I watched it.  I've seen a lot of movies and it takes a tremendous  achievement in film making for me to say that I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THIS  MOVIE!  It was impossible to guess what was going to happen, the cast was  fantastic (Jennifer Connely, mmmmmmm...), the effects were worthy of an  Academy Award.  Great direction by Proyas (same guy who brought us The  Crow) and a terrific script (which, by the way won a Bram Stoker Award).  It's hard to describe this movie, a little bit of noir, a little bit of  Blade Runner, and a striking resemblance to the Borg of Star Trek: The Next  Generation.  But it's not a Star Trek movie by a longshot.  Eyecatching,  Breathtaking, my only regret is that I missed it in theaters.  If you like  action, crime, sc-fi, or horror movies check this one out or just go ahead  and buy it.

The city above is neo-grunge, but the Strangers' city below is a bizarre Art Deco noir. The Strangers redesign that city above, every day, in amazing scenes of rubbery, expanding skyscrapers. The city below is filled with dark, cavernous spaces and monumental icons of unknown meaning. (The Strangers also defined the trenchcoat look later popularized by The Matrix.)<p>The story has that Kafka feeling about it that is blatantly fictional, but still sounds true to that frightened little voice in the back of the mind. The city and everyone in it are manipulated every night at midnight by dark forces for dark purposes. Each morning, that facts of history have been altered. The population's memory has also been altered to match. All of the past has been changed, switched onto a new track -- except for one man.<p>It's quite amazing how, with such a strong start, the movie falters so badly. There was much more to be made of this plot, and much better use to be made of Jennifer Connelly. The Strangers never managed to make much sense - despite the nominal purpose for their experiment, they show little interest in its outcome. In the end, the incredible visuals carry the movie.<p>I like this one for its imagery and for the Twilight Zone sense of its beginning. It could have been more, but that's enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Beware for those of you wanting to watch an action/ sci-fi movie as this isn't like that. There isn't a lot of action whatsoever or not even that much suspense, but the movie is very interesting, exciting and unlike anything else that you've ever seen before.<br /><br />This movie is visually stunning and has a very powerful score that goes along with everything that's happening in the movie.<br /><br />This movie is definitely one of the best that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The movie is about a man waking up with a body next to him and not remembering anything from his past (complete memory loss) From then on, he's wanted for murder and hunted down by mysterious beings called strangers who can stop/control time. The title of the movie is clearly illustrated throughout the movie as there is basically no sun.<br /><br />I don't want to give away anything else about the movie so that you can discover this amazing movie on your own! Believe me, this is one movie that everyone should see. The plot and story of this movie is so remarquable and is probably the best and most interesting plot ever in a movie.

That's the kind of movie it is.<p>It was somewhat unfairly eclipsed by the Wachowski Brothers' _The Matrix_. The latter is a great movie and one of my favorites, but I suspect the Wachowskis watched _Dark City_ while they were turning their storyboard into a screenplay.<p>I can't tell you much about this one without giving away things that you really need to see in the movie. I can tell you that Rufus Sewell is a poor schlub who wakes up one day in a bathtub and finds out he's suspected of being a serial killer; that Jennifer Connelly is deadpan-delightful as his wife; that William Hurt is suave and Chandleresque as the police investigator on the case; and that Kiefer Sutherland does remarkably well for being cast very much against type. And that's about it.<p>At a broad and general level, I can also tell you that the mood is extremely dark, the tension is nonstop (in part because of the creepy soundtrack), and it's spooky as all git-out. And it plays with the question 'What is real?' as thoroughly as any film you've ever seen.<p>It is, in short, an extended noir-SF/fantasy mood piece. If that sounds good to you, trust me when I say you'll like it. This one's a mind-bender that will give you nightmares.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Dark City works as a concept movie (what is the nature of reality?),but in practice it doesn't work out as well. It makes a good cinematic introduction to Buddhism,superior to the Buddhism/Taoism lite of Star Wars. Dark City even leaves the viewer with questions,making the shiny happy ending bittersweet.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell,who resembles a young Ian McShane,is John Murdock,an insomniac who has been framed for murder.While he's trying to solve the mystery,he encounters the detective,Bumstead,a half-hearted performance from William Hurt, and the mad stuttering scientist Dr.Schreber,expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland shows his versatility as an actor;in contrast to his character on "24",he plays a maddened,bumbling scientist. Jennifer Connelly stars as Anna,John's wife. Her role is primarily to be a double agent&a damsel in distress.<br /><br />In the end,John learns that the Strangers (who look like a cross between the Borg,Nosferatu&Pinhead) are trying to find out what makes humans human through their experiments,and want to be immortal because their race is dying out. Since they're all male (except for a demon child),one wonders if an alternate title could be "The Matrix Needs Women." The last battle between John&the leader of the Strangers (Ian Richardson,who was an evil British Prime Minister in a BBC series)is a cheesy metaphysical shoot 'em up.It goes on and on and on.It comes across as a staring contest crossed with a fireworks show.<br /><br />However,the movie brings up intriguing ideas,especially Buddhist ones. Sutherland's character brings up reincarnation ("you have lived many lives"),that reality is an illusion,and that it's a person's responsibility to create their own world.In the last battle,he tells Sewell that he "must concentrate." Concentration is important to all forms of Buddhism.<br /><br />There are also aspects of Dark City that are intriguingly open-ended:<br />Were the Strangers a figment of John's imagination? Was he hallucinating due to his insomnia?<br />Where were the people of the Dark City from before they were abducted?<br />Was it all John's dream?<br />When John reunites with his wife,is he still within the Dark City,making memories that are only an illusion?<br /><br />While the movie has its cheesy aspects (the Strangers floating around,having hilarious names&menacingly intoning "Sleep"),it does bring up fascinating philosophical questions.It makes for fun viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The film:<br /><br />Dark City is one of the standout science fiction movies of the 1990s, along with Gattaca, The Matrix, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers. It portrays a bizarre world in which humans live in an eternal night and are manipulated by a group of strange creatures known as the Strangers.<br /><br />The sense of claustrophobia and dread are well developed, and the setting, which uses evocative period details, especially art deco and 50's modern styles, is eerie and cool. Definitely watch the Director's Cut - there is really no reason to watch the theatrical cut, which shortens a few scenes and adds a terrible voice over the spoils the mystery at the very beginning of the film. This is a film that rewards multiple viewings, and the DC is the way to go to get the most out of it.<br /><br />I will say that I found one moment at the conclusion kind of annoying and pat. Basically, it was a line of dialogue in which Sewell's character avers that the essence of humanity is in some sort of soul, whilst pointing to his heart. Blargh. How cheesy. But overall, the momentum of the story, the creepiness, and the unsettling plays on identity and memory work very well.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Detail is middling for a Blu-Ray. Certainly, it is superior to the awful original DVD. But digital noise reduction has scrubbed away some detail, especially in faces. Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connelly's faces in particular have a waxy look that is noticeable. There is no film grain whatsoever, which is a bad thing, since the computer programs that reduce grain tend to scrub away those fine details mentioned above. It's not the sort of transfer that's going to beat you over the head by "looking HD." Brightly lit scenes fare much better in terms of detail, which is part of the issue in a film called "Dark City." There are several scenes which are very strong, showing good detail in cloth, or textures of walls, streets, etc. If you let it work on you for 2 hours, there are pleasing things to be found, and to be sure, it's not awful. It's just not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Production documentaries total about 1 hour 20 minutes, and there are 3 commentaries on the Director's Cut, two commentaries on the theatrical. Overall, it's a nice selection of extras, especially for a "catalog" release of a not terribly successful film.<br /><br />**********<br />For the price, any fan of science fiction with a Blu-Ray player should pick this up. It's a very strong science fiction plot with a lot of good creepiness and a few mind twisting themes. It's well acted, and the selection of extras, especially a superior Director's Cut, make this a fine purchase. It's too bad that the transfer was manhandled in such a overpowering way with DNR, but it's still superior to the DVD, and, while it is not among the best HD transfers on Blu-Ray, it's at least as good as very good cable TV HD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>Try to spot the changes..

The story involves a guy whose memory seems a-twitter who is obviously the pawn of aliens. Sounds goofy? It is.<br /><br />There is some stylish production values in the oddball city where it is always night and rainy, and there are many famous actors in the starry cast.<br /><br />However, I liked Charlton Heston's first film, "Dark City", from 1950 much more than this one. I doubt the two were related in any significant way other than having the same title since Heston's movie, his first starring role, was about the underworld, as I recall.<br /><br />In any event, this movie is an OK night with the DVD player.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a very cool film.

I have to say there is stuff in Dark City I thought Inception lifted and did far better especially the creation of these new worlds where buildings arise and fall at night (in Inception case it's in dreams).<br /><br />What doesn't work in this movie is it is too dark--not the theme but the lighting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the title is Dark City but it is hard to see anything on screen at times.<br /><br />Also, what is up with Kiefer Sutherland and what seems like his attempt at a Peter Lorre accent?<br /><br />Felt the story was unique and had legs but the execution of it was, well, the whole thing looked a bit like a made-for-TV movie. I know there are comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis but this movie is not even remotely close to the genius of that man's filmic vision.<br /><br />To top it off the extras are laughable on this version of the DVD.

Looking for sci-fi flicks I have yet to watch on NetFlix, I read stunning reviews regarding Dark City. I eagerly dropped it into the queue, and in two days it landed on my doorstep. Unfortunately, after 30 minutes, I punted the movie, and sent it back.<br /><br />Good actors, but horrible material to work with. The villains were hokey, and Kiefer Sutherland was horrible as the mad scientist. He kept breathing like a goofball between every word, as if his breathing technique would make up for a lack of creating a convincing character.<br /><br />Yes, the world was dark, and gritty, and all that. The story was plausible, but the screen play was cheesy. In the end, I was left saying: what a waste! What a waste of acting talent. The world moved on, and so did I. If you have friends who say this is better than the Matrix, should should call your local phone company ASAP and have their number blocked.<br /><br />Check it out. You might like it. Me?

The former owes a lot -- at least visually -- to the latter. You'd have to be blind not to see it, and the supplemental material even includes a too-brief discussion of the films' similarities. There's an excerpt of a 1927 review of "Metropolis" from H G Wells, which pretty much nails everything wrong about /that/ "silly film".<br /><br />But this is about "Dark City". The film's mysteries gradually unwind in a way that's perfectly clear to the characters and the viewer, with The Basic Reveal coming about 40 minutes before the end (in the extended version), so there's no need to describe the plot. However, I think most viewers will recognizethe analogy with the dream state in which we are assaulted by unknown forces, yet are able to perform seeming miracles (teleportation, walking through walls, etc) that protect us.<br /><br />The DVD of "Dark City" was one of the first DVDs I bought a dozen years ago. It's a beautiful film that did not come across very well on a letterboxed 32" screen. It really needs an HD transfer and a 50" or larger display to reveal just how magnificent it is. (I might also add that it's hard to believe Alex Proyas also directed the miserably sloppy/boring "I, Robot".)<br /><br />This is a gorgeous demo disk with uncompressed 7.1 sound. If the strange and the wonderful appeal to you, it's strongly recommended, at a price that makes it very nearly an impulse purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*The Blu-Ray has excellent video quality; easily one of the best transfers ever.  The movie is much more colorful than I remember.  Very clear, crisp picture.  No grain.  Even though most of the movie is dark, it looks phenomenally great.  The sound quality is great too.<br />*Includes both the theatrical cut and director's cut of the movie.  Also has a bunch of special features, some of which came from the older DVD release (essays and notes), and others that are brand new (documentaries, new commentaries, and some other stuff).  All of this is on disc one; disc two is a digital copy.<br />*The movie itself has some good action and special effects.  Moreover, it has a very slick and interesting tech-noir style and production design (overall, it's like a retro version of "Blade Runner").<br />*The story is interesting.  It didn't make total sense when I first saw it years ago, but repeated viewings make things clearer.<br />*Characters are not bad.  Has a good cast.<br />*Pretty good writing; some memorable lines.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*As said above, storyline may be hard to get on first viewing.<br />*Kind of slow at parts (but if you like the style, it'll be interesting all the way through).<br /><br />The movie was a pleseant surprise when I saw its former DVD release years ago; it was stylish and had some great action and special effects (especially during the movie's finale).  Repeated viewings have been even more interesting.  The Blu-Ray is most worthwhile, for both its video quality and its array of special features.  Definitely reccomended to sci-fi fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>I saw this in it's orignal version some time back.

But it isn't. Instead, it's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion. This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />Our hero John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and the police hunting him for brutal murders that he is sure he didn't commit. And worse, hes being pursued by the Strangers, without even knowing who they are or why they're after him.<br /><br />And then he starts seeing past the Strangers' illusions. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and the sun never appears. As John searches for hints to his past, he finds that the places he knew never existed -- and it's connected to the Strangers. Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City -- and of why the Strangers want John.<br /><br />It's not surprising that "The Matrix" and "Dark City" are often compared. They deal with an illusionary "real" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys. But "Dark City" is very much unique -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir with an eerie Philip K. Dick twist.<br /><br />The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, enormous cogs and giant clocks. Proyas gives all these scenes a creepy feeling, which is only increased by the fact that there are so few people in the streets and houses. Even everyday things like eating soup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written ("You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place"), and very spare. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is well-suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers. Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub-singer wife. Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.<br /><br />The original DVD was rather bare-bones in its presentation, but apparently Alex Proyas slapped together a long-awaited director's cut. Apparently it restores a substantial amount of cut footage, some updated special effects, remixed sound, and a lighter-colored, techno-creepy cover that emphasizes the sci-fi elements over the noir darkness. Remember the director's cut cover of "Donnie Darko"? It's a little like that.<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, "Dark City" is a unique and compelling sci-fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot. Definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FEQXNCFC68KC.html">A3FEQXNCFC68KC</a><br/><p>I saw this movie in the box office and it blew me away. The noir look and feel of the movie. The sinister strangers that pop up. The fact that the plot unfolds in front of you gradually in this film. Alex Proyas made a winner in this movie.<br /><br />This movie really plays with the whole concept of what you think is really actually isn't. It does so by allowing you to realize this as John Murdock, the main character, does. Pieces don't make sense at first and then fall into place later. In my opinion this is a superior form of telling that concept then how it was done on The Matrix, where the concept of reality not being reality is practically spoon fed to you (Don't get me wrong. I really like The Matrix. I just see this one aspect as limiting compared to Dark City). This is where Dark City shines.<br /><br />The acting is superb all around. The special effects are very impressive for its time, especially with the budget they had to work with. The script is unique and very well laid out.  All in all this is an excelling science fiction film that plays out like a mystery and holds onto you until the finish.<br /><br />The DVD might not have nearly as many bonus features as the ones you see these days, but when I got this DVD back when it was released it seemed feature-rich. The big bonus feature back then was the director's commentary and it's still the sign of a good special edition. Alex and the production team go into some real fine detail on the movie which makes the commentary that much more special. You also get a commentary from Roger Ebert that feels more like an analysis, but is actually a good analysis.<br /><br />Other features include actor profiles, a review comparison between Dark City and the silent movie Metropolis (Roger Ebert seems to find many parallels between the two), and a game called Return to Shell Beach (which I never really figured out or cared to as it meant disrupting the movie while playing it).<br /><br />Considering the price tag on this DVD now it would be a crime NOT to get it. The movie is excellent. Believe me. If you're a sci-fi fan you don't want to miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Dark City is a film that will only grow with time, for not only is it a bottleneck work of art, but it's a transcendent film. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it transcends the limits of sci fi. Similarly, claims that the film is Gothic, noir, Expressionist, etc. are similarly shortsighted, as well are those which liken the film's narrative to Kafka or Orwell. The clear progenitor of this film is in fact Rod Serling, creator of the television show The Twilight Zone. But the film makes use of imagery from sources few have ever noticed- from campy predecessors in science fiction- the scene of Murdoch on The Strangers' wheel is highly derivative of the flying death scenes in Logan's Run, and the early scenes of The Strangers causing the city to sleep for a tuning, with cars in the middle of traffic jammed roads, is a steal straight from the opening scenes of Federico Fellini's 8?. This diversity, however, just proves a point I've long made, that greatness is a difference of kind not merely degree. Great films, and works of art, like Dark City, transcend their natal genres, and join a higher club, for they have more in common with the great films of other genres, than they do with lesser examples of their genre. And, the bottleneck status of Dark City also proves another point. German filmmaker Werner Herzog has long declared that our culture (cinematic or not) is currently starved for images, especially new images for a new age. I've never bought that, and a film like Dark City disproves Herzog's point. Images are always recycled, as are stories, and until mankind gets into outer space and experiences new things, now images are going to be relatively scarce. What I believe Herzog meant, however, was that the old images, stories, and ideas, need to be made re-new, and this is the essence of an artistic bottleneck- be it artwork or artist. The old is all filtered through that bottleneck and re-presented in new ways, mixed with new things, and, most of all, made better. As example, Shakespeare improved upon the dramatic archetypes of Greek tragedies, and the Modern Masters (Ibsen, Shaw, O'Neill) improved on Shakespeare's often one dimensional characters and fleshed them out, and set them in `real' situations, rather than the soap operatic melodramas Shakespeare could rarely transcend. It is quality, and quality alone, that is the important thing in any work of art, because that is a thing that is not ground to the subjective biases of individuals nor masses, not originality nor sentiment. And in these areas that define what makes a work of art work greatly, Alex Proyas's film Dark City transcends to that rarest circle, greatness, even as, within the limits of its genre it stands alone....nonpareil.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This was sadly a sleeper in the box office, probably due to the theatrical trailer that made the film look more like some sort of demonic tale than what it was really about.<p>The special effects are out of this world, but  there aren't many of them... you don't need to see a lot of special effects  in this highly cerebral tale of realistic terror.<p>A city that seems to  never have sunlight and everyone goes to sleep at midnight.... well, almost  everyone.  Aliens driven to find out what makes the human species survive  adversity create a twisted zoo of human subjects who have no idea what is  going on and never realize that nothing is quite what it seems... with the  exception of John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who seems to be the only person  to realize nothing is how it should be.<p>The psychological fear in the  film is far more powerful than anything you actually see, but the two  (visual and psychological) exacerbate one another... you will be on the  edge of your seat through out.<p>This dual-sided feature-packed DVD  includes the theatrical trailer, cast bios, and full-length audio  commentaries; one by Roger Ebert, who (rightfully so) dubbed this the best  film of 1998 and the second commentary has audio from the Director,  writers, production designers and the director of photography.  This is the  first DVD I ever bought and I've seen it several times... it is exquisitely  executed and a standard by which other DVD presentations should be measured  in terms of what the DVD medium is all about.<p>The film contains nudity  and violence and is not suitable for children.  Don't let the comparisons  with &quot;The Matrix&quot; fool you, this is a film and genre in its own  right, but you will see some parallels once you've seen both movies.  The  film has been more closely tied with the epic Sci-Fi silent classic,  &quot;Metropolis.&quot; The DVD includes blow-by-blow comparisons of this  film w/ &quot;Metropolis&quot; as well as an interactive game (can be  played using a remote control on your TV or by your mouse)... well worth  the money and a treat for those who love movies that entertain by  stimulating the mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>John Murdoch awakens alone in a strange hotel to find that he has lost his memory and is wanted for a series of brutal and bizarre murders. While trying to piece together his past, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group of beings known as The Strangers who possess the ability to put people to sleep and alter the city and its inhabitants. Now Murdoch must find a way to stop them before they take control of his mind and destroy him. An absolutely brilliant and nightmarish movie.  "Dark City" is an enriching and surreal experience, full of beautiful images and powerful symbolism. A fantastic science-fiction masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Dark City doesn't have the most interesting plot when it comes to science fiction movies.  There's little character development, , and the movie is pretty much a series of chases, running around that basically piles evidence about the big picture that can be summed up in a paragraph (and also loses the mystery and the jolt moments after you see it again).  How can a movie with a story like this possibly even warrant a good grade?<br /><br />Well, Dark City does, and it does so with ease, thanks to the visionary directing of Alex Proyas, the art style, some fine performances, and execution.  Excellent, excellent execution.  Director Alex Proyas was responsible for that turd Knowing, but I always thought that the directing was very good in a sense.  However, it was it's totally unimaginative in all aspects and really bored me to death (and the movie didn't even explain why those things were even there!).  Dark City, however, doesn't bore you, thanks to it's one of a kind world that it creates.  Sure, Dark City may not be any way significant or have anything to say, and it's frequent comparison, The Matrix, even said a lot more, and I find that movie to be little more than psuedophilosphy (don't get me wrong, I dig the Matrix, I just don't believe it's worthwhile social commentary like A Clockwork Orange)<br /><br />Even though the story isn't the most profound of science fiction I've seen, it's miles better than garbage like The Day After Tommorrow, Armageddon, and even Alex Proya's own Knowing.  It's not terribly complex, and the movie almost seems like a game of Myst regarding it's plot.  However, unlike, say, Knowing, Dark City features some explanations that are at least interesting and gives us some insight on the creatures, who can do all kinds of crazy things and are merely just curious.  It's not among the most memorable stories out there, but at least it has some grounding in creating interest and some insight.<br /><br />However, Dark City really elevates itself to it's execution, from it's acting to it's sound, and most of all, it's visual style. The acting is reasonable as it makes the characters believable and somewhat likeable even though they don't develop much (but actually works because of the plot), but it's the two senses that make Dark City a great movie to behold (inspired by German Expressionalist Films) Borrowing from such movies as Metropolis (1927) (though I really can't see much of the influence of M and Nosferatu, to be honest).  A special note is the effects, which are great to see.  The climax of this movie, in particular, is awesome.  I still can't believe they were able to make a movioe with a visual style like this in 1998, a decade before big budget CGI fests flooded the Hollywood market.<br /><br />Dark City does have it's influences, but it still is a good movie that should easily complement movies like Brazil, Blade Runner, The City of Lost Children, and The Matrix, and not replace them (and those movies should not replace them either).  Dark City may not have many mindblowing secrets, but it sure is a place worth visiting again and again.  This DVD makes the movie even better, as it includes 3 commentaries, a theatrical trailer, cool production shots, and two documentaries totaling an hour and a half.  It also adds fifteen minutes of footage to the movie (and movies)  Whether or not you get the director's cut or not, the trip to Dark City is worth it.<br /><br />B-</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Very cool sci-fi-noir flick from 1998, where humans are the rats in some weird experiment. Hadn't seen this one in quite a while, and was glad to see that it still held up to multiple viewings. And I love the look of this film, which comes across great on Blu-Ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Cult films don't come much more groundbreaking than "Dark City" -- it was bending reality before the Matrix ever did.<br /><br />At first glance, Alex Proyas' movie seems like a basic sci-fi little-man-against-evil-aliens flick. But it isn't. Instead, it's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion. This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />Our hero John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and the police hunting him for brutal murders that he is sure he didn't commit. And worse, hes being pursued by the Strangers, without even knowing who they are or why they're after him.<br /><br />And then he starts seeing past the Strangers' illusions. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and the sun never appears. As John searches for hints to his past, he finds that the places he knew never existed -- and it's connected to the Strangers. Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City -- and of why the Strangers want John.<br /><br />It's not surprising that "The Matrix" and "Dark City" are often compared. They deal with an illusionary "real" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys. But "Dark City" is very much unique -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir.<br /><br />The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, big cogs and giant clocks. Proyas gives all these scenes a creepy feeling, which is only increased by the fact that there are so few people in the streets and houses. Even everyday things like eating soup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written ("You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place"), and very spare. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is well-suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers. Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub-singer wife. Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, "Dark City" is a unique and compelling sci-fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot. Definitely a must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bathtub, a dead prostitute in the bedroom. What happened? Why can't he remember? Why can't he recall his own name? Did he kill the girl? John has no idea. You see, he was destined for a completely different reality than the one he's awakened to / in. Mr. Murdoch was supposed to be a serial killer. He somehow resisted this fate and must now find out who he really is. Along the way he meets THE STRANGERS, an odd group of humanoids, led by Mr. Hand (Richard &quot;Riff Raff&quot; O'Brien). These scary folks seem bent on Murdoch's destruction. They control everything, making the entire city sleep, so they can rearrange buildings, erect whole new cityscapes, and inject whole new lifetime &quot;memories&quot; / &quot;experiences&quot; into the minds of their subjects (the populace). John soon finds that he can manipulate things with his mind and battle the strangers on an equal footing. Helped by a police detective (William Hurt) and John's &quot;wife&quot; (Jennifer Connelly), Murdoch sets out to discover the secret truth behind the artificial world he's trapped in. Kieffer Sutherland plays a psychiatrist who may or may not be trying to help John Murdoch. The ending is positive without being sappy. DC is sort of a good cross between THE MATRIX, BLADE RUNNER, THE TRUMAN SHOW, METROPOLIS, and THE TRIAL, among others. Would make a mind-blowing double bill w/ MEMENTO! Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>If you're into the darker side of sci-fi, you will probably enjoy this foray into pseudo-reality.  Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow), this was somewhat of a sleeper film that encouraged viewers to question their reality a full year before Matrix-mania hit the silver screen. <p>Although the film lacks the action or pizzaz of The Matrix, certain parallels between the two films are inevitable due to the aspect of humans being controlled by an outside force (in this case, a race of aliens inhabiting the bodies of deceased humans) and not even being aware of it.  The visual feel of the film is totally different from the Matrix, however, as Proyas takes chooses a low-key, seedy art-deco look for his film as opposed to the Matrix's brighter, monochromatic post-modern aura.<p>Some relatively big names participate in the cast, although curiously, not in the lead role.  Relative unknown Rufus Sewell plays the lead role effectively although not spectacularly, while William Hurt, a pre-Beautiful Mind Jennifer Connelly, and a pre-24 Kiefer Sutherland round out the cast in this well-written and directed feature.  <p>Although the situations are about as far removed from reality as one can get, the viewer empathizes with the main character's confusion and rejoices in the revelation that he has the ability to liberate captive humanity from its oppressors.  A fine film, and one worth a repeat viewing now and again.</p></br></body></html>

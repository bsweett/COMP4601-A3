I found that this weekend is also the It's a Wonderful Life festival at Seneca Falls, NY, which claims it was the inspiration for Bedford Falls (see their site here: [...], which also includes an appearance by Karolyn Grimes, who was the character Zuzu and her pedals).<br /><br />But what a story!  I'm sure most readers know this story and the DVD I picked up had a lot of interesting extras and "making of" that was fascinating.<br /><br />The film is a slice of Americana, taking us from the Roaring 20s to the post-war era of the mid 1940s.  Featured is George  Bailey, the son of a small town building and loan president, whose kind heart and common sense had kept the town running for years.<br /><br />On the other side of the spectrum is old Potter, a miserly miser that makes Scrooge look generous by comparison.<br /><br />The story's general plot goes through George's life through the eyes of an angel, a little guy who wants to earn his wings.  He watched with the viewer as George grows up:  George prevents several deaths, gets the town through a run on the bank during the '29 Depression and gets through the war.  He has kids and runs a successful business that is booming.<br /><br />Despite these successes, his uncle loses money that was accidentally given to the Potter miser.  Potter looks at this as an opportunity to finally beat George.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart's acting ability was amazing in this film.  His range from pure happiness to deep despair was palpable.  Despite his personal sacrifices to give up his dreams for the benefit of others, George Bailey was finally at the end of his rope.  Stewart's performance as a broken man on that bridge was just an amazing piece of cinema.<br /><br />No Man Is a Failure Who Has Friends:<br /><br />Many themes in this film too many to mention, really.  There is a reason why this film has endured as a Christmas treat.  It is deep and philosophical without being preachy.  It has a dark side that cuts across the aisle of greed and despair, of heartache, and of suicidal tendencies.  The film raises you up and makes you think.<br /><br />What if you had never been born?  What hole would be hard to fill without your contribution to people around you and to Man as a species?  Would lives have been better off if you had never existed?<br /><br />DVD Specials:<br /><br />I enjoyed the bits with Frank Capra's son as he went over his father's inspiration for the film.  They showed a clip from an interview with Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra himself.  It's Capra's favorite film.<br /><br />The DVD also has a brief spot with Tom Bosley who again goes over similar ground to the bit on the "making of" segment, but adds some film history.  It's a Wonderful Life was not a hit at the box office at its release.  In fact, viewers thought it too depressing for the holiday season (which I find simply unbelievable).<br /><br />When the film fell into the public domain, it was shown on TV in the 70s and there was a revival for it.  Now we have Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes) touring the country pushing the film.  Karolyn has an endearing and powerful personal story herself, which I wish was part of the DVD set.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  An enduring, heartwrenching film (for me, anyway) that nearly always makes me cry as well as makes me look at my life.  Would it had been better I'd never been born?  For George Bailey the answer is a resounding no!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>At its center, the film works because we all have wondered what would the world be like if we were never born. Have we had an impact? After all, whether it's leaving behind descendants, works of art, discoveries, or just our name, we all want some recognition, that we mattered, or at least were here. It helps define our sojourn, and allow us to extrapolate meaning from a cosmos which is random, indifferent, and so large and eternal as to defy the meager human ability to fully comprehend. With that as a base desire, the film then goes nearly two hours showing us a life that has many tangents with ours- be you an American, Mongolian, or Zulu. We see the effect George has had, even if he does not, and know what can only await him when Clarence pulls out his life's rug from under his feet- if not the particulars, certainly the general effects, which can only be negative. Yes, George may be more involved with others than the typical person, but we are all connected, however peripherally. This film does a better job than any other film in espousing the notion of The Butterfly Effect, even more so than the recent film of that name. We all see ourselves in George Bailey, for the film does not focus on George's mere home nor business lives, but all the important moments they bound, and even fail to contain. We can easily extrapolate ourselves into his position, especially at his moment of crisis, when he literally, as Potter taunts, is worth more dead than alive- at least on a material level.... This toweringly great film is all about corralling the material instincts and aspects of the world, and using them for the right reasons, while appreciating the values that lie beneath those instincts. The cynics, dummies, and willful misreaders of this film be damned! It is not corny, cheesy, hokey, nor a mere feel good tearjerker, like its many inferior copycats are. Too often the commercials or excerpts that are shown damage the overall film's perception, for it's a synergistic film, whose whole far surpasses its parts. It is great art, period. It is defensible not only on an emotional level, but on intellectual and artistic levels. It is also testament to the fact that great art always rises to the surface, even if bad critics pummel it. This has an extra resonance for me and those who produce excellence with no immediate reward nor recognition. But, even without that, It's A Wonderful Life deserves its plaudits, and your viewership.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I have watched this movie many times, and each time it makes me cry and feel overwhelmed with emotion.  This amazes me, because it is so sentimental and in many ways contrived, at least as we see it through our jaded modern eyes.  Sure, it was made for a simpler time, but there is no doubt that it taps into universal human truths and hopes.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as a good and talented man who allows his sense of responsibility to guide his life, which costs him hugely in his sense of frustration and thwarted ambition.  You see it in him as a child, particularly the scene in the drug store, where he saves more than one life.  (That scene chokes me up every time I see it.  There is such struggle and caring in it, such courage as he sticks to his decision.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.)  Of course, he has a terrible crisis that is resolved, with a renewed sense of life.<br /><br />Donna Reed is also wonderful as his wife, a simple woman who loves him in the way we would all hope to be loved in marriage.  Indeed, she embodies an ideal and yet is so believable that it makes me introspect on my own marriage.  And Barrymore!  The perfect capitalist ogre.<br /><br />Like many, I watch this every Christmas season and feel awe at the power of a perfectly crafted hollywood story.  While we get down on hollywood formulas, there are times when it works as well as one could hope.  That is this film, one of the finest ever made.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>This Frank Capra film is a perennial classic full of emotion and warmth. I do not find it depressing as some people do. Instead, it is reflective and pensive on the good that is all around us yet we never truly see. The film is a celebration of all that is good in our lives and the performances ring true to that end. I only wish Dimitri Tiomkin's score had not been truncated before the film's release. Yet most important is the film's true meaning and there it is indelibly endearing and sincere.  Frank Capra's images are indelible and the print of this DVD is outstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/AK6UVFSU07NXH.html">AK6UVFSU07NXH</a><br/><p>There seems to be some sort of conspiracy in Australia to keep this film a secret. It is clear to me that &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is regarded as the standard Christmas eve broadcasting in the US. It seems  that many Americans regard this film as worn out, in the same way as say  &quot;The sound of music&quot; has been, through too many viewings. To the  best of my knowledge it has only been broadcast once in the last ten years  in OZ, (I've been informed that's not strictly true, but why spoil the  story), and that time was not advertised. So perhaps I am in a better  position to judge the true worth of this film, not having been overexposed.  I regard it as one of my top ten of all time. The cast is fabulous. James  Stewart was perfect in his central role as George Bailey. Although I would  rate his performance in &quot;Mr. Smith goes to Washington&quot;, slightly  higher. The story is brilliant and the direction is immaculate.<br /><br />I  was lucky enough to get one of the 45th anniversary copies of the  re-mastered laser disc and it is a beautiful transfer. If you ever want to  add this film to your collection, this is the copy to get. If you are not  crying through at least half of this film, both in joy and anguish, then I  think there is something wrong with you. I certainly got more out of this  film than any rendition of Dickens', &quot;A Christmas Tale&quot;. After  all how many of us can empathize with a penny pinching self centered old  grouch versus a good man faced with letting his family and friends down.<br /><br />That is the basic story after all. George Bailey has been dealt a  savage blow and is contemplating suicide at his lowest ebb. It takes an  apprentice angel to put it all in perspective and remind him that joy in  life should never be eclipsed by any setback. Maybe those Americans out  there that have not taken the time to watch &quot;It's a Wonderful  Life&quot; in the last ten years should stop and try to recall the story.  If you can't, then you should make the time to give it another chance. You  may be surprised at the power it still has to move you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>You know for years I've avoided It's a Wonderful Life simply because I was completely convinced it was just an old and horribly dated Christmas film.<br /><br />Well, last night I finally watched it and... I'm really glad I did. I was wrong. It's not horrible simply because it's old. Sorry for being so close-minded and ignorant. I guess I was under the assumption such an old movie is no longer relevant in todays world, but it actually is.<br /><br />It took a while for the storyline to get to the segments I REALLY had the greatest admiration for, such as when James Stewart's character was forced to learn an important lesson about respecting people (and subsequently taken to a time when nobody even knew who he was because he never existed- you'll understand this segment when you see it) *this* is when the storyline really kicked in for me.<br /><br />It was a lot of fun watching James Stewart's character communicate with people he knew really well around town, however, none of those people knew him at all thanks to an angel taking him to a world where he was never even created.  It was both emotional and exciting wondering what would happen next thanks to James Stewart's reactions and facial expressions.<br /><br />I really liked James Stewart's character too. He really disrespected his family for a while there, but by being shown the way of life, he learned to treat everyone around town with respect and consideration.<br /><br />The entire storyline is really good so I honestly feel really bad for originally skipping over the movie so many times simply because of its age. Don't let age fool you- this my friends, is a holiday classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>Although this film has been around since long before I was born, I had never seen it until recently.  I did not know what I had been missing.<br /><br />Featuring Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, this is a classic in every sense of the term.  Bailey is a regular guy living in an average town.  He has a brother who becomes a big war hero and a good friend who becomes very wealthy.  Not George.  He just keeps plugging away at his life.<br /><br />A series of events hits him that leaves him very discouraged.  He is contemplating suicide and speculating that it would have been better had he never been born.  An angel is sent to help him.<br /><br />During the course of the movie, the angel reveals to George many things and people that would have been worse off if not for his presence.  It is not only a great story, but it will also prompt viewers to consider that even seemingly small things that they do may have a big impact on others.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for viewers of all ages and interests.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`It's a Wonderful Life' is one of those movies that could easily have fallen victim to its own popularity.  Rendered as one of the greatest American films, `It's a Wonderful Life' has a lot to live up to, and with all that hype comes, at times, major disappointment.  The nice thing about `It's a Wonderful Life' is that it actually lives up to the hype, and then some.  Not only is it one of the most heartwarming films I've ever had the privilege of seeing (sure, it may not seem it at times, but just wait) but it is also one of the smartest and most intelligent films to come along.<br /><br />The film tells the story of George Bailey, your typical `nice' guy with big dreams that finds himself shortchanged by everyday happenstance until he's married with children, still living in the same small town he wanted so badly to escape from and working a job he never anticipated or desired.  It's not that George is unhappy it's just that he is less than satisfied.  As events unfold within his life that press firmly upon him to where he starts to feel trapped George contemplates the unfathomable.<br /><br />Suicide.<br /><br />The film somewhat starts at this point; with an angel being sent down to save George from himself in an attempt to gain his wings.  What follows is a beautiful look at a life lived to the full despite not being lived as fully as one would have hoped, and then we get a glimpse at what life would have been like had George never lived at all, and while the results are a tad on the extreme side they help us to appreciate that each and everyone of us play a large part in the lives of everyone we touch.  It's a beautiful and sincere message that resonates with everyone and touches every soul.<br /><br />If you walk away from `It's a Wonderful Life' unmoved then you must have ice in your veins.<br /><br />Some pass this movie over expecting it to be nothing more than a Christmas film, but Christmas is the smallest part of this film.  Yes, it is used around the holidays to fill the heart with gladness and express the wonderment of children and family and friends and blessings but those emotions and that message is much farther reaching than a single yearly event.<br /><br />The film is bolstered along by some beautiful performances, especially from James Stewart (who has never been one of my favorite actors).  He delivers such a powerfully moving and real portrayal of a man who doesn't fully understand all that he has until he is faced with the prospect of never having it at all.  His transformation from a man down and out and unsatisfied to a man striving to retain all that he fears he has lost is amazing and utterly convincing.  This is the type of performance that moves people to tears.  I was also impressed with Lionel Barrymore who portrays Henry F. Potter (the Scrooge in this tale) with such devilish intrigue.  He is the perfect villain to Stewart's worn soul.  This is the type of villain you love to hate.<br /><br />In the end I must urge everyone to watch this movie, not once, not twice but over and over again.  Don't limit yourself to that one time of year to enjoy this wonderful movie but indulge yourself with one of the most beautifully complete tales of love, life and the American dream ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>Sometimes you probably wonder, like most people, if life is really worth living.  If you are like many, this is often the case during the holidays.  This classic film is a gentle balm for the holiday malaise.  It is corney and sappy, its true.  But the message is nonetheless true and will tug at your heart like few others.  Its a must have/must see movie.  The grandady of all "feel good" movies you will not want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>A classic like no other classic, a film so fun and alive, sentimental, and full of hope.

It is one of my favorite holiday movies during the Christmas season, and certainly the one with the best acting. Jimmy Stewart is absolutely incredible as George Bailey, whose unlikely encounter with an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) allows Bailey to see how he's helped so many of his neighbors. Essentially, this film is a warm-hearted version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, replete with much American optimism. It's also a subtle cinematic ode to friendship, family and faith. Aside from Travers, the supporting cast, including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore, is superb. Without a doubt it's a popular film during Christmas that ought to be required viewing throughout the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>I started my yearly ritual of wathcing this movie back in my teen years.  While technically not a Christmas movie is has become adopted as one.  The real point is that life is worth living and that everyone truly matters.  George Biley had to find out the hard way - what becomes of life when only one person is not there to affect outcomes.<p>This movie is wonderfully acted and the overall message is a beautiful one.  I still make it part of my Christmas tradition.  <p>Interesting note:  the kid that is talking to Mary in the gym dance - she's distracted from his story when she sees George:  that kid played Alfalfa in the Little Rascals!</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>Here I am, just another reviewer acknowledging the immortal significance of this gritty but sentimental, sometimes harsh but more often joyous, deliberate but life-affirming treasure that is "It's a Wonderful Life" (hereafter "Wonderful Life").  Do I have a new perspective on "Wonderful Life"?  Maybe, but I doubt it, but here goes:  It has often struck me how "Wonderful Life" is sort of the inversion and distorted reflection of "A Christmas Carol".<br /><br />  George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge - can any two characters be more diametrically opposed? George is kind-hearted, thoughtful of others, beloved by the citizenry; Ebenezer is uncaring, misanthropic, and treated with fearful disregard.  The only thing they seem to have in common is that both are industrious and, surprisingly, both dissatisfied with their lots.  However, although rich with public esteem, George admits his despondent dissatisfaction with his relatively "poor" financial status. Conversely, although rich with material goods, Ebenezer harbors dissatisfaction with his relatively poor social/human status, that is, his alienation, though he will hardly admit this.  In a subtle, distorted way, George and Ebenezer kinda want what the other has - the only difference is, ironically, what Ebenezer subconsciously wants is better than what George wants.<br /><br />  Of course, both men receive spiritual intervention and of course, get a glimpse of their futures.  Only difference is, George receives a vision of what the future would be if he did not continue his altruistic ways, while Scrooge receives a vision of what the future would be if he DID continue his selfish, parsimonious ways.  For both men, both visions promise stark oblivion (in different ways, of course).  Both men's future visions, for different reasons, convince them that selfless interaction with society is the path to bliss; George just needed to be reminded of it, while Ebenezer needed a remedial course.<br /><br />  Therefore, in my opinion, many parallelisms and common themes exist between "Wonderful Life" and "Christmas Carol" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>What really struck me about Jimmy Stewart's performance is how he played the film's protagonist George Bailey as he passes through various stages in his life.  I first saw this film when I was in my 20's, so seeing Steward play the character as an impatient young man was illuminating.  At the point in the story where all of George's friends have just finished college, while he is still stuck in Bedford Falls tending to the Bailey family's Savings and Loan, strikes a familiar chord.  At that time in my life I was a weary engineering graduate student, and felt that my life would never really get going.  Stewart plays George Bailey at that age as sullen and indifferent to any possibility that his life might take a turn for the better.  George is played by Stewart in such a way that he struggles betray no interest in Donna Reed's character Mary, the girl who had admired George her entire life--and who George will eventually marry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Although now a perennial holiday favorite, in first run "Wonderful Life" failed to earn back its $3.7 million cost.<br /><br />Shortly after its release, the FBI cited this movie's anti-banker plotline as a common ploy used by Communists. There may be some truth here, for the story was partly scripted by Dalton Trumbo, playwright Clifford Odets and poet/critic Dorothy Parker. All three were investigated for possible Communist activities. Trumbo and Parker were both blacklisted. Odets avoided the same fate by cooperatively naming his "fellow travelers."<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />After a large sum of his customers' money is inadvertantly lost, businessman George Bailey (Stewart) attempts suicide by jumping off a bridge into an icy river. He's rescued by an angel named Clarence (Travers). In a clever variation of Dickens' Christmas spirits visiting Scrooge, Clarence shows the despairing man how the townspeople of Bedford Falls would be far worse off if George Bailey never existed.<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDVO">DVD</a>.

It was given an extra boost due to the fact that through inattention, the copyright ran out! When TV stations realized they could show it with no royalties due, it became a popular item in their schedules. Movie fans, with a second chance to appreciate this film, found that they liked it after all. Once you understand that George Bailey's life is full and rich, even if it never followed the course he himself had imagined for it, you understand that the movie isn't depressing at all. No matter how many times I view "It's a Wonderful Life", I still get a little choked up at the end.<br /><br />This was Jimmy Stewart's first film role after serving in, literally, heroic fashion as a bomber commander during World War II. Despite being a star and subject to assignment in "morale roles" if he had so chosen, Stewart went into the Air Corp and flew a complete tour of 25 bomber missions. He also flew a number of other live missions that were tallied as flights where he trained air crews. When offered the chance to have those missions count against his tour of 25, he declined. If you know anything about the history of WWII, you know that bomber crew duty in the European theater was pretty much the most dangerous combat assignment in the war.<br /><br />This DVD presentation is extremely well done. Whether from a clean print or a masterful restoration (or a combination of the two), the movie is free of artifacts of the type you find in old film prints or a rushed digital transfer. When you compare the actual film to scenes shown as examples in the two included documentaries, you can see what I mean.<br /><br />And mentioning the two documentaries, they are very satisfying. One is hosted by Frank Capra Jr., the son of the famous director of the film. He narrates interesting facts about his father and this film in particular in a warm tone that makes you feel part of the process. The second feature is hosted by Tom Bosley (the father on "Happy Days"). That documentary is, I believe, somewhat longer. It goes into some of the casting choices that could have been made, which I always find interesting. Both have tidbits of history and trivia about the film that are anywhere from interesting to fascinating ... including an explanation of how the film was actually shot during a record heat wave!<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" has become arguably the top Christmas classic, in part due to its heavy exposure on TV, and in part because the film is so good it holds up under that heavy exposure very well. It is a must see for our family every Christmas season, and I have to say that I'm happy to own a DVD with a presentation of this high quality, so that I'm not subject to the random quality of prints shown on TV broadcasts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>This GOODTIMES version of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) is recorded in LP speed and doesn't contain a HiFi audio track.<br /><br />Slower speed non-HiFi tapes have degraded picture quality, with sound clarity that's dependent on the alignment of your machine's playback head (a stationary device similar to the sort found in a cassette deck). The slightest variation in azimuth from the mfr's dubbing unit means blurry audio, often with a background squeal. Additionally, such slow-moving tracks have limited frequency range and an increased amount of flutter.<br /><br />All HiFi videotapes come with a back-up linear track such as described above, but on HiFi VCRs the sound, which is laid down on a slant alongside the video portion, is picked up by the rotating video drum. This simulates a tape moving at an enormous rate of speed. The advantage is a frequency response, dynamic range and harmonic distortion level that nearly equals CDs in quality (if you connect your VCR's audio outs to a decent amplifier).<br /><br />All pedantry aside, for anyone still seeking a videotape of this classic film, choose one from a major studio rather than a budget brand like GOODTIMES.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>I love this movie, made by obviously good people and yes, so full of good. That said, on my most recent viewing, the following things caught my eye and made me realize IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE would have NEVER been made today:<br />1) The police try to shoot George for hitting one of them. Talk about police brutality!<br />2) In George's alternate life, we find that Mary had the very worst possible thing happen to her: she became an old maid!. Her eyesight aapparently also suffered from this as she ended up wearing glasses too.<br />3) George and Clarence get thrown out of a bar for talking about 200 year old angels. Those Potterville bars sure had high standards for their drunken patron's conversations!<br />4) I would also question George's sanity for letting Uncle Billy handle a $8,000 deposit which I'm guessing would represent somewhere around $200,000 of today.<br />5) The simple, even naive way the movie starts with the stars speaking to one other. There you can also hear someone praying to "Jesus, Mary and Joseph". I bet somebody would attack that for being "un-politically correct" these days.<br />I also noticed for the first time that with all the heavy snowing when George is on the bridge, not a single flake actually sticks to his clothes; Harry's hat in his final scene also seems to be refrigerated as the snow on it stays while that on his shoulders melts. The Christmas decoration switching on and off his arm when he talks to Harry long distance is also very funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Well, December is here, and it's now time to ramp up the anticipation for one of the most cherished holidays of all. You got it. It's time to dust off some DVD cases and get into the holiday spirit. And boy do we have a wide variety! There are dozens of films that we can enjoy watching during any time of December. Home Alone, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, A Christmas Story, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, and even Ernest Saves Christmas are ideal motion pictures for this time of year. Many people, however, consider It's A Wonderful Life to be the finest Christmas film, and it's not hard to see why. It's a loose adaptation of Philip Van Doren Stern's short story called "The Greatest Gift," and it tells of how wonderfully important your life really is, not only to yourself but to everyone that's close around you. It's well directed by Frank Capra, and it's one of the excellent motion pictures that that can really get you in the mood for the holiday spirit. Here's hoping that this movie will really last forever.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>This is one of the most beloved movies in film history.  It is very uplifting, and while can be viewed at anytime for a boost, it always has been part of my family's Christmas Eve tradition.  While the colorized version is okay, I prefer the original black and white.  The quality appears to be much better, and maybe that has something to do with traditional expectations also.  I always wonder when they make a movie like this, if they realize it is something special, and how important it will be.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful story about a man who has big plans but settles for the simple quiet life as he marries and has a couple of kids. but when a big problem arises in his life and he feels there is no way out. He thinks the unthinkable to end it all, only to be saved by an angel and his friends and family. he then realizes he has a wonderful life and true happiness is with family, i just love this film. It's got a good story, the kind of story you don't find nowadays. long live Jimmy Stewart he's the man.  i'm sure this will a be great edition of the film. it looks as if it contains both B&W, Color Versions of the film that are in the set to be released, i've already preordered a copy for myself and hope this is the last reissue. because there have been tons of other copies made by various companies, i say if it's not broke don't fix it that's my opinion anyway. Paramount had already released the 60th edition last year so let's hope this is a perfect edition of this classic film, that keeps on selling for years to come .  I always get a tear in my eye at the end i must confess it's a tender part.<br /><br />All in All Like The Macy's Thanksgiving Parade this film is one that warms my heart and soul around christmas time in the arms of love ones and friends. This Film is an American Institution to me, It's a classic, pure and simple everybody should own a copy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />Update: I just watch this DVD and let  me tell you, that it's a wonderful package both Black and White and Color Versions Are Excellent and remastered very well for total clarity of picture and sound. the color version is just unbelievable,  i couldn't believe my eyes it's was better than the Republic version released in 89. and wasn't pasty looking, the colors looked natural like they belonged there. i do have agree with most of the  reviewers stating that the trailer for the queen's film, should've not been on this disc. i agree it was totally out of place to be on this DVD of such class. but that's only a small problem,  just fast forward it and enjoy the movie. curious though the color version does not have  a trailer on it thank goodness. what great buy this is, if you don't already own this film or just want an upgrade this for you . i love this edition personally because it gives you a choice of which version of the film, you want to watch on any given day.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>When I think of words to describe Frank Capra's masterpiece &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; only one word comes to mind: greatness. Greatness in its storytelling, which embodies the traditions and values of an American era gone by... greatness in its ability to generate some of the most complex characters in movie history from the simplest of human themes... greatness in its sense of heartfelt emotion and true knowledge of what life is really all about. Here is a movie that merits multiple viewings with each new holiday season, leaving its mark on each new generation while giving those familiar with it another chance to experience the magic. <p>People are most often surprised by the history of the film, which opened to moderate business at the box office, yet failed to muster the excitement and audience embracement that modern viewers have so lovingly bestowed upon it. Due to the weather, many people remained in their homes, while many who ventured to the bistro billed the film as too depressing for the Christmas season. And so, like a snowflake in the winter breeze, Frank Capra's slice-of-life film came and went like most modern movies of today. <p>Perhaps if its copyright had been renewed, we may never have known the true heart of this magnificent film, which has since become a traditional part of the holidays for many who revere the film as a classic; to bill it as anything but such is an injustice. The film has earned its popularity through its virtue and heartfelt emotional core, telling a story that serves as a model for humankind as well as a striking portrait of some of our country's most darkest days. <p>The story, originally a short story in the form of a Christmas card which was purchased by RKO Pictures for ten thousand dollars, takes us to the small town of Bedford Falls, where life is simple and people are filled with high spirits despite their hardships. At the center of this is George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart in one of the towering screen performances of all time; George has lofty ambitions that include &quot;seeing the world, building skyscrapers 1000 stories high,&quot; and &quot;a bridge a mile long.&quot; His idealistic view of the outside world is constantly put on hold, as he struggles to upkeep his deceased father's building and loan company, which is in danger of going under. <p>It may not appear so at first, but as the movie progresses, we can see just how much George does for his fellow man. He keeps the building and loan going as an outlet for those who have little or nothing to begin a better life without having to turn to Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore), &quot;the richest and meanest man in the county&quot; who sees fit to keep the citizens of Bedford Falls under his rule. But George will not allow it, and so, with the help of his newly-acquired wife, Mary (Donna Reed), and his business partner, his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), he struggles to keep the town alive, ignoring his own dreams and aspirations for the greater good, never realizing the full impact he has on his fellow man until he is given a frightening glimpse of what may have been had he never been born at all, compliments of angel Clarence Oddbody, played by Henry Travers with real wit and acting ability.<p>Through all of this, George's life is shown in various lights, from the happiest moments a man could ever wish for, to the darkest depths of depression from which every man spends much of his life running from. This is why Capra's film succeeds so enormously: one minute we are in the murkiest recesses of life, as George searches frantically for a way out of his troubles. Through Capra's direction and Stewart's brilliant acting, much of this third act is infused with sheer terror that still manages to evoke chills, as he discovers what his absence would have meant to the people he met in his life. And then, after the realization that running from one's hardships provides no solace, he returns from his nightmare to discover his life in a completely different light, armed with the knowledge that &quot;no man is a failure who has friends.&quot; <p>The overall film itself is a wonderful mosaic of American life at its most jubilant and its most downtrodden. As George grows up, from a small boy working in a drug store, to an ambitious college-bound teenager struck by love when he lays eyes on his future wife, we bear witness to some of the landmarks of our nation's history, from a Charleston contest at a high school dance, to the Great Depression and World War II. Each character is affected by these events, yet their upbeat demeanor in the face of these trying times magnificently captures the human resolve, and we come to care for all of them a great deal more. <p>And just as Capra is working his magic behind the camera, his wonderful and now-landmark cast works much of their own onscreen. Stewart's performance is one of history's most memorable, and will not soon be forgotten so long as the film remains in our hearts. Donna Reed evokes a warm and caring nature as Mary, sharing a terrific bond with Stewart that makes the marriage between their two characters affectionate and loving, not to mention totally convincing. Thomas Mitchell's eccentric and frantic Uncle Billy is supplied with heart, while each supporting actor offers humor and heartfelt emotion to the town's most notable citizens. Barrymore, too, plays the miserly Mr. Potter with supreme and delectable nastiness, one of Hollywood's most memorable villains. <p>Despite a less-than-favorable history, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; has reached its broad audience to find a home in everyone's hearts, with its wonderful storytelling, instantly likeable characters, and warm message about life. It takes risks in that it doesn't hide the hardships from view, but rather shows them in a most eerie and frightening manner, and this juxtaposition of gloom and happiness is the movie's biggest success. That, and its status as a great American film, a timeless classic which keeps us coming back for another slice of George Bailey's life each holiday season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>The incomparable Jimmy Stewart stars as everyman George Bailey, an adventurous dreamer in his youth who feels repeatedly held-down and shackled by a small-town life that he cannot seem to escape throughout his adult years. A group of angels look down on George as he grows from boyhood to adulthood and experiences wonderful moments brought about by seeming defeats and sidetracks from his own hopes and dreams. When we finally catch up with George in modern-day (the late nineteen-forties), a sudden moment of desperation on Christmas Eve has driven him to thoughts of suicide. Convinced that the world would be better off if he'd never been born, the angel Clarence comes to George to show him otherwise by introducing him to a bleak world that never knew him and all the good that he has done.<br /><br />Directed by Hollywood fave Frank Capra in 1946, "It's a Wonderful Life" was forgotten soon after its initial release despite being nominated for multiple Oscars. However, an amazing thing happened when the film fell into public domain decades later. Repeat viewings on television gradually made the film a Christmas tradition and one of the most beloved films of all time. To this day, I personally consider it to be the best film ever made (though it is not my absolute favorite film or even favorite Christmas film, but definitely among them). "It's a Wonderful Life" has it all. So many moments of this movie are pure magic caught on film, sometimes even by accident! The performances are fantastic, the passion of the telephone scene is something you'll never forget, and the ending is sure to leave you in tears!<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" has been released several times on DVD. I still have one of the earliest versions myself, if not THE earliest. Mine is the Silver Screen Classics release by Artisan, and it's quite satisfactory. The double-sided disc holds the film on side A and 3 extra features on side B. The features are the theatrical trailer, a Making Of documentary hosted by Tom Bosley, and "A Personal Remembrance" hosted by Frank Capra, Jr., which features interviews with Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Whichever version of the DVD you get though, be sure to get one, because this film is an annual must-watch at the very least! And, if you like this one, look for "The Bishop's Wife" (1947) and "Miracle on 34th Street" (1947) if you want to have the three best classic Christmas films ever! Actually, I need to pick up those other two myself!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>One of the most heartwarming and uplifting films ever created, Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life perfectly captures the human spirit through faith, love and second chances, and beautifully weaves an unforgettable tale. Essentially a twist on Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", the characters are richly developed and each scene is elegantly directed. Jimmy Stewart displays the purest of human emotions with unbeatable acting, as does the superlative supporting cast including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.<br /><br />In Bedford Falls, George Bailey (James Stewart) contemplates suicide. Through the prayers of countless friends, an angel named Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers) is sent to Earth to help George in his plight. From here the story backtracks with a narration by Joseph, the head angel, to fill in the details of Bailey's life. As a young boy he saves his brother Harry from drowning, and later after the untimely death of his father, stays in Bedford Falls to help run the Business and Loan Company, started by his father and business partner, Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), years ago. George desperately wants to leave the small town that he's been cooped up in his whole life, but continually finds himself staying, first to save the business, then to allow his younger brother to go off to college, and finally to wed childhood sweetheart Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). When the conniving Mr. Potter, the richest man in town, who has been trying to buy out the Business and Loan Company his entire life, discovers a banking error that could destroy the fledgling company, George becomes impetuous and is convinced he's worth more dead than alive. "Is he sick?" asks the angel Clarence. "No, worse", responds Joseph. "He's discouraged".<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart turns in a tour de force of Christmas spirit, hope and anguish, and he lights up the screen like few others. His acting is flawless and his emotions utterly genuine. Donna Reed is also exceptional as Mary, the girl who is madly in love with George and content with waiting until he realizes his feelings are reciprocal. It is a timeless romance and an essential part of this film which is often overlooked by the comparisons to Scrooge's revelations in "A Christmas Carol". The love story is prominent and heartfelt, and while noticeably characterized by the 40's strict sense of decent relationships, an inspiring image that never fades. Lionel Barrymore plays Mr. Potter, the "Grinch" character who never does receive proper requital, although we are content knowing he never rises above the changeless miserable miser figure he holds throughout the film. He hates everyone who has anything he doesn't have - although money has never been one of those things.<br /><br />And then there's Clarence, the simple angel who is anxious to receive his wings by helping Bailey realize the value of God's greatest gift. Henry Travers portrays Clarence with wonderfully elementary honesty and presents humorous situations of disbelief for George, which quickly turns to panic at the insistence and demonstration of Clarence's guardian angel abilities. Clarence, while only appearing at the very end of the film, is a major player, giving George the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he were never born. George spends a great deal of time struggling with disbelief at Pottersville, so renamed because of his absence in preventing Potter from taking over the town. His friends and family don't recognize him, and he is reduced to tears at all of the now indifferent lives he didn't know he had touched. As Clarence points out, it's remarkable to see how many people are influenced by a single individual.<br /><br />Written, produced and directed by the legendary Frank Capra, It's A Wonderful Life created countless poignant and memorable moments and themes that would later be referenced and remembered in future filmmaking. George wants to do big and important things away from Bedford Falls, realizing only at the conclusion how important it was for him not to accomplish those goals. The broken down Waldorf hotel becomes the home of George and Mary's dreams and even the location for the perfect honeymoon, one that the newlyweds missed out on initially, and George shouting from the top of the very bridge he nearly leapt from: "I want to live again!" In the end, George is the richest man in town, measured not by his wealth, but by his friends.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>The holiday season is not far off as I am writing this. I just received my copy of "It's A Wonderful Life". Several years ago about every t.v. station aired this classic. That is until NBC snatched up the exclusive rights to the Jimmy Stewart film about this hero down on his luck until his meeting with Clarence. Donna Reed did an excellent job in her role. I may sound prejudice but she is one of tbe best and she was from my home state of Iowa!!!!  It's A Wonderful Life..even though it was panned by the critics and was not one of the big box office hits of 1946,the movie has stood the test of time ever since for a new generation to enjoy. And always remember...every time a bell rings an angel earns his or her wings!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>In Frank Capra's film imagination and ideal sentimental outlook of post WW2 America, Bedford Falls is the small town American dream. Looking back as a child this world was the "real" America or at least the way we all thought and felt it should be.<br /><br />I remember seeing this film at the young age of six or seven, in my pyjamas sprawled in front of the black and white TV set with my two younger sisters, though it was in the middle of July, before it became a "Christmas Tradition", the entire family sat attentive, watching George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) grow and become something of the true "good" man: sensitive, loving, caring and loyal.<br /><br />Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) is simply stunning and so innocent, beautiful and loved George with all her heart.<br /><br />George and Mary's wedding night is so Irish, small town, simple and lovely to watch as they come to terms with that broken-down "house" which had become a symbol of their respective dreams. Even as a small child, the old guy outside their window on their wedding night, singing lyrics of love felt to me to be true. We loved these two people because they were really in love and at bottom, we all want that love.<br /><br />Love becomes reality when the children arrive and making a living, a family, is important.<br /><br />George Bailey had always dreams of travelling the world. Even to the end, he kept old "tourist" pamphlets and books of far away places but something, people and basic life obligations always somehow prevented that dream.<br /><br />The villain of the film is Mr. Potter, (Lionel Barrymore) a Dickensian-like character, a true Capitalist without heart, pushed hard to turn Bedford Falls into a "Las Vegas", though it was little George Bailey, caring and deeply aware of the "worker" the "little man" who staved the ugly and evil Mr. Potter off from attaining his selfish goals.<br /><br />How this turn in the plot occurs, however, is pure fantasy, because as George Bailey stresses, having lost money ( by the stupidity of Uncle Billy) owed to the tyrant, is about to do a willing free-fall into the river, Clarence, an apprentice angel, prevents George from his self-destructive action, and talks Bailey into trying life again. The way the angel does this is true wisdom combined with loving magic.<br /><br />How would life be if you had never been born?<br /><br />Clarence the bumbling angel takes George through Bedford as though he never existed. George discovers that his life did have an affect on the town and the many lives he would have come in contact with. In a few words, without George, Bedford did indeed become a "Las Vegas" and his friends, particularly Mary, were lost.<br /><br />George comes back to reality and the entire community give back to George who has done so much for them, (the money Uncle Billy had lost) on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />A little bell rings which signifies an angel has moved up and finally attained their "wings". As an angel, Clarence, has turned a good man from self destruction, and now can move upward...and fly.<br /><br />This Frank Capra film written by Philip Van Doren Stern (story) and Francis Goodrich, et al., has somehow taught us that giving is one of the truest virtues of them all.<br /><br />A splendid film.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>The quintessential Frank Capra film and a heartwarming holiday treat year in and year out, "Life" is the ultimate optimistic statement on the value of love, life, and community. Capra's masterful handling of the bittersweet storyline--in which Bailey sacrifices his own dreams to run the family savings-and-loan business and keep his hometown of Bedford Falls out of Potter's greedy paws--is pure Hollywood magic. Reed and Barrymore give exceptional performances, but Stewart, in one of his all-time great roles (a personal favorite), is the dynamic, all-too-human force holding it all together. Revived in the '70s after languishing in copyright limbo, "Life" is nostalgic and achingly sentimental, but doesn't shrink from portraying the dark side of American life. If "Zuzu's petals" don't put a lump in your throat, wait till a revivified George finds a special surprise waiting for him back home. Let those tear ducts flow, because "It's a Wonderful Life."</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>1947's "It's a Wonderful Life" has rightly been a Christmas favorite for years.  Frank Capra's classic movie carries the simple but powerful message that everyone can be a hero in their own lives, and no one is poor who has friends.<br /><br />The story features James Stewart as George Bailey, a banker in the small town of Bedford Falls.  Facing financial ruin on Christmas Eve, he comtemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, gives him an opportunity to see his life as it might have been without him.  George, although hardworking, good-hearted, happily married, and modestly successful, has unluckily never had the opportunity to pursue bigger dreams outside Bedford Falls.  In the disturbingly dark alternate version of his life, we discover that George had a postive impact on a lot of people over the years, and without him, those lives went badly wrong.  In the end, George is offered the chance to return to his life as he has lived it, and discovers the true value of friendship.<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" features an exceptionally solid cast and crisp black and white cinematography.  Frank Capra's excellent direction carries us through the emotional gauntlet of George Bailey's painful voyage of discovery about the truth of his life. The feel-good ending will make the viewer appreciate his or her own Christmas as the annual small miracle it is.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a family Christmas movie on a par with the better versions of Dicken's "Christmas Carol."</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>You do NOT have to wait until Christmas to open this gift. Frank Capra's wonderful film of 1946, may be enjoyed anytime of the year. "It's A Wonderful Life" is the feel good movie of the all time.It should be watched anytime you need a lift!(Okay, Okay , you can watch it at Christmas time too!).<br /><br />ASC(Angel Second Class), Clarence Oddbody needs to get his wings.George Bailey is desperately in need of an Angel. So the powers up above arrange a meeting. It's a story made in heaven.<br /><br />Clarence gets to view George Bailey's life from the time he was a young boy until the present, when George is having so many problems he thinks he would be better off if he'd never been born (it may be safe to say we have all had days like that!). We watch as George touches the lives of so many from boyhood to adulthood. He saves his brother's life,he stops his boss(a druggist) from making a fatal mistake, he saves the family business, "The Building and Loan Assoc" from the hands of the Scroogelike Mr. Potter, is friend and mentor to so many, and although never gets to follow his dreams of travel, settles down with the girl next door in his town, "Bedford Falls".<br /><br />But things start going amiss for poor George,an accidental misplacement of a large sum of money, and the auditor showing up just at the wrong time, causes George to face loosing everything he THINKS is important. He's on the bridge, ready to pack it all in when his guardian angel Clarence shows up in the nick of time.Clarence shows George what life would REALLY be like if he was never born. It's not good! George must realize that "It's A Wonderful Life" before he can exist again.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey. He is just tremendous in this role. We see the full range of his talents as he runs the course of going from carefree, to distraught, to bitter and finally elated with life as he discovers Zuzu's petals have reappeared in his pocket.The petals that disappeared from his pocket when he disappeared from existence. Henry Travers is Clarence and there has never been a more cherubic angel than he. Donna Reed as Mary(George's wife) is exceptional at making a wonderful life for George and looking great doing it. And Lionel Barrymore is the mean Mr. Potter who we love to hate. There are so many other famous faces to look for that do such a superb job, here are a few...the great character actor Thomas Mitchell is the forgetful "Uncle Billy", Lillian Randolph is "Annie", the housekeeper, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey, Ellen Corby, the lady who only wants $17.50, Gloria Grahame is Violet and don't miss Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, mischievous as ever at the pool scene.<br /><br />So it's clear as a bell(oh..I think an Angel just got his wings!)if you're feeling a little down, watch this movie and like Zuzu's petals, your smile will reappear.<br /><br />Happy Viewing, and Happy Holidays......Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>James Stewart was, before this film, a competent actor with indisputable professionalism.  In the decades after this film, he became George Bailey to the fourth generation after his own...<br /><br />He viewed his own contribution more simply, though.  He felt that acting was a job like any other.  This degree of modesty and "class" is awfully rare these days.  Looking at the whole of his acting career, this film is not really his "best effort."  He was pleased to play good guys and bad guys, heroes and villians, and, I think, longed to be seen as somebody who knew how to deliver the goods regardless.<br /><br />My admiration for him is great, and I miss him terribly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>George Bailey (James Stewart) gives up his dreams of world travel to run the family business, a little bank that just manages to survive by making home loans to the poor.  When catastrophe strikes and it seems that he will lose everything, he despairs, only to have divine providence step in to show him how valuable his life and struggle has been for so many people.<br /><br />This film has an innocence and exuberance that transcends any charges of schmaltz, sentimentality, or cheesiness that may understandably be leveled against it.  We follow the trajectory of George's life through his youth, his marriage to his high school sweetheart (Donna Reed), and his position as a community leader who is the only buffer between the people and the rapacious Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the richest man in town.  James Stewart gives a truly great performance, believably portraying George Bailey both as a man who inspires the affection of his community and one whose disillusionment and fear drive him into a personal hell from which suicide seems the only escape.  The term "heart-warming" was probably coined just to describe the finale of this film./</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This rates up with my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  I grew up on the Donna Reed show and remember that this was the movie I always saw her in and she was a lot more beautiful then.  James Stewart is great as George Baily, the guy who wanted to help everybody and sacrificed his own financial success.<br /><br />The idea that one doesn't realize one's worth until you are removed from the equation has been copied hundreds of times since but never as well as this movie.<br /><br />Clarence is probably the most enjoyable bumbling character that I have ever seen.  There is a cameo by an adult Alfalfa Sweitzer (for the Our Gang series) and the characters of Bert and Ernie later were immortalized by Sesame Street.<br /><br />The ending of this movie is the "feel good" ending of all-time!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>For many, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a staple to their holiday traditions.  With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday.  As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago.  It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers.  For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again.  As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; "It's A Wonderful Life" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business.  With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself.  I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams "Merry Christmas" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape.  "It's A Wonderful Life" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy.  The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place.  This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing - giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him - but also a glimpse of a world without small business<br /><br />"It's A Wonderful Life", the film itself, is beautifully crafted.  With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image.  Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls.  Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town.  Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave - and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own.  Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting.  Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism.  His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes.  When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him - we scream with him.  This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters - we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles - and they do.  One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received.  His enormous sets, the birth of a new "snow", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe.  What I enjoy about "It's A Wonderful Life" is that Capra tricks you by the end.  Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time.  One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film - since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets.  Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural.  Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.  This film teeters between drama and science fiction, while so many critics award this film the "feel-good" holiday movie during December; I find it a bit strange that perhaps this film lead to so many other science fiction movies of the same nature.  Perhaps the "Cloverfield" monster could be considered a Clarence to someone in New York City?  I may be stretching a bit, but what pulls me into this film time and time again is the fact that Clarence is not of Earth, yet George easily believes.  He listens, follows, and - with some resistance - does what Clarence orders.  This is a film without guns, without explosions, without the President getting on his red phone - but instead a film where a celestial being can visit someone without fear, anger, or confusion.  This is why I collect the "Alf" television series.<br /><br />Overall, "It's A Wonderful Life" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home.  The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world.  Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values.  The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer - the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back.  Dreams are traded for jobs - communities are strengthened by friendships.  This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls.  The science fiction element to this film, yep - that is what I am considering it - comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout.  Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes?  Brilliant!  While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film.  Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever.  Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever.  It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>It's a Wonderful Life- It's a classic well known to every generation, even those who claim they hate black and white movies and who never watch family films. Why are Frank Capra's films so universal and timeless, especially this one? Well, watch it and find out.<br /><br />The story concerns George Bailey (James Stewart), a guy from a small town that everyone knows and loves. As a boy he worked in a drugstore, his father at a savings and loan bank, and when his father died, he took over, despite aching to see the world and go to college. He did his duty but found happiness in a girl in town, Mary (Donna Reed) who became his wife. However, through the storybook life, there was a sense of longing for childhood dreams and a feeling of emptiness in George. This only manifested itself when Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the local rich curmudgeon with selfish ambition, antagonized George. Finally, at a turning point in his life, George is faced with failure and faces an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) whose purpose is to pull George back from the precipice of suicide.<br /><br />It is difficult not to get wrapped up in such a story. You don't have to be from a small town, you don't have to be married, and you don't have to be middle aged to understand this movie and to love it. The themes and the sentiments are universal. Everyone likes to feel they are basically good and that the forces against them are evil; that is what this story is about, good trying to win over evil. Such a basic idea is enhanced by wonderful camerawork, brilliant acting, and amazing directing done in the golden age of Hollywood.<br /><br />This is no Christmas story, so do not hesitate to watch it any day of the year. The uplifting tone is often associated with an allotted time for giving each year, but it is appropriate for any time. Perhaps that is what we all need.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I have seen hundreds of movies that move me, "It's a Wonderful Life" have been one of my favorite Christmas story as long as I can remember. Many people find it corny and old fashioned, I find it uplifting and as true in content today as the day it was made. No one could have portrayed the character of George Bailey like the unforgettable Jimmy Stewart....and Donna Reed and the entire cast.......Wow!!<br /><br />I think Frank Capra must have had a sixth sense when it came to knowing who would cast well with whom. I cannot count how many times I have viewed this movie, and every time I do it's as though it's the first time I have seen it.<br /><br />I am hard pressed to pick a favorite scene, but if I did I think it would be when the druggist, Mr. Gower, realizes that George did not deliver the capsules that contained poison, and hugs him. Without being asked, George tells him he will never tell a living soul......and does not.<br /><br />In closing, I would say there is probably not a person alive that could not benefit from the message in this movie. This is a true example of just how wonderful life is, and the final scene will help anyone who is sad or going through depression see that very well. A truly great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>For those of you visiting Earth for the first time and who have no idea what this film is about, here is a review:<br /><br />"It's A Wonderful Life" begins in heaven, as angels discuss the sudden glut of prayers from the citizens of Bedford Falls, as they ask for help for George Bailey.  A man worthy of support from above, the angels decide to help George and dispatch Clarence, an angel in training, to do the job.<br /><br />The first ninety minutes of the film work as Clarence's (and the audience's) crash-course in George Bailey 101, as Clarence views the most important events in Bailey's life.  Clarence sees George as a little boy saving his brother's life and correcting potentially dangerous errors of his original employer, the town pharmacist.  As the young boy grows into an adult (Jimmy Stewart in the role for which he will most be remembered), George's life becomes one of compromise.  His dreams of seeing the world and a life of "importance" must be tempered and put on hold, as George settles for a job in his father's building and loan.  His friends and younger brother go off to exciting careers and fight in WWII, while George gets stuck in Bedford Falls and tries to convince the townsfolk to invest in each others' homes.<br /><br />Clarence comes in to George's life just as he has decided his life is a failure.  Wishing he had never been born, Clarence grants that request and lets George see Bedford Falls as it would be without George Bailey.  What follows is a declaration as to the power of the individual, as George gets to see how much his life changed the world for the better.<br /><br />Singed into our culture and as regular a part of the Christmas season as long lines at Wal-Mart, "It's a Wonderful Life" is the rare film that literally affects people's actions.  Almost everyone sees in George Bailey the humanity that we all can be and once dreamed of being.  The yearly viewing of this film reminds people of noble intentions they once had and the compromises we all make along the way.  I have no doubt that the night after this film is shown each year (usually the Saturday after Thanksgiving) people all across our country hit their pillows with goals and promises of doing better and doing more with their lives.  This little movie shows us all that we matter in the world, and that's a message we all need to hear from time to time.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>How ironic that this once-forgotten and neglected film became by 1990 the most taken-for-granted American movie as a result of multiple screenings on virtually every television channel during the Christmas season.  Now that it's been removed from public domain and its distribution returned to studio control, perhaps we can begin to appreciate once again what an extraordinary film it actually is.<p>New viewers, especially, have the opportunity to approach the movie not with assumptions about its &quot;excessive sentimentality&quot; but to experience the darkness of George Bailey's suicidal descent, without  which the film's ending would not provide such overwhelming relief and celebration of life's &quot;wonderfulness.&quot;  But prior to this emotional pay-off, we are also first-hand witnesses to much emotional pain.  George's &quot;surrender&quot; to Mary, for example, is perhaps the most memorable kiss in all of film because of its violence (he curses and practically strangles her while yielding up his idealistic dreams of personal greatness).  And later when it appears he has transplanted his grandiose visions to Bedford Falls, where he is its proudest citizen, we suddenly see what his pride has led him to: a complacent self-satisfaction so great it can lead him to thoughts of self-destruction over the disappearance of a mere $5000.<p>More than Scrooge's stinginess or Dante the Pilgrim's sinfulness, George's story reminds us of our own misplaced piorities and their distorted, potentially fatal, consequences.  This is a film that encourages self-examination and affirmation of life like few others.  And because of it's archetypal patterns and complex, rich details of production and performance (it's far more than a &quot;talking picture&quot;), the film can never be reduced to a mere &quot;message.&quot;  It invites numerous viewings, each leading to the discovery of fresh, new meanings.<p>  If you see one film a year, make it this one (even if it's not during Christmas).</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>I wanted to see Its a wonderful life, but was subjected to a movie preview before<br />the magic hit me.......What a bad decision by the studios...but this is not the<br />first time...ive been getting VHS (noy yet on DVD) and even if the movie is a<br />classic from the old days,  they tag movie preview from today's movie on it.<br />Its bad, but they need the money you know....<br /><br />For the movie, hey...loved it in black and white...and love it in Color. Seeing it<br />in black and white for the first time is almost a must, because some scenes have<br />more emotional value to them when filmed in black and white. Then when you see<br />the film in color you can feel the difference.<br /><br />Great film for all..and nicely restored versions....enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>This original uncut version of "It's A Wonderful Life" shows the entire story of George Bailey {James Stewart} when he was a child and shows everything in the movie, like about his guardian angel Clarence watching flashbacks of George's life, unlike on tv where it's cut short for commercials. Even more wonderful is that it doesn't miss out on a single detail. This has to be one of the most heartwarming christmas films ever made for being a classic. It explains everything there was to ever explain about the story, and it only becomes more excellent late in the movie when George soon discovers what his life is really about after he sees what it would have been like if he didn't exist. Highly recommended for a christmas movie that is perhaps even more heartwarming than even "Miracle on 34th Street" {1947}. 5 out of 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>Would you believe that this film tanked at the box office?  Critics ripped it to shreds saying that it was too sappy and sweet.  Humbug.  This is the most classic film of all time and if you haven't seen this yet then you haven't really had Christmas.  Yes, yes I know they show it 500,000 times every Christmas but that's because people love it so.  I'm glad that Jimmy Stewart lived long enough to see it become so loved by movie watchers around the world.<br /><br />In case you've been living on Mars for the past hundred years, it's the story of George Bailey (James Stewart) who wants to build great buildings and travel the world.  He feels left out as all his friends go on to college while he helps his father at the family business.  Just when he's all set to finally go to college his father dies and he has to stay on at the Bailey Building and Loan.  A few years later his brother comes home but has just gotten married and received a job offer even though he was supposed to be coming home to take over the business so George could finally travel.  No such luck.<br /><br />Finally George realizes that he's not going anywhere and he's married with four kids.  One day his uncle misplaces $8,000.00 bucks and George is threatened with jail time.  He loses all hope and decides it would be better if he had never been born and plans to commit suicide but an angel shows him what would have happend if he had not been born. The angel convinces him that he should not throw away God's greatest gift.  It turns out that he helped so many people (including saving the life of his only brother) none of them would have made it without his help.  Because he saved his brother, his brother was able to save the lives of many of his comrads in the army.  Because of that, his brother won the Congressional Medal of Honor.  But George learns that if he had not been there to save his brother, every man on that army transport would have died because his brother would not have been there to save them.  Because he helped so many along the way, they in turn help him when he's in the darkest pit of his life.<br /><br />This may be the most spoofed movie of all time.  Saturday Night Live spoofed it more than once and so did Married with Children just to name a couple of shows.  Perhaps even more spoofed is the ever popular Scrooge.<br /><br />It's a Wonderful Life is a Timeless classic.  It applies itself to any year, any day, any country, any family, any race.  "One life touches so many others."  Ain't that the truth.  Don't pass this by.  Please watch this with your children.  It is still as heart warming as ever.  You can even take it back to Mars with you when you leave!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>You simply cannot go wrong with this movie!!!

It is an annual Christmas watch for me, along with "Scrooge" to absorb the Season's Spirit.  Overall it has a kind and generous message, although you sometimes feel it is corny, it works.  The main character, George Bailey, is played by Jimmy Stewart .  George has a problem at the bank he manages.  The examiners are there and $8,000 is missing.  A greedy, mean-spirited bank president finds the $8,000 in cash and keeps it to make George's life miserable.  George has  serious problems and contemplates suicide and drives his old car to a  lonely snowy spot on the town's bridge.  His guardian angel  "Clarence" played by Henry Travers appears and jumps in before George!  George jumps to rescue him and they end up drying clothes in a small shack together.  George wishes he had never been born and his wish comes true.  Clarence gives him the wish, and tours George through the town as it would have been without him.  It shows how George sacrificed his education for his brother's (who becomes a war hero), he kept the savings and loan going for his family, and  protected the small town from the avarice and greed of Mr. Potter.  George also married his beautiful childhood sweetheart (Donna Reed).  If none of this had happened, the town would have hit bottom and lives would have been wasted.  George saw what might have been and learned his life was important.  In the end, the town came together with plenty of money to save the Savings and Loan and his reputation.  The only "open-ended" item was why Mr. Potter never gave the stolen  $8,000 back to the bank he ran.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>The LION'S GATE 45th anniversary VHS edition of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a fine-quality dub.

Its message, similar to A Christmas Carol, is that a good look at your past deeds will help to put your current world into context. In Scrooge's case, it was his bad past that helps him to create a better future. In this Capra tale, it is the realization that the main character has done a lot of good in the past - and that it really has made a big difference in peoples' lives.<br /><br />I won't give away a lot of plot details here. If you're like most people, you've probably seen this several times over the years and appreciated the nuanced layers of meaning offered by the storyline. If you haven't seen this yet, then most definitely rent or buy it for a viewing, without "knowing what's coming".<br /><br />You can say the movie is a bit sappy - but there are times we can all appreciate a bit of sappiness in order to help a message "go down" more smoothly. We've all had times in our life that we feel frustrated, that maybe we aren't making a difference. This movie helps to show that the feelings are common ones - and that usually they are not warranted at all. The movie also helps to demonstrate that good deeds are always remembered, and that people really appreciate even the little ones.<br /><br />A good movie for watching with family and talking about.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a classic film without a doubt. When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say. When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope. Someone somewhere does care. You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it. You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you. You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with. Perhaps is worth living after all. You may have more to offer than you ever knew. You will be missed. You never know what's around the bend of life. Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly. Yet, he perseveres. My heart goes out to him in this film. He just seems so sincere. Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart. Thank you so much for this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Although it didn't impress much at the time of it's release, this film probably more than most others, goes to show that eventually the cream always rises to the top.  It's just a charming, heart-warming film with a nice mix of comedy, drama, sadness, despair and joy which makes it difficult for any human being to not be touched emotionally in some way by this film.  The screenplay is very good, the casting excellent and James Stewart shows why he is considered to be among the greatest screen actors of all time.<br /><br />The DVD though isn't all that much to shout about.  The Special Features are pretty decent with a very good documentary about the film hosted by Tom Bosley of "Happy Days" fame being the standout but it's placed on the the "B" side of this single disc.  Fortunately with the advent of Blu-ray and the much greater capacity such a format affords, we don't have to put up with this inconvenience any longer.  The sound quality is in the original mono format which has been THX mastered which makes it the best possible mono quality that you can find.  However, it would have been nice if they were to provided Dolby or otherwise 5.1 Surround Sound Options as well.  The picture quality has been restored but not very well as visual imperfections exist throughout the film suggesting either a poorly preserved master or that the restoration job wasn't the best.<br /><br />I note at the time of writing that a Blu-Ray version is out there and I wonder if they made any more audio and visual restorations and if so, I will certainly put it on my list of Blu-Ray titles to get in the future.  If you are not too picky about the "dirtiness" of the picture quality, this DVD is certainly one for your collection that bears the test of repeated viewing and enjoyment.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is a classic film and should be in everyone's holiday DVD collection.

Thus spoke Clarence, angel - second class, to the suicidal George Bailey, owner and manager of the local, recently bankrupt "Building & Loan Co." in Bedford Falls, somewhere U.S.A.<br /><br />Of course George doesn't believe this silly, little old man is really an angel, nor does he believe his wish to "never have been born" has just been granted. However the reality of the situation is soon to set in when he discovers that no one in Bedford Falls has ever heard of George Bailey. Not only is he viewed as a stranger in town, but the town itself is nothing like it was before he met Clarence. In fact it's no longer 'Bedford Falls.' It's 'Pottersville.'<br /><br />Yes, George finally comes to realize that Clarence is right, a life is a terrible thing to throw any. We are all connected to each other in ways we could never imagine, nor fully comprehend. The absence of just one life may have devastating consequences on others.<br /><br />Has George learned his lesson? Can an angel - second class, reverse the wish and restore George back to his family and friends in time for Christmas? And lastly, has Clarence finally earned his wings? Considering the fact that "It's A Wonderful Life" is one of the most beloved Christmas films of all-time I'm sure you already know the answer.<br /><br />Simply the best Hollywood has to offer at Christmas, or anytime of the year! Thanks to director Frank Capra and the whole cast for making this film a part of my holiday family viewing tradition.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>Since I saw this movie several times before, when I decided to see it again I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  One sign of a truly great movie is that you can watch it more than once and enjoy it.  This is a great movie.<br /><br />It cuts to the heart of the question of what makes life worthwhile.  The answer that it gives is that the kind acts that we do, the love we show, are what makes life worth living.<br /><br />I like the way it portrays America as being run by greedy and power hungry men.  The whole world is run by them.  But they don't run everything.  And I believe that the underlying premise of this movie, that there is a Heaven, that there is a God, even that there are angels, is very likely true, and that the purpose of living our lives here is not to amass the greatest fortune before we die.  It's to build bonds of loyalty and love to take home to Heaven with us when we graduate from this school of hard knocks.<br /><br />I don't want to claim that this movie is perfect.  It never pays to do that.  A good review, even if it's a rave, should have some constructive criticism in it.  I haven't seen a perfect movie yet.<br /><br />In that spirit I would say that even though Donna Reed's acting is good as George Bailey's wife, the script writer used her as a cardboard character who never falls off her pedestal.  It was a badly written character, a non-person, just too perfect.  I see no reason for that, considering that the writer showed us George Bailey at his worst, badgering a teacher on the phone, badgering his kids, occasionally being a dope.  The writer should have breathed at least a little life and imperfection into Mrs Bailey too.  She should not have been written as a robot.  She could also have been given a sense of humor.<br /><br />I got a kick out of the cabbie and the cop being named Ernie and Bert.  I understand that the Sesame Street characters were named after them.<br /><br />In today's world, where we only believe what we can see with our own eyes, I think we've lost some truths that are contained in this movie.  I'm not kidding.  I think there are angels, and I think there is a Heaven, and I think that those things are more real than the chair you're sitting on.  We teach our kids to believe in Santa Claus, and then we pull the rug out from under them and let them know Santa isn't real, but I think you will be surprised to find out that Heaven is real, angels are real, and God is real.  I don't think those are just children's stories.<br /><br />I would also disagree with the director's decision to show Jimmy Stewart at his worst.  In a few scenes he is really, and there is no other way of putting it, an obnoxious jerk.  As soon as life deals him some legal trouble, he gets really bad.  I'd prefer my heroes to show a little more poise under pressure, and George Bailey fails miserably in that department.  While Donna Reed is far too goody-goody, with no blood running through her veins, Jimmy Stewart is at times a most unlikeable hero.  We have to remind ourselves that he did save a life or two and make a few sacrifices earlier in life.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this film is that I don't understand how a bank president (isn't that what he is?) and a real estate developer (isn't he that too?) is doing so poorly financially, and why the loss of $6,000 would be so devastating to his savings and loan.  That's a bit much to swallow.  When Uncle Stupid lost the money, I really don't think the roof caves in on a savings and loan.<br /><br />In other words, we are being fed a sob story that can't be real.<br /><br />Lionel Barrymore makes a wonderful villain.  Actually he reminds me of Jim Backus as Mister Magoo, minus the myopia.  He represents the Evil Capitalist, the greedy miser who owns everything.  Did you notice that when George Bailey is removed from the picture, it turns out that Mister Magoo turned his town into a place full of girly shows?  That is so funny.  In those innocent post-war days, the way they painted a bad town was by putting girly shows in it.  Drugs?  Crime?  Of course not.  Those were innocent days.<br /><br />There are times in all our lives that we want to escape our reality, we want to die, we wish we were never born, and so on.  I feel that way a few times a day, actually.  It is comforting to think that it really is important that we lived, that we really did have a good impact on someone.  Did I?  I don't know.  I'm glad for George Bailey's sake that he did.  Now if only he could learn to curb that obnoxious and self centered behavior of his, and be more sensitive to other people's feelings.  Sometimes he's like a child, just popping out with the stupidest and most cutting things.  Good thing he gave us reasons to like him, because it isn't always easy.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, everywhere you go. Now before we start breaking out into song, let's focus on what the Christmas holiday means to all of us. For younger children, this is the time to be away from school and enjoy all the wonderful presents they have begged Santa for over the past four to five weeks. For the more adult crowd (at least most of them), Christmas is the time to gather with family and friends, swap stories and memories, and hope they don't get a necktie or socks as a gift. The festive yuletide season is also the time when the greatest films of all time are shown across millions of televisions sets across the country and possibly the world as well. You have your comedies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, the cartoon treasures such as A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and those delightful classics like White Christmas and The Bishop's Wife. But none of these can hold a candle to Frank Capra enduring theatrical triumph, It's a Wonderful Life. Amazingly the feature wasn't considered a Christmas film until its repetitive showings in the 1970's when the copyright on the film went up. Now it is basically considered a near crime for this film not to be seen at least during this festive time of year. Quite amazing to see how a total box office dud can rise over the years to be not only the greatest Christmas film but one of the most enduring classics of all time.<p>The story follows a man who is at the end of his rope and how he discovers that he really has bigger purpose in life then he had originally thought. George Bailey is a good man who has never accomplished the goals he once set for himself as a young boy. Growing up in the little town of Bedford Falls, George dreamed of venturing out into the world and visiting many different and exotic places without a care for anybody else but himself. Unfortunately luck does not seem to be on his side as every opportunity he has to escape the little town ends with him in the same place he has been for all of his life while others get to enjoy the life George wishes he had. Now in charge of his father's loan office, George Bailey faces one of the greatest challenges of his life. Uncle Billy has lost the $8,000 that the loan office carried and Mr. Potter, the richest and stingiest man in town, has issued a warrant for his arrest. George now contemplates taking his own life until his guardian angel shows him the world as if he was never born and it's a more frightening situation then he had ever imagined. The story for It's a Wonderful Life is quite a simple premise and yet it has to be one of the most inspiring and insightful plots in motion picture history. No other film in recent memory can claim it has pulled off the same premise as wonderfully as Capra's classic has.<p>Though there are many memorable performances in It's Wonderful Life, the overall emotional support lies on the performance of only one man, James Stewart. It was once said of director Frank Capra that Stewart was his first and only choice for the role of George Bailey and that shows in his emotionally driven performance in the two hour feature. Jimmy Stewart showcases a wide range of expresses from his frustration when Uncle Billy loses the money, till exasperation when he stands at the bridge contemplating whether to kill himself or not, to his exuberance at discovering he is able to live once again. James Stewart has to be one of the most treasured performers ever to come across the silver screen and no more so then in this film. What makes this feature even more special is the fact that this was the performer's first feature film since coming back from his service in World War II. Jimmy Stewart should be revered not only for his dedication to his profession but to his country as well.<p>Overall, It's a Wonderful Life's message of necessity and good nature of man kind rings no harder in the minds of movie-goers then it does today. Plenty of classic holiday films have come along over the years including such favorites as The Santa Clause, The Grinch, and the recent smash-hit, Elf, but none of them can ever come close to the staying power of Frank Capra's crowning achievement. The truth is that the messages expressed in the film go way beyond the holiday season and can be enjoyed during any time of the year with as great of amount of enthusiasm as if the Christmas spirit was all around. Granted the film has been labeled overly-sentimental but if anything that is more a greater compliment then anything else one can say about one the true treasures in cinematic history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>How can a man go from be happy to misable? But it can happen. George Bailey starts life as happy boy turning itno man, and was around to save to save his 8 years old brother from drowing but then causing him to lose hearing in one ear. As a 12 year old he works in a drug store for kind of a gumpy man (H.B. Warner). The movie starts with some people in a town called Bedfordfalls praying to god to help George Bailey (James Stewart). Which leads us to see a couple of talking things that are supposed to be god and angles (and angles in training). Then we got a flashback of George's life as a 12 years old boy in 1919. When he saves his brother Harry. Then we see him becoming a man who knows what he wants to do tommrrow, the next day and the next year, he wants to leave the little town and see the world. Which he learn from when he tells that his girlfriend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). After he breaks a window at this big house.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Even though some years it is overly shown on TV I still love this movie and never tire of it. I think what makes it one of my favorites is that it tells much more than a Christmas story. It tells us that no matter what we do, we matter. We touch so many peoples lifes during our lifetime that like a butterfly flitting across a blue sky in Illinois may lead to the wind a Sailing ship needs in the Sea of Japan. Well a little overstated maybe but we do in fact cause ripples in the fabric of our civilization. We all may never impact so many as George Bailey does, but we certainly can make a difference even if it is just one we touch. Anyone no matter what age should enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I have to make an admission that I'm not exactly proud of.  Despite numerous opportunities to see this film over the years outside of a few snippets I casually watched this is the first time I've seen "It's a Wonderful Life" in it's entirety.  I had no conscious resistance to the film.  When it was in the public domain it seemed like it was on TV every night on every channel so my thought was I'll catch it some other time.  Some other time finally came and, boy, was I wrong not to catch this cinematic treasure earlier.  This is not just a celebration of Christmas but a celebration of American idealism.  Bedford Falls, a microcosm of middle America, epitomizes the sense of community that we may not achieve but at least aspire to.  George Bailey(James Stewart) is our everyman who perserveres  despite the disappointments life throws at him.  Behind every good man there is a good woman and his wife Mary(Donna Reed) encapsulates that.  The film's basic premise is that every person has an impact on their community, for better or for worse, and despite the curveballs thrown our way life is worth living.  In lesser hands this theme could have been greeting card hokum but in director Frank Capra's hands it is life affirming.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>The box is pretty neat, it's has the classic picture of Bailey and his family with his angel looking up with a 3-D tree sits in the background with the ornament. I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it's nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you'll remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That's the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.<br /><br />The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.<br /><br />The movie is well worth the price it's an American classic. As long as dvd's and blu-ray and whatever comes after that exist, movie companies will always release the same dvds over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>Simply the best Christmas movie of all-time !!!!!

A  man is framed by the local capitalist in Bedford Falls who wants to put his hands on the business this man manages to the sole benefit of his clients. His whole life was a fight against injustice, against greed, against inhuman capitalists who consider other men as mere toys on their chessboard. He is led to the envy to commit suicide. But God sends an angel to save him. The method is simple : grant his wish, temporarily, not to have been born. And we have a trip in this society the way it would be if the greedy capitalist, Mr Potter, had not had our hero as a fighting counterpart. The vision of this would-be world is drastic and absolutely dramatic. The worse sides of every man have found the proper environment to prosper and build an unethical world especially by expelling all those who had a moral sense. He then has the possibility to go back to his real life and he discovers that he can escape bankrupcy and all it means for his clients thanks to his friends, nearly the whole population of Bedford Falls who give him the little money thay can find for him to go through this difficult situation and prevent Mr Potter from putting his claws on the city. Capitalism is a fighting tool for those who want to unite against greed and to join forces and will to promote a better world. This trick of seeing what the world would be if the greedy had the upper hand was used in many other films, for one the Back to the Future trilogy. This film is also a tremendous boost for those who doubt the outcome of their fight against immoral powerful people : fight and fight again and never forget that ? no man is a failure who has friends ?. It is true it is hard at times to see it, but yet any rockbottom despair is not worth dying since it would give an easy victory to the immoral band of people who take advantage of capitalism to impose their will and greed over the whole world.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Your life doesn't seem so wonderful?  Suffering from depression?  Then here's a pill to swallow: watch Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life".  It's guaranteed to do you some good.<p>The screenplay of It's a Wonderful Life originated with a Christmas card short story called "The Greatest Gift" by Philip Van Doren Stern.  It revolves around the life of George Bailey, an ordinary man who falls in love, gets married, has a family, and unselfishly works hard to support his family and local community.  Deep down George has the itch to escape the chains of the small town atmosphere of Bedford Falls and the family business.  He longs to travel the world in search of adventure, and has visions of constructing grand buildings.  His dreams however are anchored by reality: He feels morally bound to honor his commitments to his family and the family business "Bailey Building and Loan".  The first three quarters of the movie slowly builds up atmosphere, as we come to understand George Bailey's character and outlook on life.<p>It is only towards the very end that the moment of crisis comes: On the eve of Christmas, precisely as a bank inspector is on the scene, a huge sum of money is lost by the bank, and George's entire business is threatened.  At this point the lengthy build-up bears rich fruits: as viewers we are now in a position to understand the incredible and painful frustration George feels.  We share the hurt and disillusionment of this broken man as he snaps at his family and loved ones, and tears well up as his uncomprehending children pray desperately for their father.  It is the slow build up that enables us to share his and their emotions of grief, sorrow, pain and frustration.  <p>When George is at the end of his road, he selfishly considers suicide.  At this point heaven answers the prayers of his family by sending a guardian angel second class (AS2) named Clarence to help George renew his perspective on life.  When George in his depressed state is convinced that the world would have been better off without him, the angel offers him "a chance to see what the world would be like without you."  His magical heavenly touch transforms the world to the place it would have been without George Bailey's touch, so that George can discover that "each man's life touches so many other lives."<p>The religious aspect is not convincing: Bailey receives divine aid even though he professes himself not to be a religious man, whereas the Bible portrays heavenly help as a gift for believers.  The notion of a guardian angel as presented in the movie is especially weak, particularly because of the way it often functions for comic relief in a rather trite and disrespectful manner.  Spiritual matters hardly receive the serious treatment they deserve.  In the end, religion (represented by the guardian angel) functions more as a backdrop and literary device to examine a serious perspective on life.  It's a flimsy and unconvincing backdrop, but the matters that the guardian angel as a literary device serves to reflect on are serious indeed.  By being given the opportunity to imagine he had not existed, George Bailey is confronted with the value of life, even a hard and difficult life, and learns that every person can make a difference.  As George reflects on all his blessings, and the impact he has been able to have on people's lives, he comes to the conviction "I want to live again."  Clarence reinforces George's desire to live:  "You see, George, you really had a wonderful life.  Don't you think it's a mistake to throw it away?"  Life is valuable particularly when it is used in selflessness (represented by Bailey) and not in selfishness (represented by Potter).  When serving others instead of mammon, life is tremendously valuable, even though it may be hard.<p>Though religion is outwardly present in the form of the guardian angel, this affirmation of the value of human life has been stripped of any religious notions.  And yet this self-reflection is itself a very religious one.  It is too bad that the movie succumbs to the need to have a feel-good ending where George overcomes his troubles, because it results in a overly sentimental feel-good Christmas without the Christ-child.  In that sense the movie falls short by not being sufficiently religious.  The reality is that the lives of most viewers do not receive the magical solution that George receives, and that their troubles are ongoing - and only the gospel gives life a wonderful significance in the midst of ongoing troubles.  By providing an overly sweet ending, the theme of "do good to others" is unchained from the gospel, and an opportunity was lost to convey a message even more profound.<p>But even so, the message conveyed is still profound and enduring: Life is wonderful, particularly when it is lived in selflessness for others.  We might not all touch as many lives as George does, but we can all have a tremendous impact in the lives of others.  Unlike so many contemporary movies, It's a Wonderful Life does not promote materialism, greed or immorality, but shows the joys and rewards of a simple and self-less life with family and friends.  The concept is brilliant, and we are left to reflect for ourselves what the lives of our family and friends would be like without our touch.  Not only does this movie provide enduring and powerful themes affirming the value of marriage, family and self-less human life, but it does so with warm humor and touching romance.  Most importantly there is powerful emotion and lasting quality that has the capacity to renew your perspective on your own life.  What more could you ask for?  Few movies are worth watching more than once, but this is certainly one of them! You only live once, but watching this movie once or more might just improve that life you only have the opportunity to live once.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>Everyone has their films that they must watch during certain holidays.  For some reason, at my house we always watched "Uncle Buck" on Labour Day weekend.  Likewise, Roger Ebert apparently watches "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" every Thanksgiving.  My wife likes to watch "When Harry Met Sally" on New Year's Day.  But Christmas is the time most saturated with films that the season wouldn't be the same without.  "A Christmas Carol," "White Christmas," and some version of "The Grinch" are holiday necessities for many people.  My personal favourite of all these films is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life."<br /><br />Because the airwaves are saturated with it (because the copyright was not renewed when it expired in the '70's) it's easy to flip by and watch bits until a commercial comes on.  People who have only seen the film this way are missing the joy of the film - it is a finely-crafted vision of a town, the progress of years of the characters in that town, and the steady wearing down of one man's dreams until one Christmas Eve he decides to take his own life.  What he hasn't noticed is all the good he done, and he's momentarily forgotten how much he is loved - by his extended family, by the people in the town touched by his basic goodness.  He is not a Scrooge or Grinch remarkably transformed by the meaning of Christmas, but a good man worn down and worn out that is then rejuvenated by the Spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />Capra and Jimmy Stewart evoke such a sense of place and timing that you can't help by be immersed in the story.  The extended cast weaves in and out of the story, without intruding on the primary narrative.  It's suitable for all ages - in 1947, the MPAA didn't allow anything questionable through - but I suspect that younger viewers will grow bored since the film is mostly dialogue and "grown-up" events.<br /><br />This DVD edition looks very good.  The sound is okay, but as usual, the visuals were cleaned up much more than the sound.  There are a couple short (20 minutes) making-of featurettes, one of which is the same as on the VHS edition that came out many years ago (with Tom Bosley as host).  But the main reason to buy the DVD is so you don't have to sit through the ads and suffer the cuts television stations make to cut down the running time.  This film deserves much better than that!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Republic Pictures (Dist by Artisan)DVD edition of "It's a Wonderful Life".......<br /><br />You do NOT have to wait until Christmas to open this gift.

We watch as George touches the lives of so many from boyhood to adulthood. He saves his brother's life,he stops his boss(a druggist) from making a fatal mistake, he saves the family business, "The Building and Loan Assoc" from the hands of the Scroogelike Mr. Potter, is friend and mentor to so many, and although never gets to follow his dreams of travel, settles down with the girl next door in his town, "Bedford Falls".<br /><br />But things start going amiss for poor George,an accidental misplacemnet of a large sum of money, and the auditor showing up just at the wrong time, causes George to face loosing everything he THINKS is important. He's on the bridge, ready to pack it all in when his guardian angel Clarence shows up in the nick of time.Clarence shows George what life would REALLY be like if he was never born. It's not good! George must realize that "It's A Wonderful Life" before he can exsist again.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey. He is just tremendous in this role. We see the full range of his talents as he runs the course of going from carefree, to distraught, to bitter and finally elated with life as he discovers Zuzu's petals have reappeared in his pocket.The petals that dissapeared from his pocket when he dissapeared from exsistence. Henry Travers is Clarence and there has never been a more cherubic angel than he. Donna Reed as Mary(George's wife) is exceptional at making a wonderful life for George and looking great doing it. And Lionel Barrymore is the mean Mr. Potter who we love to hate. There are so many other famous faces to look for that do such a supberb job, here are a few...the great character actor Thomas Mitchell is the forgetful "Uncle Billy", Lillian Randolph is "Annie", the housekeeper, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey, Ellen Corby, the lady who only wants $17.50, Gloria Grahame is Violet and don't miss Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer, mischievous as ever at the pool scene.<br /><br />Hollywood is no slouch when it comes to making the old look young, and that is no exception for this film. At 57 it looks amazingly new on this DVD. It is remastered from the original film negative and the sound in Dolby Digital is clear as a bell( oh..

There's also "A Personal Remembrance" with Frank Capra Jr., that has some nice interviews with Jimmy and Frank, but contains much of the same info from the first featurette, but is nice to have.

After finishing high school, he is going to tour Europe then go to college and become a big name architect and construction job manager, building huge dams and great projects.  Everything seems to be headed that way, too, until his father, Peter Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds), has a stroke and ends up dying.  His father was the head of the local Savings and Loan and without his guidance, the vile Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the town miser, plans on a forced takeover of the Savings and Loan, much to George's Uncle Billy's (Thomas Mitchell) wishes (and to the detriment of the town's poor).  <p>The only way to save the Savings and Loan is for George, whom everyone respects and trusts, to step in as the new chairman and takeover.  Giving up his tour of Europe and college education, George does the 'right' thing, and takes over the Savings and Loan, which is really the only thing standing between the poor of the town having a chance to live decent lives and Mr. Potter taking over everything and grinding them into the mud.  <p>In giving up his college dreams, George has to watch while his younger brother, Harry (Todd Karns), uses his money to go to college, becomes a football star, then a war hero.  George also watches his new found love, Mary (Donna Reed), go off to school.  All of this turns George bitter, but he presses on, despite the problems.  Eventually one good thing does happen, Mary comes back, and despite his bitterness towards his lost opportunities, George marries Mary and they make a life together as the advocates of the town's poor. <p>George, who helps the poor despite it hurting the Savings and Loan and keeping him perpetually poor, eventually runs into trouble.  His forgetful uncle, Billy, loses an $8,000 deposit on Christmas Eve, just when the local auditor comes to check over their books.  Without that money, George and Billy are bound to go to jail.  As it turns out, Mr. Potter is the one who found it, but because he wants to crush them out of business, he doesn't give them the money.<p>For George, this is the last straw.  Knowing his life is ruined, he finally breaks down and is mean to people, starting with his Uncle, but moving to his wife, kids, their schoolteachers, and, well, pretty much everyone.  Until his guardian angel happens upon the scene, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers).  Clarence appears just in time to stop George from killing himself then helps him to see all of the good that he has done for the people of the town and how much they need him.  Once George realizes this, he can't wait to get back home, despite the impending jail sentence.<p>But when he returns home, even though the police and the auditor are waiting for him, he finds that his incredible wife has brought the townspeople together and they are going to bail him out.  Thus ends a touching tale about how kindness can make you much wealthier in terms of relationships than can money.<p>My Comments:<br />Believe it or not, I had never seen this movie, despite it supposedly being a classic Christmas film.  I was a bit hesitant, because I tend to enjoy psychological thrillers much more than sappy dramas, but I ended up appreciating this movie.  However, my appreciation went much further than what I would consider the superficial heroics of George Bailey, who saved his younger brother and was nice to people.  It was also deeper than the townspeople coming together in the end to save George and the Savings and Loan.  What I really liked about this movie was the communism.  Yep, that's right, this is pure communist propaganda and I loved every second of it.  But before I get into that, let me talk about the story and the acting.<p>The story is pretty straightforward.  It does cover quite a bit of time, but does so well and convincingly.  There aren't any major plot holes and the only kind of quirky thing is the intervention of the guardian angel.  For most people, the divine intervention is probably one of the best parts of the film.  As an agnostic, I recognized that many people probably enjoyed this notion, but it was really just a necessary tool to illustrate to George what life would have been like had he not been born.  And, yes, the portrayal of George's town without him was a bit extreme, and the idea of someone not being born wasn't particularly well-fleshed out (though this is a drama and not a science fiction thriller).  But overall, it's a sound story that hits all the right marks to jerk a tear.<p>The acting is also good.  There are some weaker links, like Thomas Mitchell and some of the other peripheral characters, but the main actors, Stewart and Reed, were really very good.  (Oh, and Donna Reed, am I the only one that thinks she's attractive?  I never thought I'd hear myself say that about Donna Reed...)  Anyway, I can't really complain about the acting.  It was really good for its time and pretty good for today.<p>Now, back to communism.  Yes, this movie is about communism, but not Soviet or Chinese communism.  This is essentially a boiled down version of Marxist communism, where the people own everything. It also is a brilliant depiction of the exploitation of the working classes by the bourgeoisie, in this case Mr. Potter.  George's attempts to help the poor and maintain the Savings and Loan are Capra's way of defeating capitalist exploitation.  Hooray for the little man!  Three cheers for labor unions!  If Frank Capra was just trying to tell a story and was not trying to criticize capitalism, then I'm a double-headed pig that can use a computer.<p>Overall, this is a very good film.  It is well-produced, convincing (except for the whole guardian angel/talking in space thing), and the acting is good.  But what's more, it has an anti-capitalist message.  I can't say it was perfect, but it was touching and inspirational.  If only we could take out the religion stuff, I'd say we have a rallying cry for social democracy (okay, leave in the religion for now, but eventually...).  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, yes, it's sappy, but it's also heart-warming (and Donna Reed's cute).  You should definitely check it (and her) out.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>It was designed to be shot in B&W. Sets were constructed, costumes were designed, and lighting was used to optimize how the movie would look on black and white film. Why would anyone think it was doing the film any favors to colorize it decades later?<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, and from the screen captures I've seen, the colorization on the most recent release (Two-Disc Collector's Set from 2007) is the best so far. But still, for me, the B&W of this classic film is still classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>We see the life of George Bailey. Working as a young clerk in a pharmacy, he tried to correct a mistake by the pharmacist, and is slapped around for this. [Could this happen to the son of a banker?] The pharmacist's son had died in the war (influenza!) and this distracted the pharmacist (drank too much?). Later George enters a dance contest, and some of them take an unintended bath [symbolizing the Crash and Depression]. George's college plans are halted by his father's illness [a symbol for hard times]. Another crisis follows the attempt by Banker Potter to appropriate the Building & Loan Society [which provides loans to working people so they could move from the cold water tenements owned by Potter]. But the Board decides to continue with George Bailey as Executive Secretary. George's younger brother goes to college, marries an heiress, and moves away. There is one scene where Uncle Billy has overdone his celebrating [nepotism is always a problem].<br /><br />Mary gets a call from Sam while George is there. They learn of a stock offer in plastics - "the deal of a lifetime". People in Bedford Falls are out of work since the factory closed down. Later George and Mary are married on a rainy day, but are interrupted by a run on their bank [no FDIC in those days]. George takes charge and saves the business from the schemes of Potter. George's speech explains the economics of banking to the audience: they will be all right if they just stick together. One sunny day shows a family (with a goat!) moving to a new housing tract [as occurred in the 1920s]. This was possible after local farming closed down. This affects the rent profits of Banker Potter, whose tenements are losing renters. [They hadn't yet figured out to fill them up with Welfare clients.]<br /><br />Potter makes a generous offer to buy George. He refuses, and shows he could learn some diplomacy and tact. Trouble occurs when Uncle Billy loses the cash he was supposed to deposit! [Pride goes before a fall.] Potter finds it and keeps it. [Did you expect him to be honest?] This was a management failure on George Bailey's part - sending out a boy on a man's job. George's request for help from Potter is soundly rejected. And so Angel Clarence intervenes. What would happen if George Bailey was never born? [This reminded me of "A Christmas Carol".] At the end the people come up with the cash to meet the bank's needs. And so the story has a happy ending. [Can you believe this?] Bedford Falls doesn't wind up as Pottersville.<br /><br />In real life Banker Potter would have to turn any found money over to the police. Potter has also broken Banking Laws by taking depositor's money without any accounting or receipt. If his servant talked, Potter would spend the rest of his life in jail. Some have noticed the absence of religious persons in this film; what does that say? No mention of other members of the ruling families in this town. I always thought this film had a subtle anti-alcohol message. [The names and settings suggest upstate New York.]</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>It was produced and directed by Frank Capra who collaborated with Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett, and Jo Swerling on the screenplay. Nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) it won none. Over the years, however, it developed a loyal following, largely comprised of those who appreciate Capra's films. Only in recent years has it received the recognition and praise it deserves. How to describe this film? It focuses on a thoroughly decent man named George Bailey (James Stewart) who, after being financially ruined by his evil rival Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), becomes despondent and attempts to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. George is rescued by his guardian angel, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), and permitted to learn what would have happened if he (George) had never been born. Only then does George fully appreciate how precious life is. Of course, the film has a happy ending. <p>Many people think this is a corny film but I do not. As in other films (notably in Meet John Doe), Capra celebrates certain basic values which guided and informed George throughout much of his life. When facing financial disaster which involves not only him and his family but countless others who entrusted to him their limited funds...and their own dreams for a wonderful life, George temporarily loses his faith in those values and his will to live without them. He regains his appreciation of life only after a near-death experience and a realization of how important his life had been to others. I am reminded of the situation in Thornton Wilder's Our Town when Emily Webb fully appreciates only in death what she had not previously while alive in a town very much like Bedford Falls..<p>It is noteworthy that Leo McCarey, a contemporary of Capra's, affirms many of the same values in films he directed such as Going My Way and The Bells of St. Mary's. When It's a Wonderful Life appeared in 1946, the World War II had only recently ended. Moreover, only 17 had years had passed since the stock market crash. Several contemporary accounts of American society during the mid-1940s note an excitement about opportunities which had been denied by the Great Depression and then delayed by the recent war. An entrepreneur, George Bailey's dream is to enable as many people as possible in Bedford Falls to own their own home. The film traces his efforts to make that dream a reality while he also marries Mary Hatch and they start a family. Yes, George is idealistic and somewhat naive but has business acumen. Regrettably, he is vulnerable to....<p>I am among those who cherish this movie and the values which it affirms. I am especially grateful for the documentaries, &quot;The Making of It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and the special tribute to Frank Capra, &quot;A Personal Remembrance&quot; from &quot;Frank Capra Jr.,&quot; which accompany it in its DVD format. Until recent years, seeing it again was among the highlights of my holiday season. What happened? By way of concluding this brief commentary, I presume to suggest that those who allowed this film to be overexposed on television every December should be strapped into their seats in a screening room, eyes held open with duct tape, and required to watch the following films (repeated over and over again) for 168 consecutive hours: Battlefield Earth, Barb Wire, Howard the Duck, It's Pat, Little Nicky, and Wild Wild West. I further suggest they be joined by those who have butchered directors' cuts such as Sergio Leone's of Once Upon a Time in America.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is arguably one of the best films ever made - certainly the best Christmas film. Frank Capra is one of the most talented directors Hollywood ever produced, and he considered this to be his favorite film. It has been called sentimental - I would call it heart-warming. It is full of what makes life - and a film - wonderful. As far as I know, Jimmy Stewart was the only actor Capra ever had in mind for the part of George Bailey. This is not true of the other characters, although it would be hard to imagine anyone else in any of the roles other than the talented cast he chose. The script is superb, the set is one of the largest ever built, the cinematography is excellent. It is, in essence, a wonderful film of a wonderful story of a wonderful life.<br /><br />You can't beat a story about a person whose life is falling apart, finds himself on the brink of disaster and, through some turn-of-events, changes and comes back. George Bailey is such a person. He has spent his life doing the right thing and helping people whose backs are up against a wall, only to find his own back there and no one to help. He once had big plans for his life - he wanted to build things - but circumstances and his own character have not allowed him to realize those dreams. He has ended up doing the one thing he told himself he would never do: end up living in Bedford Falls running his father's Savings-and-Loan.<br /><br />But he cares about people. And he's got some wonderful relationships, not the least of which is his wife Mary, played by Donna Reed (who was an unknown at the time). Mary gives George everything he needs in a spouse: love, respect, support, a home, a family and a wonderful companion. George is blessed, but his life has not been easy, especially because of the town "Scrooge," Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore. Potter owns everything - except the Savings-and-Loan. He'd like to own it, but George Bailey stands in his way. The Savings-and-Loan is the only way average people can own a home in Bedford Falls. If Potter gets his hands on it, he'll control the lives of everyone in the town and be able to keep what he calls "the riff raff" in his slums.<br /><br />Now, once again, circumstances take a turn for the worse: Uncle Billy (played by Thomas Mitchell), who works for the Savings-and-Loan, loses $8,000. In 1946, at the time of our story and the movie, this is enough money to put them out of business. Potter, who is aware of the loss, sees this as his opportunity to destroy the Saving-and-Loan and put George in jail. George desperately turns to God in prayer. Then, depressed, he gets drunk. Then, hopeless, he decides to take his own life by jumping off a bridge - but he's stopped by an angel.<br /><br />He's not just any angel: he's an angel second class named Clarence (played by Henry Travers), who is striving to earn his wings. Clarence is like someone out of the 19th century, when he had his last assignment on earth. When George tells him that it would have been better if he, George, had never been born, Clarence gets an idea. He decides that the best way to help George see the value of his own life is to show him what the world would have been like without George Bailey.<br /><br />It takes some convincing for George to realize that things have changed: he hasn't been born, so all the good he's done - including saving his brother's life, who later saves an entire ship of Navy men - never took place. Bedford Falls has become Pottersville, a decadent cesspool of hopeless despair. After George experiences incident after eye-opening incident of the difference his life has made, he returns to the bridge and cries out to God to let him live and to take him back to his life, which He does.<br /><br />Even though his circumstances haven't changed, George has. He realizes that, in spite of his circumstances, he is living a wonderful life that is making a huge difference in the lives of others. Before it's over, he realizes something else: because of the life he's living, he has a lot of wonderful people who care for him. As his brother puts it, "To George Bailey, the richest man in town." George is rich, but not in money. Potter may be rich in gold, but George is rich in something far more valuable - friends. It's a timely message that will always be needed. It's a story that only gets richer with the telling. And it's a film that seems to get better with age.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant 1946 film, "It's a Wonderful Life". Arguably, one of the best films of all time, "It's a Wonderful Life" tells the story of a fictional character named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart, 1908-1997) who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), dreamed of world travel and being an archetect, but the death of his father (Samuel S. Hinds, 1875-1948) forces him to remain in Bedford Falls in order to manage the Bailey Savings & Loan.  Though feeling trapped, he eventually marries Mary (Donna Reed, 1921-1986) and has four children.  Barely able to take care of his family, George is tempted by offer for a high-paying job by his chief rival,  the unscrupulous Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore, 1878-1954), but rejects it.  Finally, the pressure becomes too much for George when his absentminded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell, 1892-1962) loses money that was supposed to be deposited in Potter's bank and George is accused of embezzlement.  Feeling completely lost & helpless, George decides to plunge from a bridge into a dark & cold river; but suddenly, someone else falls in and George instinctively jumps in to save the other man's life.  The other man, however, is no man at all; but a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers, 1874-1965) sent to save George.  Not believing that Clarence is an angel, George wishes that he had never been born and Clarence grants him his wish.  When George returns to Bedford Falls, what he finds is the unseemly town of Pottersville: filled with nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  Further, no one knows George anymore.  Horrified, George desperately attempts to find Mary, his children and his mother; but what he finds only gets George into trouble with the people who had once known him including his two dearest friends: the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen, 1905-1985) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond, 1903-1960).  Will George get his life back, along with his wife, children & friends?  You'll just have to watch (if you haven't already) this classic film to find out.<br /><br />With a brilliant story, wonderful direction thanks to Frank Capra (1897-1991) and superb acting, "It's a Wonderful Life" remains one of the most loved & watched films of the last 60 years.  The filmed earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor and Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Other memorable characters include George's mother (Beulah Bondi, 1888-1981), Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner, 1875-1958), George's daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes), George's brother Harry (Todd Karns, 1921-2000) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame, 1923-1981).  Overall, "It's a Wonderful Life" gets a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Though originally filmed in black and white, the film was colorized several years ago. While some don't approve of the colorization of older films, it's nice to see this DVD package offering both the original black & white version, as well as the colorized version for people to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>This movie is a movie that I don't just watch around Christmas.

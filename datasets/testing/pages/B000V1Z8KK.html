Solid entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>More action than sniper. Decent set of actors well cast in their roles. Wahlerg? At least you always know what you are going to get with him. LOL. Plot? Totally predictable but enjoyable anyway. Audience? Male, 20+ years. Not a date movie or to be watched with a female. Oh, there is a token female but not much more than that: token. Watched more than once? Barely, as not non-stop action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>This movie is all about one man done wrong twice & both times by his own government. Mark Walhberg's character, Bob Lee Swagger, is the best sniper/marksman out there & trained by our government's military.<br /><br />When Bob Lee Swagger is left to fend for himself while in combat by our country's military, he decides to retreat from society disillusioned that his own country would leave him to possibly die in enemy territory while serving his country.<br /><br />Three years later, the government comes a knocking once again on Bob Lee Swagger front door, asking him to serve his country once again. This time they want him to figure out how and where a sniper might hide in order to kill the president during a set of public speaking engagements. In doing this task, Bob Lee Swagger becomes a prime suspect in the conspiracy to kill the President by the very same people whom have asked him to help them! Bob Lee Swagger must flee for his life after being shot, avoid being captured, and attempt to clear his name with the aid of two other people.<br /><br />It seems highly likely that Bob Lee Swagger could survive being shot, avoid being captured by the FBI, and attempt to clear his name with ONLY the aid of two other people.... One of whom is an amateur! This movie is all about revenge, vigilante style. It is sort of a modern day version of a Charles Bronson flick, but with Bob Lee Swagger having a little more compassion and depth of character then Bronson's characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed</a>) is a disgruntled vet. Ultimately left for dead on a sniper mission toward the end of his career, Bobby survives while his spotter-partner "takes one for America."<br /><br />Several years later we find Swagger living a life of self-imposed exile in the Colorado Rockies, his only friend a mutt who guards him and his home. He has no plans to re-enter society until...<br /><br />Enter Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S0DDG0">Dreamgirls</a>), a "patriot" who claims that the life of the President of the United States is in danger. Knowing Swagger's history and his righteous defense of everything American, Johnson approaches the sniper-extraordinaire with a proposition: help them find out how an attempt on the President will take place and thus they can defuse it.<br /><br />Come to find out, Johnson isn't working for the President at all and is in the pocket of a U.S. Senator named Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty). Their plan isn't to kill the Prez but to eliminate another threat that stands near him during a speech in St. Louis (naturally money is involved).<br /><br />Having utilized Swagger, the Colonel attempts to off him but fails, much to the chagrin of Senator Meachum.<br /><br />Swagger is now on the run, wounded and bleeding, his face plastered on every television screen claiming he attempted to kill the President. Knowing that he has to get away no matter what, Swagger runs afoul of Secret Service agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash</a>). Hobbling him in quick, military fashion, Agent Memphis is just "glad to be alive." Which brought up a unique question: Why didn't the sniper just kill him? This drives Agent Memphis to make some terrible discoveries about his boss, his job, and what America values most.<br /><br />Double-crossed for the last time, Swagger seeks out those who framed him and uses his sniper training to ultimate advantage. Anyone less than 1,000 yards away is surely in trouble now. He even eventually brings Agent Memphis into his fold and teaches him the fine art of Sniperdom.<br /><br />SHOOTER's details are more interesting than the whole, as are the DVD special features. How a shooter positions himself. The effects on his shot from weather and wind to the curvature of the Earth are brought into play, making the mechanics more fascinating than the story.<br /><br />There's also the fact that some HUGE holes develop later on. Swagger nearly gets killed, then suddenly BANG! we're somewhere else where he can eliminate a threat to himself. There's no rhyme or reason to this showing that director Fuqua needed a little help come editing time. And then (drum roll) the big problem: Swagger is in custody and then, without clear reason, he's set free. The ridiculousness of this event is mind-boggling, even while watching a fictitious film where one must suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This film might appeal to military types who like to watch long shots being made at moving targets, but other than that, it's probably a safe pass.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Format: Blu-ray<br />MPEG-2 BD-50<br />Running time: 2:05:41<br />Movie size: 30,405,734,400 bytes<br />Disc size: 39,058,040,880 bytes<br />Average Video Bit Rate: 28.36 Mbps<br />DD AC3 5.1 640Kbps<br /><br />Extras:<br />(*)Survival of the Fittest: Making of Shooter<br />(*)Independence Hall<br />(*)Deleted Scenes<br /><br />Version: U.S.A<br />Format: HD DVD<br />MPEG-4 AVC HD-30<br />Running time: 2:05:37<br />Movie size: 22,523,803,648 bytes<br />Disc size: 28,782,408,985 bytes<br />Average Video Bit Rate: 20.48 Mbps<br />DDPlus 5.1 1536Kbps</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>A patriotic Marine sniper named Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is set up by his own government as a fall guy for a foiled(?) assasination attempt on the president.  Pre-Bush 43, a plot like this would have been considered far-fetched.  Thanx to Dubya & his corrupt administration, a plot such as this would nowadays be considered par-for-the-course inside the beltway!<br /><br />The only person in the world who is able to help Swagger is the bride of his dead spotter (played by Rhona Mitra).  After enlisting her help, he shows the bad guys (led, surprisingly, by an outside-the-norm role for Danny Glover) that it's best not to mess around with a Marine sniper!<br /><br />I know it's based on a book, but for me the film had a lot of motifs / overtones of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W07EKW">The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)</a>.  Problem is, Mark Wahlberg is no where near as good an actor as Matt Damon.  He lacks Damon's powerful screen presence, and simply isn't up to the task of the character he is attempting to portray.<br /><br />The highlight of the cast would be Rhona Mitra as a simple country girl who lives in Kentucky.  She is absolutely positively perfect as the Bluegrass sweetheart!  She even speaks with a southern accent, which is something you don't hear in most Hollywood movies.  I was a bit surprised that she's the same woman who played the role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN697M">Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</a> as the roles are so different. This is a very dynamic actress!<br /><br />In summary, this is a film that was good, but could've been better with a superior actor in the lead role.  It does make you suspend your disbelief on some things from time-to-time, but that's all well & good in thrillers such as this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>Have to admit that Mark Walberg...who is an individual of questionable character... is superb in this incredibly crafted drama.

There is a lot of shooting going on, some rootin and tootin, and quite a bit of scootin.<br /><br />Mark Wahlburg is ok, I like the guy, he isn't De Niro, but he is a solid, honest actor who brings his look of quizical confusion to many of his roles, and he does here as well. The plot of both the film, and that of the actual baddies, is over complicated, with the mantra "keep is simple stupid" so beloved (and quite rightly too) of military planners entirely absent, but it makes for a high octane ride.<br /><br />Not "War and Peace", but still an enjoyable "beer and nuts" film for a weekend night.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg, an actor whose fierce gaze and sneaky humor can carry a movie over the rockiest terrain.

Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), to help avert the assassination of the U.S. president. However, when an assassination attempt is made, Swagger is double-crossed and ends up on the run for a crime he didn't commit.<br /><br />In many ways, "Shooter" reminds me a lot of "Hero". Not with respect to plot, but because both are films that I didn't particularly like, but, nevertheless, consider worth watching for the unusual and rather dubious messages at their cores. The message of "Shooter" seems to be that it's OK to shoot politicians whose political beliefs diverge from your own (either that or "the end justifies the means", one or the other). Considering the fact that this film is a Hollywood film, made in 2007, I was amazed that such a message was allowed, since it seems that, now days, film makers and production companies are more aware than ever of the dangers of including violence-encouraging messages in their films. For that reason, this film fascinated me, and I am glad I saw it.<br /><br />As a piece of cinema, however, "Shooter" is very lacking. It's not a terrible movie, I did enjoy the action sequences, but in between the action sequences, I found that my attention drifted. Most of the characters in the film are poorly written, in particular, the scenery-chewing villains, who are portrayed as having no redeeming features at all, and the film's heroine, played by Kate Mara, whose only purpose in the film seemed to be to follow instructions given by Swagger. It didn't help matters that Kate Mara is a terrible actress (I have never seen her in anything before this film, so perhaps it was just that she didn't have decent material to work with, but her performance in this film was so bad that, in the future, I will be avoiding her films), and that both Glover and Wahlberg mumble a significant proportion of their lines (this was particularly annoying in the case of Glover - I know he can speak properly, as he does in other films, and yet in this film, it sounded as though he had his jaw wired). The only actor who really stood out for me was Rhona Mitra, whom I was already a fan of, as an FBI agent, but her role is small and her character vanishes about 2/3 of the way through the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>A veteran double crossed by the government during his early military career is used once again in this fast paced action flick.

McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Sometimes I wonder why I wait so long before watching a certain movie, especially one that has received praise from essentially everyone I know that has ever seen it. Such is the case with the military-themed/conspiracy thriller "Shooter" starring Mark Wahlberg ("Four Brothers") and Danny Glover (`Lethal Weapon' series). I was told from so many sources that "Shooter" is a definite must-see of a movie, yet for some unknown reason I never did get around to watching it, until recently that is. Of course, I had plenty of opportunities to watch the movie, due to the fact that I had purchased it several months back even though I hadn't seen it yet (a concept which may seem strange to some of you). Who knows why it took me so long, maybe I need to get my head examined (one of my friends sure thought so when I told him I had yet to see this movie). Whatever the case may be, when all was said and done now that I've finally taken an opportunity to sit down and watch the movie, I enjoyed every single minute of it and wished I would have gotten around to seeing it much sooner.<br /><br />"Shooter" is the story of former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who after being betrayed by his superiors, has left the service and is leading a quiet, peaceful existence in a remote cabin somewhere in the mountains. However, as much as Bob Lee has tried to remove himself from the outside world, there are those that still possess the means to find him; led by a high ranking Colonel (Danny Glover), a mysterious group within the U.S. government believes that Bob Lee may be the one person on the planet to help them in preventing an impending assassination attempt on the current President of the United States. Feeling the pressure to once again serve his country, Bob Lee reluctantly agrees to lend his expertise; however, all is not as it seems. On the day of the attempt, Bob Lee is betrayed and wrongfully identified as the shooter by the very people he agreed to help. Now, he's on the run from virtually every government agency in the United States, and as if that weren't enough to contend with, the group that hired him is tracking him across the country to silence the one loose end that could expose their far-reaching conspiracy to the entire nation.<br /><br />I've got to say that I am becoming more and more impressed by Mark Wahlberg's acting ability with each movie he makes. Not only are his skills as an actor becoming more refined, but his movies just seem to get better and better as well. Mark's performance as Bob Lee Swagger was perfect, he was full of confidence without being arrogant, appeared to be an honorable man who seemed to go out of his way to save lives at all cost, and despite being betrayed by his superiors, he still maintained a strong sense of pride for his country and the military; which was a welcome change in character traits from most of the leading roles featured in today's movies dealing with any facet of the military and/or its soldiers. Michael Pena ("World Trade Center") was solid in his portrayal of an FBI agent that becomes Bob's reluctant partner, and one of the few members of any government agency that believes that he may just be innocent after all, despite all the evidence to the contrary. Kate Mara ("We Are Marshall") plays a widow of one of Bob's military buddies from his time in the service, and becomes an ally and eventual love interest for him, serving as a means for allowing Bob to open up once more to another human being and to begin to heal from the wounds that his life and career have left upon him. Kate wasn't given as much to do in this film dramatically as she had been in "We Are Marshall", but what time she did have on the screen she made the best of, and managed to show that her character was emotionally vulnerable, yet strong enough to stand up for herself if the moment arose; instead of just being the typical damsel in distress that would generally be the female role in a film such as this. Granted she eventually becomes `in distress' so to speak, but not until she's proven to the audience that she has the means with which to protect herself under normal circumstances. Rounding out the cast are veteran actors Danny Glover and Ned Beatty as members of a secret group within the U.S. government that sets Bob up for the assassination attempt. Danny Glover has played villains a few times throughout his rather lengthy career, and each time he brings a depth and realism to each character, never allowing them to be even remotely the same in their presentation. For his character in "Shooter", Danny added a slight lisp to his character's vocal performance, and played him as someone who had at one time possibly been an honorable soldier, but life and/or experiences have jaded him so much that he is essentially nothing more than a soldier for hire to the highest bidder. Portraying the man currently financing Glover's most recent mission is Ned Beatty, in a surprisingly sinister turn as a corrupt U.S. Senator who feels he has the nation's best interests at heart, no matter how misguided he may be, and is willing to do anything to see his goals accomplished.<br /><br />Critically acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day") delivers movie audiences yet another solid film following up his previous successes, the historical epic "King Arthur", the military thriller "Tears of the Sun", and the film that garnered Denzel Washington his first Best Actor Oscar nod "Training Day". Fuqua deftly captures the frantic action and fast-paced action sequences with the ease of an accomplished action director, utilizing quick edits that have become synonymous with today's action films; yet Fuqua thankfully avoids overusing the hand-held camera approach that has permeated most of the popular action movies of recent years (a technique that was made popular by director Paul Greengrass' massive box office success with "The Bourne Supremacy"). For a director whose early successes were found in music videos, Antoine Fuqua has definitely come a long way in the last ten years since he made his theatrical directorial debut with "The Replacement Killers", and has become yet another one of those directors whose films I greatly anticipate whenever I hear of an impending release, though I don't always rush out to see them as was the case here.<br /><br />The plot for "Shooter" was surprisingly more involved and complex than one would expect from most Hollywood action films. The screenplay, written by Jonathan Lemkin ("Lethal Weapon 4") and based on a novel by Stephen Hunter titled "Point of Impact", featured plenty of little twists and turns along the way to keep the suspense ratcheted up, and the audience wondering just what exactly was going to happen next. I really appreciated how the script spent time focusing on each of the main characters to flesh them out a bit more than your standard one-dimensional action film characters generally would be; it was this type of work in a screenplay that propelled "Shooter" far above the average action movie that most action buffs love to see. Truthfully, "Shooter" could almost be considered a "thinking man's action film" so to speak. Who knows, with the success of "Shooter" maybe Hollywood will take notice and begin making more action films with this kind of attention to detail, featuring smart, well-written dialogue, surprising twists (that make sense and don't appear convoluted and convenient), and plenty of suspense and thrills without resorting to excessive violence as their only means of conveyance. If we begin to see this kind of action movie taking place more and more, maybe the action genre could gain a little bit more respect from the critics; instead, of being looked upon as films for the mindless masses that can't stand to see any kind of drama being played out, only guns blazing, fists flying, and mayhem galore, maybe there's hope in the eyes of critics for the action junkies yet.<br /><br />Every single aspect of "Shooter" was perfectly mixed together, from the acting to the directing to the story; nothing was out of place or off-beat in the least; delivering audiences an incredibly solid action film that boasted plenty of pulse-pounding action, along with a hefty dose of drama, intrigue, and depth to make for a thoroughly entertaining movie experience.<br /><br />"Shooter" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The film opens with two US troops being abandoned by their commander. They are not in authorized space.  When asked why, the commander said something to the effect that the men were well trained and they would find their way home.<br /><br />We know one of them did, because we see him years later.  Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) has nearly gone off the grid.  It's just him and his dog living in a remote cabin.<br /><br />When he's approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to help foil a plot to kill the US President by determining how the shooter is going to do it, he reluctantly accepts the job.<br /><br />When the fated day arrives, it's actually the Archbishop of Ethiopia who is shot and the crime's blamed on Swagger.  Swagger goes on the run, trying to find out precisely what happened.<br /><br />"Shooter" is a smart paced and intelligent conspiracy thriller taken from the pen of Stephen Hunter. Excellent acting on the part of the whole crew.  This multi-faceted film is well worth owning.  You will want to see it again.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, December 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>was going so good. I should have stopped there! It is about the oil and there is nothing but conspiracy behind it! The acting is good with the exception of Danny Glover.(I don't know what is up with him lately!) There is plenty of action but the story line just drops off halfway through.  The ending isn't what I would have liked but I guess that is hollywood. The language and violence makes this a NON-family movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>In "Shooter", Mark Wahlberg plays a Marine sniper who gets left behind with his spotter for both of them to die on a secret mission in Ethiopia. His friend is killed but Wahlberg makes it out. Disillusioned, he leaves the service to live a hermetic lifestyle in the mountains. A few years later, Danny Glover comes calling asking him to serve his country one more time. They know an attempt will be made on the President's life but not where. They ask Wahlberg to scout the cities the president will be in making speeches, and determine which one would be the logical place the killer would do it. After he gives them the location, an attempt is made but Wahlberg is blamed. The rest of the film is him on the run and trying to unravel what happened. It leads him to a conspiracy involving a high ranking member of congress.<br /><br />A lot of unbelievable things happen in Shooter but they're done in a stylish way. The plot is an intriguing one even if you do see a few events coming from a mile away. The action is sharp and fast paced with a lot of good performances. Shooter is a step below the Bourne films as government conspiracy action movies go, but it's an enjoyable couple of hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Reminicent of The Parallax View, Wahlberg is framed by covert government operatives (led by Danny Glover) for a political assasination.  Wahlberg (looking more Matt Damon like) is a government agent whose special talent is as a shooter with a rifle that allows him to reach a target a mile away.  Wahlberg explains that there are many things that affect the shot from that distance such as wind, etc.  Glover approaches him saying that an assasination threat has been detected against the president and the government wants Wahlberg's expertise to tell them how the shooter will do it (they tell him that the shooter has Wahlberg's talent to be able to strike from a mile away).<br /><br />Wahlberg scouts out the locations the president is to visit and tells Glover where he thinks it will happen and when.  They go to the location on the day the president arrives to supposedly catch the shooter before he gets to the president.  As this happens very early in the movie, it is fairly easy to guess that Glover is just using Wahlberg to perform the assasination himself and then blame Wahlberg.<br /><br />Glover's plan to eliminate Wahlberg after the shooting fails and most of the movie after focuses on Glover and his corrupt government men trying to get Wahlberg before their operation is blown.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of great action and makes the viewer think that going forward, no political leader may be safe from assasination if he could be easily hit from a mile away by someone with Wahlberg's gun.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Okay, the mark isn't very high, but this film still delivers what one expects from an action/conspiracy film.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**  I don't think I give anything away that Amazon and others haven't already, or even the DVD box itself, but I'd rather play it safe in the event I do give away more than one might like.<br /><br />Amazon's review is accurate and to the point, so I won't belabor all the points of the plot here.  Here is what works in this flick: Mark Wahlberg is wholly believable in this role that bares some resemblance to Matt Damon's Jason Bourne, and Danny Glover of the "Lethal Weapon" franchise fame makes a great villain along with Ned Beatty as a crooked senator.  Michael Pena is cast perfectly as the FBI agent who sees more to the story than he's getting from his bosses.  In addition, the direction is fast-paced and professional by the man who brought us Denzel Washington's Oscar performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKED">Training Day</a>.  The action is exciting and fun as these kinds of films are expected to have.<br /><br />What doesn't work too well:  The plot, which takes considerable "suspension of disbelief", goes down smoothly enough, but has holes you can drive a truck through.  Wahlberg's girlfriend in the film is totally unbelievable, completely miscast, and poorly written.  We are expected to believe that a girl who never saw a day of violence in her life can just pick up a shotgun and shoot a man to death while never blinking an eye.  She even does so in her underwear.  I think it's safe to say she is nothing more than eye-candy.<br /><br />Okay, now why 4 stars and claiming it "hits it's mark" then, Steve?  Well, it isn't aiming very high.  It's a generally well-acted and executed action flick and should be judged as such.  It isn't out to save the world, make a statement, enlighten us in any manner, and nor is it looking for Oscar nominations.  It's simple popcorn fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Shooter" is so preposterous, such a hilarious, offensive gumbo of "Rambo," "MacGyver" and most Steven Seagal pictures, that it deserves a list.<br /><br />Cut it out, tack it on the fridge and save it for that lame flick night when you rent this movie and "Sahara:"<br /><br />* This is a Very Serious Movie about The State of America. It features Shadowy Ex-Military Types, Corrupt Senators and Nefarious Plots. Good thing there is a Lone Patriot.<br /><br />* How do we know "Shooter" is Very Serious? A title card doesn't read "3 years later." Oh no. It reads "36 months later."<br /><br />* Danny Glover is one of Shadowy Types. Is there something wrong with him? He walks so uneasily he practically waddles and talks with a lisp so noticeable you can see a wall of spit frothing under his lower lip. My prayers for him, but goodness.<br /><br />* Mark Wahlberg is the Lone Patriot, Bob Lee Swagger, who's hired by the Shadowy Types to plan an execution of the President, so they can stop an Inside Job in Philadelphia. Except the Shadowy Types are the Inside Job, and the Lone Patriot is their Fall Guy.<br /><br />* Good thing Micheal Pena plays FBI agent Nick Memphis as the Lone Patriot's Only Defender.<br /><br />* To recap: Bob Lee Swagger and Nick Memphis. Those are their names. Eventually Swagger will wear a feathered snowsuit and Memphis will go sleeveless.<br /><br />* Now each of them get a Supportive, Completely Platonic Girl Friend. Swagger gets his Dead Partner's Widow (Kate Mara). Memphis gets a sympathetic FBI agent (Rhona Mitra).<br /><br />* But only the Widow gets to carve a couple bullets out of Swagger after he knocks himself out with the gas from a can of whipped cream. And only the Widow wears a blonde wig and leather miniskirt as a disguise. And only the Widow has lines like "Don't you take that away from him!" and "You best call me Sarah."<br /><br />* Alas, the Widow also has to get kidnapped by a particularly Shadowy Type who likes to lick her face and whisper "There's your boy!"<br /><br />* Let's do a quick review of a homemade weaponry featured in "Shooter": An IV made out of a turkey baster. A silencer made out of a water bottle and a sponge. A machine out of "Saw" that forces a guy to shoot himself in the head. A rifle that shoots by remote. Pipe bombs. Napalm. Yes, homemade napalm. And a truck that travels from Virginia to Montana in a matter of 12 hours.<br /><br />* Ned Beatty is the Corrupt Senator. Beatty, mourning the fact that he played a great role just like this 30 years ago in "Network," belches absurd lines here like "There are haves, and have nots!"<br /><br />* There's an Apocalyptic Old Man in "Shooter," too. You know the guy. He was here before time yet was and will remain until the Rapture to expense bizarre wisdom in his house in the woods. In "Shooter," Old Man knows guns inside and out, and where all the world's best snipers are hidden.<br /><br />* Because the movie never explains it, you should know that Ethiopia and Eritrea are two different countries. Do you notice how action movies use geography like "ER" uses medical terminology?

I wont get into that part but it is there.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the almost constant action. It was intense from the get go without being overly violent. Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and that is evident here. The movie starts with soldiers on a top secret mission. Wahlberg is a sniper and his spotter gets killed in the first part of action. This causes Wahlberg to retire until he is called back into action by the US government.<br /><br />The movie doesn't get stale at any points and is constantly moving. You don't need to put much thought into anything that happens since it is explained well. The movie goes from location to location all over the United States and has a climatic almost predictable finish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun action movie where you can get into the intensity this is it. I would say this is a must have for any action afficianodo. Also it's almost a must have for anyone with a home theatre set up.

On a convert mission in Ethiopia he does his job but things go wrong and his spotter (Lane Garrison) is killed after they are hung out to dry by the shadowy figures running the operation.  Thirty-six months later back in the world Swagger has left the military and lives with his dog on a mountain in Wyoming, minding his own business.  Then Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) shows up with an offer for an unusual job.  Word is out that somebody is going to kill the President of the United States in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia and Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the scene and tell them exactly how he would do it so that they can stop the assassin.  Swagger does his job, but it turns out to be a set up and once the fatal bullet is fired he is the most wanted man in America.<br /><br />This week I am very much aware that what you think about a movie can depend on what else you have just seen.  I saw "Shooter" on DVD the day after seeing "Live Free or Die Hard" in the theater.  My favorite scene in the new summer blockbuster was the one early on when John McClane has to rescue a computer geek from a hit squad that is shooting apart the kid's apartment.  It was, relatively speaking, one of the most realistic sequences in the film and with that thought fresh in my mind I liked that most of "Shooter" was in a similar vein.  Of course, this is predicated on how realistic you consider kill shots from a mile out to be.  I read somewhere that there was a sniper shot in Iraq that took out the target at three-quarters of a mile, so 1800 yards does not sound like all that much of a stretch to me and not that much to ask in terms of the willing suspension of disbelief.  Besides, if an expert sniper can train an actor like Wahlberg in two days to get hits half the time from 1100 yards out, then I am willing to go along with the ride in this film.<br /><br />In a movie like this a lot of it depends on the other characters besides the hero.  Glover is okay as the man out to get Swagger, Beatty is channeling his role in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESU8">Network</a>" way back when, and Jack Payne (Elias Koteas) is one of those giggling goons that I doubt would be able to get this gig in the "real" world.  Rade Serbedzija as Michael Sandor has the requisite weight, but few opportunities to really swing it around because his character is subordinated to people who are clearly not his superiors.  Fortunately the good guys are also after Swagger, so he has plenty to contend with here.  I also liked the fact that the FBI were not portrayed as total idiots, and that once things were not adding up the way they thought they started redoing the math, just like Nick Memphis.  I even like the nudge nudge, wink wink near the end that suggested that the government might have its hands tied but that is not true of everybody. Once we get past the rather cartoonish villains, the characters helping out are hero turn out to be a lot more interesting.<br /><br />In this sort of movie there is always the woman the hero turns to in his hour of need.  For "Shooter" that would be Sarah (Kate Mara), the widow of Swagger's spotter, who is literally the one person on earth who would believe a word of what he says.  I liked that this was a woman willing to shoot first and ask questions later.  Sometimes the woman becomes the hero's sidekick, but in this film that role goes to Michael Pena as Nick Memphis, a rookie FBI agent who gets in Swagger's way early on and keeps asking questions when his bosses are telling him to shut up.  He finds somebody to talk to in Agent Alourdes Galindo (Rhona Mitra), but that only serves to make him another person on the bad guys' hit list and forces him to decide which side he wants to be on for the duration.  But the reason I finally decided to round up on this film was because of the the character of Mr. Rate (music legend Levon Helm), a guy who knows everything about government conspiracies and even more about guns.  Swagger pays the old guy a visit in a scene nicely written by Jonathan Lemkin (the screenplay is loosely based on the novel "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a>" by Stephen Hunter).<br /><br />So, yes, the whole idea of a conspiracy so big that one guy does not stand a chance going up against it is old hat, but I liked that Whalberg's character just does what he has to do without spouting one-liners and I thought his performance was a lot more compelling here than it was for his Oscar nominated role in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>."  I liked that the film emphasizes the importance of teamwork to a scout-sniper and works that into how things play out.  The hero is a sniper and his solutions almost always have to do with firing a gun, usually a rifle and usually from a long way off.  If this film is nothing more than the Bush-era version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004Z33G4">Rambo</a>," then I found the experience a whole more enjoyable this time around.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Shooter to date is by far the most underrated movie of 2007. Do you want a movie with action? How about suspense? Thrills? Shooter has it all.<br /><br />The acting is great and the direction is terrific. The plot is spotted with a few stretches of the imagination, but ultimately Shooter holds up well against some death-defying encounters and a sensational government conspiracy.<br /><br />Based on Stephen Hunter's 1993 novel Point of Impact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a> , Shooter is the story of Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, aka, good vibrating Marky Mark <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001Y5A">Music for the People</a> ). In Hunter's novel Swagger was a legendary sniper in the Vietnam War. In Shooter we get the 2007 version of Swagger fresh out of conflict in Africa.<br /><br />After the FBI receives a sniper's threat against the President of the United States, Swagger is asked by the FBI to come out of retirement to help prevent the imminent threat. But the tables quickly turn on Swagger when he ends up as the accused assassin. And Swagger goes to war ala Rambo against all that betrayed him.<br /><br />In unexpected role reversals, Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are not in the typical teddy bear roles that they are normally cast, but they do their thing well under the direction of Antoine Fuqua who had success in 2001 with Training Day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKED">Training Day</a> .<br /><br />Shooter gets a bit politically one-sided at times, but otherwise the entertainment factor outweighs the political bias.

As Swagger, Walhberg exhibits real screen credibility and weight. His performance is committed and human. Also making a good impression is Kate Mara as a steel butterfly-type woman: beautiful but as deadly at home at the stove as she is with a rifle.<br />Fuqua proves once again that he is a great director of action and this film is big, bold and noisy: explosions and gun battles abound. But Fuqua is also a great director of actors: Denzel's towering performance in "Training Day" and Walberg and Kate Mara in this film.<br />Though loud and obnoxious at times, there is definitely an intellect at work here and "Shooter" is never crass and manipulative though its origins can be traced back to the bizarre juxtaposition of both "JFK" (it is no coincidence that Wahlberg's character's name is very similar to Lee Harvey Oswald) and "Rambo." Now there's a combo.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"Shooter" is a very watchable action movie with fairly good acting and special effects to keep interest up through the few slower parts.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows John Lee Swagger (great name for this character), a retired Marine Sniper, that is asked to do one more seemingly beneficial job for the government. Obviously, things do not go as planned and he is soon the subject of a nation wide manhunt and Swagger needs to use his Marine Corp Sniper training to stay alive. There are quite a few plot holes and it is hard to believe that the experienced and powerful forces at work in the shadows could be so good at somethings and so very incompetent at other related activities, but that is where some suspension of disbelief is required.<br /><br />It would be easy to get drawn into harping on the few preachy parts and political cynicism that crept in from the time this movie was made (released in 1997), but I choose to just enjoy it as an action movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>Stephen Hunter's Swagger books, about the country folk father and the son, both unusual marksmen, are superb.

Based on the popular novel 'Point of Impact' by Stephen Hunter and adapted for the screen by Jonathan Lemkin, this is a story we don't want to know: the Intelligence and Security of the US are shown to influenced by financial gains, greed, and lawlessness - all undercover in the most frightening ways. Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day', 'Tears of the Sun', 'King Arthur') knows his way around this kind of material and it is to his credit that he keeps the tension almost unbearably high for nearly two hours.<br /><br />Retired military sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is living a lonely but secure life in the mountains until he is approached by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) to return to the art of killing: the President is threatened by an assassin and only Bob will be able to trace the paces that will prevent the event from happening.  Bob returns to Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia (the three places where the possible assassination could take place) and leads the FBI and CIA to the point of discovery, and at that time everything changes: to share the facts and events would be to spoil the innumerable surprises that alter the events of the story.  Bob discovers who his real friends are (Kate Mara and Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and the rest of the film is a chase and destroy mission that has the viewer gripping the chair.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg continues to prove that he is more than a hunky underwear model (though he is keeping his physique in perfect form!) and delivers one of his most completely realized characterizations of his career.  The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Ned Beatty, Elias Koteas, Rade Serbedzija as well as Glover, Mara and Pe&ntilde;a, and each manages to make some fairly unbelievable roles credible.  SHOOTER is not a great movie, but as an action/thriller/suspense film it ranks with the best of them. Grady Harp, June 07</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>For a thriller fan like me, "Shooter" looks like a modernized, post 9/11 version of "Three Days of Condor," made about 30 years ago. The difference is that "Shooter" is not about bookish Robert Redford; it is about Bob Lee Swagger played by Mark Wahlberg, retired ace sniper living quietly with his dog. One day Bob is visited by three men in black suit (including Danny Glover) who coax him into another mission, that is, to prevent a rumored plot of assassinating the president of the United States.<br /><br />Anyone who knows some basics of thriller would soon know what follows after that. Of course Bob shouldn't have left his mountain cabin. He is in for big trouble, of which nature should not be disclosed here ... well, but you may have already known that). To survive, Bob enlists help from Nick Memphis, disgraced FBI agent (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and Sarah Fenn, ex-love of his former partner (Kate Mara), with "enemies" at his heels.<br /><br />The film's script begins with an intriguing premise that would remind us of "JFK," but it gradually becomes clear that though slick and engaging, "Shooter" does not offer anything new much. Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day" "King Arthur") manages to keep the ball rolling, and he knows how to set up the right mood for each moment of the story with a blend of snappy actions including car chases and shootings, and the beautifully-shot photography.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg who keeps playing touch guy roles these days, and Michael Pe&ntilde;a are both very good though even their fine acting cannot make us forget the fact that the script has so many plot holes and implausible events. Kate Mara and Rhona Mitra appear, but their characters are there to further the story; once it is done, they are forgotten until the next occasion.<br /><br />"Shooter" is a roller coaster of actions with one stoic, invincible hero in center and a bunch of villains waiting to be his next target. It is not a classic, but still entertaining with the director's inspired visual sense and a string of decent actions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Another well thought out action/thriller film from 'Antoine Fuqua'(Training Day).

The only thing I thought the film could do without was perhaps the cliche scene of our lovely "love interest" holding a shotgun while wearing her finest Victoria Secret apparel.

That whole Marky Mark thing still haunts me.  I saw this movie at the theater because there was nothing else showing.  I did so reluctantly at a friend's request.  I was pleasantly surpised by how good it actually was.  This movie just rocks along.  There was never a slow part that made me lose interest.  This is one of those rare times where Hollywood didn't drop the ball and deliver something purile and geared for the socially-retarded moviegoer.  Non-stop action with a clever plot and good actors.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger, an ex-marine scout sniper that ended his military career after a botched mission in Africa left his partner and friend dead and him to fend for his life.  Holed up in the mountains for the past three years, Swagger is visited by a mush-mouthed colonel (Danny Glover) with a mission.  Seems like there is going to be an attempt on the President's life, and they want Swagger to figure out how they're going to do it.  Pure recon mission.  Right!  Well... Swagger gets set up after the attempt on the President goes down, killing an Ethiopian Bishop instead of the President.  On the run and wounded, Swagger has every law enforcement agency in the nation howling for his blood.<br /><br />This is great entertainment, pure and simple. Wahlberg is cool and calculating and detatched in the way that reminds me of the early Dirty Harry movies with Clint Eastwood.  He is brutal and it rocks! Michael Pena does great as the FBI agent roped into helping Swagger and Kate Mara is pretty and tough as Swagger's dead partner's widow who helps him when no one else will.

Trying to rekindle the "Academy" caliber magic, the filmmaker has attempted two epically scaled war films to little success. Even with an Oscar to your picture's credit, in Hollywood, three strikes can usually mean you're out. Luckily for Fuqua, the director had one last trick up his sleeve that will hit audiences from a mile away.<br /><br />While the trailer made the film appear as if it was a less entertaining version of In the Line of Fire, Fuqua's new film, Shooter, is a surprisingly fresh take on a hard-R action film. Starring Mark Whalberg, Shooter boldly exhibits a true anti-hero vigilante that is not afraid to dole out justice even if it means sacrificing customary role-model morals.<br /><br />Framed by a powerful, unnamed rogue corporation for an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, ex-marine and expert sniper Bob Lee Swagger not only has to outrun federal agents in order to prove his innocence, but the world's best "shooter" must extract revenge in places where the law is incapable of going.<br /><br />Fuqua, a director who has a history of working with strong male leads, certainly picked perhaps the hottest up and coming male property Hollywood has to offer these days to fill in this role of a modern day Rambo. Coming off his Academy Award nominated performance in The Departed, Mark Whalberg certainly carries the mantle of a John Wayne-like cowboy, dealing justice from the end of a smoking barrel, quite well.<br /><br />Though the marketing campaign makes the picture appear to be a political thriller, at its heart Shooter is a revenge film that works on a simple premise: for every injustice vengeance must be taken. Granted there are some points where the film gets bogged down with over-the-top government conspiracy mumbo jumbo, these holdovers from the novel upon which Shooter was based can easily be forgiven thanks to a simple remedy provided by Fuqua: he knows how to blow stuff up.<br /><br />Offering refreshing action based on exhilarating practical effects, Shooter fires up impressive blood sprays, napalm explosions, crashing helicopters and great hand to hand combat sure to satiate the appetite of action lovers. At some point during the narrative the film tries to justify Whalberg's raw justice by insinuating that the film's villains, headed by Warren Beatty and Danny Glover, were involved in the destruction and killing of an entire African village for monetary gain. However, Shooter so clearly draws a line between the good and the bad that this subplot is moot; we already want to see Bob Lee Swagger exact his revenge, and each kill along his quest is even more satisfying than the last.<br /><br />Predictably audiences will know where Shooter will ultimately go, but that is the nature of the genre. The simple storytelling and intensity of the picture's action should be enough for this substantially memorable spring blockbuster to captivate audiences. Though it may not be Oscar material, Fuqua has proved that not only does he have big budget hits left in him, but that Shooter is an unadulterated shot to the head.<br /><br />-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.net</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Surprisingly, for an elaborately staged revenge action piece, this 2007 movie is too politically ambitious for its own good. Director Antoine Fuqua knows how to stage an over-the-top battle and a desperate chase scene with plenty of eye-popping firepower and expert stunt work, but along with screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin, he also wants to make the story a topical commentary on the current political landscape. They are caught in cross purposes that don't mesh well at all, especially toward the end, because the movie is basically a man-on-the-run B-picture with an A-picture budget.<br /><br />Based on "Point of Impact", a suspense novel by Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter, the densely plotted story focuses on the aptly named Bobby Lee Swagger, a former military sniper who happens to be one of the most expert marksmen ever. Abandoned by the U.S. military during a deadly secret mission in Ethiopia, he has since become a mountain-man survivalist who is recruited three years later by a shadowy figure, Col. Isaac Johnson, to help prevent a predicted assassination attempt on the President. A sudden, Hiitcockian twist occurs a little over the half-hour mark, and the rest of the movie is a series of convolutions that spiral completely out of control by the overblown series of finales.<br /><br />All of this may have had a chance for resonance if the characters were developed beyond the level of action figures. Looking seriously self-possessed, Mark Wahlberg does his best to make Swagger a more dimensional character than the Rambo-constrained script demands, but the film doesn't give him much breathing room beyond his angst over his spotter's death and his burgeoning anger at the U.S. government. On the latter point, he suddenly articulates his perspective like a McLaughlin Group commentator, one of many laughable elements that seem to multiply once Swagger takes charge of his mission of vengeance. As the initially reluctant FBI agent who searches for the truth, Michael Pe&ntilde;a brings mush needed humanism to the story, but his character's arc is absurdly presented in broad strokes.<br /><br />With a convincing Kentucky accent, Kate Mara looks at first to be playing the spotter's widow as a feisty, vulnerable figure, but she is reduced almost systematically to a nearly mute damsel-in-distress as the story progresses. Similarly, Danny Glover plays Johnson with some interesting texture at the beginning but then quickly moves into Simon Legree territory. The worst casting occurs late in the movie with Ned Beatty as a pompous U.S. senator pivotal in the political conspiracy behind Swagger's set-up. A far cry from the Machiavellian corporate tycoon he played in "Network", Beatty plays to the rafters with zero subtlety. Still, it is hard not to be impressed with the film's technical aspects, particularly the sharp cinematography of Peter Menzies, Jr. and the propulsive editing by Conrad Buff and Eric Sears. Lemkin's polemic-heavy script, however, cannot begin to elevate the movie beyond its testosterone-driven genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I didn't think I would enjoy Shooter as much as I did. It is a flat out guy movie with brutal close quarter and various sniping action scenes, little importance in the dialogue, and two hot chicks in Rhona Mitra and Kate Mara. Mark Wahlberg fairs really well here as the Bourne/Rambo hybrid. He has come a long way since Planet of the Apes. Shooter might not be brain food, but I had a fun time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>Recipe for the "Shooter" cocktail:  Take one multiplex theatre screen.  Add two measures star power, stir in one measure conspiracy plot, add a dash of characterization, a soupcon of Hitchcock, garnish with attractive leading lady, and fill to the brim with explosions and shoot `em ups.<br /> "Shooter," directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a nonstop action thriller that despite its predictability -- a pleasant roller-coaster ride in what Hollywood does best:  a star-driven, action-packed tale of good guys and bad guys painted in solid whites and blacks and loads of eye-filling, ear-pounding pyrotechnics.<br /> "Shooter" works primarily because it does what it does well without making excuses or aspiring to great themes.  There's nothing wrong with a good action picture.  Hollywood rose from the lemon groves with silent-screen Westerns, gangster flicks, and historical epics.  Staged fist fights, one-on-one duels, bullet ballets, and full-scale wars have brought buckets of bucks into box office coffers.<br /> "Shooter" introduces us to Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who has retired from his job as Marine sniper after his spotter and best friend is killed during a mission gone wrong.  Swagger retreats to a wilderness mountaintop cabin where he's lived with his dog the last three years.<br /> One day, several government agents, headed by Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), come to Swagger, asking him for help.  They've uncovered a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.  The shot will be taken from a mile away.  They want Swagger to help them figure where and how the fatal shot will be fired.  Reluctantly, Swagger agrees.<br /> But things are not what they seem.  The shot is fired anyway.  Swagger has been set up.  His own murder is thwarted, and a badly wounded Swagger must elude a massive dragnet in an attempt to clear his name.  At this point, the film employs a device Alfred Hitchcock returned to again and again -- the innocent man thrown into a dangerous situation who must extricate himself or face death.<br /> Wahlberg carries the film effectively with a combination of attitude, physical prowess, and acting chops.  Though "Shooter" doesn't offer him the meaty role "The Departed" did, he anchors the action stuff so that we stay involved.<br /> Michael Pena ("World Trade Center") stars as FBI agent Nick Memphis, a man the Bureau is targeting for incompetence in allowing Swagger to escape.  Nick looks at the evidence from the shooting and sees that things do not add up.  Using the Bureau's own resources, he attempts to find out the truth.<br /> Pena is very good as Nick, playing the character with intelligence and humor.  The subplot of Nick doing the legwork -- often dangerous -- necessary to piece together a puzzle whose pieces don't fit, is juxtaposed with the Swagger-on-the-run main story line until the two converge, with Nick showing he's skilled in the field as well as with computers and forensics.<br /> Veterans Glover and Ned Beatty (as a corrupt U.S. Senator) add stature to the film, and Kate Mara is on hand to provide a sort of romantic interest, most improbable given the plot and the fact that Swagger is all over the media as assassin on the lam.<br /> In a scene which goes beyond straining credibility she -- a third grade school teacher -- removes a couple of bullets from Swagger by performing surgery in her bedroom.  It's not possible, you see, for Swagger to mosey into a hospital with every law enforcement department in America on his trail.<br /> But why nit pick?  This is a forgivable sin in a movie whose prime goal is to entertain us with a tale of a good guy taking on powerful forces in a solo, Dirty Harry-style attempt to right the shortcomings of bureaucracy and a molasses judicial system.<br /> "Shooter" is rated R for graphic language and violence.  It's not the best action picture ever made but, with Wahlberg delivering star luster, it is enjoyable divertissement.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg feature that is just awful. Made it about half-hour into it before turning it off. Just too stupid for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Though little more than a strung-together collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clich&eacute;s, "Shooter" provides a veritable feast for conspiracy-theory paranoiacs and a decent enough time at the movies for the rest of us.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, an embittered ex-marine gunnery sergeant who's been living a hermitlike existence ever since he and his sharpshooter buddy were left to perish on an Ethiopian hillside by the American forces that had sent them on the mission in the first place. After three years holed up in the wilderness of Wyoming with no one but his devoted pooch to keep him company, Swagger is coaxed out of retirement by the FBI to help foil a planned assassination of the President of the United States. When Swagger discovers at the last minute that he is actually being set up as the fall guy for the killing, he barely escapes with his life and spends the rest of the movie dodging the authorities while attempting to clear his name and bring the true culprits to justice.<br /><br />Wahlberg, all brooding stoicism and macho-man swagger (pardon the pun), continues his run of tough guy roles in this film, though one wishes he would return to the more nuanced, multi-layered portrayals he managed to put forth in movies like "Boogie Nights" and "Three Kings." Kate Mara is likable and attractive as the woman who befriends Swagger. But the most compelling performance is by Michael Pena as the low-level FBI agent who believes Swagger is innocent of the crime and who winds up joining forces with Swagger to uncover the conspiracy. The Average Joe demeanor that Pena brings to the character provides a proper counterbalance to Wahlberg's strutting self-confidence and superhuman athleticism. Danny Glover seems to be phoning in much of his performance here as the leader of the covert FBI cabal, and Ned Beatty does his best as a stereotypically smarmy senator who's up to his ears in venality and corruption.<br /><br />The plot often doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it is easy for a layperson to get lost in all the arcane machinations that come flying fast and loose off the screen. Still, the screenplay does a nice job fitting the pieces of its puzzle together, merging the two story lines that run along parallel tracks for the first half into a unified whole at about the midway point. The action scenes are strikingly well done, even though they often sacrifice verisimilitude and plausibility for mass explosions and preposterously lopsided gun battles.<br /><br />The movie makes a lot of grand speeches at the end about governmental corruption and what it truly means to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, but "Shooter" is designed to be a generic thriller not a big-think social drama. And, on those terms only, the movie succeeds more often than it fails.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Shooter" is one of those action films with such an improbable plot that it begs you to find it ridiculous and laugh at it. It is a ridiculous film, but a strangely engaging one.<br /><br />I have mentioned in the past that I am a fan of adrenaline filled action films, the type that made producer Joel Silver richer than God, and eagerly go to each, awaiting the next great "Lethal Weapon" or "Die Hard". Well, "Shooter" is neither of these, but it is an acceptable stepping stone as we wait for that next great action extravaganza.<br /><br />Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, a subtle name for his character I might add), is a sharpshooter in the military, one of five or six men in the world that can make a shot from over a mile away. Apparently, women don't factor into the equation. He and his partner, the spotter, are on a covert mission in Ethiopia when everything goes wrong. A number of years later, Swagger is living as much off the grid as possible in a small cabin out in the woods, with his faithful dog, Sam. One day, Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover) and his two assistants, arrive to enlist Swagger's help. They have learned there will be an attempt on the life of the President of the United States. Their intelligence reports indicate the shooter will pick one of three of the President's upcoming public speaking engagements. They want Swagger to help them identify where and how the assassin will strike. Swagger says `No'; he isn't happy with his treatment after the Ethiopian incident or the government in particular. But he realizes he may be able to help and scouts the locations on his own before he realizes Philadelphia is the place. Johnson asks him to be present, to help identify the shooter's location, and he agrees. But Swagger is framed for the assassination attempt and goes on the run. A rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, "Crash") gets involved and realizes there may be a conspiracy. Swagger runs and runs and finally arrives at the home of his ex-partner's fianc&eacute;e, Sarah (Kate Mara). Will Swagger be able to uncover the truth as he runs for his life?<br /><br />Directed by Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day"), "Shooter" is a film that goes to great lengths to make the story believable, but it is so filled with conspiracy and double crossing, that it just isn't representative of how our government is run, so we ultimately can't believe it. Must.... Stop... Typing these... Lies. Okay, I'm back. So, we all know the government is involved in some secret stuff that we probably don't want to know about, any government, led by Democrats or Republicans, and "Shooter" does a good job of portraying this. But Swagger is akin to Superman, he eludes multiple government agencies, police forces, secret agencies, bullets seem to bounce off of him, and more. And this stretches the credibility of the story thin, so thin you can read a newspaper through it.<br /><br />And the one thing that helps to ground the film and us, to keep us running from the theater laughing our heads off? Mark Wahlberg. The film sets up his skill level; we watch during his mission in Ethiopia, and many people testify to his great ability, so that is something we more or less accept as a given. He is, after all, one of only five or six men in the world who can make the shot. Apparently, women don't have the trigger finger skills. At one point, he comments the government spent a lot of money training him how to stay alive. This is a throwaway moment, but it helps to partially explain how he is able to elude all of these people and stay alive. Again, this wouldn't work so well without Wahlberg's personality filling the role.<br /><br />Wahlberg is not a great actor, but he has a winning personality and has the requisite charisma to hold our attention while he is on screen. As Swagger, he doesn't have to emote a lot, but we feel his pain and frustration as he works his way through the situation. Throughout the years, there have been a number of actors who have gained a reputation as simply being themselves onscreen, earning a lot of money, as this given persona in the process. John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood and others all more or less appear on screen as themselves, or at least the persona they create for the public. Occasionally, they are able to reach further inside themselves and create a unique, unusual, more interesting character, something a little different. Clint Eastwood has been more successful in this regard, but his characters are always variations on a theme. I am not saying Wahlberg has achieved the same status as these icons of American cinema, but he is certainly on the path. He is, more or less, the same character in each of his films; the working class guy, soft spoken, who triumphs over adversity. The recent exception would be his work in Martin Scorcese's "The Departed", an award worthy performance. But I suspect Wahlberg will have a long and fruitful career appearing in a number of films such as "Shooter". His mere presence, the soft spoken every man, helps to make Swagger seem real and allow us to have more sympathy for him.<br /><br />Danny Glover is pretty good as the strange Colonel Johnson, who has a hand in many nefarious activities around the world. Glover wears a dental prosthetic throughout the film, it is clearly visible a few times, and causes him to slur and lisp quite a bit. It is quite strange to listen to Glover, playing this menacing "Colonel", using this very strange method of speaking. Ultimately, this undermines the seriousness, the scariness of his character.<br /><br />Michael Pena is also good as rookie FBI agent Nick Memphis. He shows his embarrassment at being overtaken by Swagger, his face plastered on the news. Then, when he realizes something is going on, his instincts kick in and he tries to solve the mystery. He continues to investigate, despite interference from the department and all of the obstacles placed in his way. Throughout the film, he shows the common sense we might all hope to have in the situations he faces, making his actions more believable.<br /><br />Kate Mara adds less significance. She doesn't even know Swagger when he shows up at her door and soon is involved in his plot to uncover the truth. She seems to be around to add a female presence, no matter how slight.<br /><br />Ned Beatty makes an appearance as a very Dick Cheney-like Senator from Montana. He is good, but the performance is one note, which it should be. He is supposed to be crooked, evil and he is.<br /><br />Director Fuqua has a good knack for action and handles most of the action scenes well. He presents the complicated stunts and maneuvers in an easy to follow way, keeping us on the edge of our seats for most of the film. But, as is the case with most of these extravaganzas, he has to keep ramping up the action. Once Swagger has taken out one guy, he then has to face three guys. Once he has faced three guys, he has to face a small squad of men with semi-automatics. Then, a whole helicopter battalion complete with missiles. And so on. If he only had to fight one guy after another, we would get bored. But on the other hand, because everything is required to escalate so quickly, Swagger also starts to appear infallible, further propagating the need for more and more elaborate and dangerous looking action sequences. After a while, it gets silly, and we become numb. Will he ever not be successful in a confrontation? When he walks through a wall of exploding bombs, we realize nothing will ever cause Swagger harm. This, of course, robs the film of suspense in the last, crucial act of the story.<br /><br />"Shooter" is a fun action film, engaging because of Mark Wahlberg's personality, and certainly worth the price of a bargain matinee.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>"The Shooter" is a movie obviously intended for 15 y.o. schoolboys and Michael Moore/Oliver Stone aficionados.  It is truly the worst movie that I've seen in some time.  It relies entirely on old Hollywood standbys--fatal wounds that the hero recovers from; car chase scenes; heroes that never miss; bad guys who always miss; sinister government plots; sinister FBI characters etc.<br /><br />It's an Oliver Stone film on crack.  There are echoes of "JFK" i.e. the three guys on the grassy knoll are buried in Terlingua.  "Hey, I've still got the shovel!"  There are even echoes of the Ruby Ridge massacre.  Our 'hero' is living way out in the woods.  The FBI shoots his dog.  Man, man, man, really original stuff.<br /><br />The plot is far too complex, far too complex to follow, but, not to worry, the director explains it in the end.  The government killed 400 villagers in Ethiopia so that an oil pipeline could go through [get that, folks, evil oil].  Now we don't quite know why they were killed but apparently it's so other villagers will get the message and just get up and move away.  Logical.  Our hero and his shooter friend, shoot Ethiopian retaliation forces but of this I was never clear.  Maybe they were they were shooting the bad guys who did the village murders and our hero, in turn, murders them as a cover-up.  Not to worry.  Our hero doesn't know who he's shooting, either, and, the government, rather than extract or heroes, shoots them up with a helicopter and his friend is killed.  Of course, as we are watching all this we have no clue as to what's happening...we have to wade through hours and hours of this turkey dreck hoping that maybe somebody will make sense of it.  Truly, they never really do.<br /><br />Our hero, after his return, is intelligently employed to detect a long range sniper trying to kill the President.  It's at an outdoor Presidential review featuring the archbishop of Ethiopia [is there an archbishop of Ethiopia?].  Boom! Goes a shot which we learn later, deliberately misses the President and kills the Ethiopian.  Perfect good sense. Suddenly the cops are shooting our hero--again, we have no way of knowing why.  Despite the fact that the hero is shot through the axillary artery, which would have killed him in minutes, and through the gut, which would have disabled him in hours, and killed him in a day or two, our super-hero soldiers on to kill thousands and thousands of bad guys [make that agents and U.S. soldiers] with rifles, pistols, machine guns, garrots, karote and miscellaneous bombs.<br /><br />Wow!!!  What a guy!  And he does all this while mumbling his lines which adds to the mystery of the whole thing.<br /><br />Now, a word for the writers, directors and producers, if they ever read these things.  Why in H... can't you use just a tad of originality?  Why does it always have to be all this Hollywood BS and tripe?  Are you imbeciles or just younger than 22?  Do you still have problems with acne?  Who are you going to vote for in November?  Yeah, I know, it's just a joke.  The whole stinkin' thing is a joke.  Get your stuff together, boys and girls.

Based on Hunter's 1993 techno-thriller of a book POINT OF IMPACT, this film, however, makes Swagger over from a middle-aged Vietnam vet to a much younger Marine Corps Gunny Sergeant plying his sniping trade in these more contemporary times.<br /><br />PLOT SPOILERS begin and never really end:<br /><br />The picture opens with Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) and best friend/spotter Donnie out on a military op in Ethiopia. As usual with things of this sort, the operation becomes another instance of a mission gone horribly wrong as Swagger and Donnie end up being abandoned by their home base and Donnie mortally buys a bunch of bullets. Cut to three years later, where a disillusioned and now ponytailed Swagger has retired from the Marines and has become a recluse living in the Wyoming wilds. His preferred company is a dog talented enough to fetch him a cold one from the fridge.<br /><br />But the government comes a'callin' in the form of the very self-assured Colonel Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells Swagger that because of certain governmental leaks, the President's safety is now compromised. Johnson wants Swagger to scope out the President's upcoming multi-city tour and come up with the most likely scenario for an assassination. Swagger is initially disinclined, but the colonel knows the right buttons to push and plays on Bob Lee's patriotism until Swagger caves in. To cut to the chase here, Swagger does come up with an assassination scenario and - BAM! - is promptly shot and framed for the fatal shooting of the archbishop, who had stood next to the president. The rest of the film has to do with Swagger as he channels his inner Rambo to administer to his own wounds and then gets his trigger-happy vengeance on.<br /><br />TRAINING DAY director Antoined Fuqua delivers a polished and sometimes exciting action movie here. There are several thrilling sequences where you just can't help but root for Swagger as he shows up like an avenging angel and kicks copious villainous booty. The wild shootout in the backwoods of Virginia and the showdown in the snow are two very gripping sequences. And, yes, Swagger does remind me quite a bit of Jason Bourne, another anti-hero from literature. Not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Here's the not so positive stuff: SHOOTER does suffer from a decided lack of originality. We've seen this premise before with its weary plot elements, about a man who is framed and, now, it's become him against the world (again, you don't have to go any further than the BOURNE films). *Sigh* even after all these years, Hitchcock still does it best. This time, the "twist" is that the man implicated is a long range marksman (but who can wreak close range havok if need be, with or without weapons). There's some stuff about the nuances of sniping, of how the Corealis effect and the wind and calculating distance and such actually do play a crucial part. I do find the opening bits between Swagger and his spotter buddy quite involving as that sequence somewhat breaks down what goes on between a sniper and his spotter during a mission. But, overall, when it comes to the lowdown on sniperology, the movie SNIPER does it better.<br /><br />What sucks is that we have to wade thru another muddied conspiracy, this time centering on oil pipelines and the massacre of an African village, the intricacies of which I couldn't have cared less. The villains are boring. We have a smug, seemingly untouchable lead villain ("I win, you lose!"), an over-the-top psycho underling (Elias Koteas), and a (gasp!) crooked senator (Ned Beatty). And, of course, a mob of second-hand minions who are no match for Swagger's solo but righteous act and are mowed down with ridiculous ease. Kate Mara (ZOOM, WE ARE MARSHALL) is here because you have to have a hot chick even if she's playing the second fiddle, eye-candy role of the not-so-grieving widow. Kate is very beautiful and she tries, but her scenes with Wahlberg, the scenes that should count the most, are lukewarm. It doesn't help that nothing happens between them, on-screen anyway. There's one moment when I thought things would develop to the next level, but, then, phfft...nothing. I don't know how long Swagger was recovering in Sarah's home but she went from uncertainty to acceptance to staunchily aiding and abetting the dude in a seemingly inordinate amount of time. Ah, platonic love...<br /><br />The good news is that Michael Pena (CRASH) is very good as Nick Memphis, the young but lowly FBI agent who comes to suspect that not all is as it seems. In his further investigations, Memphis proves to be dogged and perceptive, to the point where he becomes noticed by the wrong people in the department. Believing that he's going to be fired because of a prior slip up (as shown in the film), he persists anyway. The good news for him is that this persistence also gets him noticed by Swagger, who eventually comes to see him as an ally. As Memphis, Pena is funny and frustrated, fearful and savvy, suspicious and smart. Not too surprisingly, his character is imbued with more personality than Swagger, who, at times, seems to be nothing more than a killing machine.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger does his best, and it's sure good enough. He doesn't get any showy emoting moments here, other than maybe during his ministrations to his wounds, wherein the viewer fully empathizes with the agony and desperation undergone by the character. But, let's face it, Bob Lee Swagger is supposed to be low key and taciturn, a simple man who's crafty in certain ways. But, irregardless, Wahlberg is convincing in the part, or as convincing as you're gonna get, given the outrageous storyline. When called for in his scenes, Marky Mark shows off a certain no-nonsense intensity and ruthlessness that befit the character. I like it, what he does in this role.<br /><br />One can't help but wonder how Tommy Lee Jones would've fared as Bob Lee Swagger. Tommy Lee Jones was originally slated to play Bob Lee Swagger, and, to be honest, as much as I like Mark Wahlberg, Jones would've been ideal. For those who haven't read the books, Swagger is actually written as a southern hick. Wahlberg sidesteps that issue (or, at least, I didn't notice a southern accent), but Tommy Lee Jones, who not only is closer in age to the book version of Swagger but, with his country drawl and sensibilities, would've definitely played up the hillbilly aspect. And, not to put down Wahlberg's acting chops - which is improving all the time - but Jones is the better actor of the two. Oh, well...As a substitute, Wahlberg is a very do-able choice.<br /><br />Three stars for this one, a film that has its moments but becomes ultimately bogged down in its own hackneyed trappings. If you liked this film but haven't yet read the book it was based on, then definitely check out the novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a> (which is better than the movie) and its two sequels <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/044022313X">Black Light</a> (1996) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440226457">Time to Hunt</a> (1998).

Soon, he is on the run, relying on help from Sarah (Mara), the girlfriend of his ex-Marine partner and FBI agent Nick Memphis (Pena), both of whom become targets as well.<br /><br />Despite all the action, "Shooter" has quite a bit of substance, with twists and turns that are unexpected.  The movie moves at a fast pace that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.  Wahlberg is solid as the ordinary guy Swagger.  Danny Glover is very good in his important supporting role as well.  If you are looking for a good action movie with some brains, "Shooter" is the movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>This one won't take long to go to DVD, but it's a muscular, enjoyabvle vehicle for up and coming star Michael Pena, with a strong supporting part from Mark Wahlberg.  Wonder why they put Wahlberg's name so big above the title, and his photo goes on the poster, when director Antoine Fuqua systematically throws the whole movie to Michael Pena, who plays a rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis, who cracks the whole case open and gets to be responsible for clearing Wahlberg's name.<br /><br />Maybe Wahlberg was busyt making another movie so his screen time wss limited for this one?  But every time you think, OK, now Bobby Lee is really in trouble, wonder how he's going to get out of this one, Fuqua switches the action to miles away, to wherever Nick Memphis just happens to be.  If I didn't know better I'd think that the movie was planned to be just the first in a whole line of "Nick Memphis" action thrillers, in which Michael Pena would become a superstar on the line of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hispanic.  The script had a lot of implausibilities, but surely the name "Nick Memphis" itself is the worst offender?  OK, maybe he was from Memphis, but that's like me calling myself Kevin San Francisco.  It just doesn't fly as a legal name, especially for a straightedge FBI guy.<br /><br />Saw this one on a plane and twenty minutes into I remembered I had read the book this was based on, Stephen Hunter's "Point of Impact."  That book was pretty good.  Here I kept thinking, if I was Marky Mark, there was no way I would have fallen for Isaac Johnson's line of malarkey about, we want you to think of a good way to assassinate the US president, come on, anybody would have said, Hell no.  Yet in the book you believed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I have to admit I found the violence, which was a bit excessive, to be an integral part of the story. In Shooter, the good guys win in the end by a landslide! Not only do the good guys win, but they have to win! The mass murder that took place in the name of corporate & government power in "Ethiopia" can not be allowed to happen all over again in Ecuador! In Shooter you are, unfortunately, left only with black & white, life & death choices.<br /><br />While this is supposedly a work of fiction, Hollywood, in my opinion, just substituted Ethiopia for Nigeria, or perhaps, Cameroon!<br /><br />It's a simple fact: There are so many mercenary forces around the world for hire, they are even currently employed, in a huge way, to fight in Iraq against the insurgents! So it's not so far fetched that they are being used in very poor countries to get rid of tribal/indigenous people who are trying to stop large development projects, like an oil pipeline. I know I would get a bit testy if some outside force, in cooperation with my central government, was going to force me off my land and/or harm the environment that my family is dependent on for wholesome food and clean water! (For further information on on this complex subject, see the documentary - "Pipe Dreams" by Terri Hathaway or read anything by the late Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.)<br /><br />But what does this have to do with the American justice system? I couldn't think of a more scathing indictment than when the U.S. Attorney General, himself, throws up his hands in the air and says there is nothing he can do! How can the most powerful U.S. law enforcement agency possibly stop American mercenaries in the employ of corporate and government interests working both inside and outside of the United States? In other words - when it comes to extreme human rights violations, the lofty U.S. Justice system is powerless, and only the story's hero has the courage, and ability, to stop these foul villains from committing further atrocities in the name of progress!<br /><br />What a commentary on American society!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1842778110">Looting Africa: The Economics of Exploitation</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1870716221">Genocide in Nigeria</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586420259">In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son's Journey to Understand His Father's Legacy</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Shooter" is great!

Three years later, he gets coaxed back into action by Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) who requests that he finds a way to plan the President's assassination in one of three cities.<br />In the end, Bob Lee is double-crossed and framed for the attempt. Soon he becomes a fugitive trying to prove his innocence.<br />Naive cop Nick Memphis (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) just "knows" Bob Lee's not responsible for the events.

Bob Lee obviously has no respect for the government, and it is even more apparent when he realizes he's been set up. Even better, Bob Lee was trained to kill, but also how remove weapons from people's hands in order to survive.<br /><br />An engaging, enjoyable movie with a lot of action.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I had mild expectations before watching "Shooter." I didn't read the book on which it's based and had no idea of the premise. Wahlberg was great in "The Departed" so I was at least looking forward to seeing another one of his performances which turned out to be also great. Mark Walberg plays the betrayed soldier Swagger aka Shooter who lives a Ruby Ridge like isolated existence against the stunningly beautiful backdrop of forested mountain country. Sometimes this makes wonder is that the only way Americans can seek beauty, virtue, spiritual healing? By fleeing to the wilderness? But the Government institutions that screwed him once come back to exploit his love of country and heritage a second time. They want a Lee Harvey Oswald patsy like that portrayed in Oliver Stone's "JFK" An Ethiopian politician is about to speak the embarrassing truth about the role of Big Oil and US Intelligence in killing off the villagers unfortunate enough to be protesting about their displacement for a pipe line installation. This isn't "Commando" - This is real life as we live it in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />I think the most sobering moment in the film is the depiction of Shooter (with some assistance from a disaffected FBI agent) killing off a platoon of his own country's soldiers. A patriot taking up arms against his own countrymen. Another disturbing aspect is the degradation in which his countrymen live. Kate Mara has been criticized for her performance as his dead spotter's widow. I fail to see its defects. She is no less a cipher than the arms expert whose knowledge Swagger seeks out in his quest to discover what is going on at the rotten core of his country's government.<br /><br />It seems that all the characters live in conditions of near squalor. Even the inhabitants of the big cities. Philadelphia has a grimy, unkempt look, crying out for a coat of new paint. It brings to mind that Talking Heads song, "I Wouldn't Live There If You Paid Me". And they all mumble so incoherently that the provision of subtitles would have been a boon to the viewer. All except the "front men" like Ned Beatty's senator - but then he is no more substantial a character than the sum of his lying words.<br /><br />I have heard criticism of the film's climax. Maybe Swagger is more clever than Lee Harvey Oswald, but it is that culmination that injects some element of hope into the nightmare that has been portrayed up on the screen for two absorbing and stimulating hours.<br /><br />I've seen "Half Nelson" months ago. In that film an intelligent, articulate, widely read teacher gives up the struggle and reduces his own existence to that of a drug filled haze. At least "Shooter" seeks a way to reform the system, even if it is the clich&eacute;d route of the old western heroes. When do we get an American hero who can take on the evil system without resort to bloodshed, and win. It does not have to Luke Skywalker. Let's have another Jim Garrison (from "JFK"), using words instead of bullets. And let him triumph this time. This film really got to me. It altered my mood for some time. It is more than just another action flick it's serious and efficient film. Must see for those who are interested.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>The first 20 minutes or so are truly riveting. Tense, taut, well-made and quickly paced, it's an action film ready to take off. Buuuut then it slows way down and gets preachy and never pays off.<br /><br />Marky Mark is getting a little better at playing the misunderstood patriot each time out. There are some great lines. Ned Beatty is funny as always (he just cracks me up for some reason, whatever role he plays). Too much violence, but that's what it takes to get big movie funding these days, it seems.<br /><br />I don't know how other reviewers can moan about this being liberal propaganda. I know few true liberals who would support this amount of gun porn, and the notion that a gun will solve almost all problems. Hollywood is awash in these movies now; god only knows how much money the gun and bomb makers give to making these movies, but it's got to be lots. They sure get it back in taxpayer money, times thousands. Great investment!<br /><br />The idea that our government is run by thugs making trillions by putting our soldiers in places we have no business being is hardly liberal. Read some statements by Republican politicians these days. Everyone's getting tired of seeing homeless folks everywhere here while we spend 10 billion a day on a war that most Americans despise.<br /><br />This movie hardly makes that point. It just says that the art of killing is a good one to know. And make sure you have lots of guns.<br /><br />Not exactly left-wing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>From director Antoine Fuqua who's created such hits as 'Training Day', 'King Arthur', and 'The Replacement Killers', comes 'Shooter', a high action "guy" flick.<br /><br />Extreme sharp shooter Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is recruited after retirement to aid in foiling the president's assassination.  What he doesn't know is that he's going to be framed for it.  Rookie agent Nick Memphis (Micheal Pena) seems to be the only one who smells fish in this fouled bowl of a coup.  Seems the president wasn't the real target, but an ambassador from Africa with some unknown figures of casualties stemming from the construction of an oil pipeline.<br /><br />Managing to elude the secret service and FBI, Swagger then visits his dead partner's wife Sarah Fenn (Kate Mara) for a little recoup and regroup.  Now he's out to prove his innocence.<br /><br />Look for an excellent performance from Danny Glover as Colonel Isaac Johnson, playing the part of the bad guy.  Also excellent are Rhona Mitra (Hollow Man, Nip/Tuck Season Three) as Alourdes Galindo and Ned Beatty as Senator Charles F. Meachum, another bad guy.<br /><br />There's car chases, blowups, shootouts, homemade IV's, a pretty girl, and all kinds of tense action and puzzling intrigue.  While sticking close to the formula for a "guy" flick, 'Shooter' manages to entertain all with its edgy atmosphere.  Although, I could have done with more 'Sam the dog' than the patented Mark Wahlbery "swagger" in slow motion.  There's a decent plotline, a lot of action, and enough good performances to keep this movie from falling into the flatlands of typical "guy" flicks.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>THE GOOD - What a great start! The first half of this film is very good. It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the "Bourne" movies ("The Bourne Identity" and "The Bourne Supremacy") you should like this and that was the case with me.  Mark Walhber's "Bob Lee Swagger" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. The first half included an interesting study on what it takes to be a good "sniper." It also had good photography.<br /><br />The second half of this made me wonder, "Who wrote this script? Oliver Stone? Michael Moore? The DNC? I couldn't believe all the politics - all the Liberal conspiracies and the anti-Bush Administration comments - in the last hour of this movie. First, this extreme paranoid view that everyone in the government is corrupt is vastly overworked by Hollywood and this movie is the topper where they aren't even subtle about these theories.  They turn a decent action thriller into one big Left Wing propaganda piece. What a shame. And how about those action scenes? Fifty trained guys and an armed helicopter against "Rambo" in here and guess who wins?<br />Stupid......really stupid.<br /><br />How a film can be so entertaining and somewhat intelligent and go down the dumper so fast and be so stupid in the second half is staggering.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>All these stars of recommendation -- are you kidding me! For a movie that starts with so much promise, this sure turns into Bollywood in about 30 minutes.<br /><br />Danny Glover sports a lisp. The plot sports a brain malfunction. Politicians are easily located and live in houses that are sorely under-guarded, their meager protection coming from patently inept soldiers who cannot shoot straight, ever. The music and direction are painfully juvenile, such as a heavy metal backdrop with drums and cymbals when our oh-so-cool protagonist, suitably named Bob Lee Swagger, drops a clever line and swaggers away in slow motion with his shades on.<br /><br />This protagonist and his whiz partner (suitably Hispanic, to cater to a global audience, because the African American crowd was already covered with the villain, and the Chinese/oriental with an FBI agent) go on to jointly defeat an army of about a hundred soldiers who're heavily armed with machine guns and everything else. The massacre takes place around a house, completely surrounded, but not to worry. Our hero has some real killer stuff that he and his pot-bellied aide have pulled together from groceries from the local supermarket, such as salt, sugar, and straw. There was also a plier, which should have greatly helped.<br /><br />Then there's the scene on the top of a rather high snow-capped mountain where snipers are conveniently located and camouflaged in white fur, waiting for a certain helicopter to arrive before they start shooting each other. How did they get there in the first place? Perhaps they were serious rock climbers and spent two days to get to the peak, or of course, they could have been escorted in a cable car. Failing that, if the only plausible alternative was to take a helicopter or some other aerial route, how was it that they did not spot each other earlier?<br /><br />Action trumps logic here.  The villains are cardboard evil, never really striking any meaningful chord of fear. Wahlberg, who was stunning in The Departed and still manages to contribute the screen presence in this farce, really ought to reconsider doing these B-grade movies before he becomes the new Van Damme. The exploding bombs and energetic car chases may appeal to a couple of freckled teenagers, but overall it's a predictable mess of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Fuqua has turned Hunter's thoughtful book into a nutcake leftist fantasy where the baddies are all greedy, piglike Republicans. It could still have been otherwise entertaining, but the result is neither terribly thrilling nor intelligent; unlike the book, the action doesn't showcase Swagger's smarts, and his sidekick dons a Che T-shirt - perhaps to honor the gay-killing murderer? Fans of Hunter's books (and Fuqua's previous movies) will be repulsed by this rabid drivel.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>I was all set to enjoy a good action film with a fine cast, and sure enough the film began that way.  But very quickly after the main pivot point in the plot, the film spirals off into leftist paranoia and clumsy editorializing. A feeble  attempt at relevance has the reverse effect of turning the film trite and cliched. The villains that might have been interesting, had they been presented with any depth, became cartoonish stereotypes, and the plot became increasingly ludicrous and muddled with the result that any admiration for the craft involved was completely subsumed by this simplistic and trivial sermonizing.<br /><br />Too bad, because I like Mark Wahlburg and Fuqua has shown he has good chops in the action genre and can present complex characters ala Training Day.  But if I needed another pretentious misrepresentation of facts, I need only access any number of mainstream media.  No doubt there is a vast audience that will either ignore the op-ed message in the film or will eat-it-up.  Sorry, I'm not interested in lame caricatures and simplistic conventional wisdom.  Maybe 1/2 more star  solely for the quality of the film-making despite the content.  It's not a horrible film, having some good moments before it descends into utter silliness.  No, sadly, it's a dumb film, that could have been much better, considering the talent involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>This is a great film.  Mark Wahlberg is always reliable for turning in a quality performance so sometimes he can be taken for granted.  Remember how he shocked everyone with his excellent performance in Boogie Nights?  Well here he possesses an amazingly strong constant presence that never lets up.  He is an action adventure superstar.<br /><br />The simple basis of the plot is that he is a shooter for the war/government in retirement and is called upon to undertake a special mission.  That is all I will say for nothing else about this movie is simple.<br /><br />The movie is a high octave full force action thriller and the action sequences are amazing lighting up the screen.  There is graphic violence but it is very well executed and fits the format of the film.  It is not gratuitous.  The film is also a thriller with a strong political edge.  How all this mixes together so expertly is due to the true craftsmen who have put this film together.  And Wahlberg allows the strong esemble cast to shine and does not try to steal the show even though it is totally his.<br /><br />This movie literally blew me away.  I really did love it.  It is over 2 hours in length and the time flew by with action and shocks and plot twist too many to mention.  Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The thriller genre has really achieved a prominent space where Tightrope (1994), and Absolute power (1997), found into the unsaid scandals behind stages a propitious opportunity to show the audiences new visions around erroneous tactics of Defense around an enigma that concerns us, from extreme to extreme around the world: the insatiable thirst of oil.<br /><br />And so, a well trained shooter will be the chosen prey, for a very zealously elaborated macabre murder, to create an opinion's matrix around his culpability. But this smart strategy ignored what the human factor can do, once the critical point has been reached.<br /><br />The well rounded script, the superb cast that includes the best performance of Mark Wahlberg in his lifetime and a fabulous direction effort make of this thriller the best of the year, after "Michael Clayton".<br /><br />Kudos !</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Mark Wahlberg was great. The plot was far-fetched. Danny Glover is absolutely obnoxious with those braces on, and mis-cast as the bad-guy heavy (unbeknownst to Wahlberg).

Still a very good action movie with lots of shooting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film begins with camouflaged snipers overlooking a valley. A convoy drives down a road and is targeted. Then the hunters become the hunted. Were they betrayed? Government agents meet the survivor and ask him to plan an assassination so they can stop it. The sniper explains the difficulty in shooting a target from a mile away. A plea is made. This lone gunman will take the assignment. Cameras allow "Big Brother" to watch people in the streets of Washington. Next he visits Philadelphia, the most likely venue. After his report they want him to be a spotter. The President arrives to make a speech. There is a surprise. [Was it telegraphed?] Now Swagger must escape from the good guys as well as the bad guys. He makes a daring escape to the river.<br /><br />The new FBI agent tells what happened and is cautioned about speaking. The corporate media convict Swagger in their news reports. [Who writes them?] Swagger treats himself for blood loss with a saline solution. Sugar was used to treat wounds for centuries. Swagger looks up the girl friend of his dead buddy and asks for help. "Bad things happen to good people." The new FBI agent Nick Memphis investigates the discrepancies and finds answers. "It wasn't my fault." Swagger tries to contact that Nick Memphis. More drama follows. Nick is abducted and tortured. But help arrives in time to rescue him. An expert explains how a duplicate bullet could be created. And tells of an expert shooter who could have done the job.<br /><br />Who is "Sczerbiak Mikhaylo"? "No loose ends this time." There is a meeting where a confession is given to Swagger. Is this a trap? There is a shoot-out and explosions for an exciting finish. Will there be a deal? There is more drama in the snowy mountains. Senator Meacham explains the facts of life. The FBI helicopters arrive. There is a final meeting in Washington with a trick about that rifle. And so it ends. Will Swagger get his revenge on the bad guys for a happy ending? Does the flaming ending satisfy the audience?<br /><br />The first part of the story echoes the JFK assassination then turns into a chase story that echoes "Rambo". The last part is a typical action film with shootings and explosions for the story of an agent betrayed by his government but who survives at the end. Films are made to be commercially successful by a design that Hollywood perceives will sell to the public. While many of the events in this film echo historical events, stringing them all together seems unlikely for this morality play.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>In "Microtrends," a new book by pollster Mark Penn, 1 percent of Californians between the ages of 16 and 22 expected to be military snipers in 10 years. Why? "Aspiring snipers are evidence of a patriotic generation, who see sniping--a profession requiring reserve and cool in a war without front lines--as the new "Top Gun" military profession." Mix this particular factoid with the "other gunman" conspiracy theory and you have Shooter.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, a military sniper abandoned during a field op.  His best friend dies in the ensuing fracas, but Swagger survives to become one of those militia-type recluses who lives alone with his dog in the mountains, spouting conspiracy theory.  He's just the kind of antihero America needs, and it's not long before Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) asks for his help in serving the country once more.  It seems an assassination attempt is planned against the President, and only Swagger can plot out the sniper's moves before he actually makes them.  Playing on Swagger's patriotic sympathies, Johnson lures him out into the open and...<br /><br />Spoiler alert!  But seriously, you saw this coming, right?<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, in retracing the steps of a would-be assassin, Swagger is framed AS the assassin! An all-out manhunt ensues, with Swagger enlisting allies like the girlfriend of his dead buddy (tasty Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn) and an agent in the wrong place at the wrong time (Michael Pena as Nick Memphis).  Seems the good Colonel is actually a subversive government agent working for a Dick Cheney-esque senator, Charles F. Meachum (Ned Beatty).<br /><br />Thus ensues a cat-and-also-cat game between Swagger and everyone else as they struggle to track down a ghost who strikes like a thunderbolt out of the blue.  The twists and turns, the blatant pandering to conspiracy theory, and the demonizing of a Republican-run government are all very entertaining or insulting, depending on your views.  And Shooter delivers in spades, with plenty of head shots that make this movie the modern descendant of Rambo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shooter is also highly predictable.  Swagger's inevitable betrayal is obvious from the start.  And the fact that the government agents might not be good guys is clearly telegraphed by Elias Koteas, who dresses like a bad guy in his black suit and tie, and even adjusts it once, goodfella style. I mean, the guy's  name is Jack Payne for crying out loud!  Why not just call him Major Blood and be done with it?<br /><br />Still, Shooter is very entertaining.  There's enough skin, violence, humor and conspiracy theory to keep an audience entertained. The ending may be complete wish fulfillment, but it's extremely satisfying. Those Californians will have plenty of reasons to want to be snipers by the end of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>I hope you are not looking for a movie that is a totally new storyline.  This movie doesn't really dwelve deep into a story.  It is actually quite political and for those paying attention their are some jabs at the current administration.  I wont get into that part but it is there.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the almost constant action.  It was intense from the get go without being overly violent.  Mark Wahlberg is an excellent actor and that is evident here.  The movie starts with soldiers on a top secret mission.  Wahlberg is a sniper and his spotter gets killed in the first part of action.  This causes Wahlberg to retire until he is called back into action by the US government.<br /><br />The movie doesn't get stale at any points and is constantly moving.  You don't need to put much thought into anything that happens since it is explained well.  The movie goes from location to location all over the United States and has a climatic almost predictable finish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun action movie where you can get into the intensity this is it.  I would say this is a must have for any action afficianodo.  Also it's almost a must have for anyone with a home theatre set up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie is non stop thriller, starting out with action, and ending with action.

From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.<br /><br />Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.<br /><br />Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-`80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.<br /><br />As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right "action-hero" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the "tender moments" last about three minutes in total.<br /><br />With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Plot: A cyborg from the 2029 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has arrived in the present (which, for the sake of the film, is 1984). In this near future, machines are rising to near domination over humans. The reason he has been sent back in time? To terminate. You see, in this seemingly hopeless future, there will be a man who is capable of leading an army that conquers the machines. The cyborg must terminate the mother of that child -- Sarah Connor. Also sent back in time is the "good guy" of the story -- Reese. Reese has been sent ot protect Sarah from the cyborg, to be sure the child is eventually born. But, even with Sarah's natural determination to live and Reese's passion for his duty, the incredibly advanced humanoid machine will be one tough cookie to beat! Can they terminate the terminator? Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?<br /><br />A wonderful storyline, a heart-pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic. Is it Schwarzenegger on screen with his mechanical brutality that attracts so many? Or maybe the terrifying ride along with Reese and Sarah trying to escape this madness? Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie. Still, time and time again, nothing compares to the darkly action-packed experience of The Terminator forever frozen in time with your DVD copy. You don't really need a reason to love The Terminator, you only need the film itself!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>There are several reasons why the first Terminator was and still is better than its sequels.<br /><br />  First of all, even if one sees it now, 20 years after its original release it still holds its ground with particular tech-noir ease. It doesn't look dated and it actually gains charm as time goes by rather than lose any.<br /><br />  Then it's also the "feel" this film has. It still retains this unmistakable "indie film" quality allthough for its time back then it was definetely high budget. All the dark, industrial superbly edited scenes contribute to that feeling, and J.Cameron did a memorable job creating a film that was expensive but kept you watching not because of ultra-flashy effects, but because of an intriguing storyline, great directing, good to very good performances, and cool visuals.<br /><br />  Speaking of the storyline, in T1 it happens to be more consistent and solid than in the following Terminator installments. It's a solid script deserving of a classic sci-fi film, one that puts the T1 in a pantheon of great futuristic films.<br /><br />  Its superiority lies also in the fact that T1 is dark and ominously threatening in its entirety. The coldness and the relentlessness of the cyborg is its trademark sign and that's what sets its unique atmosphere. If it has lost something is that fact that the back-then not so famous protagonist has since become a megastar and a governor on top of it. This takes somewhat away from the charm of not being familiar with the actors but it's ultimately not enough to harm the film.<br /><br />  Cameron kept the effects at a minimum and yet managed to give his film a dominant aura of technological-doom. He used more industrial visuals of the present than of the future to achieve this and he was succesful by a good margin. It was after all one of his very best films.<br /><br />  The Terminator's machoism is well disguised underneath its fake skin and Arnold was a perfect cast for this role. He wasn't consumed enough back then to be taken in as funny even if he delivered lines like "I'll be back" or pronounces names with a German accent (Sarah Cannah anyone?).<br /><br />  One of the top 20 sci-fi films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>The Terminator has made it's mark in the realm of science fiction, and it shows. It's not enough that Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfectly cast in the title role, but his unrelenting coldness is even more explained to us through the stories and flashbacks of Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese (&quot;You still don't get it, do you? He'll find her. That's what he does! That's all he does!!&quot;) Biehn's performance grabs me every time I see it, just as Arnold's agressive coldblooded behavior also draws my attention. And in the middle is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who sees her normal life slip away in a matter of hours, (&quot;Come on, do I look like the Mother of the future? I mean am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook&quot;)yet is still able to draw strength from her pain and loss and fight to stay alive. It doesn't get much better than this, folks.<p>I wish people would stop being so hard on the special effects of this film. You can't compare it to T2. The Terminator had a shoestring budget of $6 million, while T2's budget was something like $80 million. Of course the special effects are better in the sequel...especialy when you've got an extra $74 million to spend this time around. Instead, people should be commending the hard work Stan Winston and company gave on The Terminator effects. Sure, that's not Arnold's face when he takes his eye out, but hey,...not bad. In fact it doesn't even look half bad when he puts his glasses back on just before the real Arnold is put back on camera wearing his glasses. The arm surgery is very impressive. I remember as a kid I couldn't watch that scene because you can see a vein wrapped around the metel skeleton while he's working on fixing his fingers. Looks pretty realistic to me. Take these things into consideration the next time you want to take pot shots at the visual effects of the film.<p>With the new 5.1 Surround Sound Mix newly created on this DVD, there's a lot to talk about. First off, the remixed sounds of most of the guns and explosions have been changed. The 44 Longslide with laser sighting sounds completely different when Arnold fires it. Same goes for the Oozie 9MM, Reese's shotgun, the whole ball of wax. At first you might be destracted by the changes since we're so use to the mono version. And since this DVD also includes the mono version, you can go back and forth and listen to the differences. The explosions, such as the giant armored machines of the future being destroyed, sound terrific. They really put a lot of work into making these explosions even more memorable. It almost reminds me of how George Lucas redid the explosion of the first Death Star for the special edition of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, except we don't get any additional visual effects to go along with it, just better sound. <p>Yes, it's true that you don't get as many extra features like you do on T2, (here in the USA, both T1 &amp; T2 are on one disc with one side used for the film and the other side used for the extras) but still, it's nice to have them. I think most would say that the deleted scenes are the best asset. The only shot of Arnold that was deleted was after he killed the other Sarah Connor, you see him go back to his car very slowly..not in a hurry..and drive away. Very very creepy. The other scenes range from Lt. Traxler (Paul Winfield) beginning to believe Kyle's story is true, to scenes with Kyle &amp; Sarah fighting over doing something to the Cyberdyne Company as we witness Kyle breaking down because it's so hard for him to look at the green grass and the trees, because in his world it's all gone. Director James Cameron explains that it is a good scene but decided that he didn't want Reese breaking down more than once and he already does that right before the love scene, which could not be cut. And of course, there is the deleted scene of discovering that the factory that the Terminator was destroyed in was actually Cyperdyne Systems. We see one man find the CPU chip and put it in his pocket, but it was better to cut all this out and use it to better advantage for the sequel. Throw in a few trailers &amp; TV spots(the teaser trailer reveals that the original title was just &quot;Terminator&quot;, not &quot;The Terminator&quot;), some short retrospective documentaries (although the original &quot;making of&quot; that's been out on video is not present), storyboards, script ect...and you've got a pretty well rounded special edition.  But wait!  There's more! <p>There are also some hidden features on the disc, located on Side 1. Just go to the Special Features section and then choose DVD-ROM Features. Once there, take your remote control and type in the following numbers (very slowly): 5, 1, 2, 8, 4, &amp; 1. (These numbers stand for the date of the Terminator and Kyle Reese's arrival (May 12, 1984) You'll be taken to a special hidden 2 page section, with about 29 different topic interviews done by James Cameron, Michael Biehn and others.  The interviews are done with slide pictures and not real video.  The topics range from how two kids actually played the part of the little boy who takes Sarah's picture for $4, Hemdales lack of faith in the picture, technical aspects, deleted scenes, to comaparisons to T2 ect.  Very interesting stuff.  Plus, on page 2 there is some reading material on a topic called &quot;Chrono-Surfing: A Brief History of Time Travel&quot;, written by Randall Frakes (co-author of The Terminator novelization).  So those of you scoffing about the lack of extras should check this material out.  It's a very nice &quot;Easter Egg&quot; find.  Plus, get the DVD soon and receive a fancy lithograph cover case of Arnold.<p>The Terminator...A Sci-Fi Classic!<p>&quot;I'll be back&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>With rumours circulating about a fourth Terminator movie, featuring Arnie in a cameo-only role due to his high priority commitments as California govenor, this will probably ruin the whole trilogy for fans of the films. Arnie is the THE Terminator, if he doesn't come back in a decent role for the fourth, if it goes through (lets all hope it doesn't), I'll be mighty disappointed. Crackers without cheese is what Terminator would be without Arnie (oooh, cheese!)<br /><br />Michael Biehn (yum), and Linda Hamilton also feature alongside Arnie, trying to get rid of him. I actually prefer Linda Hamilton in the second one, the eighties hairstyle she has in this, is very bad. Very, very bad. Although she's a lot more masculine looking in the second, she looks loads better. I also prefer Arnie in the later movies than this one. He's so plastic/fake looking at one point, particularly the scene where he removes his eye, and dons the infamous shades. (One afternoon during a break in filming, Arnold Schwarzenegger went into a restaurant in downtown L.A. to get some lunch and realized all too late that he was still in Terminator makeup - with a missing eye, exposed jawbone and burned flesh.)<br /><br />Michael Biehn's character gets bitten on the hand by another character. This happens to him in every James Cameron movie he's in - see Aliens and The Abyss. The scene where the Terminator punches through a car's windshield was done with a hydraulic piston that was positioned next to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to look like his arm; they even had it pass through the arm on the jacket to give added realism. Auto glass is almost impossible to penetrate, by design, which required them to use hydraulics to get enough force. The idea stayed with Cameron and he used it again during the fight between the T-800 and T-1000 in T2: Terminator 2.<br /><br />To Arnie speaks very little in this movie is an understatement. His voice is used in exactly 16 lines, with 17 sentences spoken. The terminator has two other lines onscreen, one with the voice of a police officer overdubbed, and one with the voice of Sarah's mother overdubbed. There are also many lines with the voice of Sarah's mother, and we learn that the terminator is actually saying them, but we don't see it. Arnie also taught the world is now infamous catchphrase "I'll be back", which was originally scripted as "I'll come back". (Just doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?) There is only one time that Michael Biehn and Arnie are in the same frame together. It is when Kyle blasts The Terminator the second time at Tech Noir. When they finally meet in the factory, it is not Arnie, just a metallic puppet.<br /><br />As with all James Cameron DVDs (everything except Titanic - um, HELLO - and Terminator 3, since it wasn't done by him) there are loads of extras on this, most of them pretty tedious if you're not interested in a blow by blow account of every single scene. These include: Terminator A Retrospective; 'Other Voices' documentary; deleted scenes, four trailers (foreign, alternative, teaser, and TV spots); James Cameron's artwork stills; production photos; Stan Winston's photos; visual effects photos; publicity materials; original treatment script stills, and on the DVD-ROM: original treatment script, 1983 fourth draft script and final shooting script.<br /><br />Personally, I'll always prefer the second and third movies to this, but it's still great, as it really introduced the whole story to the viewing audience. The second and third have slightly better effects, plus the third has a female Terminator plus Arnie! Always a must for the guys in the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>When released in 1984, no one expected this to be a hit, but it definately set the tone for today's action movie, the film begins in the year 2027 A.D. where machines have taken over the world after a nuclear fallout, the human survivors have waged an all out non-stop war &amp; are very close to victory, so the machine's leader Skynet has the best plan of defeat, they will change the past by killing the mother of John Connor, the human resistance leader responsible for their near defeat, The Terminator, A machine disguised in human form is sent to the year 1984 to off Connor's mother Sarah, the resistence leader John then dispatches his own warrior Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the terminator (Scharzenegger), what follows is a cat &amp; mouse game with the Terminator killing anyone that gets in his way, Arnold has a field day as his famous villian, the best scene in the film is when he tracks her down, but his assasination attempt is ruined by Reese who has also tracked Sarah down, in a night club where Arnold &amp; Beihn face off, they escape but are pursued through the end, the future war is realistic in that is shows the consequences of letting computers run our lives, a very close reality, the sequel, although good, really contradicts this one, whereas you know by the end that the future can't be stopped, in T2 however it is , which would make the events of the 1st film non-existent, I don't hate T2, but feel it should have been done differently, this one however more than holds its own as a simple one-time movie, Terminator 3 is supposed to be on movie screens in 2003, hopefully we will see more of the future war, whereas in T2 we only see it in the beginning, which was disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>James Cameron showed the world his modus operandi for the first time in this spectacular sci fi action- fest starring Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In his first major action role as the lethal machine, who is aptly described by Michael Biehn's charcter Reese: "It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!" Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.<p>The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way. Stan Winston's animatronics used to create the Terminator are brilliant and the CG is "Whoa" material. Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well! This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made. The DVD extras are excellent too, with commentaries, 'making of's, "terminated" deleted scenes, trailers that fully capture the menace of the machine and the nerve-shredding pace of the film, production info and more. YOU MUST OWN THIS DISC.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>I can't tell you how many times I've watched this movie. Never mind its sequels, though. This is the only one really worth watching. This is one of my favorite action movies and I recommend it for anyone who likes them. Terminator rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>Saw this again the other night...sure, the '80s hairstyles and clothing and special effects seem a bit dated now, especially compared to the computer generated graphics we're used to now.  But this movie is still lots of fun: excellent camera work and film editing keep it brisk and moving, many funny and famous bits of dialogue, Arnie's exaggerated accent and wooden acting, a generous amount of carnage done in a half-cartoonish style---all the essentials still work!<br /><br />Kept me giggling throughout, just like in the old days...</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>For those who have read other reviews by yours truly, this will be review, but I divide science fiction into three categories:  true science fiction, science fantasy, and science horror.  Often, science horror could be called true science fiction, because it is based on what could happen.  However, true science fiction is focused more on the possibilities and human reaction, while the purpose of a science horror movie is to terrify you.  This movie will terrify you.<br /><br />This movie does an excellent job with its twists and turns in the plot; you will jump at least once by the time the movie is over.  Schwarzenegger is excellent as the villain, and Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn turn in good performances.  It also has a small role by Beth Motta, who I remember as being an exercise instructor for 20 Minute workout, an exercise program.<br /><br />One challenge in science fiction is dealing with time travel into the past.  This successfully achieves that goal.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>This is a movie that confused me a bit as a child, but upon viewing it another time, I couldn't get enough of it. If you're an action fan, then this movie has everting. Great one-liners, car chases, fights, and murder and futuristic mayhem. In 1984, two men[Michael Biehn and Schwarzennegar] appear out of nowhere, both are from the future, and both have one goal, find Sarah Connor. This is Arnie's best role still to date, although he doesn't talk much. He starts out the movie with a bang, naked in kicking some street punk's asses, and stealing their clothes in the process. He proceeds to find as much ammo as possible, and track down Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton. Hamilton delivers a good performance as a young woman frightened out of her wits. Director James Cameron does an excellent job putting the film together, and I found it hard to believe that this was only his second Hollywood film. Its a fun, suspenseful movie to watch!</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>The Terminator is one of the greatest action sci-fi films ever made. It has one of the best performances of Arnold Schwarzenegger's historic carear. <p>In 1984 the world is safe. Safe that is until The Terminator(Schwarzenegger) appears and stars killing woman. He's looking for Sarah Connor(Hamilton). He's been sent from the year 2029 to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the son she hasn't had yet who will one day stop the machines. The Terminator is a cyborg. He has a skin outside with a metal exo-skeleton and he has one purpose....to kill.<p>Sarah knows she is in trouble and she's scared. She meets up with Kyle Reese(Biehn) who warns her of the danger. She is skeptic at first but goes with Kyle. The Terminator will not stop however and Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop this killing machine before it kills them.<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is the man in this film. He was originally cast to play Kyle, but after he read the script he said wanted the part of the bad guy. He plays it to perfection. He has very few lines in the film, but he is terrifying in the movie. The whole look with the glasses and leather jackets and with Arnolds body makes one of the best bad guys ever. Actions speak louder than words in this movie. Arnold really is good enough in the moive to earn an Oscar nomination. You don't think they will ever take him down in the film, and the ending is great.<p>Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. This is one of the best performances of her carear as well. If it weren't for Hamilton in this movie and Weaver in Aliens we wouldn't have the big woman action thriller that we have today. You like her in this a lot and she's even better in T2.<p>The special effects are great in this movie. James Cameron's movies have always had great special effects Terminator is no exception. The movie is made so well. James Cameron really is the man and this guy really does deserve more credit in Hollywood. Very few directors over the years have made movies that are consistently good and Cameron has never made a bad film. He also needs credit for writing this masterpiece of a film.<p>The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever made. It's a huge movie and especially with pop culture today. It's stood the test of time. The famous line &quot;I'll be Back&quot; is from this movie, but it's always been here. If you haven't seen this movie you must go pick it up and watch it. If you have and don't own it, go buy it now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>"The Terminator" is a significant film for many reasons.  It put James Cameron on the map, it proved Arnold Schwarzenegger was not a one-hit wonder after "Conan the Barbarian" (1982), and it introduced the general public to Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn.  It also reinforced the notion that vision and filmmaking ingenuity play a greater role in creating a quality film than exorbitant budgets and the casting of award-winning performers.<p>In the future, humankind is locked in a deadly struggle with machines that want to eradicate them.  The machines send back in time a robot (Schwarzenegger), dubbed a Terminator, to kill the mother of the man who will lead the human resistance against the machines.  They reason that by removing the mother from the timeline, the son who will battle them in the future will never come to be.  The woman the machines seek is a waitress named Sarah Conner (Hamilton).  Leaning of the plot against her, the human resistance tries to foil the machines' plan by sending back in time a lone soldier named Kyle Reese (Biehn).  Reese is charged with keeping Connor alive in order to preserve the timeline but that mission proves challenging as the relentless Terminator proves extremely adept at tracking down its prey.  <p>"The Terminator" can be interpreted as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, but to be honest it is better remembered as an exciting and entertaining chase film.  The energy generated by the pursuit of Sarah Connor is so intoxicating that any deep thoughts over the film's message is deferred until long after the end credits have finished.  Hamilton and Biehn are great in their parts but it is Schwarzenegger who steals the film.  He is perfectly cast and somehow manages to imbue his emotionless character with more charisma and humor than the average flesh-and-blood cinematic character.  Sure, the time paradoxes that the story poses might not stand up to close scrutiny when you think about it, the musical score is hopelessly dated, and the special effects are not top-of-the-line.  However, Cameron's determination to turn out a good product in spite of the limitations that confronted him comes through in every frame of "The Terminator."  Who would have ever guessed at the time of its making that this small film would continue to endure decades after its initial release?</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>Two sequels later, there still isn't a _Terminator_ movie that comes within miles of the first of the series.<p>Oh, I like T2 well enough on its own terms, but even though it's got much higher production values than this one, it pretty much wrecks the premise on which the series is based. If the future is really changed, there's nowhere for the Terminators (and Kyle Reese) to come back _from_, and the whole house caves in. (T3 makes a valiant effort to overcome this problem but doesn't quite make it.)<p>This first one is complete as it stands. Shot on such a low budget that James Cameron couldn't even afford to record it in stereo (a shortcoming finally remedied in the 2001 DVD release), this film sets the standard of logical consistency for time-travel action-thrillers (admittedly a pretty narrow genre; the other reasonably well-known one is _Timecop_, and it's far from consistent).<p>See, the plot in this one is carefully constructed so that when Skynet sends the Terminator back in time, it's actually helping to _bring about_ the past in which John Connor is conceived: by sending Arnold, Skynet seals its own fate. If you're an SF reader, you'll be thinking of Heinlein's 'By His Bootstraps' at this point, and you'll be right.<p>There's lots of cool action, too, and even the low-budget special effects have held up well against the last twenty years of cinematography. But the film doesn't actually rely on them all that much; it's really Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and the terrifying Arnold, under James Cameron's direction, that keep the tension high here.<p>I saw this movie in 1984, almost by accident. I was living on Long Island as a graduate student (math) and my housemate and I headed out one Saturday night to see a movie. By the time we got to the theater, it was already ten p.m. and this was the only one that hadn't already started. I expected to be disappointed, and instead was very pleasantly surprised.<p>It's still one of my favorites, and it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago. It's a pre- and post-apocalytpic thriller, a man-vs.-machine action flick, and several other things. But mostly, it's just a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>There are countless ways to describe how I think of this film; one of them is Spectacular! The first in the classic Terminator movie series is a ground-breaking cinematic work of art of absolutely stunning proportions and put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map and made him one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and early 1990s before several commercial duds would temporarily dampen his success later on (Batman & Robin anyone?) until "Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines" came along. The groundbreaking movie is the story of an extremely bleak future where Los Angeles and much of the world's civilization is wiped out by nuclear Armageddon when a computer program/internet named Skynet, goes out of control, and the machines, under control of it, unleash a reign of nuclear terror and destruction, decimating much of the human (non-machine) population, and taking over much of the world, except for a few surviving humans who have gathered forces to fight against the machines thanks to a rebel leader named John Connor who leads what remains of the human race into ultimately smashing the machines into junk, ensuring victory against them. However, the machines send back a human cyborg 45 years back in time to the year 1984, to kill John Connor, by means of "terminating" a waitress woman named Sarah Connor, who is the future mother of the human rebel leader, which would result in John never even being born in the first place. In the year 1984, Sarah Connor's life seems like any ordinary life: living as a waitress at a slighltly seedy L.A. Restaurant, and barely balancing a checkbook. She has no idea that it will take a massive turn. A rebel soldier named Kyle Reeves is also sent back in time to protect Sarah Connor, and her 'unborn' son from the emotionless Terminator and thus fighting for the future of humanity. At that point, it is evident that Reeves would not only protect John Connor but in fact, turn out being his father later on. What makes The Terminator even more dangerous is that he is able to copy other peoples voices, and yes, even copy women's voices, making him even more likely to find where his target is. The human cyborg does not feel emotion; it does not feel pain; it cannot be reckoned with. He can blend in with the rest of society as he is part human, part machine, with flesh on the outside, but machine and robot on the inside and all these things make him so much more dangerous to be reckoned with. <p>Parents, be warned! There are truckloads of disturbing violence in this film and also some extremely bloody scenes that will scare young children and I can't blame them, even I have become unsettled when watching this when I was younger but sadly worse stuff has happened in real life. There is one scene which I'm not going to mention for fear of spoilers, that even I had a relatively tough time handling. Occasional profanity also makes this movie one for the more grown-up audiences. However, it also brings to mind, the possibility of what might happen if man and machine do in fact, start fighting each other especially with all of the computer viruses that plague the internet today. It also brings to mind that it is possible to actually build a machine that could do the same things that Terminator actually does in this movie. In top of it all, it is very chilling as the movie's story does brush very closely with reality at the possibility of all of the things happening in this movie actually occurring in real life especially with all of these computer virus attacks that have crippled businesses these past few years although time travel may not be possible because it would likely have messed up the timeline already.<br /><br />This film, while it was a highly ground-breaking film back in 1984, has really begun to show it's age, especially the futuristic battle scenes where the floating spacecraft vehicle looks more like a toy suspended on a string than a realistic looking battle vehicle but this movie was made during a time before the special effects technology would skyrocket not too long afterwards, often to an excessive degree. Also it was filmed and The special effects also kind of look cheesy now due to the time of their creation, but only to a mild degree. The two latter Terminator movies benefited from superior production but while parts of the first Terminator movie have really dated badly, there is no denying that this is still a five star plus movie and I highly recommend buying this for those who want a highly brilliant movie, with violence and action that meshes along with the storyline, as opposed to the brainless, thug war violence of a lot of today's movies ("2 Fast 2 Furious" anyone?). While parts of this movie really show signs of being extremely dated, particularly the futuristic battle scenes in 2029, the low budget spent on making this incredible movie really went into good use thanks in part to a strong story and stunning directing thanks in part to the blossoming talent of James Cameron. "Terminator" is arguably one of the best movies from the 1980s and also one of the most fascinating and most innovative sci-fi action movies of all time. <p>"The Terminator" is a highly essential film for the ages. From here through the next two movies, we hear that unforgettable line "I'll Be Back!". Whether to see cinematic innovation or just simply have fun, or just have some 1980s nostalgia, this movie delivers all of the above and is an essential film and the success of it resulted in two dynamite sequels. It's so unbelievable how James Cameron took the low budget spent on the movie's making and turned what could've been a long forgotten throwaway sci-fi flick into a timeless modern masterpiece. All three of the Terminator movies are masterpieces.

In many ways its effects on popular consciousness have been notable, and it also made a major star of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who up to that point had appeared only in supporting roles in minor films like "Stay Hungry" with Jeff Bridges and "The Villain" with an aging Kirk Douglas.  With the release of this film, all that was over in a heartbeat. Or perhaps one could say, in the speed of a laser beam. For this is a science fiction thriller to end all thrillers! <p>The movie staggers the viewer with the horrifying vision of a world at risk, of a world we can recognize in the act of propelling itself toward a nightmare future, a future that may well be dominated by impersonal and anti-human machines. Linda Hamilton plays the hapless, disorganized, and playfully immature Sarah Connor, future legendary mother to John Connor, the future potential leader of the Anti-machine rebellion that might just save the world in that future time.  And while poor Sarah is trying to wrap her mind around all this data being hurled at her by a solitary soldier sent back in time through a time machine by her son to warn her, a cybernetic warrior is systematically hunting and killing every other Sarah Connor in the Los Angeles county telephone book! <p>This sets the stage for non-stop, heart-wrenching action, and the viewer is assaulted by both sights and data that intrigue and astound him or her, for this is science fiction very well done, a story that has meat and bones over its substantial interior, and like the cyborg that Arnold plays, is ready to slay you into submission.  The scenes don't follow each other so much as get exploded from one sequence to the next, in a blood-curdling, shotgun wielding struggle to kill or be killed. And the struggle goes on and on. This is a classic thriller, folks, one that has already spawned another hit movie (T-2), and rumor now has it that Schwarzenegger and company have T-3 ready to begin production soon. In the unlikely event you have been off the planet and have missed seeing it to date, no problem. Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.  The show is about to begin!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Terminator is one of those movies I remember long after I walked out the theatre. What I remembered most was that it was pretty darn scary. A good thriller type of film to watch on the TV or Theatre. The effects were very cool at the time and the robot and mechanical effects were pretty impressive.<p>Of course James Cameron and Arnold Swartzeneger had a chance, with more time, money and technology, to do the second Terminator much bigger, better, faster and louder - but this one had a simple story and motivated the characters to really move.<p>Linda Hamilton and Michael Bein were great together and the action very intense. Ironically enough The Terminator is a bad guy in this movie. He spends most of his time trying to kill Linda. In the sequel, he is just the opposite - trying to save Linda and her son. It's irony with a twist.<p>This is good science fiction, with good action and some very scary scenes; I purchased this DVD, which does not have all the extras. Since then, the new DVD has a lot more. Oh and Terminator 3 will be out in 2003 - if you didn't already know!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>This movie put both James Cameron and Schwarzenegger on the map back in 1984.When the movie starts,it's the year 2029 where the city of LA is basically rubble and machines/super-computers run the show in the future.Expect the fact that some humans survivers and they weren't giving up without a fight and they're led by a man named John Connor.The computers are hell-bent on exterminating the humanrace for good and the only way the computers can destory man's future is by changing the past.So they send an indestructible cyborg called the terminator(Schwarzenegger)back in time to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton)whose unborn son will become mankind's only hope.But the Human Ressitance sent a soldier named Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn)to protect Sarah and her unborn child.The Terminator is one wild and great ride to take.The acting is great,the score is really cool,the images of the future are creepy to see and great screenplay and directing by Cameron makes The Terminator a classic adventure film to watch over and over again.The DVD is loaded with special features like a brand-new "Other Voices"Documentary with new James Cameron interviews,"The Terminator:A Retrospective"Documentary,terminated/deleted scenes,trailer,TV spots and more.The Terminator is a must have in your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack. The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.<p>I'm not a big fan of Cameron as a director though. There are no huge comparisons between the terrifying Dark Future LA and the 1984 LA. As most scenes are shot at night in derelict parts of town the whole films looks miserable. It can also be so VERY, VERY 80's. Take a gander at the clothing and the music. The Technoir scene is a great example. <p>Arnie is super-cool as the emotionless cyborg who just blows everyone away WITHOUT grinning at the camera. Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor. But she became really annoying in the sequel. It's a shame Lance Henrikson isn't in it for long and Dick Miller has an amusing cameo.<p>It is quite scary in parts too. The steel exo-skeleton of the Terminator is not the kind of bad guy I'd wanna go up against and the visions of the robot war is rather ugly. Especially when we see the wheel crush up all the human skulls. Although it is quite unlikely that skulls would be piled up like that. Where are the rest of the bones?<p>The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible. It's nothing but inaudible noise. The same applies for T2 and his score for True Lies. Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?<p>Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Fifth Element, X-Men) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it. <p>But Cameron made it in 1.85:1, which sucks. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print. <p>The new DVD has a much cleaner anamorphic picture (Image previously released this in letterbox only and mono) and the 5.1 sound will give your system a good workout.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>TERMINATOR is a movie purely incredible in many ways, but the two best things in it are first the successful modern retelling of THE tale mentioned in the title, (a tale which appears at least once in all human cultures since the dawn of time) and then the unique and powerful love story. There are also many other treasures in this film (see below, at the end of the review).<br /><br />But first, the tale. From distant and terrible future comes to present day the Dragon (or if you prefer you can call it the Beast, the Monster, the Destroyer, or any other similar name). This Dragon is a powerful and cunning monster - it hides its real form (and it can even disguise its real voice), it doesn't feel pain, it never sleeps, it doesn't need to eat, drink or even rest, it knows no mercy, no fear, no doubt - and as if it was not enough, all its vital organs are covered with nearly indestructible armor... Few of those who will cross his path will live to tell the tale - and even those lucky few will be marked by its passage for ever, in their chair and in their mind. Oh, by the way, the Dragon looks very much like Arnold Schwarzenegger...<br /><br />The Dragon came for one and only one reason - it must find and slay the Princess (in some versions of this story also called the Maiden, although in this particular case she is probably no more qualified...). The Princess name is Sarah Connor and she bears a strong resemblance to young Linda Hamilton. She is absolutely not aware of her importance and being born in a very average family, she lives a rather banal life of hard labor and simple pleasures. On the surface she is a very average young girl, barely out of her teens, not very bright, not very ambitious, not very courageous (at least in the beginning in the movie), cute but not really a stunning beauty - but in fact she is the most important woman in human history since Virgin Mary! And if the Dragon finds her and kills her, all humanity will perish with her!<br /><br />Lucky for her and the whole humanity, the Dragon has been tracked and followed by the Knight (the Prince, the Paladin, the Hero, the Warrior, the Monster-Slayer, the Great Hunter, etc.) who swore to save the Princess (and therefore the whole humankind) no matter what the price, without any regard for his own safety. This Knight, who looks like Michael Biehn, is still young, but in the same time he is already a precociously aged battle scarred veteran, who slayed many a lesser dragon before, but who never yet faced such a formidable foe as this particular Beast. Even worse, he had to leave his magic sword (here called plasma rifle) behind, in his own times... For that reason the Knight can not just face the beast and slay it - he must first find the Princess and place her in a safe place and only then find a way to outsmart the Dragon, to have at least a chance in the unavoidable confrontation. And that will really, really NOT be an easy quest!<br /><br />The TALE would not be complete however if love did not intervene. And surprisingly TERMINATOR, when one looks carefully, is in fact a story about an incredible love. A love completely mad, passionate, burning, tragic, condemned from the beginning, without any hope to be fulfilled but which will ultimately defy the time, the destiny and even the death itself - and triumph! And it may well be, that by this love the whole humanity will be saved - or at the very least get a fragile second chance...<br /><br />As promised, here are some other treasures you can find in this movie. There is the excellent camera work, great music and an incredible atmosphere of a great city (Los Angeles) at night with its game of lights and shadows - all of which is the trade mark of great James Cameron, who signed here his first masterpiece. There are excellent second roles of Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen and Earl Boen. There are action scenes which still are impressive 28 years later and which did not age at all. There is the archi-famous Schwarzenegger's line "I will be back", which contains so much menace in it that I still shiver when hearing it even if I watched this movie like 20 times already. And finally, there is the water and fire proof perfection of scenario which appears in its full glory in the last two minutes of the movie...<br /><br />I can not find any more words which could praise this movie enough, so I will stop here, inviting you with all my heart to discover this immortal tale, in which the Dragon, the Princess and the Knight will meet their respective fates... and in which they will all lose... but in the same time they will also all win (as it is explained with more detail in the less magnificent, but still very honest sequel).</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>A wonderful film that at its heart has a well thought out story, and for the most part does not betray the fact that it was filmed 25 years ago. I've just re-watched it for the first time in ten years and none of the elements that made it so good in the 1980's have really dated at all. Sure there are no mobile phones to assist Sarah Conner, and the stop motion photography near the end betrays the films relatively low budget, but all in all its a roller coaster ride that takes some beating.<br /><br />The first hour is relentless action with a high degree of tension as well. If by chance you've never seen it before you are really won't be sure who wants to kill Sarah Conner. Of course if you've seen T2 first you may be even more confused....<br /><br />Schwarzenegger was made for this role, and the idea of him being a cyborg with real flesh is entirely believable. If theres one criticsm of the film its perhaps that they should have dubbed a different voice (a bit like they did with Dave Prowse in Star Wars) when The Terminator speaks.<br /><br />Credit must go to James Cameron the director, who was responsible for so many quality Action/Sci-fi/Horror films in the 80's and early 90's. Sadly Cameron hasn't maintained that standard and since directing Titanic (which itself wasn't that good and was 10 years ago now) hasn't made another as good as The Terminator.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is a true classic of the sci fi genre. a five star movie classic,  That being said Warner Brothers made no attempt to clean up the print for the blu ray release.  This was a early release from the studio on the new format. They since have released many flicks with excellent cleaned up pictures. However sony also made this mistake with their release of  the fifth element and then recalled the first edition and put out a proper cleaned up release.  Warner brothers needs to do the same with this one.  Lets just hope that no other movies get released on blu ray with tear and wear lines down the center of the picture. 'caligula' has them too sadly but that's a special case,  Blu ray should never have such poorly done transfers on this format. Even the newer release of this is just the same print. this is lame.  Someone clean this movie up! they fixed 'predator' so why can't they do the same for this and 'robocop"?</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>The Terminator is a true classic that really made Arnold famous. The visual effects may look cheesy now but for 1984, it was revolutionary. That's 21 years ago! The movie was directed by James Cameron and was followed up by an even better sequel. Buy this one and Terminator 2: Judgement Day and rent T3: Rise of the machines, and you'll be in for a true treat.<br /><br />This one is about a cyborg sent from the future in the past/ present to kill Sarah Connor because she would give birth to a son that would lead the resistance against the machines. Arnold plays the machine/ Cyborg/ robot and he's big, mean, and just awesome. He tears out a page from the phone book, and decides to kill every Sarah Connor. The movie is absolutely wonderfully made. But a man is also sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor.<br /><br />The movie is very suspensful and absolutely brilliant thanks to Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schw.. as the evil cyborg. Arnold barely talks but has an evil stare with a very mean look. He does have some awesome catch phrases such as "I'll be back!".<br /><br />When you watch this movie, remember that it's a classic and that it made Arnold famous. Just look at his eye contact and facial expressions. That shows everything. Also, don't laugh at how cheesy some scenes are, it was made 21 years ago! The special effects in this movie were AMAZING FOR THE TIME! So, just sit back and enjoy a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>You get a very interesting Horror/sci-fi film that stamped James Camron, and Arnold Schwarzenegger around the world.<br /><br />This movie is about Sarah Conor(Linda Hamilton) who's unborn son will be the turning point of the war with the machines.  But the machines refuse to go out like some chumps.  They send a rithless machine, the T-model 101(Arnold Schwarzenegger to waste her like a coke can.  This is the only time you'll see Arnold as a ruthless mo'fo but it's undeniebly an unforgettable performance.  But the humans send one of their own, a human who knows the situation.  Cyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to protect her, but the million dollar question is, can they do it, or will they be ruthlessly slaughtered by the heartless machine.<br /><br />The one thing I like about this film, is the fear it presents.  It seems nothing that Cyle and Sarah do can stop him, not even a police force of 30 men with shotguns and assult rifles even stalled this baaaaad dude.  It makes the Terminator feel almost invincible.  Even the dated special effects at the end, where the terminator looked fake, made him look scary.  If he moved realistic, I dunno, but with him moving fake, accually mad him look scarier.<br /><br />Arnold in this one is the scariest out of the terminators, because the protagonist wasn't a machine, but a human.  T-1000 is the best because liquid metal seemed nearly indutuctable.  The T-X is just, well T3 shouldn't have even been made.  I mean T3 made the hairstyles on the wemon in this film look sexy(Well maybe)<br /><br />James Camron's carrer was made, and Arnold's carrer skyrocketed way up.  This may have been low budgeted, but high hearted.  This film is second to the clerverly made sequal that continued the plot so flawlessly, and this film makes T3 look like junk.

It begins in the future, with machines ruling the Earth, before backtracking to present day.  It turns out that the machines have sent back a cyborg in the shape of Arnie to kill the mother (Hamilton) of what will be the leader of a human war against the machines.  Yet the humans send back a human protector for the unaware Sarah O'Connor called Kyle.  Thus ensues one of the most compelling chase movies for a long time, with a dark plot that adds to a sense of despair and panic.<p>The acting is all spot on, with Hamilton being especially impressive as the ditzy waitress who suddenly has to come to terms with the fact that she holds the key to humanity's existence.  Surprisingly Arnie is also incredibly well suited to the menacing role of the terminator - the role that launched him into super stardom.  The action sets are all superb too, with some great special effects even by today's standards.  All this and there are some fantastic one-liners, some of which have deservedly gone down in movie history.  However, it is the dark nature of the story that really gives it the nudge above countless other such movies.  The city streets that the heroine runs through look wasted enough for the audience to consider if it's worth saving or not.  That the movie manages to tackle a romantic subplot successfully should also be noted.  This is one of those rare movies where looking back, it is still the genre classic now as it was then.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>Nearly 20 years since its release, &quot;The Terminator&quot; still has the juice to stand up to the Hollywood dreck that's being released today.  In a nutshell, a cyborg (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to kill a woman (Hamilton) and prevent her from giving birth to her son.  Meanwhile, an agent (Beihn) is also sent from the future to protect her. I won't go into further plot details, but this film grabs your attention from the opening credits to the last frame. Even the special effects hold up well after all these years.  If you have a taste for sci-fi inspired action, you cannot go wrong with &quot;The Terminator!&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>The Terminator remains the great 80s B-Film. Not only does it have a sexed-up "Outer Limits" plot with a brilliant conception of a futuristic war against self-generating machines, but in in the best "Escape From Planet of the Apes" tradition, it even takes place in the present day.<br /><br />The Terminator was a breakthrough film that altered the Sci-Fi mainstream. Its nihilism and violence killed off the Star Wars era, and ushered in the second half of the 80s, during which McTiernan/Cameron thrived. But all of this cultural relativism aside, The Terminator is a well-constructed, skillfully shot lower-budget film. The unrelenting pace has a become a textbook for subsequent directors.<br /><br />But I do I think it is unfortunate that there were sequels made. "T2" immediately does away with the Del James-esque poetics of the first film and goes for pure commercialism. It has neither the nihilism nor the urgency of the first, and the science fiction element is simply rehashed, with mediocre results. Terminator 3 does a decent job of continuing with the story, but it too just makes the same point (in a much less subtle way) than this first film, which stands on its own.<br /><br />And the blu-ray looks great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>I was kinda miffed when I discovered that 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD was released in the UK before it was available state-side. You'd think that the first video release of a movie would occur in the country it was made in, right? After all, how would the British digital videophile feel if 'Monty Python' was available on DVD in the US before being released in the UK? Or a Japanese disc-hound if he discovered the 'Akira' Special Edition platter was gonna first hit the street in Toronto instead of Osaka? But, since MGM is a gigantic multinational corporation, and they own the rights to (or have a license to distribute) 'The Terminator' Special Edition DVD, I guess they can release it anywhere and at any time they danged well feel like it. Which is pretty much what they did of course. Fortunately, I still had the original Terminator DVD to tide me over 'til the new platter's release date rolled around.<p>However, after checkin' out this bad boy, my little gripe concerning MGM's distribution practices kinda fell by the wayside. Though not nearly as tricked out as the Special Edition DVD release of T2, this disc does have a pretty good array of extras, including trailers, cut scenes, two documentaries, and even a choice between listening to the new 5.1 sound remix or the original mono! I found this little bonus to be the disc's most interesting feature. Since I'd watched the old mono 'Terminator' many many times, I was really able to hear the difference between the two sound tracks, especially when gunshots were being fired. Just do a quick back & forth switch between the 5.1 and the mono during the police station shootout, and you'll see-- whoops, I mean hear-- what I'm talking about!<p>I was somewhat disappointed that the cut scenes were put aside for separate viewing on the Special Features side, rather than restored to the movie itself. But, when I listened to Cameron's audio commentary regarding these moments, he made a few fairly good reasons why he decided not to make the restoration. Still, I think it would've been a neat idea to have the option of watching the theatrical version and the rendition with these cutting-room bits restored. There's a few more poignant moments with Reese and Sarah, but most of the clipped moments involved Cyberdyne, the company that eventually paves the way for the Terminator's future. I'll not reveal any further info regarding these 'lost' scenes; you'll have to see them for yourself! <p>Then there's the documentaries. The first one is a half-hour retrospective featuring (for the most part) Arnie and Cameron discussing their memories about the making of 'The Terminator'. Then there's the 'Other Voices' doc, featuring remembrances by such notables as director-cowriter James Cameron, makeup effects designer Stan Winston, T2 co-writer William Wisher, producer Gale Ann Hurd, Arnie, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and other people involved in the making of this legendary sci-fi actioner. <p>The one extra feature I was hoping would be on this disc is, unfortunately, absent: a feature-length commentary track by Cameron. I found this little exclusion to be a bit disappointing. I guess I'll just have to deal with it whilst I continue my 'Easter Egg' hunt. However, If you have a DVD-Rom in your computer, this platter also includes three different drafts of the script, as well as watch the movie whilst reading the final draft screenplay. You know, just in case you can't follow the dialogue too well, and you're not too hot about reading those pesky English subtitles. <p>'Late!</p></br><a href="../users/A18CRS4FLVH5YW.html">A18CRS4FLVH5YW</a><br/><p>..

The disc is definitely not in Transformers level quality.  However, considering the low budget roots of Arnie and James Cameron's sci-fi/horror/chase film, I don't think you could expect more from the source materials.<br /><br />Even after so many years, 25 years at that, this low budget shocker still packs a punch.  Other than Predator, its hard to find Arnold in a better, more suiting role.  Cameron's story, plotting and editing keep the film on boil until the last screen.  I think only the sex scene comes off as a little out of place.<br /><br />While the 1960s era special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey look seamless on Blu-Ray, the miracles of high-def do no favors for the 1984 makeup and matte effects of Terminator.  The sound can be muted at times but good overall.  Again, considering the film's budget limitations and guerilla-style filmmaking of Cameron in those days, this is about as good as the source will allow us to enjoy.<br /><br />Comparing to the endless releases of T2 editions packed with extra content, there are precious few add-ons with The Terminator. Visual clarity and color are all very consistent.  Sharpness is hit and miss but in the end, its the content that counts.  The Terminator is a great archival shelf title that will outlast its visual flaws.  Blu-Ray will allow you to enjoy the last ounce of quality, other formats did not.  And finding the title between $10 and $15, depending on where you look, its a great buy too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Terminator 2 Judgement Day came out in theaters when I was around high or middle school.

Just before being destroyed, Skynet sends a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah, the mother to be of John Connor, the Leader of the human resistance. The terminator can pass for human, is nearly indestructible, and has only one mission, killing Sarah Connor. One soldier is sent back to protect her from the killing machine. He must find Sarah before the Terminator can carry out it's mission. "The Terminator" is a great movie. I highly recommend this movie, it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>THE TERMINATOR has become a classic; an iconic piece of movie history.  This is the movie that made the Govenator a star.  Part sci-fi time travel drama, part blood and guts shoot `em up, part action-adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger became a household name playing THE TERMINATOR, a killer cyborg from the future whose sole mission is to kill Sarah Connor.  His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling.  This is the first movie in which he wore clothes for the majority of the film, and where he uttered what is arguably his most famous line "I'll be back." (Admittedly, he only had 18 lines!) Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds.  The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.<br /><br />I just plain like this movie.  I remember seeing it in the theatres in 1984, and being blown away.  And I still enjoy it after all these years.  I showed THE TERMINATOR to my 12 year old daughter a few days ago, and she thought that it was "pretty cool," too.  High praise coming from a tween!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>Some films age like wine: the older they get, the better they get. It's hard to believe that the Terminator's pushing 25 years old. Terminator's lean script, staccato editing and direction, and its human driven storyline are what allows it to survive amongst modern films that benefit from superior technologies like CGI, motion capture, and now 3D-motion photography. Everything's relative and, in 1984, Terminator's special effects were extraordinary.  For instance, there's a scene in a motel where the Terminator attends to some gunshot wounds he suffered. Using a box-knife, he opens a vaginal gash on his forearm to readjust a broken piston rod.  Then, he stabs the box-knife into his eyeball and plucks the soft gelatin organ out of his head. In the ragged and empty mouth of his eye-socket, a hard shiny light zooms in and out. This was scary back in 1984. Today, a five-year old could see through these transparent effects.<br /><br />Distilled to its essence, the Terminator is a cyborg from the future that travels back in time--forty years--to kill a woman, a waitress, whose unborn son will save mankind in near the future. This is the magic of the Terminator: it's a human story.  The action, the special effects, the camerawork, the actors---the special effects in Terminator takes a back seat to its human storyline.<br /><br />Terminator is James Cameron's best movie. It has the perfect atmosphere; most of the action is at night. The big `70's cars in the Terminator's chase sequences are reminiscent of the big cars in The French Connection's chase sequences.  Unlike T2, where there's a lot of exposition between action scenes, Terminator's action scenes erupt out of nowhere. I could go on and on but the bottom line is that Terminator will be around long after most of today's science fiction rip-offs are obsolete.<br /><br />author of Gotta Be Down!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>This movie is just a year younger than me, but even after all of these years, this movie still holds up today. The suspence and pacing of the film is amazing and watcing it the 30th time is just as fun as watching it the first. You gotta give credit to Arnold, he is probably the best cyborg on screen ever. A lot of the praise goes to Schwarzenegger, but Micahel Biehn makes for an excellent hero as Kyle Reese. His dialogue and scenes like when he is being interrogated by the police make the movie. I have to admit that the end of the movie when we see the Terminator as his true skeletal self, it still gives me the creeps. Just him walking and almost making it through the door before they close it is really terrifying. Overall, you just can't go wrong with this movie because it will never get old.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Although I still prefer "Judgement Day", the first Terminator contains a darker atmosphere that I really like. Filmed in a much lower budget, "The Terminator" is darker, creepier, and bloodier than the sequel. Schwarzenegger portrays a killing machine from the future who is sent to the present in order to kill the unborn future leader of the human rebellion. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor, the young woman who tries hard to disbelieve that fact that she will, in the future, give birth to the future's only hope against artificial intelligence. Michael Beihn is Kyle, who is sent to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah.<br /><br />This is an awesome film, and while I do love the sequel much more than the original, I love this one for its dark and chilling atmosphere.

If you are not familiar with this film by now......what are you waiting for? This special edition released in 2001 has a nice DVD transfer and some very interesting extras included deleted scenes and commentary, a couple of feature-ettes(one a few years after the films released and one many years later). There are some cool trailers and TV spots, plus a copy of the original script. After watching the extras I had a new appreciation for the film and realized just how far enthusiasm can take a project. Arnold may not be a great actor(especially at this time), but his presence is certainly a big part of what makes this unstoppable cyborg work so well for this film. Hamilton turns in a very good performance as Sarah Conner and also adds depth to this heart pumping thriller!</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Long before Arnold had a gubernatorial gleam in his eye, he starred as a hulking, monotone killing machine in this electrifying sci-fi action thriller by "Titanic" director Cameron. Popping off some of the most famous one-liners in film history ("Hasta la vista, baby!"), Schwarzenegger is both frightening and funny, even as he brutally destroys anyone who interferes with his mission. Hamilton and Biehn handle their roles splendidly too, with credible intensity, fear, and against-all-odds resolve. Full of dazzling special effects and far better than its buffed-up sequels, "The Terminator" is a hellish, suspense-fueled fun ride into the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Entertainment Weekly recently touted the first sequel ("Terminator 2: Judgment Day") to this film as being one of The Twenty-Five Best Action Films of all time.  That title may be an accurate assessment of the non-stop action of the sequel but what would it have been without its predecessor which ranks as one of the best science fiction commentaries on the path that we may be going with our computer-dependent society.<br /><br />James Cameron scored a casting coup when he gave the role to Arnold.  At the time, the muscle-bound actor had had a few films under his belt, films that played mostly on his physical appearance and his novice acting skills.  "The Terminator" character was short on dialogue but Cameron made the best of his star by providing him with one-line zingers and stares that could wake the dead.<br /><br />To call the part "tailor-made" for Schwarzenegger would be a major understatement.  He was muy perfecto.<br /><br />Linda Hamilton, not yet the household name that she would become for TV's "Beauty and the Beast," as well as not yet the future "Mrs. James Cameron," is appropriately confused and terrified as the waitress that would ultimately become the mother of the man that would rescue humanity.<br /><br />Michael Biehn is well-cast as the other traveler from the future, intent on preventing Arnold's malevolent cyborg from doing his killing-thing.<br /><br />Stan Winston's effects still hold their own after almost a quarter of a century.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>In one of the most intelligent and unhesitating science fiction films of the 1950s, Robert Wise equipped "The Day the Earth Stood Still" with technical marvels, chief among them the huge robot Gort--the prototype, Michael Rennie suggests, for a global police force...

But in James Cameron's breakthrough feature, there is, indeed, 'a storm coming in.'

James Cameron is a genius. I knew it then. And, of course, it's apparent to everyone now. James makes flawless films. Even taking into account the lack of high-tech special effects in the first Terminator compared to the wizardry we have today, you have to realize this is an all time great! This movie never loses it's punch or appeal---even twenty years later! James gives us a gutsy female heroine (Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor) long before they became popular. (Look at ''Charlie's Angels''.) But Cameron writes characters who are REAL. Who doesn't identify with Sarah Connor? The always underrated Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is as superb as he is darling and appealing. Check out Bill Paxton (who would go on to be featured in and eventually star in more of Cameron's films) in the opening sequence as an unfortunate ''punk'' and his punk friends who meet the Terminator! And wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect as the single minded killing machine. Arnold and James make wonderful movies together. Who doesn't enjoy an Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi flick? As James Cameron has said about Arnold, (not exact quote)-He takes direction very well and can physically and emotionally do exactly as the director envisions. Arnold is just great and just keeps getting better. When I first saw this film, I told friends I thought that was funny when Arnold said ''I'll be back.'' It is a truly captivating line....I was right! That line became Arnold's most famous ''catch phrase''! You cannot miss seeing this movie and no home DVD/Video library should be without it! Yes, this movie is A#1 in my book-----exciting, frightening, riveting, romantic and unforgettable. If you don't love it, you're simply not a sci-fi movie lover.

This was not immediately obvious to a lot of people who only gave T1 the nod after the  success of T2. I am happy to lavish praise on both movies.  Consider though  that T1 had a production budget of less than one fifth of T2 and you may  start to get a feel for what an outstanding job was done on it.<br /><br />Terminator is the story of a young woman, (Sarah Connor), being  stalked. When you get down to it, that is the essence of the film and also  the source of the suspense and empathy we feel for that character. We can  all imagine what it would be like to have your life placed at risk at the  hands of a persistent murderer.<br /><br />Where this film pushes the envelope  is that the stalker is a cyborg, (part mechanical, part organic), killing  machine, (Terminator), from the future. Everyone else has said it so I may  as well. Schwartzenegger was perfectly cast in the role of an emotionless  machine of destruction. It's mission to assassinate the mother of John  Connor, who was to later in time become the leader of an army that opposed  the terminator's creator, Skynet.  Said creator being a self aware computer  that had taken control of the world by using the automated nuclear defence  grid.<br /><br />Sarah has an ally in the form of a soldier who volunteered to  travel from the future to protect the mother of his commander against the  Terminator. Played by Michael Biehn, Kyle Reese is determined to save the  woman that he loves. He managed to fall for Sarah before he had even met  her, through a faded Polaroid that John Connor gave him some years earlier.  In my opinion, it is Biehn that shines in this picture. Yes, the rest of  the actors were excellent but this was the first major film that Bein was  in and he was nothing short of brilliant. I think that a large part of the  horror we feel towards the terminator is a reflection of Reese's attitude  and reactions to it. If this obviously tough and battle scarred veteran is  brought nearly to the edge of hopelessness then you just know the bad guy  is a serious problem.<br /><br />Terminator was a fast paced film with a  relentless series of suspenseful chases and terrifying action sequences.  I  could not at the time imagine a film that could be as gripping, that is  until I saw Judgment Day, otherwise known as T2. Same plot only with the  roles exchanged. This time the victim is John Connor a twelve year old boy,  the original terminator, still played by Schwartzenegger, is the protector,  (reprogrammed in the future). The bad guy is also a terminator, but this  time it is an advanced prototype, (T-1000). No longer a Cyborg but a living  metal organism that can flow into any shape it desires.<br /><br />If I  thought the first terminator was relentless then the T-1000 is unstoppable.  Well, at least until he faced the newly buffed Sarah Conner in the dramatic  finale. The special effects in T2 were ground braking and the attention to  detail was flawless in every part of the movie. I have never met anyone who  didn't walk out of the cinema after T2 with a look of stunned awe on their  face.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as the cold-blooded Terminator is this, the template for all science fiction action movies since.  Though the FX weren't exactly innovative even in 1984, they're good enough to make the futuristic sets and high-octane action scenes more than believable.  But James Cameron's story of heartless cyborg murderers and an expendable humanity isn't built on FX pyrotechnics anyway, and that's why in many ways it compares favorably to its generally bigger and better sequel, Judgment Day.  Cameron and co-scripter/producer Gale Anne Hurd created a story around a skeleton of realistic characters and some clever twists on the traditional time travel plot, which Cameron himself then molded into a masterpiece of cinematic suspense.  Highlights include:  a peak ahead to an apocalyptic future where humans live like rats and cybernetic assassins stalk the earth; a sensitive love scene between the mother-to-be of mankind's eventual savior and her protector; much clever dialogue ("Come with me if you want to live," "I'll be back," etc.), and a closing shot that turns the traditional riding off into the sunset ending on its head as the female lead drives off down an uncertain road beneath hovering thunderclouds that are harbingers of the nuclear storm to come.  Odds are if you're interested enough to be reading this review, you've probably seen it already--hasn't everybody?  But if somehow you've managed to escape The Terminator this long, don't worry:  HE NEVER STOPS.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>I dont know about the BD version but herd enough complaints to buy this DVD version.

Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. As I write this, there's a fourth Terminator just out on the silver screen.<br /><br />In retrospect, what makes this "Terminator" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the next two Terminator movies.<br /><br />Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the "good guys." The now famous phrase by Arnold, "I'll be back." comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.<br /><br />Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.<br /><br />I've been debating about buying the Blu-Ray but have held off because of conflicting reviews on it, most of them being negative about the transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. The difference here is that you almost begin to empathize with Brynner's obsession as if perhaps he wanted to have been created as a human being and not a robot.  Brynner does have his catharsis. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator has less aspirations and has only a singular purpose in this film. Schwarzenegger's performance is not exactly endearing but he does come across with a certain amount of misplaced aplomb, which adds to his absurdity and fascinating screen presence.

With T3 coming out, here's a review of that original movie.<p>First, you have to remember that in 1984 when this first came out, the whole gritty future-view a la Blade Runner (1982) was just taking hold. Along comes Terminator which melds that future-is-bleak theme with modern day action, and throw a muscle-man and tender-turned-tough woman into the mix. <p>I am a HUGE fan of this movie for many, many reasons. You have Linda Hamilton as a normal, every day woman who resists what is going on - and in the end finds her strength to go on. That transformation is just amazing. You have the love story between her and the 'normal man' who is sent back in time to try to defend her. And of course you have the 'machine' - Arnold - who single-mindedly works to track her down and destroy her.<p>There are just so many touches in the movie that show the care that James Cameron put into the film, making it truly the 'baby' of him, Arnold and Linda. This isn't your average action movie where the high bodycount and infinite ammo are key. It is a movie with a lot of thought, with well laid out backgrounds and the time changes between the &quot;current future&quot; of 2029 and the &quot;current present&quot; of 1984 show great connections.<p>Linda Hamilton in this was always a huge role model to me and many of my friends. She wasn't special. She didn't have ninja training or robotic eyeballs. But she saw what had to be done, and she gathered her strength and did it. <p>A great movie in its own right, and a must-see for anyone interested in T3!</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Tripping, dude in real life is pumping iron and winning Mr. Universe awards, beating out that Ferrigno guy that played the Hulk.

No, he was not but Linda Hamilton rox yo world as Sara Connor, now you can spell that Sarah Conner or Sara Connor or whatever, I don't care.  What I do care about is that this film really opens the eyes to a bad dude.  This dude has red eyes and he gave a whole new attitude in 1984 when he had one ripped out, shrugged and simply donned some blades.  Yeah black leather jackets as well.  Oh man and then he just starts ripping up this police station!<br /><br />Well c'mon, not very realistic.  Sure you can have cyborgs come here and do stuff, they do all the time but usually they are just in Vegas playing the odds while on a stopover from Venus.  Okay the worst part is this...a waitress from Los Angeles suddenly becomes the cops main concern?  Yeah right that did not happen in the whole O.J. deal now did it?  Real life this lady would not have made it and by the time the cops even had gotten hot on the trail, the Terminator would have been jumping around time warps so much his head would be spinning!<br /><br />Classic Sci-Fi starring Arnie, who is now a Guv-nah but still pumps iron.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>OK, I had my suspicions after seeing Conan The Barbarian, but this movie proves it beyond any shadow of doubt. Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cyborg! I watched him come through time and space, hunting down that poor Connor girl (Linda Hamilton) in 1984 LA, and I just knew! His relentless pursuit of Sarah Connor is devoid of any / all emotion! Watching him is like watching any well-oiled machine. His robotic moves are matched only by his mechanical dialogue. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) comes through the same time portal, in an attempt to stop the rampaging mechanoid, but can flesh and blood possibly stand against such a machine as Arny?? No! Run Reese! Run Sarah! Our very future depends on your survival! THE TERMINATOR substantiates my deepest fears! We are doomed! The infamous &quot;police station slaughter scene&quot; shows us Mr. Schwarzenegger as the juggernaut he is! Unstoppable, concerned with nothing but the termination of mankind! He is now governor of California! Soon, SkyNet will be established and Arnold will become our king! EEK! James Cameron's intense masterwork of sci-fi / horror is perfect for Arnold's plan of world domination! Watch it and believe...</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Saw this 1984 film on Netflix.  I had never seen it before.  Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cyborg from the future who is not human.  His mission is to kill a young woman (Linda Hamilton) because these creatures are going to take over the world but the son she will bear in the future will foil their plans.  However, Michael Biehn, who also comes from the future but is human is out to stop all this and save the world.<br /><br />What follows are a lot of chase scenes, guns, explosions and other predictable special effects that were available to 1984 audiences.  This fight doesn't seem fair at first because the cyborg is not human and can grow new body parts when necessary.  However there is no doubt how it will all turn out.<br /><br />The plot is simple, actually too simple for me.  Once I figured it out I fell asleep and awoke just once in a while to the sound of explosions.  I guess I'm just not into this kind of film.  But I'm glad I tried to watch it just to check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>The movie is classic, not the best movie of all time but well worth watching,<br /><br />while the Bluray is not the best looking of all time either, but considering how old the movie is I think it looks great.

Now that Home Theatre is more common many early released movies are being re-released with many enhancements &amp; extras.<br />This movie definitely set Arnold Schwarzenegger to the super star level. Under the direction of James Cameron (Titanic) this scfi thriller has Schwarzenegger cast as the ultimate bad guy in the futuristic bombed out Los Angeles (2024 AD and 1984 AD). A complex plot with lots of action &amp; special effects that we expect from a Schwarzenegger movie!<br />Brief movie summary - 2024 AD LA is ruled by Robots &amp; Arnold plays a Killer Android sent from the future to &quot;TERMINATE&quot; a woman who will bear a future &quot;PATRIOT LEADER&quot;. In turn the &quot;Patriots&quot; send a human warrior to safe guard this woman from the Killer Droid. This makes for a real interesting twist of fate for the woman.<br />This DVD is All new Master from a HI-DEFINTION TRANSFER / Enhanced for WIDESCREEN 16:9 / NEW 5.1 Stereo Remix.

The original Terminator helped in definining the sci-fi action movie industry and is, in my opinion and many other people's opinion, one of the all time best sci-fi movies of all time.  I had previously already upgraded Terminator 2 to Blu-Ray, but I figured it was time to also do the same with the original Terminator, because it's no less deserving of that in my opinion.  Just like Alien 1 & 2, so is Terminator 1 and 2 as far as classic awesomeness.  I recently encountered this addition of Terminator on Blu-Ray and decided that I simply had to have this edition of it, and now I do.  Many of the younger generation of nerds/geeks out there I've ever talked to are not familiar with these films, and I made sure to let them know that they needed to look into them.  Sure, they're a bit older and the special effects are decidedly not the most amazing, but they're still awesome films that every sci-fi & action lover should watch, so if you're reading this and you have never seen the Terminator films, or even the Alien films for that matter, get on it!</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>The original terminator would not say is the greatest sci-fi movie ever but nonetheless a decent introduction to the franchise.  It is pretty interesting and the sci-fi effects are good but of course nothing like T-2.  I know that the sci-fi movie business was just getting going in the mid 80's so I am not criticizing the movie on behalf of that.  If your a fan of the terminator movies and have not seen it be sure to do so but otherwise look towards T-2, or T-3 for a more impressive sci-fi viewing experience.<br /><br />Peter J.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator Micheal Biehn plays Kyle Reese a soldier from 2029 he's the Ultimate protector Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Connor. So in the Year 2029 machines are the ruling class and they want to wipe out the rest of the human race and the leader is John Connor. Skynet the super computer that runs the machines send there newest invention back to 1984 to kill his mother Sarah Connor this invention a Terminator a metal endoskelon over artificial skin but looks entirely human. Kyle Reese volunteers to go after the Terminator. The story progresses well I really wish they would have kept the scene where Reese breaks down and when it show the Cyberdyne Systems sign in the ending. This movie is about survival and Sarah Connor & Reese falling in love & becoming almost disturbed as Reese & a killing machines  that kills anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>One of the best movies ever made, this has everything.

But a cyborg has also been sent back to kill the woman to prevent mankind from defeating the machines.  This is a perfect role for Arnold.  Cold emotionless and intimidating.

I really wish these companies that release Blu-Ray would stick to the REASONS WHY we would upgrade our movie collections from DVD to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This release of "The Terminator" onto Blu-Ray is a waste of everybody's money if your intention is the same as mine as to get a High-Definition improvement of our favorite movies.  If it can not be made to look any better than the DVD, please don't release the Blu-Ray version of the same mediocre quality.  However, I know with today's quality enhancement skills being applied to many films, this movie could have been greatly improved for a pleasing High-Definition improved picture and sound.  We know it takes a pain-staking frame-by-frame articulate effort to improve video quality but it CAN be done.  It has been done by many movie companies already.  And only then, should our movies be converted to Blu-Ray so that it JUSTIFIES why we would want to buy the movie again.  Jeez, is that too unrealistic of an expectation?<br /><br />Here are some words of deception used as well as some vague statements to explain what you're getting with this Blu-Ray release of "The Terminator":<br /><br />On the front (bottom), it says: EXPERIENCE HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />The deception here is that this statement DOES NOT apply to this Blu-Ray disc.<br /><br />And on the top of the back it says: BLU-RAY DISC TAKES YOU BEYOND HIGH DEFINITION<br /><br />Again, that statement is not supported by this movie's un-enhanced transfer to Blu-Ray.  Shame on you, Sony!<br /><br />Then, there is this rather vague disclaimer that I guess we should start to look for before we waste our money buying the Blu-Ray to replace our DVD:<br /><br />Near the top on the back it says:<br /><br />PURE (meaning unchanged and unaltered) PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY. TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE MASTER<br /><br />Well, there you have what best explains that NO EFFORT has been made to improve this movie for transfer to Blu-Ray.  You're going to get the same un-improved video transfer as that of your DVD, and this Blu-Ray disc gives you less extras than the DVD.  And why is that?  So that, some day soon, they may actually apply that pain-staking, frame-by-frame, articulate effort to improve the video quality, and then put in all those currently existing extras that your DVD already has, so that they can sell the Blu-Ray version of this movie AGAIN.  Why else, would they leave out all those already existing extras?  It's a pre-calculated rip-off! It's a recognized release pattern that we've seen for years, and they still do it.  I believe George Lucas is the master of this corrupted "bilk-the-consumer" re-release then re-sell, style of profiting.  Sell it at a bare minimum for quality and content.  Then, improve on it, and then sell it again.<br /><br />So, I hope this will be a lesson to us all.  And I've learned this with several Blu-Ray releases as well.  Just because it's been transferred to Blu-Ray, DOES NOT mean that it's going to look any better than your currently owned DVD.<br /><br />So, buyer beware!  If possible, RENT IT FIRST!  So, you can compare it to your DVD.  That would save you money in the long run, don't you think?</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>The movie, well, it's still great. This commentary is strictly on the BluRay version.<br /><br />Extras: Minimal<br /><br />Video Quality: Terrible. It looks like an old, damaged, partially burned film was used as the master. There are scratches, black marks - even jitters. More like a drive-in movie that was played 100 times too many. All that was redone was some of the text. The classic scene when Arnold stands up - in the left portion of the screen is this dancing black burn/scrape the size of a large rat moving up and down the screen.  When Kyle lands in the alley, it looks like there are coffee grounds on the lens.  It's that bad - seriously.  The only part (and I do mean part) that anyone took time on was Arnold's front nude scene when he walked towards the punks, seeking clothing. You clearly see said "part" dangling and bobbing. Nuf' said.<br /><br />The opening menu reminded me of some cheesy fan website. The button audio was 10x louder than the background audio. Each time I arrowed up or down, I thought I'd blow a speaker. Even the rendering was poor - too few frames, so it's jittery.  I picture someone at the studio yelling "Hey, I need an intern to learn BluRay mastering - here's some software, a video camera, some film and the keys to the screening room. Do me proud."<br /><br />DVD quality: Well, the menu froze several times for around two seconds. The opening titles froze for a second.  The movie froze several times for a second or two.  I have a new, version 2 BluRay player and around 20 BluRay movies. This is the ONLY one this has happened on. This is a minimal quality, no frills (not even a one page insert), low-budget production.  To be honest, I think my DVD version is better (except for the audio.)<br /><br />Audio: Phenomenal. True 5.1 - the rumbles shake the rafters, gunfire and plasma rifle lovers can rejoice.  Arnold's stoic accent thunders.<br /><br />Skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I should have known that when a blu-ray disc was selling for under $10 that something was wrong. Sure enough, the picture quality is pretty much the same as a regular DVD. The fact that it's selling for such a low price probably means that somebody is wising up and will soon issue a better quality blu-ray version. My advice is to pass up on this offer and instead wait for the definitive treatment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>"The Terminator" directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought-provoking motion picture of the 1980's. What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie. Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves. Shame on them!</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>Well I doubt I need to paraphrase the plot, so I won't.  But what i will do is discuss the DVD, which most of the time the only info I really want to know.<p>OK, first of all the picture quality is EXCELLENT.  In fact, it's so good that it looks as if it were filmed just yesterday.  (Except for the occasional Gremlin you see in the film, LOL!)  But anyway, the DVD case states that it was transfered from a HD master and it shows.<p>However the new 5.1 soundtrack is not bad, but you can tell that it's all new as to everything hasn't been &quot;stereo-ized&quot;.  For example, in the police station scene where Arnold is walking through and shooting everybody he sees his guns, there are instances when the gun sounds are in stereo in one shot and then not in another while in both instances they should be as they fire to the left or right.  Also the sound is really bad during the film's numerous car chases where the most dominant sound is the music while the car sounds are barely audible and then all of a sudden you get a sound in the left or right channel when the car hits something or makes a powerslide around a corner.  But...what can you expect from a soundtrack that was originally just Monoaral.<p>One note though, since I don't have a true surround sound system, that above complaint may not be as bad as I made it out to be.  (I have a TV with simulated surround and a 2 speaker stereo that has SRS sound)<p>But as for the Bonus Features, that's where you get your money's worth.  First of all it has several deleted scenes w/ or w/o commentary, all of which are in as good as shape visually as the Feature.  Second of all it comes with 2 really great documentaries.  &quot;The Terminator: A Retrospective&quot; that was shot in '92 (a year after T2) that's OK, but not too indepth, and &quot;Other Voices&quot; that is brand new that really goes into the making of the film that mirrors in quality the documentary that's on the T2: Ultimate Edition.<p>The Menu Navigation is also very cool which sort of takes you through several &quot;Cyberdyne&quot; animations.<p>So if you're looking to complete your Terminator DVD collection as I did after already owning T2, grab this one as it's the best version we'll have for a while, or forever.<p>Oh, one more thing about the sound.  They have changed the sound of the Flying HKs.  They no longer have that strange screaming robotic sound.  They now have a jetliner sound, which may or maynot sound more realistic to you.  In fact all of the Future War sequences have been totally revamped sonically.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>As we all know, this is the film that cemented Schwarzenegger's spot in the action-brawn firmament, and it was well deserved. He's chilling as the futuristic cyborg who kills without fear, without love, without mercy. James Cameron's story and direction are pared to the bone and all the more creepy. The Terminator robots are pretty cool looking, and the fact that this film causes you to think. Yes there are alot of explosions and a sex scene, but this film doesn't insult your intelligence. If you're going to buy this, get the MUCH BETTER sequel Terminator II: Judgement Day.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>James Cameron showed the world his modus operandi for the first time in this spectacular sci fi action- fest starring Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In his first major action role as the lethal machine, who is aptly described by Michael Biehn's charcter Reese: "It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!" Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.<br />The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way. Stan Winston's animatronics used to create the Terminator are brilliant and the CG is "Whoa" material. Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well! This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made. The DVD extras are excellent too, with commentaries, 'making of's, "terminated" deleted scenes, trailers that fully capture the menace of the machine and the nerve-shredding pace of the film, production info and more.

On the second disc there are seven deleted scenes, including a fascinating foreshadowing of Sarah Connor's mission in T2, as well as trailers and TV spots. There are also two &quot;making of&quot; featurettes, one being an 18-minute piece from1992 based around a friendly at-home chat with Cameron and Schwarzenegger (&quot;We did the first Terminator for the cost of your motor-home on the second film&quot;, jokes the director to the actor). The hour-long &quot;Other Voices&quot; featurette is an in-depth montage of cast and crew reminiscences covering all aspects of the production from its initial genesis as a fevered nightmare to the &quot;guerrilla&quot; filmmaking of getting the final shots.

THIS 1984 CLASSIC IS ABOUT AN UNSTOPPABLE KILLER CYBORG FROM THE FUTURE [ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER] WHO TRAVELS BACK TO 1984 LOS ANGELES TO KILL AN INNOCENT WOMAN NAMED SARAH CONNOR [LINDA HAMILTON], LITTLE KNOWING THAT A MAN NAMED REESE [MICHAEL BIEHN] WAS SENT TO TRY AND PROTECT HER. THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIES EVER MADE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. THERE'S EXCELLENT SPECIAL EFFECTS, EXCELLENT ACTION SEQUENCES, AND EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. THIS CLASSIC IS SOMETIMES UNDERRATED IN COMPARISON TO ITS 1991 SEQUEL ''TERMINATOR 2; JUDGMENT DAY''. ALTHOUGH THIS MOVIE MAY NOT BE NOWHERE NEAR AS HIGH TECH AS TERMINATOR 2 OR 3, THIS IS EASILY THE BEST OF THE 3. ONE HAS TO WONDER, WHY COULDN'T MICHAEL BIEHN GET ANYMORE HIGH PROFILE ROLES? HE DID SO GREAT IN THIS MOVIE. I ALMOST WISH HIS CHARACTER RETURNED FOR T2. IN MY BOOK, THIS IS A DEFINITE 5-STAR CLASSIC, THE SUCCESS OF THIS MOVIE INSPIRED MANY CLONES AND IMITATIONS, BUT NONE OF THEM EVEN COME CLOSE TO TOPPING THIS FANTASTIC MOVIE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS FILM TO ANY ACTION OR SCI-FI MOVIE BUFF. THE SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE ORIGINAL PREVIEW TRAILERS, TV SPOTS, DELETED SCENES, AND MORE. YA JUST CAN'T HATE THIS MOVIE.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Looking back almost twenty years to James Cameron's 1984 film, &quot;The Terminator&quot; almost seems quaint.  Given the special effects that would dominated not only its two sequels but just about every other big budget action film to come down the pike, there is an almost brutal simplicity to the original offering.  Lacking the computer generated effectives, more expensive production values, and the self-reflexivity of the two sequels, &quot;The Terminator&quot; simply strikes me as being the best of the bunch.  There was a lot of creativity and thought put into &quot;Terminator II,&quot; but this one has the better story.<p>If you think back to 1984 then what we have in this movie is a combination of key elements from &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Halloween.&quot;  From the former we get the idea of a relentless killing machine that stops at nothing, while from the latter comes the fact that somebody who knows you is out to get you for reasons that you do not know and none of the tradition tools of persuasion, such as knives and automatic weaponry have any effect; like Michael Meyers this guy keeps getting back up.  &quot;The Terminator&quot; now acknowledges the work of Harlan Ellison, whose teleplays of &quot;Solider&quot; and &quot;Demon With a Glass Hand&quot; on &quot;Outer Limits&quot; are clearly antecedents for this tale, but in many ways Cameron's movie is a high-tech slasher film.  Keep in mind that his previous directorial effort was &quot;Piranha Part Two: The Spawning,&quot; and from this film he moved on to &quot;Aliens.&quot;  It was not really until &quot;The Abyss&quot; that Cameron's films started evidencing a sense of the truly poetic (then again, there is the Polaroid photograph in this one).<p>The premise is simple and direct.  Two naked guys show up in Southern California.  One of them tears a page out of the phone booth and starts killing women named Sarah Connor.  However, there is one more name and address on that list and she is the true target of what is happening.  By now both of the naked men are dressed and the other one saves her from the killing machine, at which point she finds out it really is a killing machine.  Not only that, it has been sent back from the future for the sole purpose of making sure she ends up dead.  Furthermore, it turns out the stakes are a whole lot higher than that as well.<p>Much is made about the title character being played by the (almost) current governor of California, and while this was certainly a breakthrough performance for Arnold Schwarzenegger (at least for those who never saw &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;), the story is still the more important element.  Cameron knows how to have exposition double up for explanation, especially when yelled by a character during a car chase, and that most of his audience are not hard-core hard-science science-fiction fans who enjoy a good time travel paradox narrative, whatever the problems in logic and physics.  <p>As Cameron would prove again in &quot;Aliens,&quot; he knows how to push down on the pedal and pour on things at the end to give us the thrill of several &quot;what next?&quot; moments.  Also, he maintains the Dionysian sense of gloom until the end of the film.  In fact, that is true of the entire trilogy, which has ended the series without every providing a moment when the lead character and the rest of us can believe that things are going to be okay.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>I'd forgotten that this film was a bit scary.  A slightly different tack than different films in the series.<p>Some interesting extras and making of films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>I said a couple weeks ago on this site that I considered "Terminator 3" arguably the best of the series, but having just watched this one again after buying it on DVD I have to rethink my position.  In the few years since I last watched this movie, I had forgotten how dark and disconcerting it managed to be without any uber-expensive special effects.  Since it didn't have anywhere near the budget of its sequels, the original "Terminator" had to rely on some old-fashioned devices like detail, atmosphere, and characterization.  The second and third installments were certainly solid efforts, but they seem almost sterile in comparison.  This is easily the rawest "Terminator" movie, and all the better for it.  <p>While the screenplay is a model of tightness and efficiency, it's James Cameron's grim vision and stark direction that steal the show.  Nuclear-age paranoia has been a staple of filmmaking at least since "Dr. Strangelove," but the image of the future depicted here is even more unflinching than most.  The L.A. of the 1980's is made to look pretty dark and desolate, but the post-apocalyptic dystopia of 2029 is much worse.  It's a cold, mechanized world, with laser-firing machines roaming around and human skulls littering the landscape in a very nice touch.  And in 1984, man and machine do battle with nothing less than the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.  <p>"The Terminator" is probably most notable for introducing a new entry into the pantheon of legendary movie supervillains with the role that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger into mega-star status.  As the fearless, guiltless, pitiless twenty-first century killing machine known simply as the Terminator, Schwarzenegger cuts a largely silent swath of destruction through 1984 Los Angeles, killing almost everyone unlucky enough to get in his way.  With the square-jawed Schwarzenegger striking a very imposing figure, the Terminator has become an enduring film villain precisely because it's so mechanical and unfeeling.  In one especially chilling scene, a heavily armed Arnold nonchanlantly strolls through a police station, wordlessly shooting up defenseless cops who have no idea what they're up against.  I can't help thinking that the Terminator would've made a great Nazi.  And when its skin gets burned off and it's reduced to a metal skeleton with fiery red eyes and an evil grin, the Terminator is even scarier.  <p>The movie's human characters don't fare too badly either.  If there's one area in which "The Terminator" clearly outdoes its successors, it's emotional depth.  Arnold may be the picture of cool detachment, but the unfairly neglected Michael Biehn (who managed to carve out a decent career himself) turns the future soldier Reese into a tortured soul worthy of Shakespeare.  Everything this guy says and does is intense, fuelled by the horrors that he's experienced and that he knows are coming.  And over the course of the movie Linda Hamilton turns the hapless Sarah Connor into a genuine tough chick, a role that would be taken to its logical conclusion in "Terminator 2."<p>Since this movie the "Terminator" franchise has taken on a life of its own, with Arnold playing no less than three different cyborgs in increasingly expensive epics.  The original still hits the hardest though, precisely because it relies more on writing and direction than the special-effects blockbusters of today (this certainly doesn't just apply to the "Terminator" movies either).  Not to mention, this movie introduced the line "I'll be back" to the national dialogue, for which we should all be eternally grateful.  In this writer's humble opinion, the "Terminator" series decks it out with "Lord Of The Rings" for the title of THE movie trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>This is the film that cemented director James Cameron as a visionary director, and also cemented Arnold Schwarzenegger as a premier action superstar.  Schwarzenegger is chillingly perfect as the heartless, soulless cyborg killer sent back to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will unknowingly in the future give birth to a son named John who will become leader of a human resistance in a distant future war with cyborgs called Terminators.  Michael Biehn plays a soldier sent back in time as well to protect Sarah and stop the Terminator from fulfilling his mission.  Imaginitive special effects and makeup are abound, and the film is action packed from beginning to end, and all the actors give superb performances, but this is mainly Arnold's show, and like I said before he is chillingly perfect.  A little side note: Arnold was originally supposed to play the soldier sent to protect Sarah, and Lance Henriksen (who plays a cop) was supposed to be the Terminator, but Arnold expressed to Cameron that he would do better as the Terminator, and he was dead on the money.  Look for Bill Paxton as a punk in the beginning of the movie, he has an unfortunate run in with good 'ol Arnold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>With the possible exception of Linda Hamilton's hair, this movie has aged well, and stands up under scrutiny today -- a remarkable achievement.  Part thriller, part romance, part time travel paradox, The Terminator was a blast when it first came out and is just as much fun to watch now.<p>This DVD edition is terrific.  You can listen or watch subtitles in English, French or Spanish.  Special features include: trailers -- two from television, two for US theaters and one for foreign theaters; two documentaries -- an 18 minute retrospective with James Cameron (JC) and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the new one-hour "Other Voices" featuring cast and crew recollections; 5 deleted scenes and 2 deleted arcs, with JC commentary; a treatment, the fourth draft and the final draft of the script; and a photo gallery of JC's artwork, production stills, Stan Winston effects, special effects, and publicity materials.  There is a lot to see here and it is all interesting.  There are some fascinating revelations here -- for instance, originally conceiving of The Terminator as an everyman who could be inconspicuous anywhere, Arnold was originally interviewed for the part of Kyle Reese and OJ Simpson was being considered for The Terminator!  Yikes.<p>Lovely package.<p>Note to Macintosh users:  Normally I would grade down for having material that is inaccessible to Mac users, but those items are made available here as html files -- if not an entirely satisfactory solution, at least an effort was made.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>I got hundreds of 'em.  VHS tapes, collected over the years when VHS was cool.  I was digging through them the other day and, to my delight and surprise, rediscovered THE TERMINATOR, a great action thriller that put director James Cameron and &quot;Ahnold&quot; on the superstar map.  <p>Schwarzenegger is absolutely perfect as an unemotional cyborg that travels back in time to 1984 to &quot;terminate&quot; a young woman (Linda Hamilton) destined to give birth to a man who ultimately will lead humans against the machines of the 21st Century.  Arnold brings his &quot;A&quot; game to this role, effectively portraying a brutal, stoic, ruthless killing machine that will stop at nothing to achieve its mission.  Hamilton as the constantly running victim is very good at screaming and looking terrified, while Michael Biehn is solid as her futuristic &quot;protector.&quot;<p>As entertaining as this movie is, the special effects are dated and quite laughable by today's standards.  Equally as laughable are the hairstyles, including a brief appearance by a spike-haired Bill Paxton.  Yet the flaws are overcome by the action and nonstop thrills, as Cameron showed the world he is a filmmaker to be reckoned with.  And I reckon I'm darn glad to have THE TERMINATOR in my video collection.<br />--D.

With its dark vision, extraordinarily well laid out plot and "Arny" starring as the bad guy, this film was destined to succeed.  Not only was there an outstanding script, written and directed by James Cameron, but those starring in the film made it the success that it is and only to be matched by its sequel.<p>The Terminator is James Cameron's first film and arguably the best film of his career.  While "Conan the Barbarian" put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map, The Terminator put him in the dead center of the map and launched him on a streak of highly successful action movies.  It was extremely interesting to watch a couple of the Special Features and find out that James Cameron and crew were basically putting this outstanding sci-fi classic together on a shoestring budget!<p>The great thing about Arny in this movie is that he didn't even have to say much, he just had to be cool and it worked perfectly for him.  Linda Hamilton performs admirably as we see her character go through the change from the shy and sheltered young woman to the somewhat hardened heroine by the end of the film.  Michael Biehn's performance as the sacrificial hero of the film is perfect!  Along with the outstanding leading cast, look at the secondary characters, to name just a couple, Lance Henriksen and Paul Winfield.  Even one of James Cameron's favorites, Bill Paxton has a small role in this extraordinary film.<p>The more interesting aspect of this film when put in the light of the first two films and the third one that's in the theaters now is from a story standpoint where this first film is just the first paradox of the many that come about throughout the films, raising several "what ifs" about the "whole" story!<p>The premise:<p>We're brought into the film brilliantly as we see The Terminator make his trip through time, showing up and not taking any "no" answers to his request for the clothes of a young punk!  We're then taken to Sergeant Kyle Reese's time jump and a consequent search for clothes as well, but he's not so lucky and is immediately set upon by the police.  Jumping forward a bit, the Terminator has made his move and Reese has stepped in to try and save Sara.  While they're running from the Terminator and the police at the same time, some of the most imaginative filming in the history of film is going on as the scenes cut to the dark future of the early twenty first century and the machines are attempting to eradicate humanity.<p>I highly recommend this outstanding science fiction classic to all who haven't seen it yet, for it is truly one of the best films in the history of the genre and well worth repeated viewings.  I've watched this film many more times than I can remember but it was certainly great to see it in the widescreen DVD format, something I haven't seen since this film was in the theaters.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Other Voices - A documentary that includes a new James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger Interview.<p>The Terminator:  A Retrospective documentary<p>Several deleted scenes with commentary<p>Theatrical trailers<p>And several other interesting special features</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>James Cameron has to be one of the finest Directors of our time.  An elite perfectionist, he is one of the few who knows how to meticulously balance a love story smack dab in the middle of a Science Fiction action movie.  The story starts in modern day 1984 (not so modern anymore) where a cyborg has been sent back in time to destroy the birth mother of the machines greatest enemy so that their nemesis cannot be created.  Thankfully the girl has a common name and lives in Los Angeles where several women exist with the same name.  Being logical, the killer intends to take them all out.  One by one the women fall victim to this `serial killer' and Sarah, played by a younger Linda Hamilton, starts to think she's next...and she's right.  Enter the man to save her life, Kyle Reece, played intensly by Michael Biehn.  He's a soldier from the future who is sent back to protect her from this unfeeling machine.  The best part about these two coming through the portal from the furture is that they come through with nothing.  So they have to rely on what is already in 1984.  This eliminates many complex elements in the story, as well as some costlier special effects.  It keeps grounded a little more.  Since the weaponry they're forced to use is less sophisticated, the Terminator is harder to  kill.  Kyle and Sarah find themselves not only running for their lives but finding something more in each other.  This movie sounds like a cheesy love story within an action movie but there is a special chemistry between the two leads and Cameron juggles them all like a professional circus performer.  Both Hamilton and Biehn's character have a dire innocence about them.  Sarah has no idea that anything she ever does could be considered so important, and being told the reason why this machine is after her makes her world seem that much smaller.  Reece has never known deep emotions of love, and the only women he has ever known are tough soldier types.  Getting to know Sarah makes him really feel what he knows was in his heart already.  <p>No one but Arnold could play the Cyborg Tank that stalks poor Linda Hamilton throughout the movie.  His unstoppablility is only outdone by his cold unfeeling exterior and deadly violent actions.  The chemistry between Biehn and Hamilton is strong and believeable.  The action scenes are intense and you always know what's going on.  I would highly recommend this film.  It set a standard for many other Sci Fi films, as well as gave birth to one of the greatest sequels of all time, Terminator 2, Judgement Day.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LSRBVD2MK3PL.html">A2LSRBVD2MK3PL</a><br/><p>It has ben nerly 16 years since &quot;The Terminator&quot; came out, and it is still a great movie. Some movies lose their shine after a few years but &quot;The Terminator&quot; has not. This was the role Arnold  Schwarzenegger was born to play, nobody could have been better. Though I do  love this movie, the DVD has no extras besides a theatrical trailer and the  transfer is only moderatly good. But you can't go wrong with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>The Terminator. Not much more needs to be said nearly 30 years after Arnold told us he'd be back. His merciless cyborg stalks and glowers his way to near perfection throughout this movie. I can't think of another truly evil character this iconic that has held our attention and filled us with dread for that long. Even Vader has some redemption in the end. The Terminator just, well...terminates people. And we love him for it. Do what I did and treat yourself to a great piece of 1980's film noir. The Blu-ray version's clarity and soundtrack is well worth every penny.</p></br></body></html>

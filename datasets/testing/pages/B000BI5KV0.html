MARCH OF PENGUINS earned well-deserved acclaim for its depiction of the plight of the Emperor Penguin, every year, as they march across Antarctica, to arrive on breeding grounds, to mate and further the species.  It is beautifully filmed and soulfully narrated by actor Morgan Freeman.  You will fall in love with the young penguins and grow very attached to the older ones, leading them to their destination.  It takes a year for this brood of birds to reach their destination.  That means enduring freezing temperatures, as well as staying clear of the advances of their predators.  You're going to want to watch this from start to finish, just to see what happens.<br /><br />This film earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Documentary, and is an engaging study in the lives of these extraordinary birds.  You'll never look at penguins the same way, I guarantee it.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I don't watch many documentaries, but the "March of the Penguins" is an amazing film and very worthwhile viewing. Filmmaker Luc Jaquet and crew spent a year in Antarctica to chronicle the "nesting" part of the Emperor Penguin's complicated life cycle. He picked up a flock of hundreds of Emperors as they arrived along the Antarctica coast and followed them inland 70-80 miles as they marched single file in their stiff, awkward, upright fashion to their winter breeding grounds. Any food they needed was carried inside them. When they arrived at their predetermined locality they laid their eggs and then protected them through the long bitter winter season. It was an amazing sight. Even more amazing was the realization that a human crew had been there filming the whole thing in the inky darkness and with temperatures that ranged down into the minus 120s.<br /><br />Evidently, the penguins didn't seem to mind the film crew and they went about the somewhat humorous antics of their strange lives in this forsaken place. Well, at least they didn't have to worry much about predators sneaking up on them. About halfway through this saga, one of each breeding pair returned to the ocean to load up on additional food. At just about the time that the winter ice sheet  began to melt, the offspring were ready and journied with their parents back to the ocean to start the life cycle over again.<br /><br />Jaquet and crew presented an amazing story. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job of narrating the film. They presented us with a window into the lives of creatures with which we would have no way of crossing paths, other than viewing them in cages at Sea World or something like that. The film is very interesting, entertaining, funny and educational all at the same time. Well done! Amazing!</p></br><a href="../users/A281NPSIMI1C2R.html">A281NPSIMI1C2R</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins brings a new understanding to the intense conditions penguins must endure to survive brutal weather in a world they feel compelled to live in. Summer brings freedom as penguins fly through underwater worlds and in the winter, they take on an amazing task of keeping their eggs safe from the frigid temperatures.<br /><br />My respect for penguins was dramatically increased as I watched them form partnerships and then take on a world of challenges. Watching this with a sense of awe may be an understatement. There is something stunning about the commitment the penguin parents enter into in order to bring new life into the world. The male and female penguins play an equal role in the parenting process and their dedication is beyond impressive. For the most part, this documentary focuses on surviving the winter, but the scenes of the baby penguins are well worth waiting for.<br /><br />The way this is filmed, you truly gain a sense of the emotions of the penguins and you can almost see the sheer wonder of the parenting experience in the eyes of the parents. What I loved most was the way the little penguins sing to the parents and how they communicate with their friends. The sadness of the penguins who don't manage to keep their eggs safe is tangible. As they return to the sea, you can't help but feel their loss.<br /><br />Overall, you have to go into this with realistic expectations because this is about the reality of survival. March of the Penguins presents this reality, yet it also presents an emotional dimension that will give you a renewed respect for penguins. The leopard seal in this movie reminded me of the one in 8 Below (which I felt was initially more upsetting than this movie) and they are truly terrifying. This movie does seem to have been created with an adult audience in mind, so you may want to preview this before showing it to your children.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins may not be chronicalling the lives of an endangered species, but it certainly brings to the forefront the reality of just how delicate life is and how difficult it can be as well.<br /><br />It is hard to watch this film and not feel a tug at your heart as you see the imprinted dedication that these birds have to reproduction and survival of the fittest.<br /><br />In a way, this is a film about mankind too - or at least how we have strayed from what is truly important in life.<br /><br />These birds live in the harshest climate in the world. Some "march" over 70 miles each way to a safe mating ground. Some never return, due to starvation, exhaustion, age, or predators. Others make the journey only to be rebuffed by potential mates or, in a sorrowful scene, lose their baby either as an egg or infant. Regardless, these beautiful birds live with a single determination to propagate their kind - to live for the next generation. It is something that we, as humans, seem to have lost interest in as we become more and more concerned with our own personal achievements to the detriment of our children.<br /><br />I was profoundly touched by the apparent agony that the male and female birds feel when they lose their offspring. I was further touched with the dedication that the male birds have to babysitting the egg and the hatchlings as they wait - going without food for up to four or five months - for their mate to return from feeding.<br /><br />March of the Penguins is definitely family friendly. However, one of the bonus tracks may not be. It more completely shows the horrors that these birds encounter each day and what the real death tolls are as the penguins wrestle with the elements, each other, and predators. When you see the dead birds/eggs littering the mating/hatching ground it is painful. Watching an abandoned or orphan hatchling freeze to death is painful. Be careful that your children don't see this bonus track at too young an age - though its reality should be a wake up call to many pre-teen kids so they can become aquainted with the reality of death.<br /><br />Brilliant and difficult filmmaking make this film very worthy of watching/purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I applaud the brave souls who endured the rages of Antarctica's cold to film this fantastic footage. I know my son learned a lot, and I certainly collected a whole new perspective on Antarctica. It is certainly more than the winter wasteland many tend to visualize. The revelation of dedication to their young, and the role the male takes on to protect the offspring inside the egg, was an event I couldn't even imagine. What these creatures must go through to preserve their species has this viewer's deep appreciation. Think you have a tough life? Try being an Emperor Penguin...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>This dramatic, passionate, often humorous, sometimes tragic adventure film which portrays birth, death, survival against all odds, and if you'll forgive a bit of anthropomorphizing, love and fidelity, is at once uplifting and heartbreaking...and it's a documentary (!!), probably more compelling than most (fiction) movies I have seen in the last few years!<br /><br />The Emperor Penguins star here. They are magnificent birds which do not fly, but are outstanding swimmers. The largest and heaviest of the 17 species of penguins, their fashionable dress is classic - black head and wings, white abdomen, bluish gray, almost iridescent back, purplish pink bill. On the sides of the neck, there are two golden circular stripes. I actually think fashionistas consulted them before designing the tuxedo! Can you just see them walking down the "Red Carpet" to receive their Oscars?<br /><br />The plot sounds fairly simple - a year in the life of an Emperor Penguin colony - a full life cycle. Yet theirs is neither a simple nor easy story to live or to film.<br /><br />Their home is at the bottom of the world, the desert continent of Antarctica, (the world's largest desert), and the coldest place on Earth. Ninety-eight percent of the continent is covered by ice - a place well known for its ferocious winds and blinding storms. It is the windiest and least hospitable continent on our planet. Localized blizzards and life-threatening wind-chill temperatures are an ever-present danger.  Temperatures reach a minimum of between minus 85 and minus 90 degrees Celsius, (-121 and -130 degrees Fahrenheit), in the winter and about 30 degrees higher in the summer months. Depending on the latitude, long periods of constant darkness, or constant sunlight, mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent. I think it is important to describe the penguins' habitat, which is the film's setting and a major villain, (more anthropomorphizing), to give potential viewers a clear picture of the environment in which these birds live and thrive. The environment also makes for some breathtaking and chilling viewing.<br /><br />With great detail, the entire breeding cycle is shown, beginning with the long springtime march of the penguins from the sea to their inland breeding grounds - about 90 km. Courtship rites, the laying of the egg and the very careful transfer and protection of that 1 pound egg from female to male is just the start of this annual true life adventure. I won't write anything to spoil the rest of this almost unbelievable tale. I won't even go into how utterly adorable the baby penguins are and the lengths their parents will go to in order to protect them. Nature, and the truth, are more amazing then fiction.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's narration is splendid.<br /><br />"March of the Penguins" is quite simply, glorious. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A suggestion, Part 2, which has yet to be made, should be about the courageous French director, Luc Jacquet, a trained biologist, cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison, and their crew who traveled to the Antarctica, overcoming hardships similar to those of their subjects, to make this astounding motion picture.<br /><br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>I have long been an admirer of penguins, so when this film was released in the cinema, my friends variously and collectively rushed to inform me of the film. I went to see it, and was amazed.<br /><br />The plot of the film is extraordinarily simple - the film follows the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica during their annual mating and rearing cycle. It is framed from start to finish in terms of the march - the march from the sea to the mating spot, the march to return to the sea for food, the march again for rearing the young, and the march again finally to return to the sea.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humour and grace; penguins are gentle beings, vulnerable to predators and to the hazards of the winter - despite being fashioned for some of the coldest climates on earth, they nonetheless require warmth, particularly for their eggs and the hatchlings. In the severe cold and far-below-zero windchills, many do not make it, and the one negative side of the film for me was a somewhat constant lingering on this downside. While it is a part of nature, it still becomes a bit more tragic in the cycle of the film than it needs to be. As this is billed as a family film, I worried that some of the children viewing might be more emotionally upset at this than they needed to be.<br /><br />Still, the details presented are fascinating, and it is a true testament to filmmaking that these shots and images were captured as dramatically, humourously, gracefully and beautifully as they were.<br /><br />This film has 'Academy Award' written all over it, in many categories. Cinematography, musical score, directing, documentary - these are only some of the categories in which this film is likely to get a nod. Morgan Freeman never appears on camera, but gives a wonderful reading as the narrator of this visual feast, adding subtle emphasis that never detracts and often adds to the tale in the English-language version of this film.<br /><br />Director Luc Jacquet and cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have produced a masterpiece that transcends language barriers (indeed, there is no native human language for Antarctica). A French team, they have translated this film into many languages around the world, as people everywhere will find something with which they can relate.<br /><br />Perhaps the most skillful part of the filming was to make Antarctica seem so varied in texture and place; on a continent covered with ice and snow, one still gets the sense of the length of the journey, the beauty inherent in the surroundings, and the dangers involved for the penguins.<br /><br />Through the credits, one gets to see the film crew in some light-hearted scenes with curious penguins. These are expanded upon in the DVD version, with many more scenes of penguins swimming, diving and feeding in truly remarkable filming. There is also a Warner Brothers short animation as a bonus. The audio track can be done in English or Spanish (French is also available as subtitles) - because of the nature of this film, overdubbing in different languages is in no way a detraction.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>What a film! I was truly impressed. The photography was brilliant and told the story so visually and eloquently. Truly striking filmmaking! It really touched me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's hard to figure out why there's a case of penguin mania lately. Other small-time films became big phenomenons that this penguin movie still makes you fathom how it came about. Blair Witch Project and Napolean Dynamite(a vastly overrated unfunny film personally) were films that became big successes despite the lack of major promotion. Here we have a documentary of an overlooked bird that manages to make you laugh and sad without milking it.<br /><br />Narrated by Morgan Freeman, he tells the story of the emperor penguin: a bird in Antarctica who faces many dangers and perils to find a mate and create life. First it's a big migration to the nesting grounds where they all gather and meet the females. Then it's the process of finding a mate. And then they end up creating life only winter and slight accidents could provide an egg being cracked.<br /><br />Once that's done, in nature's most ironic of ironies, it's the men that tends to the egg while the females make a long trek to anywhere where they can access the sea to get fish. Then it's the long trek back to give food for the young. Then it's the male's turn to go back and feed himself who can go without food for on average 3-4 months. Babies are born and they must protect them from incredibly brutal cold.<br /><br />There's many moments where I literally laughed, probably at the overall cutesyness of it. One shot was so funny I almost had to pause the film. After the males come back they feed the young only to end up with very fat babies. Another shot has 2 penguins trying to cram into a hole big enough for one(come on, who hasn't done that with someone with a door?)<br /><br />Also some attention must be brought to Morgan Freeman's narration. His voice has this kind of statesman-like tone where anything he says must be true cause it sounds like it, while also not being so political and narrow sounding.<br /><br />It may be one of the coldest places on Earth and there's definately moments where it looks like it but living there are sure to be creatures that'll touch you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the movie immensely. The movie shows a year in the mating cycle of adult Emperor penguins. The movie starts with the penguins jumping out of the sea and starting their 70 plus mile march to the interior where they mate and lay eggs. As the director states in his commentary, one would think this would be comic, but the penguins are majestic in their way. The 70-mile trek is only the beginning of their difficulties. How the penguins survive in an Antartic winter and keep the eggs warm and then the hatchlings fed and warm is an amazing story.<br /><br />The soundtrack is good. Morgan Freeman's voice over is pertinent and not obtrusive. The scenery is magnificient. The direction has a perfect touch. The DVD extras include the director's commentary, "Of Penguins and Men;" a cartoon that is a Merry Melodies short, and a crittercam mini-documentary. All were decent. I strongly recomend the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is the surprise "hit" of 2005, and one can see why it captured the hearts of so many.  Gorgeously filmed, the movie is merely a look at the Emperor Penguins incredible mating ritual.  The loveable creatures start off on their 70 mile trek to mate, and encounter the incredible hardships of the Antarctic winter.  With narration by Morgan Freeman, the viewer witnesses the remarkable natural phenomenon in which the penguins face oppressive odds in their quest to propagate and survive.  With a sumptuous background musical score and wonderful photography, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a fascinating and entertaining documentary that should make the human race take a second look at what family values really are.  Faced with these kind of odds, I wonder if we could be so resilient and dedicated.  A delightfully engrossing entertainment for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I was not going to see this movie as I knew it would have realistic happenings of the lives of the Penquin and it certainly did.  In this movie you will see the survival in the worse conditions of the Penquin, but it is more than that.  It is the story that is proof positive that creatures, other than humans, work together, love together, mourn together and lean on each other to survive. Through this movie you will be moved with a myraid of emotions from a giggle, to deep sadness, from horror to total respect. It is a raw look at the life style of yet another one of God's creatures and one you will not soon forget.<br /><br />I watched it with my grandchildren and we laughed and cried together. In it they saw life and they saw death; they saw  the importance of committment and love  for survival, the workings of a family unit in the wild and most important that creatures are not just dumb animals. Exceptional and well worth your viewing time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>Excellent!!  That is what I would call this masterpiece...first of all, I am not the documentary type...but this one I had to watch because of all the hype that it was getting!!  And thank GOD that this movie lived up to its hype. Beautifully done, with poise and confidence of all involved in this picture.  Very informative in the life of a penguin.  These little guys and gals go through pure hell during the winter months!! I must warn parents that although this is a G rated movie, there are some death scenes of baby penguins and adult penguins alike.  If your child is sensitive to this kind of material, the best thing that you can do is talk to them about it.  Very National Geographic esq. But fun, interesting, informative, and just a really cool movie...ENJOY!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I am still in awe after watching this 80 minute documentary a couple of months ago!! The cinematography is INCREDIBLE. I'm still wondering how the cinematographers were able to capture all the footage they did of the Emperor Penguins, especially the underwater scenes with the Emperor Penguins searching for food!<br /><br />If you love both documentaries and animals, then this is a must see film! This is a great family film and can be watched by all age groups! Morgan Freeman narrates and does a fine job of it. The script for the documentary is really informative about how thousands of Emperor Penguins make their annual journey to their breeding grounds in Antarctica. Each winter the single file, 70 mile journey begins, where by the Emperor Penguins travel through  extreme climate and frigid temperatures just to find a mate, lay and care for one precious egg and raise the young penguin to fend for itself. It is an unbelieveable journey not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>So many people begged me to see this movie because I am such an animal lover (all animals, all types, birds too), and I resisted because I had heard that it was "sad." Finally, I got the DVD, and it is everything I had heard, but it is upsetting as well.<br /><br />The photography is truly breathtaking. The intimate shots of the parent birds sheltering their chicks beneath their stomachs was both fascinating and awe-inspiring, in fact the entire feat of making such a movie in such a climate is awe-inspiring. I cannot praise the artisans who created this movie enough.<br /><br />However, nature is cruel. And even though I know it is in nature's design to cull the weakest from the flock, and even though I know that it is a natural process, it was very hard for me to watch baby penguin chicks tackled by a predator and freezing or starving to death...and equally horrible for me to see a full-grown female who left a chick behind eaten by a sea lion. If I were watching a sea lion movie, I would have understood it had to eat...it's not like I am ignorant, but it truly upset me. What can I say.<br /><br />That having been said, I also question whether this movie is really appropriate for very young children. It would have deeply disturbed my own children at a certain age, and myself as well. I know the fashion is to expose today's children to everything...and I wonder if that is such a good idea.<br /><br />Brilliant watching for adults and older children, but don't expect a fairy tale. This is real, brutal life.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>I chose to see "March of the Penguins" as a diversion to a 100+ degree day, and saw that cold weather is worse than hot weather. Now, in the brisk part of autumn, it still holds up.<br /><br />Penguins from several areas of Antarctica converge on land, safe from predators and the ebbing ice shelf. They are there to mate, birth, and care for their chick.<br /><br />Monogamous for that year, penguins pair up and the mother lays an egg.<br /><br />The mother dashes off back to the sea, which, thanks to the winter and new ice, is as far as 70 miles. She's starving, having lost one-third of her weight in laying the egg. The trip is long, and she's not fast. Hungry seals await them, some penguins lose their way, and some are too exhausted to continue.<br /><br />Well-fed, full of food for her chick, she returns, and the father makes the same trip so he can eat. The father stayed behind to incubate the egg, and protect the new chick. He has lost one half of his weight.<br /><br />The pair trade places a few more times as winter plods on. With temperatures 80 below zero, and winds up to 125, I felt cold just watching. The penguins huddle to keep warm, rotating which must do outside duty.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates. His voice does not overcome the story. Better written than any documentary I have ever seen, Freeman respects the script. Having never seen a documentary in a theater before, I was impressed at how well it worked on the big screen.<br /><br />There is no plot, even though there is a beginning and an end. Unlike many documentaries, it does not detail the intricacies of eating, mate choosing, or science of penguin living. It is more about watching the arduous life cycle, with some explaining what we are watching.<br /><br />The camera works captures the cold -- the shivering penguins, the snow blowing like dust over the long line of marching penguins. It reminded me of movies about Siberia, showing Soviets living in a frozen, cold natural prison.<br /><br />This isn't a cute animal movie. Tender children might be saddened to see the eggs and chicks freezing, and could be quite frightened when the vicious seals overtake swimming penguins.<br /><br />I fully recommend "March of the Penguins."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This documentary showing what a group of penguins goes through on a yearly basis in Antarctica is almost too unbelievable to express in words. To use the clich&eacute;, you have to see this to believe it.<br /><br />When I saw it, I remember almost being stunned afterward at what I had just seen, and then thinking about it for a few days afterward, which is not something I usually do. It was just a haunting, unbelievable story....and 100 percent true, not one of these "based on a true story" fiascoes.<br /><br />The hardships that these flightless birds endure to keep their species going is almost impossible to believe. I have yet to hear a friend say anything less about this than I just said: all of them were amazed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>First of all, everything positive that you have heard or read about "March of the Penguins" is true.  This is a masterfully filmed picture with incredible nature scenes and a compelling narration by Morgan Freeman.  I admit that I felt a twinge of guilt by watching the Freeman-narrated version.  I felt that I owed it to the French production company to see their version with English subtitles.  However, this was the first version that I was able to view.  Nature can be very challenging and we see the depth of such challenges in "March of the Penguins".  I won't elaborate on the extent of those challenges because I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Let me just state that I was emotionally involved in this movie from the start to the finish and I make no appologies for that.<br /><br />I read an excellent review of this movie by a person who questioned our humanization of instinctive, non-emotional, non-judgemental roles played by "dumb" animals.  That reminded me of the opposite reaction to a book/movie "Chariots of the Gods?" which suggested that the more primative societies of pre-Columbia America (and other ancient civilizations) were too "dumb" to have created the things they left behind.  Thus aliens from outer space HAD to have created these archaeological wonders.  Why not just marvel at what an amazing world we live in.  For those who see in it God's incomprehensible miracle, so be it.  For those who want to see an extreme example of natural "love", so be it.  For those who just want a chance to see such a marvelous view of a world they'll never see in person, so be it.  Whatever you get out of "March of the Penguins" can only be positive.<br /><br />It's not often that a film is made that qualifies as a "5 Star" movie for ALL generations.  When it is, the name Disney, Spielberg, or National Geographic is usually connected to it.  This is a MUST SEE movie for everyone so don't get left out.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Not only is "Penguins" visually arresting (as you'd expect from a National Geographic production), it is emotionally involving, transcending its genre to become a family-friendly crowd-pleaser with nary an explosion or special effect in sight. Ubiquitous as his strong, comforting voice is, Morgan Freeman still makes the ideal narrator to convey this unexpectedly moving tale. Recommended as superb family viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>I love it and my kids love it. Cute penguins always get the kids. With an incredible background voice by Morgan Freeman this amazing documentary holds your attention throughout as you watch the Emperor Penguins in their annual march of survival in one of the most remote spots on Earth. Fascinating camera work.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>This film goes far beyond being a documentary about the mating behavior of emperor penguins. I have never seen anything that captures the cruel magnificence of the Antarctic landscape like this film. The bravery of these creatures and their faithfulness to the ritual of reproduction puts all small human problems in perspective. To walk 70 miles on solid ice, to starve yourself and risk death to produce one fragile egg . . . unbelievable. Life and death -- the beauty of the life cycle -- no room for mistakes, which mean certain death. When you finish this film you feel as if you have touched briefly the divine. Everyone should see this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>This film is simply remarkable. The camera crews who braved sub-zero temperatures, gale-force winds, dangerous oceanic storms and months away from home have given the world an enduring visual wonder. View March of the Penguins and you will behold absolutely lovely scenes of star-dappled black velvet skies free of lights or pollution, vast blue-white sheets of primeval ice, twisting helices of aurora australis, crystal-clear ocean waters, and above all, it will show you the hard life endured by penguins, who not only survive but prosper in the most forbidding location on planet earth. See this classic documentary and you'll watch as these gentle birds trek scores of miles in Sisyphean fashion on their annual migrations; you'll witness them dive nearly a quarter-mile below vast ice sheets, and evade shark-like leopard seals in order to feed; and as they devote themselves with such tenderness to the care and raising of their vulnerable young, I guarantee you'll feel that there is something uniquely special in these plodding, flightless creatures. These are all sights we humans would never otherwise get to see were it not for the labor of a select few who took great risks to bring the fantastic footage to us. While the very young among viewers might find the pace of March of the Penguins a little slow-moving, most who see us should be awe-struck, impressed, and informed by this cinematic marvel. Easily five stars, and most definitely worth owning so you can see it more than once!</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>It just goes to show how some of our preconceived notions of anything can be totally wrong.<br /><br />Before seeing this movie, I thought penguins lived a life of goofy fun jumping off the ice into the water and out of the water back onto the ice.  Watching them waddle around on land was great slapstick comedy.<br /><br />Well, perhaps the reason why that's all I ever thought of penguins was because that's all the footage there was.  Nobody up until now wanted to live with them for an extended period of time to see and record the harsh realities of penguin life.  After all, it took a lot of work and sacrifice (and some serious money for sure) and some genuine risk to life and limb (due to frostbite) to get this story on film.<br /><br />(What a far cry from some of the cheaply produced politically oriented documentaries I've recently seen that have one subject person on camera kicked back in a chair while the cameras roll and a mysterious echo-voice speaks in the backgound because the film maker didn't want to invest in another microphone.)<br /><br />Yes, it may be true that the narrative goes too far in anthropomorphizing the penguins, but I believe it's also true that if all we humans showed the same determination, courage, and loyalty as these birds do, the world would be a much better place.  Whether driven by instinct or love or both, and whether they evolved this way or are a product of intelligent design, these penguins are an example to us all.  That's the point of the documentary.<br /><br />The narrative by Morgan Freeman left me cold (sorry).  It was acceptable but to me neither added nor detracted from the story told on film.  There were some hokey narrative moments, like when the narration says that the dying penguins "dissappear". That was weird.  Come to mention it, given the temperatures wouldn't a dead penguine immeidately freeze solid?  What would eat them?  How come there aren't thousands of penguin corpses littering the migration route and the breeding grounds?  I guess it doesn't pay to think too much sometimes.<br /><br />I gave this DVD five stars despite some of this hokey stuff because the flaws that some may percieve in this documentary do little to detract from the beauty, the story, or the committment shown by the film makers.  They are nits, and can't keep you from enjoying this film unless you let them.<br /><br />Also, there is a documentary about making the documentary which is in and of itself an amazing story and added alot to the DVD as a product.<br /><br />So, next time I see film clips of penguins jumping in and out of the water and waddling around, I won't laugh.  This is what penguins do on their Summer vacation, a vacation that is richly deserved considering the other nine months of their lives is a cold, freezing, hellish ordeal of survival.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a fascinating and visually stunning documentary, narrated by the mellifluent Morgan Freeman. In it, the filmmakers capture the yearly march of the Emperor Penguins to their breeding grounds, an arduous seventy mile trek inland from the sea from which the penguins emerge. Single file, the hundreds of penguins march onward, knowing that some of them may fall by the wayside. Still, they march on.<br /><br />When the penguins get to their destination, the mating ritual begins. All this takes place in Antarctica, one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. Despite driving blizzards, extreme temperatures, lack of food, and other hardships, the Emperor Penguins let nothing deter them from their set course and the propagation of their species.<br /><br />With its spectacular cinematography, this is a fantastic, must see film for all those who love documentaries and nature films. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>First and foremost I have to say I am stunned by the few bad reviews this movie has received in this forum.  I am not sure what is not to like.  This was an excellent film.  My entire family enjoyed it, and learned a thing or two in the process.<br /><br />This film had several very dramatic moments and was full of excellent imagery.  The filmmakers should be proud.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>Cute and adorable, but this film opens a window to the real world of daily penguin life. That world can be filled with love and dedication, from seeing the hatching of an egg through to fruition, to the improper transfer of that egg from parent-to-parent, and its hasty demise in the bitterly freezing temperature of the Antarctic. Or the ability of parents to recognize their own young, amongst thousands of others simply by recognizing each others vocal cries. As good as documentaries get, this film rivals the best of National Geographic. Though it may bring your little ones to tears, as I witnessed in the theater. The English version of this French produced film, is fortunate to have the sensitive narration of Morgan Freeman. Now a permanent part of our family DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>I have long been an admirer of penguins, so when this film was released in the cinema, my friends variously and collectively rushed to inform me of the film. I went to see it, and was amazed.<br /><br />The plot of the film is extraordinarily simple - the film follows the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica during their annual mating and rearing cycle. It is framed from start to finish in terms of the march - the march from the sea to the mating spot, the march to return to the sea for food, the march again for rearing the young, and the march again finally to return to the sea.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humour and grace; penguins are gentle beings, vulnerable to predators and to the hazards of the winter - despite being fashioned for some of the coldest climates on earth, they nonetheless require warmth, particularly for their eggs and the hatchlings. In the severe cold and far-below-zero windchills, many do not make it, and the one negative side of the film for me was a somewhat constant lingering on this downside. While it is a part of nature, it still becomes a bit more tragic in the cycle of the film than it needs to be. As this is billed as a family film, I worried that some of the children viewing might be more emotionally upset at this than they needed to be.<br /><br />Still, the details presented are fascinating, and it is a true testament to filmmaking that these shots and images were captured as dramatically, humourously, gracefully and beautifully as they were.<br /><br />This film has 'Academy Award' written all over it, in many categories. Cinematography, musical score, directing, documentary - these are only some of the categories in which this film is likely to get a nod. Morgan Freeman never appears on camera, but gives a wonderful reading as the narrator of this visual feast, adding subtle emphasis that never detracts and often adds to the tale in the English-language version of this film.<br /><br />Director Luc Jacquet and cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have produced a masterpiece that transcends language barriers (indeed, there is no native human language for Antarctica). A French team, they have translated this film into many languages around the world, as people everywhere will find something with which they can relate.<br /><br />Perhaps the most skillful part of the filming was to make Antarctica seem so varied in texture and place; on a continent covered with ice and snow, one still gets the sense of the length of the journey, the beauty inherent in the surroundings, and the dangers involved for the penguins.<br /><br />Through the credits, one gets to see the film crew in some light-hearted scenes with curious penguins. These are expanded upon in the DVD version, with many more scenes of penguins swimming, diving and feeding in truly remarkable filming. There is also a Warner Brothers short animation as a bonus. The audio track can be done in English or Spanish (French is also available as subtitles) - because of the nature of this film, overdubbing in different languages is in no way a detraction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Most people know little about the frozen continent named Antarctica.  This documentary is an informative and fascinating look at one of its major inhabitants, the Emperor penguin.  It shows a year in the life of these animals, from the long trek to the breeding grounds, to mating rituals, to the unusual parenting practices of this species.  The photography ranges from panoramic views of this beautiful, yet barren land to intimate closeups of the penguins living, loving, and working to stay alive.  The only jarring note is the insertion of anthropomorphic statements to describe the "feelings" of the birds at various times in their lives.  The parent birds are described as unhappy to be leaving their offspring in order to return to the feeding grounds, but it appears that they are simply following centuries-old instincts which allow for survival.  Other than that, this is a charming look at a wonderfully entertaining bird whose life practices to this point were little known by most people.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins is a cinematic success, with its beautiful scenery and endearing subjects. I couldn't relax while the march was on, nor while the males and females struggled to preserve new life. Because the film so endears the viewer to the penguins, their loss becomes your own. But their triumph also fills you with joy. Too, the film wouldn't have been the same without the voice of Morgan Freeman. His voice was one of this documentary's selling points for me. Educational and entertaining, this film is definitely a must-see. It's rated G, but there are some very sad moments. Be prepared to experience a full range of emotions.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>but this is a glorious exception. This story of the life cycle of the Emperor penguins is beautifully photographed, accompanied by a lavish score, and quietly narrated by Morgan Freeman. I can't imagine how the film was made, as I'd understood humans just cannot be exposed to the cold of the Antartic winter (mounted cameras?)The cinematography is stunning--there are times when the penguins on screen look like an abstract painting, with the beautiful curving neck, white/black motif, and stunning slash of orange near the face. This is a beauty. It may be a tiny bit slow for some kids, as there are long pauses when the cameras just feast on the beauty of these birds--but for adults it's a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>As a moment of respite and perspective in a world cluttered with tribal warfare, human responses to natural disasters, and the garish flames of politics, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS reminds us of the eternal cycle of life, life perpetuated against all manner of foes and odds, and helps us re-center our blurring focus. This eloquently beautiful film, a documentary that goes well beyond the genre limitations, is a work of art by Director Luc Jacquet and his fearless crew of photographers, and as art should, it brings a subject into focus that reminds us of the space each organism occupies with dignity on this troubled planet.<br /><br />The story is simple yet profound: the Antarctica Emperor penguins yearly march from the sea to the breeding grounds, mate monogamously, procreate, the females leave their egg with the fathers and return to the sea for food, returning to nourish the new chicks, relieving the fathers to make their food trek to the sea, returning to relieve the mothers who depart for food only to return and conjointly raise their newborns, then make the sacrifice of leaving the chicks to mature and plop into the sea to begin the whole cycle again. These elegant and warmly humorous birds endure the outer extremes of nature all for the sake of nurturing their progeny. The cycle is fascinating in its centuries old repetition of ritual and wonderfully pertinent to the re-evaluating the human family unit!<br /><br />The photography is magnificent, finding not only the intimacy of the penguins, but the rapture of the frigid sea where they dive impossible depths for foods, and also the majesty of the Antarctica complete with 'Southern lights'. This film is a work of magic and happily can be shared with all generations, each segment from the very young to the very elderly will find a special message. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, December 05</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>Morgan Freeman narrates this beautiful, moving, sometimes sad, often beautiful documentary (that actually does well on the big screen).  There are no big stars in this, just thousands of the cutest most beautiful little guys you could think of.  They are amazing animals and this depicts the life cycle of them and the way they live facing brutally cold conditions, attacks by seals, and the heartbreak they suffer (like humans) when chicks die or are taken from them.  This is brilliant and unlike any other documentary I've seen.  It captivated me from start to end and it's a must see.  Listening to Morgan Freemans soothing voice is so pleasant and he was easily the best choice to narrate this.  Go see this.  I highly, highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>I chose to see "March of the Penguins" as a diversion to a 100+ degree day, and saw that cold weather is worse than hot weather. Now, in the brisk part of autumn, it still holds up.<br /><br />Penguins from several areas of Antarctica converge on land, safe from predators and the ebbing ice shelf. They are there to mate, birth, and care for their chick.<br /><br />Monogamous for that year, penguins pair up and the mother lays an egg.<br /><br />The mother dashes off back to the sea, which, thanks to the winter and new ice, is as far as 70 miles. She's starving, having lost one-third of her weight in laying the egg. The trip is long, and she's not fast. Hungry seals await them, some penguins lose their way, and some are too exhausted to continue.<br /><br />Well-fed, full of food for her chick, she returns, and the father makes the same trip so he can eat. The father stayed behind to incubate the egg, and protect the new chick. He has lost one half of his weight.<br /><br />The pair trade places a few more times as winter plods on. With temperatures 80 below zero, and winds up to 125, I felt cold just watching. The penguins huddle to keep warm, rotating which must do outside duty.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates. His voice does not overcome the story. Better written than any documentary I have ever seen, Freeman respects the script. Having never seen a documentary in a theater before, I was impressed at how well it worked on the big screen.<br /><br />There is no plot, even though there is a beginning and an end. Unlike many documentaries, it does not detail the intricacies of eating, mate choosing, or science of penguin living. It is more about watching the arduous life cycle, with some explaining what we are watching.<br /><br />The camera works captures the cold -- the shivering penguins, the snow blowing like dust over the long line of marching penguins. It reminded me of movies about Siberia, showing Soviets living in a frozen, cold natural prison.<br /><br />This isn't a cute animal movie. Tender children might be saddened to see the eggs and chicks freezing, and could be quite frightened when the vicious seals overtake swimming penguins.<br /><br />Now, with the ever-funny Bugs Bunny in "8 Ball Bunny," the kid-factor increases. Still, even as Bugs graces your home viewing experience, be careful with more impressionable children and the feature documentary.<br /><br />Another DVD feature: Rodney the Penguin assists in "Crittercam: Emperor Penguins," as we learn how some of the complex videography was really shot.<br /><br />I fully recommend "March of the Penguins."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br /><br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this high-quality film about the lifecycle of the emperor penguin. However, I believe this summer's advertising campaign was somewhat intentionally misleading. The cute pictures and even cuter lullaby-like music accompanying the TV ads would lead you to believe that you would be safe taking a kindergartener to this film. Since the film accurately and starkly portrays the deaths that befall these creatures, I can't say that viewing by extremely young children is such a good idea. Instead, the level of violence on this film, although realistic and therefore not excessive, is more along the lines of what you would see on "When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth" on the Discovery Channel. Thus, probably anyone over the age of 10 can take the death of these creatures in context and enjoy the film. That being said, it is great to see Hollywood put out such a high quality film and I agree with all of the other reviewers that Morgan Freeman did a five star job of narrating the movie. I hope that the movie's success motivates the motion picture industry to produce more intelligent films like this one that depict the animal life around us and understand that audiences are capable of appreciating and understanding films that do not involve car chases, explosions, bad remakes of 60's sitcoms, and lifesize robots whose limbs come with machine-gun attachments.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure if I would go for this type of movie, but I really enjoyed it.  It's so amazing what these penguins go through to produce young.  Beautiful, yet sad at the same time.  In my opinion, not a waste of time to watch.  You come away learning something and appreciating life's creatures.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>While it may be nothing more than a National Geographic with a famous narrative, `March of the Penguins' still stands out above the rest mostly due to its subject matter, I mean penguins are just so freaking cute.  Exploring the mating rituals of the Emperor penguins we are given some very entertaining and funny segments of film and an interesting look at the lives of some really adorable animals.  I can think of a worse way to spend an evening.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>The Oscar winner for Best Documentary, March of the Penguins actually earned more at the box office (to the tune of over 77 million dollars) than four of the five movies nominated for Best Picture.  It may be a wildlife documentary, but it is definitely a theatrical experience.  With its gorgeous cinematography and impeccable narration by the acclaimed Morgan Freeman, it can't help but impress, but the stars of the show are the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica, truly one of the most amazing species of animals on the planet.  These aren't just little guys in tuxedoes who waddle around and sometimes fall down for our amusement; these are incredibly sensitive, intelligent creatures who truly reveal the wonders of Creation in the form of their uniquely challenging lives.  Anyone who says that animals have no souls hasn't looked into the eyes of a single animal; emotions that some consider uniquely human are revealed for all to see in March of the Penguins.<br /><br />It's no surprise that life on the Antarctic continent is a rather harsh affair, but it's amazing to see just how hard life truly is for the Emperor Penguin.  It would seem, though, that this is the way they want it.  Every autumn, hundreds and hundreds of these creatures leave their ocean homes to trek no less than seventy miles to their ancient breeding ground far inside the Antarctic interior.  Once they arrive, the males and females form up in monogamous pairs.  Once an egg is laid, the female and male take part in an elaborate dance by which the egg is transferred from the female to the male.  Each precious egg can only survive mere moments in the harsh Antarctic cold, so the transfer process must be done efficiently - there is only one try.  Not all transfers are successful, and even Mr. Magoo could clearly see the pain and sorrow etched on the faces of both mates as they look down upon their lost egg.  All of the males who have secured their eggs then bid goodbye to their mates, as the females return the dozens of miles back to the ocean to feed so that they can return and sustain their young after birth.  Huddled together in the freezing cold, instinctively shifting position from time to time to allow everyone some time inside the warmer inner circle, the males wait over the course of four winter months - no food, nothing but fallen snow to abate their thirst, and trying not to freeze to death.  After the eggs begin to hatch, they must work harder than ever to keep their young warm and wait for the return of the females and the food they will provide.  After the happy reunions of those who have survived, the fathers then set off on the trek back to the water, leaving the females to raise the young, protect them from the harsh conditions, predators, and sometimes one another (as some females who lose their chicks try to steal those of other mothers), and prepare them for their own life journeys.<br /><br />As amazing as it sounds, you have to see it to truly appreciate it.  It almost makes you ashamed to be a human being.  So many men and women treat procreation as a lark or a mistake that can be "fixed," thousands of deadbeat dads refuse to support their children, and far too many mothers and fathers take no responsibility for raising their children, seemingly not caring one thing about them.  How different we are from the Emperor Penguins, who routinely suffer almost unimaginable hardships in order to sustain their species.  There is a tremendous amount for viewers to learn about Emperor Penguins in this masterpiece of a documentary, but I daresay there may even be more for us to learn from these noble creatures - they are more human than far too many men and women who are human in name only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>First of all, nobody needs Opus, the current Coca-Cola commercials or the trailer for next year's "Happy Feet" to know that penguins are cute.  We learned that lesson in the movies when Dick Van Dyke danced with animated penguin waiters in "Mary Poppins," and everybody who has seen penguins in person knows they are about as cute as animals get.  So a documentary that shows us hundreds of penguins for eighty-minutes is going to be captivating because that is a lot of cinematic cuteness.  But there is more.<br /><br />Second, "March of the Penguins" ("La Marche de l'empereur," literally "The Emperor's Journey") is about the mating habits of the Emperor Penguins, the biggest penguins of them all.  Now, what you need to know is that when this film is over you are going to be able to pass a quiz on that particular subject.  The combination of director Luc Jacquet's footage from the Antarctic and the narration by Morgan Freeman is such that when this is over you will know how far the male penguins march, how long they go without food, how they receive the eggs from the females, how much weight they lose, and just about anything else that a teacher might want to put on a quiz.  I know documentaries are supposed to be informative but rarely have I felt like I had really learned something.  I mean, just because we are supposed to learn something does not mean that we will, but in this case I think most viewers will clearly learn a lesson.<br /><br />Third, although Jacquet is dealing with the harsh realities of these penguins, who are trying to breed on what is literally the harshest place on Earth, he focuses much more on the miracle of life.  There is a point where you think the camera is about to show us things we really do not want to see, much as they are part of the circle of life and all that, but things never get that far.  I was worried about what young children would think when some of the natural predators of the Emperors show up, but I do not think there is anything here that would be traumatic even though there are certainly some heartbreaking scenes, which is to be expected when cute things die.<br /><br />Fourth, Freeman is the only narrator for this film, which is obvious when you watch "March of the Penguins."  But it seems that in places like France and Japan the film was shown with a trio of narrators representing the father penguin (Manchot p&egrave;re/Haha-Penguin), the mother penguin (Manchot m&egrave;re/Ko-Penguiin), and baby penguin (Manchot b&eacute;b&eacute;/Chichi-Penguin).  Learning this makes me wonder if just having Morgan provide the solemn narration strengthens the film's educational value.  Having the voices for the three members of the family might be adding cute on top of cute, which does not always work.<br /><br />Fifth, any doubts about the rating for this DVD are erased by the extras.  "Of Penguins and Men" is a documentary about the making of the documentary, which actually provides a few additional insights into the Emperors.  The National Geographic's "Crittercam: Emperor Penguins" provides a fascinating look at how penguins feed on fish when they dive beneath the ice, which proves to be essentially the same strategy as used by eagles and hawks.  Then for good measure there is "8 Ball Bunny," a classic WB cartoon where Bugs Bunny makes the mistake of promising to take a little lost penguin home (this is the one has a running gag regarding Humphrey Bogart's character in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), and the theatrical trailer for "March of the Penguins."  In short, the extras are about as long as the documentary itself, which makes for a nice balance without putting kids and parents on information overload.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>There used to be a time when at least one nature documentary was released on a massive national scale about every other year. Disney used to be the major Hollywood producer and distributer of these films because they were so family friendly, but there were other studios and independent agencies involved, too. Around the late 1970s, these movies virtually stopped being released. Perhaps it was because of STAR WARS (that film changed everything else in the business, why not nature documentaries, too?). Perhaps it was because people just didn't care about animals anymore. Whatever the reasons, major nature documentaries released on a large scale haven't been seen in most theatres around the country for a long time.<br /><br />Until the summer of 2005. That's when MARCH OF THE PENGUINS became the little picture that could and went on to become the highest-grossing documentary of all time (FAHRENHEIT 9/11 really isn't a documentary).<br /><br />MARCH OF THE PENGUINS illustrates a nine-month cycle in the life of Emperor Penguins. Each year these birds trek to the same breeding grounds in Antartica, battling sub-zero temperatures, bone-chilling winds, and ferocious predators all in the name of love and survival. The Emperor Penguin mating rites are one of love because these penguins remain monogamous to their spouses throughout the mating season, they only separate after it's time to leave their little ones behind.<br /><br />MARCH OF THE PENGUINS is a beautifully filmed picture. It not only captures the beauty of nature, but illustrates its wrath as well. Baby penguins are born, but in the process old penguins die and others are eaten by sea lions. It's a difficult lesson for children to grasp, but it is presented so well in the movie that it teaches children about the survival of a species, but without worrying them unduly.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrates the picture and his soulful voice adds a distinct flair. As a piece of trivia, Freeman recorded all of his narration in a single day.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of penguins and if I had the money and resources, I would own a frozen penguin refuge somewhere. I figured since I couldn't do that the next best thing I could do was to watch and then buy MARCH OF THE PENGUINS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 3/06<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />3/06: March of the Penguins is an outstanding film that is well-narrated by Morgan Freeman. It is a warm, touching, and moving story about the survival of the penguins which is a very cute story. I am let down by the idea of inserting the computer animation work for the underwater scenes. Moreover, I felt the movie was kind of slow at times. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating story about the behavior of animals, and thanks to the narration in clearing up the actions of the penguins for the audience. It is well worth my time, so it richly deserved the Academy Award for Best Documentary. All in all, I would have gladly picked March of the Penguins over Crash for the Best Picture of 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>This deservedly praised-to-the-skies documentary, following one year in the life of the Emperor penguins of Antarctica, is such a heart-warming family classic that the wife and I watch it regularly. We do this as a tonic for the nastiness of today's world.<br /><br />Narrated by the immortal Morgan Freeman, directed by the great French director Luc Jacquet, the film's impact worldwide is unprecedented--and unbelievable. It impacted documentaries, produced at least one rip-off penguin documentary (although there was one great, earlier documentary also). It inspired Queen Latifah to narrate a similar documentary, and spawned two cartoons, the miserable HAPPY FEET and the incomparable tour-de-force SURF'S UP.<br /><br />(Even the Showtime Bunnies re-enacted-it-in-30-seconds, with a hilarious ending involving Morgan Freeman freezing in the snow and demanding a mocha latte.)<br /><br />With its quiet, meditative pace and gorgeous soundtrack, MARCH OF THE PENGUINS was dubbed for viewing all over the planet. French, Indian and other actors stepped forward to help narrate this film for the countries in which it was released. That is star power.<br /><br />Really, no one saw it coming when this film was made. The miserable conditions which the crew endured for about two years, the languid nature of the subject...all of it smacked of silly classroom stock. Even Freeman called it a "silly" movie and was taken aback by the fame it won.<br /><br />What's funny is this documentary format was nothing new to me. The Brits and Canadians perfected this style of wildlife documentary. I saw a fabulously great beaver documentary from Canada around 2002--I can't recall anything about it because there are about 15 beaver documentaries. I'll never forget the excellent documentary about sloths, narrated by the crazy-like-a-fox Tom Baker (yes, THAT Tom Baker).<br /><br />Get this for the whole family, and for posterity's sake. Don't leave home without knowing this great film is on your dvd shelf.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Morgan Freeman's narration. It is a year in the life of Emperor Penguins. Their life, like all animals is dictated by their environment. Antartica does have distinct seasons & during their summer, it can be quite habitable. But not winter with it's eternal darkness. The penguins endure. There must be quite a few of them since we are told that only 10% of the chicks survive. They fall victim to cold, starvation, predators & loss of either one of thier parents. A more nuturing father in the animal kingdom you may never see. All march from their feeding area to their breeding area maybe up to 70 miles. Shortly after  mating the mother lays one single egg she transfers it to the  father. This in itself is a pains-<br />takingly slow process & many eggs crack & perish. Once sucessful,the father sits on the eggs for several months in the dead of winter while mom leaves to feed. Dad is unable to feed all this time. In several months the mothers that have survived their own ordeals return, fat with full bellies to feed their chicks. They grow fast & soon all trek back to the feeding grounds. At this point, the families break up, never to reunite. The adults return to the sea. The chicks are left & of course eventually they go for their first swim. The sea is, after all the penguins natural habitat. The young penguins will stay for 4-5 years, at which time they too will pursue a life cycle of marches.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>Do you want a movie that is:<br />1) Paced enough for adults to be able to enjoy?<br />2) Is suitable for the whole family to watch together, without worrying about blood and guts or gratious sex or bad language?<br />3) Will educate as well as entertain?<br />4) Is realistic?<br />5) Is considered worthy enough to win an Oscar?<br /><br />This movie fits all of the above.  How often do you find that?<br /><br />This movie was originally a French movie, but it is one of the rare films that can be translated to any language and be equally entertaining.  After all, enjoying nature is probably universal, and except for the billions who live in Antartica (what do you mean there aren't a billion people in Antartica?!), this is a region of the world that is a mystery, which again makes the movie more appealing.  Our version has Morgan Freeman reading the script, and doing a good job; but then there are probably few people who would not have done a good job (Little Richard comes to mind; my apologies if he or a friend of his is reading this).<br /><br />This movie, as I said, is suitable for the whole family to view together.  I don't believe any television or movies should be watched by unsupervised children (including Sesame Street and Barney), and there are definitely some scenes that a parent will want to be there to talk to their child.  It deals with life and death, after all, and while the scenes are not as graphic as a lot of movies are, it would be wise to be there with your child.<br /><br />For example, how many of you have seen sweet cuddly seals at the zoo?  I remember seeing the trainer trying to urge one into the cage, a seal (named Max) who would get to the edge of the cage and then waddle away, and finally dove into the water.  The scene with a leopard seal will show a completely different side of seals, and that scene is pretty intense.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie:  it is silent about the origins issue.  One is allowed to come up to their own conclusions if the penguin adapted itself as finely tuned as it was by the miracle of evolution and natural selection, or if a master artist designed this species, and gave it instincts that help it survive in an extremely harsh environment.  (Of course, some people on either side of the debate despises the concept of a person coming to their own conclusions, in fear that they would come to the wrong choice.)<br /><br />One important thing:  DO NOT STOP THIS MOVIE WHEN THE FINAL CREDITS START ROLLING!!!  Understand?  There are some great scenes that were not in the movie as you see the credits roll.<br /><br />The DVD has some special features.  One is a nearly hour long segment which partially retells the story of the actual movie, and partially tells about the filming and relating to the penguins.  This includes some of the movie footage, the footage I mentioned in the closing credits, and none of the above.  I would say this segment, titled "Of Penguins And Men", is not for the whole family, solely because it is above the heads of most children, and they might be bored with this segment.<br /><br />To make up for it, they have added (not surprisingly for a Warner Bros. release) a Bugs Bunny cartoon which includes a penguin.  This is not anywhere realistic, or based on the research that went into the movie, but so what?  It will amuse the Bugs fans.  (Another feature is the trailer for the movie.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Humans have it easy. We get together with the right (or the wrong) man or woman, form a short/long/meaningless relationship, and bang, a mere nine months later, you're parents. You don't have to move 70 miles to have that baby (depending on how bad your relationship actually is), you don't have to walk for miles to find your partner, you don't have to keep the egg warm and you don't have to starve in order to have a baby.<br /><br />Penguins are completely different. Not only are they men in tuxedos, they're cute, but they also go through life or death situations every year. Just to reproduce. I'm damn sure us humans would quickly die out if we had to do what penguins do just to reproduce. Yet they do it. Repeatedly.<br /><br />Can you imagine marching 70 miles to find your partner? Well, I certainly couldn't, and in my next life, I don't want to be a penguin. Once they've found their perfect partner, they have to fight off other jealous potential partners, and there are some heart-wrenching scenes when each couple gets together. Then the egg is produced, but needs to be kept warm. Impossible in minus something very cold temperatures? But it's done. Some eggs don't survive, as they're left or left out too long in the cold. The fathers have to look after them as the mothers have lost most of their body weight during the pregnancy, and need food now.<br /><br />Many fathers do survive, but some, especially the older ones, simply go to sleep, and the tear jerking scene where one just closes his eyes for the last time is just unbelievable.<br /><br />And then the eggs hatch. And little fluffy heads pop out, feel the cold, and decide to stay in the shell. If they stay out too long, they freeze. The beaks poking at a frozen baby penguin is again heartbreaking, and makes you put some extra clothing on.<br /><br />The life of penguins is not easy, as shown in this documentary, and you seem to become part of their world, with Morgan Freeman's soothing voice guiding you through their perilous journey. (His narration was recorded in just one day.)<br /><br />This is definitely a must have in any DVD lovers home, and also included are some very interesting featurettes, and a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Awwww!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ990HW13DP08.html">AQ990HW13DP08</a><br/><p>In this National Geographic documentary the filmmakers take your through a year in the life of Antarctica's Emperor Penguins. The director Luc Jacquet pitches this as a romantic story of migration and mating in which thousands of penguins waddle and glide 70 miles across an icy wasteland to the same place year after year, often in single file, to bear their young. The foreboding geography is fascinating and the cinematography remarkable, as they only could be. The technical challenges of making a movie like this where temperatures plunge to -70 degrees boggles the imagination. But I thought the film had trouble finding its exact voice. The music track suggests certain viewpoints, and the narrator's script equivocated between the purely scientific and the crassly cute ("This is a love story."). We can easily imagine learning much more about these fascinating creatures who thrive in such a harsh environment. March of the Penguins will take its rightful place alongside other family-friendly animal-lover films like Winged Migration, The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill, and  The Story of the Weeping Camel.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This is one of the best DVD's I have ever purchased without seeing it first.  A beautiful, often sad documentary about the impressive emperor penguins and the annual journey they endure for love and breeding.  Narrated by Morgan Freeman, this captivating documentary will pull at your heart strings and at times you'll want to jump into the screen to try and cuddle those adorable penguins. It may even make you want to take a holiday there just to view them in person.<br /><br />It was amazing to see the harsh conditions that these creatures endure year after year, temperatures such as 80 below zero!  If you want to see truly selfless acts of love, then take a glimpse at the lives of the emperor penguins.  We could all learn alot from them!<br /><br />The DVD is a must own. It also contains additional documentaries and the trailer. One of the documentaries (on the Region 4 version) is from National Geographic where they go travelling with the emperor penguins. Amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>This movie features two amazing stories--the lifestyle of the Emperor Penguin, which I was somewhat familiar with from children's books, and the untold story of "how in the world did they make this movie", which features footage from the coldest, windiest, most storm-ravaged place on the planet, Antartica.  At least the filmmakers got to leave at some point. By the will of God or evolution, penguins continue to struggle to maintain the species in the face of the harshest of elements.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>If this movie were made in the seventies, it would be called "Everything You Wanted to Know About Penguins, but Didn't Think to Ask," and it wouldn't match the splendor of "March of the Penguins".  What makes this movie transcend the usual nature movies like the old Disney features, "Vanishing Prairie," et. al, is that it is exquisitely filmed, smoothly narrated (by Morgan Freeman) and fascinatingly focused.  (The life cycle of Antarctic penguins is documented for one year, so it flows like a story.)  The whole experience is vivid and engaging.  The viewer is invited intimately into the penguin community, while the visual grandeur is garnished by beautiful music that matches the mood of every scene.  The information is really fresh, for who hasn't known, or at least assumed to know, a great deal about penguins?  "March of the Penguins," takes new and old territory and packages it in a way that is surprisingly well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>What a film! I was truly impressed. The photography was brilliant and told the story so visually and eloquently. Truly striking filmmaking! It really touched me.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"March of the Penguins" documents the lives of emperor penguins over the course of 9 months of Antarctic winter, as the birds take to land to find mates and raise chicks before returning to their comparatively leisurely life at sea for the summer.  French filmmaker Luc Jacquet created this tale of life on the "darkest, driest, windiest, and coldest continent on Earth" with film shot by cinematographers J&eacute;r?me Maison and Laurent Chalet, who spent a winter with the penguins. I've seen a lot of excellent still photography of penguins, but "March of the Penguins" is the most spectacular and intimate cinematography of these birds that I've ever seen. The film is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman. This narration replaces the original French narration of the film, in which the penguins told their own story, voiced by human actors, if you can believe it. Well, a lot of people didn't believe it, so a new, more objective, narration was written for some international markets. There is a little romanticizing and dramatizing in this commentary, but it's good-natured and easy to spot.<br /><br />Rotund sea birds waddling about on land can have comic consequences, and there are some laugh out loud moments in "March of the Penguins". But this film is generally dramatic, highlighting the great hardships that the penguins endure to reproduce under extraordinarily harsh conditions. The photography of Antarctica's landscape is spectacular in itself, and funny-looking birds waddling stoically across the bleak, icy terrain is quite a sight. Once the penguins traverse 70 miles to reach their breeding ground, where the ice is thick, we watch their quest for a suitable mate, egg-laying, and child-rearing, as starving parents must trek back to the sea to feed and return to feed their offspring and relieve their mates. The sight of the penguins huddled together in frigid temperatures and blizzard conditions as the Southern Lights dance across the perpetual night sky is downright eerie. Of course, there is lot of footage of irresistibly adorable baby penguins too, who play and bicker and suffer the harsh realities of Antarctic winter. "March of the Penguins" is a pleasure to watch. It's a wonder to see these remarkable birds up close.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2005): Bonus features include 2 documentaries, one cartoon, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). "Of Penguins and Men" (53 min) is a making-of documentary narrated, in English, by cinematographer J&eacute;r?me Maison. Maison follows both the story of the penguins and that of himself and fellow cinematographer Laurent Chalet, as they spend a sometimes perilous 9 months of winter filming the penguins. It includes some information about the penguins that was not in the feature film.  "National Geographic's Critter Cam: Emperor Penguins" (23 min) is a television show featuring the "critter cam", for which a camera is attached to a critter, in this case an emperor penguin in order to learn how it feeds underneath the pack ice. It follows 2 researchers who are studying the impact of climate change, specifically the enormous iceberg B15, on the lives of emperor penguins. "8 Ball Bunny" (7 min) is a Bugs Bunny cartoon that features a penguin. After a little lost penguin falls into his rabbit hole, Bugs promises to escort the little fellow home -before he realizes that penguins are from the South Pole. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>DEFINITION OF "DOCUMENTARY": 'Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration.' *** I've mentioned the definition here because some reviewers perhaps don't understand what a documentary is or what it's supposed to be. There are no bombs exploding, no Hollywood movie stars here, no wiz-bang CGI special effects. Knowing what a "documentary film" is supposed to be - maybe they would have rated this film (or any other documentary) higher (?)<br /><br />THE FILM: Amazing. Joyous. Sad. Sweet. Remarkable. This (almost) 80-minute film presents the year long struggle of the Emperor Penguin in the freezing Antarctic. Starting out in the penguin's ocean home, making the arduous 60+ mile journey to their mating grounds, the 2 week long mating ritual, the mother bird laying a single egg, the mother's trek back to the ocean for food, the fathers staying with the eggs for 2-3 months, the mother returning and then the male goes back to the ocean to feed... and this back-and-forth trip by each sex happening several times until the chick is several months old. Not to mention all this happens with the egg exposed to the frigid air and touching the ice for only seconds at a time, or it would otherwise freeze. Then it's the trek back to the ocean for everyone that survived. Much praise goes to the film team for spending 13 months of their lives to bring us this feature. The brutal cold (average -50 to -80 degrees), sever wind (20-120 mph), no food, and little or no light during the winter months makes you wonder - how do the penguins do this year in and year out (for thousands of years). An incredible journey. Sound is crisp Dolby 5.1 and the cinematography is grand.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Bonus features consist of 2 documentaries - 1. "Crittercam" a 25 minute segment showing the penguins strategies for eating and survival underwater, and 2. "Of Penguins & Men" an approx 50 minute behind the scenes look at the penguins and the team making the film. Also included is a classic Bugs Bunny short cartoon "8 Ball Bunny" from 1950.<br /><br />OTHER WORTHY DOCUMENTARY FILMS: If you're into documentary films, check out "Touching The Void" (2003), "IMAX: Dolphins", "IMAX: Africa - The Serengeti", and Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me". All are eye-opening educational experiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>I never thought a movie/documentary about animals would make me feel this way, but the French-made "March of the Penguins" truly makes you feel a great degree of respect (for lack of a better term) for what these funny little birds go through in order to reproduce. The fascinating insights into their lives, along with the impact we as humans inflict on their habitat are perfectly framed by Morgan Freeman's narration laid on top of a fascinating score (one of 2005's best). The result is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and it doesn't get old (even more so, if you have children at home). Without a doubt one of the best in 2005, and one of the best documentaries ever.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Take your mind off of a world full of troubles and spend some time with these wonderful creatures, defying all probabilities as they survive and raise a new generation in one of the harshest and least forgiving environments on earth, as they have done so for a million years.<br /><br />Also defying all probabilities, this film found an audience. I knew it had an avid following, but I had no idea the full reason why.  It is astonishing.  That would have been my title for this review, but someone else has already used it.<br /><br />The stark beauty of Antarctica in its various seasons is unforgettably photographed here, and if these intrepid little birds withstanding everything nature can throw at them from 100 mile winds at 80 below zero temperatures, vulnerable to many predators, stubbornly sharing their travails with their mates and their fellows, doesn't move you, well more is the pity for you.<br /><br />Eighty minutes long, narrated by Morgan Freeman (who could enthrall me reading Federal regulations), I have no puzzlement at all why this movie, and these stalwart little birds, found an audience that could be enchanted by the story of their life cycle. The Emperor Penguin's struggle speaks to us. Something to do with the precarious wonder of life, and the shared burdens of this little community amid so much severity.  Kudos to all involved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>Documentaries are often touchy affairs.  They require an (admirable--I'd never want to go to the coldest continent in the world for a year just to cover a movie) amount of intrigue and beauty to indulge viewers' interest.  March of the Penguins is one such documentary; of course, at a shockingly short in film-terms, but jam-packed, 80 minutes it seems like more care could've been taken (in my opinion, at least) on the lifecycle of the chicks instead of leaving them after they take their first swims.  Still, March of the Penguins is a highly enjoyable, at times even "cute" in all senses of the word movie covering the life, love and death of the Emperor Penguin in the barren, frozen wasteland of Antarctica.  The music is done beautifully as is the narration by veteran actor Morgan Freeman (who also narrated the opening and closing of the summer blockbuster War of the Worlds).  Of course, Hollywoo-dizing such a project is inevitable; some of the sounds have been added in to make it seem like the penguins are more vocal than they probably are, but it only adds to the film's allure.  Good documentary, intriguing storyline and an incredible look at the lives of some of nature's most adaptive creatures.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins is a pretty good flick: Not only is it informative, but it's entertaining and narrated wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. I found it somewhat dull, however, even though I walked away with an admiration for this movie. And I couldn't get my 4 year old cousin to sit through it, even though he loves to see the penguins at the zoo.<br /><br />This movie reminds me alot of an animated film I used to watch when I was a kid called "Scamper the Penguin." It gives all the information that March of the Penguins provides, though with slightly less harsh details and images. And of course, the little penguins in "Scamper" can talk and the girls are pink and the boys are blue. Anyway, March of the Penguins is an endearing documentary about Emperor Penguins, and the instinctual rituals of the males to travel many miles to mate with the females. Then when the egg is laid, the females travel the same distance, though in harsher weather, to feed in the ocean and return with sustenance for the newly born chick. The males don't eat for nearly four months.<br /><br />Certainly, if you love penguins, give this movie a look, maybe even a buy. Like I said, super informative, and those little baby chicks are so cute you'll be "ooing" and "ahhing" the entire time. Though my little cousin couldn't sit through it, other kids just might be able to, and if you're willing to let them see the realities of life, despite how terrible it is, it can be an excellent learning tool. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely astonishing, the cinemaphotography is supurb.  I really had no idea what these Emperor Penquins went through to mate and procreate, it was fascinating.  I loved the part in which you see the courtship, it was very touching and the penguins are just beautiful, their colors are so vivid.  I just kept thinking how in the world did the filmmakers accomplish this, it was beyond frigid, I mean even the penguins were freezing.  That is the great thing about this DVD, the extra's show you how the film was created, that is almost as interesting as the film..almost.  I found it interesting that in the end you realize why they traveled so far to mate, it makes total sence.

There are endless close-ups of penguin feathers and long-distance shots of penguins wandering across the Antarctic ice, usually heading away from the camera, while moody music plays. I really enjoyed most of it, but it could have been trimmed down to 60 minutes without hurting the narrative.

A wonderful lesson about survival. The original French version had the birds speaking about their situation, which, though cute, couldn't get across the absolute power of the ordeal. I live in Wisconsin, and winter can be brutal. Still, I choose to live here. It really makes you wonder if these animals would be happy (or content) living anywhere else.

It is now an Oscar winner for Best Documentary Feature for 2005.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins plays like an overlong version of one of those irresistible nature shows in which you find yourself enthralled on a Sunday afternoon.  The film depicts an entire year cycle of the Emperor Penguin, from ocean to land and back to ocean again.  Their "march" takes them to the coldest point in the world, a spot that will remain frozen through the summer months, thus providing the necessary solid ground for rearing young.<br /><br />Their story is a journey, one of the unquenchable thirst within animals to continue their species through all forms of adversity...and they face more than their share.  While most births in nature seem to be the products of almost miraculous powers,  the successful birth of an Emperor Penguin bests almost all others for the challenges it must overcome.  And while many fall (predators, hunger, extreme conditions), others succeed.<br /><br />Life finds a way.<br /><br />An overwhelming feeling I received while watching the film concerns mankind's relationship to penguins and all other animals who share the earth with us.  As we have evolved, it seems we have grown apart from our animal brethren in how we view the responsibilities of parenthood.  We see in the penguins a group of animals who sacrifice entire seasons for a chance at one egg, risking their own health and safety every waddling step of the way.  Once the lucky penguins see their dreams manifested in the form of a tiny chick, the risks and sacrifices continue.  The lives of the adults are devoted exclusively to protecting, teaching and feeding their children.  It's hard not to admire these parents and wish we had more of their ilk raising our own children.  A good question for parents to ask themselves is, "Am I a better parent than a penguin?"<br /><br />Sadly, the answer for many is NO.<br /><br />March of the Penguins deserves to be watched, but I have a hard time justifying its cinematic release.  The story of the penguins is no more exciting than similar shows I have seen on badgers, monkeys of even yellow jackets.  When viewing a documentary, I want to see the dialogue on a subject expanded; I want to be overwhelmed with what I learned, and if the documentary is shown as a theatrical film, I expect even more.  March of the Penguins is nothing more than a top notch National Geographic special (which is a very rewarding experience, but is it worth eight dollars?)</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>This film has even inspired a political controversy, with Right Wing advocates claiming that the annual `monogamy' the male and female engage in supports their view that the nuclear family unit is ordained by God, and that Emperor penguins are proof of `Intelligent Design', even though they are clearly marvelous products of adaptive development. Gay rights activists have countered the Right's claims by noting that female penguins often steal the chicks of other females if theirs dies, and that lower animals do not feel human emotions like love, but merely act instinctively, sometimes engaging in same sex sexual play- which is not `homosexuality', which would imply that penguins are sexually turned on my male humans. Much of this misinterpretation of penguin behavior, as presented in this film, seeped over into the fawning critical reception of this film. Indeed, while the film is enjoyable, it is so only a Disney/Pixar level, for it almost plays out like one of those computer animated films, not a real nature documentary.<br />  Yes, the penguins suffer through conditions that would kill humans in seconds, seventy mile treks across ice, male and female sharing of the caring of the egg and chick, both of which would freeze if not for a warm parental pouch to crawl into, huddling for warmth in 125 mile per hour winds at -80? Fahrenheit, months of starvation, but these are not the makings of drama, because true drama requires conscious actors. Yet, many reviews of the film contain terms like `lovemaking', `bravery', and `fortitude', only further confusing the boundaries between fiction and reality, even as the film never focuses on an individual bird nor couple, the way most documentaries do, knowing that is the way to emotionally invest a viewer in a story. Instead, this film merely relies on the cuteness of the penguins, and especially their fuzzy chicks., who, by summertime, will be abandoned by both parents, and left to fend for themselves for four years, before they return again to their birthing grounds, to give birth to the next generation of their kind.<br />  Cinematographers Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison do get some incredible pictures, especially those underwater shots of agile female penguins swiftly trying to outswim a seal that's out to eat them, as they try to fatten up on small fish, squid, and krill, to bring back and feed their chicks. Yet, the Emperor penguins transcend this film's limitations. They are silly looking yet beautiful creatures: their black and white feathers are so densely packed they resemble the gloss on fine china, and the orange marks near their pates are so rich in color they dazzle in the blinding white of the ice, but the dull classical (or New Age?) musical score by Alex Wurman is one of the few aspects of the film that has rightly and universally been panned. Supposedly the original French version of the film had much more contemporary and apropos music by Emilie Simon.<br />  Regardless, while March Of The Penguins may be solid enjoyable kiddy fare, no adult should expect to be much enlightened, for the natural and documentary parts of this `nature documentary' seem to have been CG'd to death.

Emporer Penguins achieve many miracles every year in their quest for reproduction. How exactly they know how to do all this is incredible.<br /><br />First they all leap out of the ocean and begin to march, single file, for over 70 miles, to their preferred breeding ground. They look really cute as they do this.<br /><br />Then, when they are at their breeding ground, they look for a partner. There are loads more boys than girls, so the competition is stiff. But, eventually, they find a partner and the magic happens. Do penguins fall in love? It seems they do and they all have strange rituals of hugging and talking gibberish. I have no doubts that they are actually talking to each other.<br /><br />As winter comes, they all huddle together in a group. Eggs are laid and passed onto the male as the female go off to search for food. Some eggs are misplaced and the unhatched baby penguin dies. It's really sad.<br /><br />As the girls are away, the boys have to suffer intense blizzards and snow storms. Some of the older ones die, or as Morgan Freeman says, simply go to sleep. A close-up of a penguin closing his eyes for the final time is truly a deeply affecting moment. Since this is the part where it's the males fighting for themselves, this is probably the reason there are less of them.<br /><br />When the girls return, the eggs hatch and adorable little babies poke their heads out and see the world for the first time. But since they are so small, they need to stay sheltered. The males are still sheltering and when the female wants it back they have to move very quickly since the fragile little penguin cannot be out of warmth for more than a few moments.<br /><br />Some die. And a scene where a mother pokes at her dead chick is utterly heartbreaking. However, the majority survives. As they have done for thousands of years. And as summer arrives they grown-ups depart, leaving the babies on their own. And when one of the plucks up enough courage to dive in the ocean, the rest follow. And soon, they'll be back to take part in the same ritual, the same survival quest.<br /><br />It's a purity and innocence that humans have long, long, LONG lost. Every creature on earth exists simply to multiply and be the dominant species. But surely Emperor Penguins do it in the toughest of conditions. Nature may be cruel, but it's pure. You might even end up a little jealous and insist on living as a hermit or wildman in a vain attempt at getting back to nature. But, inevitable, you'll probably miss your playstation and porn too much.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's narration is brilliant. But since he has the second coolest voice in the world (after Lance Henrikson) I could probably listen to him for hours even if he was just reading the dictionary. The score by Alex Wurman is also great and when coupled with the beautiful cinematography it makes for huge escapism. It reminds me a lot of the Landscape Channel, which I used to watch as a kid.<br /><br />I totally recommend the film.

And that is only the beginning.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed, it feels like we're there in Antarctica with the penguins (there are a few shots that I feel are a little TOO close), and wonderfully narrated by Freeman with moments of comedy to punctuate the "drama".<br /><br />While I wouldn't advise owning this, it is definitely worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>In its original foreign  theatrical release, MARCH OF THE PENGIUNS was a French film with a soundtrack that voiced the first-person feelings and thoughts of the titular birds.  For U.S. release, it was wisely re-cut and a new, simpler audio track with a poetic narration by Morgan Freeman was recorded.<br /><br />Under the harshest imaginable conditions, the lowly but noble Emperor penguins successfully live lives that reflect the most fundamental of human concerns.  Especially moving is the powerful image of a community literally huddled together to create warmth when the temperature approaches 100 degrees below zero with winds of 80 miles per hour.<br /><br />Breathtaking photography underscores the life passages that include choosing a mate, breeding, birth and the complexities of parenting.<br /><br />These sturdy and brave creatures live lives of grace and beauty and love. To think otherwise is not giving them their due.  They are living examples of what it means to make a commitment and stick to it.  Endurance and perseverance are apparently a natural part of their essence.<br /><br /> If you crave more things Penguin, check out PENGUINS UNDER SIEGE, shot in hi-def, it's the untold story of South Africa's Blackfoot penguins.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins (Luc Jacquet, 2005)<br /><br />It has been reported that, in a first draft of this film's script, there were talking penguins.<br /><br />Luc Jacquet's documentary about the love life of the emperor penguin has found itself cuddling up to some incredibly strange bedfellows in recent months, most notably Christian extremists talking about how wonderful it is that this film promotes monogamy. (Which, in my mind, still doesn't fit with Morgan Freeman's narration about the penguins mating for one year and then moving on to different partners. There's some joke to be made here about Jesse Helms at a swingers' party, but I'll leave it to you.) Still, if you're one of the twenty or thirty people in America who has not yet seen this film, treat yourself.<br /><br />Narrated by the fine Mr. Freeman, the film follows a tribe of emperor penguins on a trek from the sea to their breeding ground, seventy miles into the blistering winds of the Antarctic, and the rather extreme reaches they have to go to in order to ensure the continuation of their species. There are a lot of shots of penguins being silly. There are a lot of shots of oh-so-cute baby penguins. There's a lot of shots that simply reek of anthropomorphism (Freeman narrates, and Jacquet shows, hundreds of penguins huddled together for survival-- it's cold in the middle of winter in Antarctica-- but you just know at least half the audience is looking at it and seeing either a sixties love-in or a football huddle.) This is a movie that is unafraid to manipulate your emotions, and equally unafraid to let you know that it knows it's manipulating your emotions, and furthermore, that it doesn't care you know. But it works, one way or the other, and March of the Penguins raises itself from basic nature documentary to, well, feature film. (Which is why most National Geographic documentaries end up on the National Geographic channel instead of as feature films.)<br /><br />Go see it. You will like it, even if you realize how brazen it's being in trying to get you to like it. And, when you're walking out of the theater covered in popcorn detritus, pause for a moment to think about what could have been, and bless whatever exec said "axe the talking penguins. How about we get Morgan Freeman to narrate it?" *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>[Sorry to offend people with my review.  I know people who readily say penguins and cute puppies were created by God whereas snakes, spiders, and the HIV virus were created by some demonic force.  It's this sort of selective, anthropomorphic, myopic and reductive thinking that is taking us backward as a nation.  "God" (as opposed to "my" God, which immediately gives away the naive faith of the thoughtless "believer") is not so limited that that he/she answers only to the selfish wishes of a few. Termites are no less part of the Creator's business than cute little bunnies.  Christians and Muslims worship the same God of Abraham.  God does not play favorites, does not favor any particular flag, not to mention political party, over another.]<br /><br /> The "family values" politicians who, of late, have had so much difficulty practicing what they preach, would certainly have no more perfect model of the self-sacrificial monogamy they promote than "March of the Penguins."  But during the grueling 9 months of each year during which these noble, dignified creatures starve themselves, march endlessly, endure "terrorists" in the form of predators at every turn, they do not appear to have God on their side.  Misfortune and, as Morgan Freeman puts it, "unbearable grief," are a constant threat and reality.  Is it a moral failing that accounts for such seeming injustices and hardships to their ranks?  Is it because they lack a "personal relationship with Jesus" (to borrow a trendy phrase these days)?  Or are we seeing a more accurate mirror of the human condition than, save for Darwinians, humans are reluctant to accept?<br /><br />"March of the Penguins" is definitely manipulative, but the amazing shots that the film has provided (I'd hate to even conjecture the percentage of raw footage to actually used, edited footage in the film) are sufficient to enable the viewer to forgive the "anthropomorphic indulgences and excesses" of the story of these creatures, who are made to seem larger and more "human" than they are.  It's a movie that is part science, part "pathetic fallacy" (a term that literary teachers use for the human emotions that poets are prone to ascribe to non-human creatures).<br /><br />It's a film that leaves (quite intentionally) many questions unanswered, but its intentions are good.  It raises awareness and provokes questions about creation, nature, and humans' place in the scheme of things.  Moreover, the parallels between penguin and human relationships are undeniable, even if the "feelings" are necessarily projections of the spectators.  Any productive steps toward atoning for our own violations of natural laws--such as righting pollution and global warming--are likely to come about only if we can "feel" our inseparable relationship with nature, coming to the realization that besides being spiritual and material beings, we are indeed natural ones.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>this was a nice travelogue in the 1950s-60s disney tradition, but was nowhere near as impressive as id been led to believe. and i saw nothing cloying about the morgan freeman narration, which was serviceable in the best sense of the word. and what the hell was that stupid fuss between the lifers and the choicers claiming that this was some sort of parable about the sanctity of life? jeez, its just a nice movie about penguins!</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is one great documentary(about Emperor Penguins,as told by Oscar winner Morgan Freeman),it was a surprise hit in theatres and was a hit on DVD!!!

About every 10-15 minutes they show a Penguin dying.  However, the baby penguins are pretty cute and fun to watch (except for when they are dying).  This DVD may or may not be your cup of tea.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This penguin colony used to be near the water's edge but over time (apparently over thousands of years) the geography changed, the ice moved, and this colony wound up some 70 miles from the sea.  Rather than move as the ice moved, the penguin colony is hard wired to stay in their original spot and travel these 70 miles to the sea.  Why didn't they alter their behavior rather than take this long journey as part of their life's routine.  If it was to demonstrate their prowess, as a test to establish the survival of the best among them, then why were they at waters edge at their beginnings?<br /><br />These birds have no means of altering their facial muscles.  They are unable to give us a smile, or show fear, or sadness, or love, because they are just not built that way.  Any such emotions that were read into them by the movie's narrator are just that, something that was assumed in terms of human emotion.<br /><br />These are birds.  They most likely have strong emotions, but they should not be assumed to be the same emotions that humans have.  They have a different mate for each of their reproduction/nuturing cycles, and after they are able to find their own food, the young birds will never see their parents again.  This is not a human characteristic.  This is much closer to instinct, without involving deep emotion and sophisticated decision making.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, with beautiful views of vast nothingness in the Antarctic, and Morgan Freeman was the right person to narrate the penguins' story.  But the penguins can't be assumed to have human characteristics.  If anything, looking at their blind following of signals from their genetic make-up, the anthropomorphic characteristic closest to their behavior is "stupidity."<br /><br />What this beautiful movie shows, more than anything else, is the cruelty of nature.  These poor creatures are condemned to what, in my human view, is a terribly hard and cruel life, throughout eternity.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>illustrated with amazing photography.

But I object strenuously to the filmmakers' romanticization and anthropomorphization of their subject, even though the story naturally includes death and predation. But c'mon: "Love"? "Loyalty"? "Heroism"? Balderdash! Instinct and natural selection! (*sigh*) Actually, there's another piece of nearly the same length on the DVD that theatergoers didn't see -- "Of Penguins and Men," sort of a documentary about the making of the documentary -- which features a voiceover by the French cameraman in the understated style of Jacques Cousteau (and whom I found preferable to Morgan Freeman's rather bored narration).

I knew Antartica was a cold, harsh place, but I didn't know temperatures got down to 80 degrees below zero, with 125 mile an hour winds. That's a combined chill factor of about 200 degrees below zero, if I remember right. But somehow the penguins manage to survive here.<br /><br />The cinematography is spectacular, and one wonders how long the camera man had to wait to get some of these amazing shots, which include footage of baby chicks hatching out of their eggs, footage of the penguins swimming under the ice in the freezing water, a seabird landing near the flock and trying to kill a baby penguin, and a sea lion grabbing a penguin out of the water, and a despondent mother penguin who had lost her chick who tries to steal another mother's chick. (The other penguins intervened and refused to allow the mother to take the chic.)<br /><br />Unlike on land, the penguins are very graceful in the water and the swimming flock looks like an underwater ballet. The penguins can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes and can dive 1700 feet--far enough to reach the ocean bottom under Antartica in some places. Pinipeds or seals can also dive thousands of feet, and sperm whales are known to be able to dive a mile deep, but I didn't know penguins were capable of such feats. By contrast, a human diver unaided can only go down about 40 feet, and with an aqualung can go down about 150 feet, but that requires a different gas mix, from what I've read. Most divers never go below 90 feet.<br /><br />The DVD also contains special features such as a shorter documentary on how the expedition was mounted, planned, and filmed, and you get to meet the people who created this amazing film. One funny thing is that the special features section of the DVD includes a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "8-Ball Bunny," in which Bugs tries to return a little lost penguin to his home. The actual documentary is about 90 minutes long. I can't recall the composer who did the soundtrack, but it was good and adds to the overall ambience. In addition to this being a visually stunning and dangerous film to make, you'll also learn a lot about Antarctica and the life of the emperor penguin.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This acclaimed documentary follows penguins in Antarctica over a nine-month period, beginning with a grueling, 70-mile march to their ancestral breeding ground.  Once there, they find mates and each couple produces a single egg.  The males protect the egg and baby chick while the females return to the sea to feed for a month.  The parents take turns babysitting until one day, they just turn and walk away, leaving the young alone.  Driven by instinct and hunger, the chicks march to the sea and  begin their lives as sea creatures.<br /><br />This is a lovely movie.  It doesn't show anything that hasn't been shown before, but the extreme close-ups and leisurely pacing makes it very satisfying, there is a lilting soundtrack, and Morgan Freeman's gentle and soothing narration is exceptional.  "March" is a thoroughly enjoyable family film and the extra features, showing how the filmmakers worked in the Antarctic are fun to watch.  I had avoided seeing this movie  because I expected lots of tragic scenes of predators gobbling up defenseless penguins, but, happily, that is minimalized.  Heartily recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>The penguins are exquisite.  They almost look unreal they are so precisely sculptured and painted, their graceful bills sliced from the dark rim of the moon, their red and black lines like something from a designer of fine tuxedos, their round, dough-boy bodies with their flippers like little wings, their stoic non-expressiveness otherworldly and heroic.<br /><br />The desolate and forbidding Antarctic landscape with its immovable walls of blue-white ice and its black, rocky outcrops and the great blue and black sky above is awesome and awe-inspiring, beautiful and frightening, clearly another world as distant from our experience as another planet.<br /><br />And the story of the seventy-mile trek away from the ocean in which the penguins are so wondrously at home, where they fly through the water like something propelled, quicker than cats in their pudgy streamlined costumes, where they are expert and gluttonous fishers of fish, is nothing short of epic.  At first they march together (and glide when they can over the ice like snowmen on their bellies), male and female to the place of their birth seventy miles inland, taking tiny child-like steps.  And then they pair off and mate (the graceful courtship shown, the actual mating tastefully framed so that what we see is no more graphic than shared hugs), and then, as they stand huddled in a great mass against the wind and cold, the fertilized egg develops within the female and at length the egg is laid.<br /><br />And here the story becomes especially instructive for modern human parents.  The egg is carefully, oh, so carefully and with some haste transferred from the feather-covered warmth of the mother's pouch to that of the father's.  The transfer must not be careless or too slow because the fierce Antarctic cold will freeze the egg and the chick within in seconds.  Then the mother leaves her mate and her egg behind and begins the trek back to the ocean so that she can eat once again, and can return with rich, oily, protein-packed food from her belly to regurgitate to the chick that will be born in her absence.<br /><br />Meanwhile the fathers stand together in their living mass against the cold and wind and snow, rotating in some semi-automatic manner so that each penguin spends some time on the periphery of the mass and sometime in the warm interior.  And they do not eat.  Months go by, and they do not eat.  Finally the eggs begin to hatch and the chicks are born.<br /><br />And now the time for the mothers to return is nigh.  And the chicks peer out of their downy pouches as though looking for their mothers, and they chirp.  The fathers grow worried (I imagine) as they wait for the mothers to return and feed the hungry chicks.  Each father has exactly one egg.  Those who lost their eggs or never had an egg have left to return to the sea and to fish.  When things get very desperate, the fathers exude from their mouths a little bit of mysterious white nourishment, enough to last the chick for a day or two, a crucial day or two.<br /><br />And then at long last the mothers return, one at a time in a line from over the horizon they come.  And how welcome we can imagine they are!<br /><br />So this is a very human story, a story of monogamous parents who give everything they have to their progeny, whose struggles against the elements (and quick and hungry leopard seals in the sea) remind us of our own, except that ours seem relatively tame and not nearly as onerous.<br /><br />It is a gorgeous movie, best seen on a big screen of course with a beautiful score, a film that might be a little too emotionally demanding for small children, but one that will surely captivate older children and their parents.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Who would think that penguins were so colourful, not just the black and white, but with their cute little heads lighting up the stark landscape in strident hues of red and gold. The March of the Penguins is an amazing film, not just because you're constantly wondering how director Luc Jacquet's devoted team can actually pull off capturing a series of amazing close up shots, but also because you come to the realization that the life of a penguin is fraught with heartache, loss, and the difficulties of trying to survive in such a harshly cold climate.<br /><br />Narrated with customary preternatural calm by Morgan Freeman, this short, simple, and gorgeously photographed film follows the birds as they undertake a 70-mile trek from the sea and the source of the food to their breeding grounds, where they must find a mate, lay the egg, somehow keeping it warm against the brutal conditions, march back to an ice break to get food, hike back to the breeding grounds to feed the little ones, and fend off predators and the elements in the process.<br /><br />It's all a race against time to become organized and get the egg, and later the baby, sheltered from the terrible winter snowstorms that come sweeping over the land. Some of the eggs are exposed to the elements and don't make it, and some females never make it back, dooming the chicks. But the beauty of this movie is that it never shies away from the painful realities of living in this harsh natural world.<br /><br />Penguins make consummate, gender-emancipated parents, with mothers making the first slog, the 70 miles back and forth from the sea to forage for food, while the fathers huddle for warmth and guard the eggs. They are monogamous, for at least time it takes to take care of the chick, with their lovemaking, both lyrical and touching. Their grief when an egg or a baby dies almost unbearable, and one bereft mother's ill-fated attempt to steal a chick from another is absolutely heart trenching.<br /><br />Nature plays both devil and angel in the doggedly instinctual lives of these beautiful animals, and it's a world where divorce is never an option, at least until the chicks are self sufficient and can finally go their own way. Complete with a haunting and symphonic musical score, Luc Jacquet's film is an amazing journey of resilience and hope. Penguins have been captured on camera before, but never with quite the depth and surreal beauty that Jacquet manages to capture here.

A true story, however extraordinary. A story repeated every winter, as it has been for hundreds of thousands of years. But there has never been a generation of men to witness and shape it, to pass it down, for man has never colonized the Antarctic. The emperor penguin had never encountered man before the first polar explorers arrived barely a century ago. In 1950, when tentative, makeshift bases were established here, scientific observation had replaced legend as Man's preferred narrative." The impetus for this film is explained by the director, Luc Jacquet<br /><br />The Emperor penguin is an extraordinarily endearing creature, who despite being an animal occasionally has striking human qualities. We first meet the Emperors on their 70 mile trek to their breeding ground, full of food and fat in body. Day and night, 7 days these thousands of penguins march or waddle to meet their mates.  In the colossal cold of Antarctica, and with all of the dangers inherent, the penguins reach their destination. At this time, they meet their mates, they fall in love and an egg is hatched. It is then a 24 hour feat for the female to transfer the egg to male. It is the male's duty to shelter this egg for months from the cold and dangers. The females then devoid of nutrition make the 70 odd mile trek back to the waters to catch their food. They must eat enough to sustain them and then once again make the 70 mile trek back to the males. Meanwhile the eggs are hatching, 80% of the eggs fail. To see and hear the Emperor penguins cry and moan their loss of a baby is to bring tears to the eyes.  The mothers make it back; feed their babies, and then the fathers trek back to the ocean.<br /><br />The babies after one year, on one certain day, all of them, for the first time, dive into the ocean for their first swim. They stay there, in the ocean, for 4 years until it is their time to make the trek to mate.<br /><br />The filmmaking is extraordinary, the music superb, and the voice of the narrator, Morgan Freeman, has turned this film into one of the most superb works of art.  I see the Emperor Penguins marching, day after day in the supreme cold, full of danger all along the way, mate and meet their babies.  A tale so wonderful to behold that not enough superlatives in our language can express my wonderment.<br />Highly Recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins was originally a French documentary that was adapted for the American silver screen.

But it would have been just as good, maybe better, with no editing and no narration. Penguins are cute beyond all reason, and instead of playing against this conception to reveal the drama, the film makers, and especially narrator, reinforce it.<br /><br />This is arguably the most G-Rated, sanitized presentation of Darwinian cruelty and suffering ever created; with the exception of a few brief revelations you might think these penguins were on a hayride in Vermont. Humanity's devastation of our planet is almost complete, there are few wild places left. An intimate visit to such a truly remote and inhospitable place is fascinating, and brilliantly executed here.<br /><br />However, in their effort to create a film that was "family-friendly" the film makers forgot to point out that they were documenting the process of evolution in its most bizarre and merciless incarnation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q04XXGGED746.html">A3Q04XXGGED746</a><br/><p>This DVD goes far beyond superb photography and entertainment.

There are scenes of eggs and embryos frozen and discarded, young penguin chicks killed by the cold, and predators attacking a group of young chicks.<br /><br />One is amazed to learn that penguins may walk 70 miles to find their mates.

Parents starve to death.  And couples struggle to raise their children in a harsh world.  This is March of the Penguins.<br /><br />Penguins have been so personified as cartoon character stereotypes that they're nearly impossible to take seriously.  Where they were once comedic inspiration (e.g., Chilly Willy) they have since morphed into too-cute-to-be-real creatures known for tap dancing and drinking bottles of cola.  One viewing of March of the Penguins will dispel that perception very quickly.<br /><br />March of the Penguins follows one of innumerable penguins on their journey to and from their breeding grounds.  The challenge lies in the location of the ice floe.  The penguins must lay their eggs in a place that is thick enough to not melt, and yet the terrain shrinks and grows, making the trip longer or shorter depending on the season.  First the males, then the females, must protect the chicks against the elements, starvation and predators.  Will they survive?<br /><br />Some inevitably do not.  This is not a sappy documentary, but an unblinking portrayal of just how harsh the world can really be.  It's easy to relate to these creatures, so different from us and yet so alike.  After all, they walk.<br /><br />There are few anthropomorphic creatures that lend themselves to storytelling.  Monkeys and apes are an obvious choice, maybe prairie dogs, and then there are the penguins.  The film treats them as a tribe, and as they waddle slowly towards their inevitable destination of life and death, surrounded by ice that could be miles or feet high, we see our struggles in their own tribes.<br /><br />An excellent, sentimental film that is never too cute.

How did the camera men endure such hardship?<br /><br />It was just amazing watching the male and female penguin pass the eggs back and forth protecting the egg.  Interesting how penguins survive for months without food and waht they go through to protect their young from predators and sometimes each other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is superb as the narrator.  I found the scenery quite beautiful and relaxing.  An educational masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>This is one of the most originally presented documentaries I've ever seen.  I had no idea how involved their lives were.  Although, I must admit that about 10 minutes into the film I told my partner he could go ahead and press Play.  It takes it a bit to get enthralling.  It left me wondering what their life perspective is.  They seem to be incredibly in the moment creatures, and I wondered if they are aware of us, and if they are, what they think.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>By now, we all know that "March of the Penguins" is one of the most popular documentaries in the history of film.  It's theatrical gross set new box office records--and I think I know why.<br /><br />People like penguins--they're pretty darn cute.<br /><br />That being said, this is an impressive film documenting the mating cycle of the Emperor Penguins.  The march and subsequent 8 months dedicated to the process of mating, hatching, and rearing their young is exhausting!  And we're treated to a close-up view thanks to director Luc Jacquet.  That is the most awe-inspiring part of "March," the camera glides within the penguin habitat giving us an unprecedented look at the ritual.  And this is one painstaking effort!  You won't believe how close the shots get, how intricately you can be a part of this delicate process.  In fact, the camera work and cinematography are really what distinguish this from other nature films.<br /><br />The film is aided by a hip narration by Morgan Freeman--that voice was made for this kind of stuff.  There are some whimsically cute moments, some scary, some tragic--it's a nicely detailed portrait of life and death.  Interesting for adults, educational for kids--this is definitely a recommended effort.

On the surface, this story is about the drive of a species to reproduce, but the steady narration spoken by Morgan Freeman and the astonishing footage reveals something much more poignant:  love, dedication, determination, and a willingness to fight the odds for the survival of one's family.  It is this "humanity," the traits we recognize in ourselves, that brings this film out of the dispassionate nature film genre and into the realm of something much more raw and emotional.  Even the most hardened viewer will be touched by the disappointment, mourning, and desperation of this group of Antarctic birds that trek seventy miles every year under the harshest conditions on the planet to fall in love (yes, that's exactly what it looks like) and raise a single chick to maturity.<br /><br />With breathtaking cinematography and educational overview, this film lives up to, and even exceeds, National Geographic's high standards.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the more surprising films of 2005, and perhaps the most intriguing, was March Of The Penguins, a full-length feature film documentary cut from the same mold as a PBS National Geographic special. Directed by Luc Jacquet, the film had its origins in France, but the narrative theme is neither French, nor English, or for that matter, reflective of any nation's cultural influence. Instead, March Of The Penguins is a truly rare cinematic masterpiece that transcends borders, language, and culture. Its brilliant portrayal of the Emperor penguin in his natural habitat offers universal appeal to audiences everywhere by reinforcing the themes of love, companionship, life, and the struggle to overcome the hardships of an oftentimes cruel and unforgiving world.<br /><br />The US version of March Of The Penguins is narrated by Morgan Freeman, a stellar choice for the role as his precise, yet folksy, voice serves to underscore the magnitude and the magic of the annual journey endured by these fascinating animals. The visuals of the film are powerful in their own right, but I doubt the movie would've enjoyed the massive commercial success it did without the strength of Freeman's performance. In the opening scenes, Freeman introduces us to the Emperor penguin and its icy homeland of Antarctica. As winter approaches, penguins from all over the continent make an instinctive annual voyage across rugged and inhospitable terrain in search of the ancient Emperor penguin mating ground.<br /><br />Along the way, audiences learn every particular detail of the arduous task that awaits the Emperor penguins. With thousands gathered together, each must find a mate. Once the relationship has been consummated, a single egg is the product of their pairing. But the egg is fragile, subject to easy fracture and the hazardous conditions of extremely low temperatures. As such, the male penguin must protect the egg while the female returns to the ocean in search of food for herself and her yet to be born offspring. In the interim, high winds, driving snow, and freezing elements pound away at the swarm of male penguins as they desperately protect their respective eggs. Amazingly, the herd instinctively protects itself from the relentless cold by rotating those on the outside into the middle and vice versa, so that the burden of the cold weather is shared equally by all.<br /><br />Once winter subsides and the females return, the newly hatched baby penguins face the additional threat of predators. The males must make their own journey to the ocean, and the budding toddler penguins must be initiated into the ways of their world, all so the process can take full-circle and start all over again next year...<br /><br />One of the highest grossing theatrical documentaries ever released, March Of The Penguins is an utterly fascinating film. In contrast to the usual mind-numbing action-packed blockbusters produced by Hollywood (and demanded by those of us in the viewing public), March Of The Penguins is both educational and entertaining. You'll find yourself perched on the edge of your seat in anticipation as these rugged creatures engage with the harshest elements of nature. You'll root for the heroes and boo the villains, but despite the absence of a contrived Hollywood plot, you'll find yourself truly captivated by this charming film - the story of struggle, the story of triumph, the story of life... March of the Penguins.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>From "Mary Poppins" to "Madagascar", animated penguins have been portrayed as comical creatures with Chaplinesque walks and tuxedoed outfits. Real penguins have been spotlighted numerous times on the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. Yet for all their familiarity to us through the years, the amazing survival instinct of the emperor penguins is still something to behold. A French film crew, headed by director Luc Jacquet, spent thirteen months in the hell-freezing cold of Antarctica where temperatures range from 58 to 80 degrees below zero.<br /><br />Over the course of eighty minutes, you will see hundreds of these penguins making a seventy-mile trek to a breeding ground in Terre Ad&eacute;lle where they find mates. Apparently they have to venture that far because they need to find a place where the ice is solid enough for laying eggs. Females naturally lay the eggs, which are all the more precious because they can only produce one per pairing, but it's up to their male partners to keep them warm against the brutal conditions. Males stay to perform this one task without food for over three months, as the females march back the seventy miles to get food through an ice break. Fending off predators, they hike back to the breeding ground to feed the little ones, at which point the males depart on the same trek to seek their food. What could have been mundane is actually quite fascinating.<br /><br />What sets this apart from other animal documentaries is the intimacy of Jacquet's gorgeous photography, which captures these strange creatures in a personalized yet unobtrusive manner. The stunning cinematography is credited to Laurent Chalet and J&eacute;r?me Maison. Some of the shots have to be seen to be believed, for example, the underwater shots where the penguins dart around speedily and attempt to avoid predators like the leopard seal. Jacquet used "penguin cams" to get their perspective when swimming, and the result is startling. The inevitable scenes of death do not seem gratuitous, even when a predatory bird swoops down on the chicks. We even see an intervention scene where a grieving mother who lost her baby unsuccessfully attempts to steal someone else's.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman uses his recognizable voice to provide the illuminating narration which granted, sometimes borders on the treacly to personalize the plight of the penguins. The DVD includes two good extras - a making-of featurette, ""Of Penguins and Men", which lends Jacquet's personal perspective on the arduous filming process; and another short, "National Geographic's Crittercam: Emperor Penguins", which shows how the penguin cams allows us to see diving and feeding habits which would have been otherwise obscured by the ice. There is a trailer and even the classic Bugs Bunny cartoon short, "8 Ball Bunny", in which the rascally rabbit attempts to take a performing penguin to the South Pole even though he is from Hoboken ("Eeeeyowww...I'm dyin'!"). I always loved how the little penguin with the top hat cries ice cubes when in the bitter cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>March of the Penguins is brilliant look of these amazing animals that live in the absolute world of Antarctic. When you watch this movie you have penguins and freezing antarctic circle and the music for the background is calming and relaxing,but needless to say this movie is also very educational for the kids and the parents!!!!! You also have the legendary and talented Morgon Freeman to narrate the story of penguins!!!!!! I do recommend watching this movie you will fall in love with these amazing animals!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>*March of the Penguins* is an entertaining and educational film.  This film basically chronicles a year in the life of the Emperor penguins, which the majority of the year is spent on mating and caring for the egg.<br /><br />The film opens with a waddle of penguins coming up from water onto land.  They go on a 70-mile journey til they reach an area that's surrounded by thick ice walls and ice is thickest underneath.  (That means they're cut off from food sources.)  From there, the penguins court and mate.  The pair will be monagamous for that one particular year.<br /><br />An egg is produced, which the mother keeps warm under her on her feet.  However, after a certain amount of time has passed, she carefully passes the egg to the father.  (Some transfers will not be successful, thus the chick dies within.)  After losing a third of her weight, she goes back on the 70-mile journey back to sea to eat.<br /><br />The male penguins are the ones that have to face the harsh winter storms, while protecting the egg.  Being docile, due to lack of food and the harsh winter, they huddle together for warmth.<br /><br />The best part of the whole film is seeing the chicks hatch.  Despite not eating for a long time and losing half his weight, the father has a special food reserve only for the chick until the mother returns.  When the mother returns, there is this cute reunion of the family.  Pretty soon, the males take off to sea.  However, the journey is much shorter since the ice have melted.<br /><br />The bond between the mother and her chick is just absolutely adorable.  The chicks playing with each other is gonna make you go "awww!"  It's just cuteness overload!<br /><br />Before you know it, the mothers leave their chicks behind and take off for the sea.  However, the fathers have returned with food.  Then, they take off for the sea, leaving behind the chicks.  The chicks are on their own for a time before they take their first plunge into the sea.  These chicks will not return to land until 4 years later.<br /><br />The sceneries are just really beautiful, despite the surrounding whiteness and the harsh winter.  I love the angles on the penguins, showing you that the penguins indeed do have emotions and cognition.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman does an excellent job, providing appropriate information at the appropriate time.<br /><br />This film comes highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a terrific movie.  I found it totally captivating as did my twelve year old son.  The title has a double meaning:  it refers to the month of March when the mating cycle of the Emperor Penguins begins and also to the long march this particular colony has to make to their mating ground.  Why do they have to travel such a distance to their colony?  Well, first you have to understand that this movie is about ONE colony, there are dozens of them all around the coat of Antarctica (I did some reading after the movie).  The cycle of mating, nurturing the egg, and raising the chick, takes months and months.  It begins in their fall (our spring) through their winter, spring, and into their summer.  During the spring and summer the ice melts towards their breeding ground.  They have to be at a place that remains safe for their chicks and in the summer the sea is only a few hundred yards from their breeding ground (which is convenient for the feeding of the always hungry and rapidly growing chick).<br /><br />The story of the way the couples choose each other, create and care for the fertilized egg, and that it requires both the male and female penguin and demands on them almost to the point of death is just amazing and strangely inspiring.  I guess because raising our young for more than twenty years requires a similar kind of dedication, but not as concentrated as the penguin couple's absolute focus over one brief season.<br /><br />The DCD also has a full length program on the making of the movie.  This is as fascinating as the movie in its own way.  The French filmmakers provide their own narration and at times their prose gets a bit much about how much they are sacrificing and so one.  While I take my hat off to them for giving a year in such awful conditions to get the footage, they did choose to do it.  But this documentary on the making of the film provides extra footage of the penguins that couldn't be in the G-rated version of the film and we get to see what they had to go through to get some of the amazing shots we see in the film.<br /><br />There is also a short program from National Geographic on the Emperor Penguins that is pretty good.  It is terribly marred by its childish quick cutting to add fake excitement of those with attention deficit disorder, and its constant harping about how global warming might impact the penguins and that we should all be up in arms about it.  As if the penguins haven't adapted to changes in climate over the past millions of years.  Give me a break.<br /><br />And finally, there is the delightful cartoon about Bugs Bunny trying to take an Ice-Show penguin who gets separated from his troupe back to the South Pole.<br /><br />This is a must have DVD and I recommend that everyone watch it and discuss it with their family and friends.  Just great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>I have long been an admirer of penguins, so when this film was released in the cinema, my friends variously and collectively rushed to inform me of the film. I went to see it, and was amazed.<br /><br />The plot of the film is extraordinarily simple - the film follows the Emperor Penguins of Antarctica during their annual mating and rearing cycle. It is framed from start to finish in terms of the march - the march from the sea to the mating spot, the march to return to the sea for food, the march again for rearing the young, and the march again finally to return to the sea.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humour and grace; penguins are gentle beings, vulnerable to predators and to the hazards of the winter - despite being fashioned for some of the coldest climates on earth, they nonetheless require warmth, particularly for their eggs and the hatchlings. In the severe cold and far-below-zero windchills, many do not make it, and the one negative side of the film for me was a somewhat constant lingering on this downside. While it is a part of nature, it still becomes a bit more tragic in the cycle of the film than it needs to be. As this is billed as a family film, I worried that some of the children viewing might be more emotionally upset at this than they needed to be.<br /><br />Still, the details presented are fascinating, and it is a true testament to filmmaking that these shots and images were captured as dramatically, humourously, gracefully and beautifully as they were.<br /><br />This film has 'Academy Award' written all over it, in many categories. Cinematography, musical score, directing, documentary - these are only some of the categories in which this film is likely to get a nod. Morgan Freeman never appears on camera, but gives a wonderful reading as the narrator of this visual feast, adding subtle emphasis that never detracts and often adds to the tale in the English-language version of this film.<br /><br />Director Luc Jacquet and cinematographers, Laurent Chalet and Jerome Maison have produced a masterpiece that transcends language barriers (indeed, there is no native human language for Antarctica). A French team, they have translated this film into many languages around the world, as people everywhere will find something with which they can relate.<br /><br />Perhaps the most skillful part of the filming was to make Antarctica seem so varied in texture and place; on a continent covered with ice and snow, one still gets the sense of the length of the journey, the beauty inherent in the surroundings, and the dangers involved for the penguins.<br /><br />Through the credits, one gets to see the film crew in some light-hearted scenes with curious penguins.  These are expanded upon in the DVD version, with many more scenes of penguins swimming, diving and feeding in truly remarkable filming.  There is also a Warner Brothers short animation as a bonus.  The audio track can be done in English or Spanish (French is also available as subtitles) - because of the nature of this film, overdubbing in different languages is in no way a detraction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>So I was over my Grandpa's house Christmas day and he had the March of the Penguins DVD sitting on the sofa. I have heard good things about it and I was already getting bored with my relatives, so I popped in the DVD. The first thing you will hear is the excellent narration by Morgan Freeman (great choice) followed by the scenery that doesn't seem real. It is so amazing how this movie was filmed without interfering with the animals. It's like your right there with them, and by the time the film is over, you really feel like you know these magnificent birds as though they were human. After viewing this film, I will never complain about having a rough life or look at a penguin the same way again. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, please God, don't have me come back as a penguin. I hate the cold!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>WOW!  What a penguin movie.  When that popular penguin craze was taking place across the country a few years ago, March of the Penguins was viewed by many as the ULTIMATE penguin film.  This film does so many incredible things, and does them correctly on ALL counts.<br /><br />Are you an emotional person?  If the answer is yes, you will feel joy, happines, and sadness while watching March of the Penguins, ESPECIALLY if you're an animal person.  Someone who understands and appreciates animals will probably find themselves really attached to the penguins in this movie.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman was the PERFECT choice for narrator.  His very calm and soothing way of speaking is simply in a perfect world of its own, and he proves it here with a tremendous performance.<br /><br />Is it just me, or does it seem like you can REALLY see the male and female penguins communicating with each other?  It's almost like they're talking to each other the same way people do!  It's just they're not speaking using human words, haha.  It's fascinating.  Of course it's also possible my mind is just playing tricks with me.<br /><br />If that's the case, why is it that when the mother penguins return home to their babies, they immediately look down at their babies and appear to smile with joy?  You can clearly sense happiness in their eyes.<br /><br />You can even tell the difference between the males and females just by looking into their eyes.<br /><br />Some amazing creatures penguins are.  You WILL learn things you never knew about penguins just by following along to the story-telling.<br /><br />When the male and female penguins finally reunite after several months and stand close to each other with their baby between them, proving to the other penguins that they're a family... this is definitely a *very* special moment to watch.<br /><br />The storyline mainly focuses on the long and bitter journey that the male and female penguins have to make over the course of a long and severe winter in Antarctica.  BOTH the male and female penguins have quite the task!<br /><br />I complain when it's 30 degrees outside.  These penguins have to deal with temperatures below -60 WITH wind chill on top of that!  Talk about tough winters!<br /><br />You will learn so many things, which brings me to my next point-<br /><br />The camera crew did an ASTOUNDING job showing us up close shots of the penguins, and the way each penguin has to go about their lives just to survive.<br /><br />Thanks to the brilliant camera work, you can easily notice the look on the penguins faces as they communicate with their babies, and when they communicate with their mates.  It's what I believe to be picture-perfect quality camera work.<br /><br />Job well done by EVERONE involved in the making of March of the Penguins.  All the work that was done filming the 100-plus hours of footage has certainly paid off.  None of these incredible shots would have even been possible without the persistent job on the part of the cameramen.<br /><br />Just an incredible movie.  Children will love it for the learning aspect, adults will love it because of the incredible role of parenting the penguins have to carry through every single year (and have done for centuries) and parents will find themselves being able to relate to it (to an extent of course).<br /><br />One thing's for sure, everyone will leave with a new appreciation for how difficult it is being a penguin.<br /><br />The soundtrack that plays is VERY good.  It plays at all the appropriate moments, and it's sometimes melodic, and overall the orchestrated music really captures the feel and gigantic, mysterious beauty that is Antarctica.<br /><br />I also learned some things NOT related to penguins, such as what it's like seeing the sun finally rise in Antarctica after a lengthy period of solid darkness.  The sun actually rises, slowly moves to the left for a short time, then sets again. I was not aware how the sun rises and sets in places like Antarctica and Alaska.  Now I know!<br /><br />Also, about 30 minutes into the film, what the HECK was that?  Green and yellow lights DARTING across the night sky at lightning speed.  I HOPE those lights were actually sped up for the sake of the movie, haha.<br /><br />EXCELLENT film.  March of the Penguins is a perfect movie for everyone.</p></br></body></html>

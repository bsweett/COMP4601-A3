Dr. Loomis shot Michael Myers six times, he fell from the second level of the house, and managed to walk away before Dr. Loomis could notice.  This continued fight for Laurie Strode's life and the struggle to capture Michael Myers has many gripping scenes that make this sequel better than most other movie sequels.  The multiple unexpected twists and turns give the horror genre a great name.  Such action keeps audiences interested the whole time.  In the meantime, secrets are revealed about Myers's motives, and the most surprising one is in this &quot;Halloween&quot; edition.  All events blend wonderfully, leading to a powerful conclusion.  Jamie Lee Curtis beautifully plays Strode, maintaining her character throughout the movie.  All of her actions, namely her injury, are convincing.  Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis wonderfully, adding his own sense of struggle into the movie's theme.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  &quot;Halloween 2&quot; is a great movie to watch on Halloween or any other day that feels right.  This is sure to please many horror movie fans.  Anyone interested in watching this movie should watch part one first.  Otherwise, everything will be confusing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>If you ask John Carpenter how he got thru those long nights of writing out the screenplay for the sequel to &quot;Halloween&quot; his answer would consist of seven words - &quot;A 12 pack of Budweiser. Every night.&quot; He is also quoted, asking, &quot;How can you make a sequel to a movie that doesn't need one?&quot; In the wake of the monster success of &quot;Halloween&quot;, the film generated a lot of knockoff films. Some good, (&quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;When A Starnger Calls&quot;, &quot;Phantasm&quot;) and some real bad (&quot;Prom Night&quot;, &quot;Terror Train&quot; and pretty much the rest of the genre). So, it was inevitable that &quot;Halloween II&quot; would be unleashed. &quot;Universal Pictures&quot; threw it's hat in the slasher ring after it saw the unexpected success of &quot;Paramount Pictures&quot;' film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and bought the rights to two &quot;Halloween&quot; films (&quot;II&quot; and the awful &quot;Halloween III&quot;). &quot;Halloween II&quot; is a decent entry that has suspense, but, doesn't have the psychological hold the original has (for me this film is third best in the franchise right behind &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween: H20&quot;).<p>Picking up seconds after the original, Dr. Loomis finds Sherriff Brackett and continues the hunt for &quot;The Shape&quot; known as Michael Myers. As for Laurie Strode, she's been taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, to tend to the severe wounds that were inflicted upon her in &quot;Halloween&quot;. Unbeknownst to all, &quot;The Shape&quot; knows where Laurie is and its only a matter of time before he gets to her.<p>This isn't a bad sequel, but, it does have some faults. The gore factor is turned up a bit (slashed throats are exposed, a burn victims face is shown up close, etc.). The scares are the jump out of the seat kind, rather than the psychological type that was evident thru &quot;Halloween&quot;. That film had exposed everybody's primal fear of having the feeling of being watched and turning around and no one is there (not so with &quot;II&quot;). By the time &quot;Halloween II&quot; was released, audience's tastes had changed for more gore, and out of the seat thrills (thanks to &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;). Its like you could compare the first two &quot;Halloween&quot; films with two types of &quot;Coors&quot; beer, in the respect that &quot;Halloween&quot; is &quot;Coors&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot; is &quot;Coors Lite&quot;. Spooky stuff - less scary. Keep an eye out for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumni Dana Carvey (the church lady!) as a T.V. cameraman (you will have to pause your DVD player to see him).</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>The Sequel to the everlasting classic. And it does not let me down one bit! This is still one of my favorite horrors of all time and will remain that way forever. The suspense doesn't die down, even in the slow parts  that all of the Halloween movies seem to experience. The killings are  executed beautifully and the body count has risen to quite a high number.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>When it comes to keeping a consistent plot the Halloween series has been the absolute worst. 1 and 2 follow each other okay, 3 is the joker in the pack, Return, Revenge and Curse were nothing but gibberish and H20 and Resurrection have been poor 'post-modern' exersizes in convention merely using the Halloween name.<br /><br />Right after the original Halloween ended, Laurie is taken away to get stitched up, but Michael Myers ain't quite dead yet. Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very, very slowly goes about his killing machine business. Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange, offbeat way. No one listens to him, of course and they end up dead.<br /><br />It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness. The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obselete today. But it does have one purpose: to always look good when compared to the drek of 'horror' we suffer today. This first sequel, coming a mere three years after the original, already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point. There's no purity or class here.<br /><br />Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. What happened to Jimmy? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later? What? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers (Age 23) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter (which he does again in Revenge)?<br /><br />This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper. The sound is in not-bad-for-its-day Dolby Stereo. There are no features to speak of, which is annoying since Universal originally promised us commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes etc. Pick it up cheap.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This movie fails in many ways. It has "let's make a sequel but forget the plot" all over it. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Michael Meyer's much sought after victim. In a way, she is the film's main drawcard. Check out the wig she wears in this film (apparently her hair was too short compared to the first film, but needed to be rectified because the sequel took place the same night). Ok, can live with that, but how many people go to an empty hospital? Well in this movie, it seems like Jamie Lee Curtis is the only patient there.<br />Halloween 2 does have some scary moments, but it also has a few continuity problems. For example, there is a scene where a nurse is heading to the hospital to work nightshift after being out with a friend, but has to take the friend home first. When they leave the parking spot, Michael is in the carpark and can then be seen walking up the street. But when the nurse arrives at the hospital after dropping her friend off, Michael is in the back seat! Impossible !<br />The film's score is a remixed version of the original Halloween theme and it spoils it in a way. The original score was indeed better.<br />John Carpenter did not direct this film, he produced it (he directed the first film). It is rumoured that he saw problems with this film early on, but was unable to fix it in his capacity. Halloween 2 is only worth owning if you wish to complete the series.<br />DVD SUMMARY: Ok, there are various versions of the DVD floating around. The one I have is pretty bad. It is taken from a dirty film print, and you even get the reel change marks thrown in. The print is non-anamorphic and lacks any sharpness. The audio mix is mono surround. The extras include production notes and a trailer. A Special Edition of this movie may occur one day, but essentially it's a bad film - so unlikely to get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>HALLOWEEN 2 is a unique film in many ways, because it picks up the chain of events of the original HALLOWEEN basically right at the end of that film and continues them.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are back, with the masked figure known as Michael Myers still stalking the streets of Haddonfield.  This time, much of the murderous mayhem is centered around the local clinic where Curtis has been hospitalized...and here it is revealed exactly why the madman is targeting her.<p>Because Michael Myers couldn't even be stopped by Pleasance's gun at the end of HALLOWEEN 1, this sequel may actually have been necessary.  And certainly for the most part, director Rick Rosenthal, helped by ace cinematographer Dean Cundey (who later shot JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13), keeps his focus on suspense, in the tradition of the original.<p>But something sure went wrong when it was finished.  Reportedly, feeling that this suspenseful emphasis might make HALLOWEEN 2 look old-fashioned in light of such HALLOWEEN-inspired imitators such as FRIDAY THE 13TH, Carpenter (who was only co-producer/co-writer this time, along with Debra Hill) went back in (without Rosenthal's knowledge) and shot some graphically gory murder inserts.  This is really a shame!  The sequel may have been necessary, but the explicit violence and gore weren't!<p>This makes HALLOWEEN 2, for me, a curiously disappointing film.  Had Carpenter not tinkered with Rosenthal's methods by trying to liven up things with a bunch of unnecessarily gory murders, this could have equalled the original.  Instead, it's not much better than HALLOWEEN's many imitators.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>I just said it, this is scarrier than the first Halloween. There is more gore, more better jump scares, and more susspense. The only part that I found of distaste was the scalding the nurese's face in hot water scene, because it was disturbing and also she was a beutiful woman. My favorite in the series is Halloween: H20. Get this with Halloween 1 and H20 now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>I just viewed "Halloween 2" last night and I have to say it is a surprisingly good sequel to the 1978 classic. The film was released in 1981 and takes place on the same night as the original (October 3, 1978) and continues the story. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is brought to the local hospital where she is recovering from wounds caused by the maniacal Michael Myers. There he tracks her down to finish what he started and as a result a series of murders takes place.<br /><br /> To me what was exceptionally inventive is the reason Michael wants to kill Laurie and it is revealed about half-way through the film.<br /><br /> On a paltry $2.5 million budget "Halloween 2" grossed a very impressive $26,000,000 and fans simply loved it. My only problem with the movie was Jamie Lee's wardrobe. LOL.<br /><br /> This was to be the franchise's final film, but due to impressive box office sales other sequels and movies were made that should never have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Picking up where Halloween left off, Laurie is taken to hospital while Dr. Loomis continues to search for Michael Myers. Drugged, traumatized and injured, Laurie nevertheless realizes that she is not safe and tries to escape from the hospital, exactly the place that Michael is headed, slashing his way through body after body to get to Laurie. Laurie displays the same resilience and resourcefulness that made Halloween such a groundbreaking movie, but her role is much smaller in this film. Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis gives another excellent performance as well.<br /><br />This movie could have been much better with a larger role for Laurie and some exploration of the relationship between Laurie and Michael, but it remains one of the few horror films in which a woman shows strength simply for her own survival, and not some feminine duty, like saving a child or lover. Overall, not as strong as the original, but one of the best entries in the Halloween franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Michael Myers is still at large and no less dangerous than ever. After a failed reunion to reach his baby sister at their old home, Laurie Strode is immediately taken to a hospital to be treated by the wounds that had been afflicted by her brother a few hours ago. However, Michael isn't too far off and will continue his murdering 'Halloween' rampage until he gets his sister all to himself. Zombie's interest in character interaction and moral ambiguity gives "Halloween II" a depth that, for those with the stomach to take it, is downright refreshing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 3:12 Mins<br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4Q">Halloween II</a></p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!<br /><br />  "Halloween II" is one of the best sequels ever made in horror history.  It begins exactly where the first one ended - Michael Myers is shot and falls from the balcony.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance reprise their roles as Laurie Strode and Dr. Sam Loomis.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill wrote the suspenseful script and Rick Rosenthal provided great direction.  The eerie trademark soundtrack from the original is also used in this superb sequel.<br /><br />  If you enjoy a high body count, you will enjoy "Halloween II."  Michael Myers pursues Laurie Strode to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital; he begins dispatching the entire staff within its sanitized, claustrophobic corridors.  In this sequel, we learn why Michael Myers is intent on destroying Laurie.  We also learn that Michael Myers is well versed in the ancient occult religion of Druidism.<br /><br />  Michael Myers is Samhain, the Lord of the Dead.  He can't be killed because he is already dead.  Satanic evilness has possessed his body and given it the illusion of life.  Bullets and fire can not stop him.<br /><br />  This film is a must see for fans of high body count slasher flicks and horror films set at hospitals.  "Visiting Hours" is also highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>Michael Return for another night of murder & mayhem.<br />Michael returns to finish what he started in part 1,<br />kill Lori Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis)his sister,<br />And anyone that gets in his way.<br />Then you got Doctor Loomis(Donald Pleasant)that is<br />racing against the clock to find Lori before Michael does.<br />As Michael kills off the hospital staff where Lori is staying,<br />Michael comes in her room to kill her, but she not there.<br />As she's walking down the hall a nurse calls her name she turn around,<br />Michael walks up behind the nurse sticks a knife in her back and lifts her off the floor and then drops her back to the floor and starts to chase Lori.<br />Lori ends up in the basement where she crawls through a window to getaway from Michael, then runs to a elevator She barely gets the door shut before Michael get there.<br />She get out of the elevator and runs out to the parking lot hides in a car as she's sitting there one of the staff member gets in the car and passes out, Lori see Doctor Loomis Drive up she get out of the car and to proceed to the door she sees Michael comin at her.<br />She get to the door and starts banging on it, Doctor Loomis runs to the door and opens the door.<br />A couple seconds later Michael came busting through the door, Doctor Loomis shots him he goes down, the police goes to check if he was dead Michael grab him cut his throat.<br />Michael starts to chase Lori & the Doctor.<br />The doctor and Lori finally get in this operating room, The doctor gives Lori a gun.<br />Michael walks in the room and stabs the doctor and then comes at Lori, she takes the gun and shots him in his eyes.<br />The doctor comes to, Michael swing his knife around trying to cut someone but can't see, the doctor starts to release some gas in the room that is flammable.<br />Lori gets out of the room and goes out in the hall way.<br />The doctor says to Michael it's time and lights a lighter and the whole place bursts into flames.<br />I rate this dvd a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Jamie Lee Curtis returns for the second time as "Laurie Strode".<br />Also returning: Donald Pleasence, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis (Kyes), Nancy Stephens.<br />  As the movie begins where John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) ended, first you are treated to 2 minutes of the edited original ending, but wait...the body of Michael Myers has disappeared.

The most intriguing aspect of the film is that the audience learns the motive behind Michael's captivation with Jamie Lee Curtis's character--and this connection is vital to the success of the rest of the series.  Both Pleasance and Curtis are average in their performances and Rosenthal is only adequate as Carpenter's replacement.  Should have been the conclusion of the series; however, six more installments were created after.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Three years after director John Carpenter's low-budget horror film "Halloween" debuted in theaters, taking both Hollywood and audiences by surprise; the masked killer, Michael Myers, was back and ready to take another stab at the one that got away.<br /><br />"Halloween 2" picks up immediately where the first film ended. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has just lived through one of the most traumatic nights of her life and believes herself to be safe from any further harm. Sometimes though, appearances can be deceiving. For even though Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) shot Laurie's would-be killer Michael Myers numerous times; somehow, the masked lunatic survived and managed to evade capture by the authorities. Now, as Laurie is taken to the local hospital, her seemingly unstoppable predator patiently bides his time, just waiting for the perfect moment to strike. With only Dr. Loomis and a handful of police officers and hospital workers standing between Michael and his quarry, Laurie's night of terror may have only just begun.<br /><br />I've heard it said many times in regards to the plethora of horror franchises, "This series (insert horror franchise of choice) would have been better off if it would have ended after number one." Generally speaking this statement is fairly accurate. In fact, we could look at numerous horror franchises, and even some from other genres, to which this would apply. However, I will spare you my picks for that rather lengthy list, in order to discuss whether or not the burgeoning `Halloween' franchise has been doomed to a place therein.<br /><br />Penned by the returning writing and producing duo of John Carpenter and Debra Hill, the film takes us through the remaining hours of that terrifying night depicted in the original. Carpenter and Hill do their level best to retain that special something that made their first movie's story work so well. Yet, despite their best efforts the film never really seems to grab hold in the way its predecessor did.<br /><br />The dialogue was stronger in some places, but still suffered from an over-abundance of clich&eacute;s (which now seems to be a horror movie tradition) and several moments of blandness. While the dialogue was somewhat improved, the suspenseful nature of the original was almost nowhere to be found, much to the chagrin of many a fan. Lastly, there is the obvious lack of character development that runs more or less across the board. This oversight in the story actually surprised me given that franchise originator John Carpenter co-wrote the script. I expected him of all people to continue trying to expand upon the characters he had created. Oddly enough, one of the characters that received some development (albeit ever so briefly touched upon and clumsily handled) is the killer himself, Michael Myers. Aside from that brief moment for Michael, character development was quite scant, and didn't really seem to occur at all until the final half-hour or so of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps these problems were a result of the fact that John Carpenter has admitted on several occasions that he hadn't really planned ahead for a second installment, and that he only intended to make just the one film. Although, to be honest his excuse has always seemed a little hard to believe when one considers the wide open ending of "Halloween". Anyways, maybe there is some truth in his words, because it's possible that John hadn't really considered continuing the series beyond the first movie, and that any potential sequels were expected to be handled by someone else in every respect. If you think about it, crafting a story that follows a successful movie cannot be an easy task, no matter how talented the screenwriter may be. To make matters worse, having a screenplay that runs into a severe snag approximately halfway through the film isn't exactly a confidence booster either.<br /><br />Case in point, when the writer of a story, or in this case a screenplay, realizes that they do not have an ending for their narrative, this typically means that the movie should be a no-go. Yet, in this rare instance, the lack of resolution presented the screenwriters with a chance to deliver a surprising revelation that would provide the plot with a satisfying conclusion. The revelation, although ostracizing to some fans of the original due to the affect it had on the previous film's story, resulted in the series having a much more intimate overall storyline than it would have had otherwise.<br /><br />As for the film's director, Rick Rosenthal was placed in the unenviable position of helming a follow-up to the very film that by all accounts created the sub-genre the series now exists within. To Rick's credit he tried to recapture the look and feel of the first film via the use of long tracking shots throughout the various locales in the film, and numerous times placed us once more into the shoes of Michael Myers. For the most part, Rick did an admirable job, and it is during those times, listed a moment ago, that the movie really starts to work. However, even during this movie's stronger moments there are still two key elements to the first film's success that were noticeably absent from this one's visual style.<br /><br />First, there was the lack of subtlety in the scares and/or death scenes. The first film relied heavily on shadows and implication during these moments. By not showing as much of what was happening within the scene, the audience was then forced to imagine the events based on their sounds and shadows moving; thus, the audience's own imaginations and fears could take over resulting in potentially bigger scares. As I said, with "Halloween 2" the subtlety is essentially gone; in its place, a higher body count and much more gore. Supposedly, the stylistic exchange of more gore for subtlety was a result of re-shoots courtesy of John Carpenter who reportedly wanted the film to be able to go toe-to-toe with its slasher film competition. Whatever the case may be, I feel the decision was detrimental to the end result. Frankly, I'm surprised that John Carpenter didn't see that flaw in the decision himself.<br /><br />The second stylistic element that was lacking, although "changed" is probably a more accurate wording, was having Michael Myers extremely visible throughout the entirety of the film. In the original, we had glimpses of Michael for a majority of the time, and were shown more of him near the end. Despite the fact that we already knowing what he looks like, that didn't mean he needed to be more out in the open. Much of the fear Michael's character evoked was a result of him sticking predominantly to the shadows. Once that factor is removed he was no longer as mysterious, or even frightening for that matter; instead, he was just another masked man with a knife trying to kill this one young woman that got away.<br /><br />Speaking of the one that got away, Jamie Lee Curtis was made into a star with her portrayal of would-be victim Laurie Strode. Her performance in the original film was so much more mature than one would usually expect from a horror film character. Of course, the role made such a strong connection with the audience due to the surprising amount of character development that occurred over the course of the movie, a trait that is generally unheard of in horror. However, in this installment, Jamie's character is reduced to nothing more than a nearly catatonic zombie; effectively wasting her talents as an actress, while doing virtually nothing to enhance the character of Laurie Strode and her involvement in the series. Honestly, it almost seemed as if Jamie was included in the film in order to ensure some star power to attract audiences and nothing else.<br /><br />Once again leading the supporting cast members is Donald Pleasence as Michael's former shrink Dr. Loomis. In the last film, Donald received nearly as much screen time and character development as Jamie Lee; thankfully, that was not the case here (in terms of character development, that is). The character of Dr. Loomis appeared to be stalling in terms of his development early on in the film, and for a moment Donald Pleasence looked as if he too was going to be another wasted talent in this picture. However, unlike with Jamie Lee, Loomis' role became much more intriguing once the big revelation occurred within the story, and his obsession to stop Michael once and for all really kicked into high gear. Within the movie's final half-hour Donald really began to sink his teeth into the role of Loomis, and the change in his character's resolve and demeanor were very well conveyed throughout the closing moments of his performance.<br /><br />The other supporting characters share many of the same attributes as their predecessors from the original; the only big difference is that this time most of the characters are in their early twenties to thirties rather than teenagers. That being said, their age doesn't appear to have resulted in maturity for most of them. For instance, Leo Rossi's ("Relentless") character only seems to exist in the movie to fulfill the role of the horny teenager, but as an adult. Then, there's Pamela Shoop who seems to have slightly more going on upstairs than Leo Rossi's character, but not by much. Her role is to provide the obligatory, and completely gratuitous, nude scene so that young teenage males watching the movie won't be disappointed. Lastly, there's Lance Guest ("The Last Starfighter") who aside from Jamie Lee appears to be the youngest member of the main cast of characters. Lance doesn't give much of a noteworthy performance, but he is clearly trying to make his character more interesting than just a carbon copy of what's come before. Overall, the supporting cast, Donald Pleasence excluded, were as pointless in their existence as those of the original and maybe even more so.<br /><br />It was quite clear from the get-go that this particular follow-up was not going to come anywhere close to matching the quality of "Halloween". While the movie is plagued by more problems than the first film; there were still moments where it did shine (mostly when it was emulating the stronger elements of its predecessor). In the end, "Halloween 2" is a slightly below average sequel that doesn't doom the series, but any more problems and it would have been a different story.<br /><br />"Halloween 2" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>OK, later on that same halloween night in Haddonfield, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is whisked away to the hospital, only to be stalked by her demonic shadow, Michael Myers. Laurie is her old quivering, yet resourceful self. Michael is the unstoppable dreadnaut of death. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still raving about Michael and stalking the evil stalker. The hospital setting is cool and adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. I love Laurie and Michael's "relationship". She's the magnet and he's the murderous iron shaving. They are drawn together by forces beyond them both, as the perfect killer / victim. I recommend Halloween 2, especially for it's excellent chase sequence between Laurie and Michael. Watch H2 as a double feature w/ the original...</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>As good of a sequel as they could have made, and a darn good one at that. Meyers returns on the same night as the murders in Part 1, tracking Laurie down to the hospital where more murder ensues. There's a little more cheesy slasher gore here, but the music and the way this movie has been filmed make this one another classic. Not to mention a surprise twist ending and another showstopping performance from the great Donald Pleasance.</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>As the movie's slogan reads, &quot;The Nightmare Isn't Over Yet&quot;. The original cast and crew return for the sequel to one of the all-time greatest horror films. While the film is supposed to take place on the same night as the original massacre, it was actually filmed three years later. Many members of the cast, most notably Jamie Lee Curtis have aged since then but hey, it's all in fun, right? <p>Michael Myers isn't dead and he's still killing teenagers like nobody's business. His shrink, Dr. Loomis is still trying to warn the residents of his old neighborhood but little is being done. The original victim, Lorie Strode is in the local hospital so it's only a matter of time before Myers shows up there and perfoms surgery on the staff. <p>&quot;Halloween II&quot; is not quite on the level of its classic predecassor but it is still a worthy sequel. It does rely a lot more on gore than the original but this is to be expected. Donald Pleasance is the real star here. With Curtis nearly catatonic through the majority of the film, Pleasance really steps up. His portrayal of Loomis is such an intergral and often overlooked piece of the Halloween series. Without Pleasance in the latter films, the Halloween series has become just another run-of-the-mill slasher series but these earlier films were real treats.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I've always read that Halloween 4 is thought to be the best sequel. HARDLY (in my opinion).<br /><br />This film picks right up where the first one left off. If you thought the first one was good, this one is amazing. After he is shot by Dr. Loomis at the end of Halloween, Michael Meyers disappears and part two follows the search for him through the neighborhood and to the local hospital. There, he stalks and kills the staff on his way to Laurie, who is a patient there due to her wounds in the first Halloween. If you liked the first Halloween, you'll love Halloween II. If you're planning on going to see the latest Halloween film, do yourself a favor and go rent part II and stay at home.</p></br><a href="../users/A34HYQ9BQZPE78.html">A34HYQ9BQZPE78</a><br/><p>Picking up exactly where the original left off "Halloween 2" is able to deliver just as much horror movie entertainment as the original "Halloween". Everything about this movie makes it a classic; reinforcing the character development of the first movie while developing the new characters shown here, the plot, the series of events, and the acting, which I forgot to mention in my review of the original "Halloween". Probably most memorable are the talents of both Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis, who is probably the best horror-movie hero I've seen and shows Donald's acting skills, and Jamie Lee Curtis as her role of Laurie, who returns as the scream queen.<br /><br />Comparatively, this movie is more graphic than the original "Halloween", which virtually didn't show a drop of blood, and DEFINITELY didn't show a dude in a creepy Halloween mask getting smashed between two trucks before a fiery explosion occurred. (Which is one of my favorite moments in the movie!) So yes, "Halloween 2" is a bit more graphic than the original "Halloween", and is just as scary and suspenseful.<br /><br />What I did notice about this movie is the chilling, dream-like atmosphere. I know most slashers have a somewhat earthy element, but there's something about the dark, deserted hallways of the hospital late at night on Halloween that sets an intense and dream-like atmosphere, which seriously fascinated me with the movie, especially considering I didn't pick up on that the last time I saw it. So this movie is able to be scary, graphic and atmospheric all at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, while stylistically it's somewhat different from the original "Halloween", "Halloween 2" is just as good a movie, if not better. For fans of slasher films or horror films in general, especially those who want a movie with a chilling, dream-like atmosphere, "Halloween 2" will be a scream! Pick it up in time for Halloween night, too, so you can enter the dark realm of terror known as the scariest night of the year. Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>Halloween 1 was a classic. Halloween 2 does not disappoint us as the sequel. Again starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence with their wonderful acting, Halloween 2 is just as if not more scarier and suspenseful than part 1. Although taking place in a hospital, that does not take away from this great movie. Michael Myers is back and still out to get his sister. Of course, others lose their lives along the way! Excellent movie just like part 1!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>The original 'Halloween' is considered a classic by many. "Halloween II" is a true sequel which starts off right where the first film ends, a very effective way to get fans of the original drawn into this installment. This film has a much larger budget and it shows, but the film lacks the eerrie quality as the original.

With new director Rick Rosenthal, HALLOWEEN 2 picks up the story literally moments after where the original left off.<br /><br />We follow the wounded Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the Haddonfield Clinic where she's sedated and treated for her stab wounds.  Outside, deranged Michael Myers is again on the warpath, with Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) intent on stopping him once and for all.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 2 delivers more gory moments in lieu of the suspense from the original movie (ie: a nurse gets a drill through her head, and a sexy intern is scalded and drowned in an overheated hydrotherapy pool).  Jamie Lee Curtis spends the whole film either lying on a gurney or limping through corridors in her flimsy hospital gown.  Donald Pleasence is a real treat, as he ramps up the over-acting in his role of Loomis.<br /><br />But why is the hospital so quiet?  Where are all the patients?  Doesn't anybody get sick in Haddonfield?  The semi-abandoned hospital scenes are almost cliche, but the backdrop provides lots of great ammunition for the unstoppable Michael Myers.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 2 still stands up quite well next to the original movie.  Fans would have to wait 20 years for Jamie Lee Curtis to make her long-awaited return as Laurie in HALLOWEEN H20.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN scared millions of people back in 1978. It was filmed on $300,000 budget in the course of three weeks in the Spring of 1978. But in 1981, director Rick Rosenthal, with the help of original HALLOWEEN producers, John Carpenter (director of the first film) & Debra Hill, brought us HALLOWEEN 2.<br /><br />  Filmed in 1981, but picking up on October 31st, 1978, where LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) has been rescued by DR. SAM LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance), Michael gets up on walks away, for he has not yet finished, nor will he ever be finished, his business in Haddonfield. Laurie is found by the police and ambulance and is taken to safety at the Haddonfield Hospital to be treated for her stab wounds and fractured ankle.<br /><br />  MICHAEL MYERS (played by Dick Warlock) is still at large. He wanders into the Elrod's place, steals a kitchen knife and goes on his way. But his blood left on the cutting board scares the hell out of Mrs. Elrod, causing her to scream in front. ALICE (played by Anne Bruner), The Elrod's next-door neighbor, comes out, concerned, but realizes that it is probably nothing major, but in Alice's case, it is, since Michael appears kills her off.<br /><br />  Earlier, Laurie was taken to the hospital by two paramedics named BUD (played by Leo Rossi) and JIMMY (played by Lance Guest), who is the older brother of one of Laurie's classmates. At the hospital, DR. FREDRICK MIXTER (played by FORD RAINY) requires that she be put under the gas for rest, but Laurie is so terrified that she does not want to sleep, but the Dr. goes against her wishes.<br /><br />  Dr. Loomis has already caught up with SHERIFF LEIGH BRACKETT (again played by Charles Cyphers). They search the whole neighborhood for Michael. They found a supposed Michael Myers. As they chase him, Michael walks into the street, where is he rammed by a police car and slammed into a truck, where he and the truck explodes. The guy in Myers' mask was not Michael Myers. At that moment, DEPUTY HUNT (played by Hunter Von Leer) drives up and tells Brackett about the three kids murdered in Lindsey Wallace's house, and reveals that one of them is Annie, Leigh's daughter, and Laurie's best friend. They pull up, and Brackett looks at his daughter one last time, and storms off, pissed at Loomis for supposedly letting Michael escape, in which, Dr. Loomis hadn't done so. Hunt decides to help Dr. Loomis out in this ordeal.<br /><br />  Awhile later, Jimmy is talking to Laurie about what happened. He reveals that the guy trying to kill her tonight was Michael Myers. She is shocked to learn this, since she has heard about Michael killing his older sister 15 years earlier. She realizes that she last heard that he was locked up, but Jimmy tells Laurie that Michael did escape.<br /><br />  Awhile later, Bud and his girlfriend, KAREN (played by Pamela Susan Shoop), a nurse on the maternity floor, are in the physical therapy tub, but Bud gets out to check the temperature, after Michael had turned up to the hottest temp. There, Michael strangles Bud, but Karen doesn't hear a thing. Michael walks in and drowns Karen in the burning hot water.<br /><br />  Dr. Loomis and Hunt find out that the guy blown up earlier was definitely not Michael, but a 17-year-old boy named, Bennett Tramer. They continue their quest for Michael, until MARION CHAMBERS (again played by Nancy Stephens), the nurse who was with Dr. Loomis last night, arrives to tell him that the governor of Smith's Grove has ordered Loomis back to Smith's Grove. Dr. Loomis and Marion walk out to the car, where a marshal will drive them along. He asks Hunt to continue the search.<br /><br />  At the Hospital, Laurie escapes her hospital room, sending Jimmy and JILL (played by TAWNY MOYER), who is the hospital's receptionist, on the hunt for Laurie. While searching for Laurie, Jimmy finds MRS. ALVES (played by Gloria Gifford), the head nurse, dead. Jimmy trips and cracks his head open.<br /><br />  Jill tries to leave, but can't since every cars' tires are flat. She enters the hospital and finds Laurie walking around, where Laurie witnesses Michael kill Jill. Laurie runs down into the basement, finding the security guard, MR. GARRETT (played by Cliff Emmich) dead. Michael finds her, but Laurie gets on the elevator, leaves the hospital and hides in the car.<br /><br />  Back with Dr. Loomis and Marion, Marion reveals to Dr. Loomis that Laurie Strode is actually, Michael Myers' younger sister. Laurie was born two years before Michael murdered Judith. Two years after his crime, after their parents died, Laurie was adopted by the Strode's. They had requested that this piece of evidence be sealed to protect the family. Dr. Loomis orders the marshal to turn around, in which he does.<br /><br />  Laurie exits the car after seeing Michael again. She runs up to the Hospital door and tries to open it, but it's locked. Dr. Loomis lets her in. He shoots Michael again, but he kills the Marshall and chases Laurie and Loomis, as Marion calls for backup. They enter a gas room, where Laurie shoots Michael's eyes. Dr. Loomis tells Laurie to get out of there, as he turns on gas tanks and blows up the room, burning Michael. Laurie has done it again.<br /><br />  This film is just as scary as the first film and very enjoyable. Jamie Lee Curtis will always be the original Scream Queen. Her screams sound just as great as they did in the original, but I feel as though, hearing scream for the first time in the original will always be the best. This is a worthy follow-up to John Carpenter's original horror masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>John Carpenter doesn't like sequels, but found himself roped into writing Halloween 2.  Halloween 2 was made for the sole purpose of moola.  The first was a huge success and at this time the slasher movie at the height of it's popularity thanks to Friday The 13th.  Carpenter admits(in the documentary on the anniversary dvd of Halloween) that he had a very difficult time writing this film(he did it while drunk for the mostpart) coz he felt he was pretty much remaking his original film, which he basically was.  He never wanted a sequel to Halloween, but apparently someone else did.  Luckily he got out of directing, and left that to Rick Rosenthal who went on to do the nauseating Halloween: Resurrection.  Well, considering Carpenter was stuck in this pickle I think he did alright.  I mean, Halloween 2 is as good as it could be.  When doing a sequel to a movie like Halloween, there's only so much you can do.  Given the subject matter, you can't really give the audience anything new that they haven't already seen in the first film-We all know what to expect.  Halloween 2 is best viewed as silly slasher flick fun to be enjoyable.  It ups the gore and the nudity.  It also gives us that famous twist about Laurie actually being Michael's sister.  I do like the fact that this is one of those rare sequels that begins immediately after the events of the first film and continues on through Halloween night.  Basically, Laurie's taken to the hospital where Michael follows and kills anyone that stands in the way.  The suspense of the first movie takes a backseat as this movie plays out like any typical slasher film of the time.  It does achieve some creepiness due to some good camera angles of Michael lurking in the shadows, in halls, etc.  He kills a woman by drowning her in boiling water, and this is a highlight of the film coz this particular murder is so messed up and gruesome.  Carpenter's intentions at the end of the film are crystal clear.  Obviously he wanted to make sure that he could be spared making another Halloween film by giving this one definite closure.  He goes to great lengths to show you that Michael Myers is dead.  The final shot of the film is ten seconds or so of Michael burning to a crisp-it's a very obvious statement of, "This is The End....NOW LEAVE IT ALONE!"  Of course we all know how well Hollywood listened to this.  Carpenter even tried to push this point by taking the series in a different direction with Halloween 3(a very entertaining horror flick by the way), but too many babies didn't understand what Carpenter was doing and panned it for it's lack of Michael.  Halloween 2 is the one and true sequel to Halloween.  Personally, I try to forget 4-8 even exist.  With 2, don't be expecting cinematic art, you have to enjoy it the way you would the Friday The 13th sequels.  Which is to say, don't be afraid to laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>I ran out to buy univesal release of this dvd and the picture quality is great and the sounds also and now for the film! Halloween 2 jumps off right where the last one left off soon Jamie Lee Curtis is taken to the Hospital for evaluation and care and this is why halloween 2 is the perfect Horror film! Granted Michael Myers is the true star but here he takes a back seat to the Hosital! I like most people hjave a deathly fear of hospitals, maybe it's the smell of lysol or the fact that some check in but don't check out or the fact that even in the next room someone is dying and John Carpenter makes this the ultimate hospitalof horror! it's stark and empty the floors have a low grade sheen and the walls are a strange muted color and even the baby's ward is void of noise! When Myers makes hi sway into the hospital he turns into the Grim Reaper of mercy killing people with the precision of a ginsu! When he finally meets up with curtis his impsoing stature and slow creeping body overwhelm her and the viwer when a relentless Pleasence comes to her aid and they have the ultimate grude battle and Myers is wounded in th head by a bullet and blinded the swipes Myers takes at his sister (Curtis) with the blade slashing through the air with such a clear cut that sound alone makes this film worth the price. So sit back and watch out for two things on your next visit to the hospital; Myers and a missing scapel!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHV42BTJSVON.html">A2RHV42BTJSVON</a><br/><p>In my opinion this is a very stupid and unrealistic sequal I mean I know for a fact that there is more then about 10 people working graveyard shift at the hospitals!!!There are always the same amount of people!!!And in this movie there is hardly any hospital staff and it relies to much on killing...I was highly disapointed with this movie it did not at all meet up to my expectations and they were not very high either...The acting was good and that's the only thing that kept me from rating this movie any lower...Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as usual.!And that guy who wants her is quite charming,in this sequal you find out Michael the reason Michael Meyers wants to kill her is because he is her brother...</p></br><a href="../users/A32B206L2SEXRA.html">A32B206L2SEXRA</a><br/><p>Halloween II continues the night he came home with Michael Myers continuing his rampage for his sister,this time at the local hospital,where he butchers and kills more than 10 of the hospital staff and faculty in gruesome murders.You'll love this awesome sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>after the sucuess of the first one, you knew halloween 2 was coming.the suspence of the first one is replaced now by more gore and falls prey to it's own self. with halloween 2 the magic of the first is lost ,and soon even a halloween movie will become just a slice and series.mr. plesants looks a like tired and jamielee curtis looks bored.the over all effect is this one can't stand up next the first .</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>With the tremendous economic success of the original "Halloween" and the incredible clamor for a sequel, John Carpenter just had to make part two of the Halloween series, and although Carpenter did not actually and technically direct this movie, Carpenter's hands were all over the script.  Rick Rosenthal directed "Halloween II" and did a fine job of picking up right where Carpenter left off with the "Halloween theme" that was so effectively utilized in the original.  The acting in this movie is equally brilliant as Jaimee Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are brought back in this perfect sequel to the greatest horror movie of all-time.<br /><br />Unlike most sequels, "Halloween II" is a winner in every sense of the word.  The sequel to the greatest horror movie of all-time in "Halloween" picks up right where the original left off...this particular tactic with regard to sequels is actually much more effective than starting something completely new or picking up a few years years after the original left off.<br /><br />At any rate, Myers was shot six times by Dr. Lumus at the end of "Halloween".  So, the movie aptly picks up with Lumus looking for Myers, but Myers is only interested in getting to Laurie Strode and she has been taken to a hospital.  Not to give anything away, but as part of the summary and analysis of "Halloween II", it is important to note that there is a method to Michael Myers's madness...indeed, Laurie Strode is actually Michael Myers's other sister.  Thus, the fact that Myers would continue his murderous rampage at the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital in his attempt to kill Laurie is completely plausible.  However, this particular fact regarding Laurie and Myers is not revealed until late in the movie.<br /><br />Still, "Halloween II" picks up where the original left off in more ways than one.  The Halloween theme that John Carpenter created and mastered is brilliantly re-created in "Halloween II".  However, in this particular movie, John Carpenter gambled and changed the Halloween theme music a bit to more of an organ dominated theme sound rather than piano based and it pays off wonderfully in the sequel.  Personally, I thought that the theme music in both movies was absolutely brilliant and appropriate for the subject matter.  The music in both "Halloween" and "Halloween II" is so scary and perfect for the occasion in ever way possible.<br /><br />In "Halloween II", the audience observes an equally terrifying "boogeyman" in Michael Myers as it quickly becomes clear that the human/man part of Michael Myers is completely dead or gone and what remains in Myers is this pure evil that continues to deliberately and cold bloodedly drive Myers to even more murder and macabre.  In fact, Michael Myers appears to be even more dangerous in part II than in part I, mainly because whatever human part that was in Michael Myers in part I is now dead, perhaps after being shot by Dr. Lumus six times.  After viewing this movie, it becomes clear that Michael Myers is not only "the boogeyman" but he is the deadliest and most dangerous horror movie villain of all-time...this evil that is Michael Myers is unstoppable!!<br /><br />"Halloween II" moves along with careful attention to a course of action that would logically follow after such a horrible tragedy which has now become known to the Haddonfield community.  The police are all over the place...Laurie Strode (played very well again by Jaimie Lee Curtis) is in the hospital, Dr. Lumus, played equally well again by Donald Pleasance, is now even more obsessed with stopping Myers as well.  The local media is all over the scene and there is this general sense of chaos that has enveloped Haddonfield on Halloween night.<br /><br />Critical to the plot of "Halloween II" is a scene where a male pedestrian, who looked like Myers, is actually hit and killed in a car accident while crossing the street and burned to a crisp.  The media and police all believe that Myers has been killed, but this is not the case as Myers has simply gone to the logical place where he can find and kill his sister.  In "Halloween II", Carpenter puts Dr. Lumus in a position to give a couple more of his "fancy talk" speeches which are so effective at presenting horror to the audience while glued to Pleasance's every move and word.<br /><br />Other characters are introduced to the audience in this sequel and aptly developed as the movie progresses.  As is typical of most sequels, the body count is larger in "Halloween II" and the actual kills are much more graphic than in the original "Halloween".  Still, the blood and gore are kept to a relatively benign level.  In "Halloween II", there are some great kills which are a bit better and scarier than the ones in the original.  Michael Myers's mask is just as terrifying as it was in the original and a little bit dirtier and perhaps even scarier.  Indeed, the actual Halloween motif is again utilized to perfection as the audience gets the "Halloween feel" again as they experienced in the original and the reader should note that this "Halloween theme/motif" is completely lost with sequels 4-8 and perhaps lost forever.  It is this "Halloween feel/theme" to the first two Halloween movies that separate them from the rest and a lot of this has to do with John Carpenter who contributed greatly to parts I and II and very little after "Halloween III" (which was not about Myers).<br /><br />The creators of "Halloween II" focused a great deal on Michael Myers himself and the very mannerisms that make Myers "the boogeyman" if you will.  Myers is: slow, deliberate, stylish, evil, dark, morbid, brutal and driven by some unbelievably evil and supernatural force within him.  Also, the directors' use of hallways, stairways and the opening and closing of doors are utilized to perfection in magnifying the evil that is Michael Myers.  As in the first, Michael Myers just does not kill his victims, he terrorizes them with evil Halloween pranks and plays with them before killing them as evidenced by the scene in the storage basement of the hospital where he cleverly kills Mr. Garrett.<br /><br />Now, does all of this make "Halloween II" a better or scarier movie than the original?  Well, that is tough to answer, but the advantage goes to the original because the audience is so shocked and completely unaware of what is driving Michael Myers and what his goal is...all we know in "Halloween" is that we are observing "the boogeyman" and Halloween is his night and he has come home to kill.  Hence, in my opinion, "Halloween" is a little bit better than "Halloween II"...that said, if I were to actually rate "Halloween", it would get 100 of 100 STARS whereas "Halloween II" would get 98 of 100 STARS...get the picture?  Clearly, both are such great movies that you could almost merge the two and make one movie out of it, but I do prefer the separate parts, but taken as a whole, "Halloween" and "Halloween II" form the blueprint of what an original classic and its follow-up sequel are SUPPOSED to be like.  Ultimately, "Halloween II" brilliantly follows right on the heels of "Halloween" in every conseivable way as the Halloween theme, Michael Myers's mannerisms and the very music itself all work to make "Halloween II" more than a worthy sequel to the classic "Halloween", so much so that "Halloween II" is clearly a horror movie classic in its own right.<br /><br />Why any horror movie fan would be critical of "Halloween II" is clearly beyond me...it simply does not make sense for critics and horror movie fans alike to bash or negatively criticize "Halloween II" in any way as it is a great horror movie and really just a logical extension of the original horror movie classic which is "Halloween".  Quite frankly, any horror movie fan that thinks that "Halloween 4" or "H20" is better than "Halloween II" obviously does not know a damn thing about horror movies and would not know a good horror movie from the "Andy Griffith Show".  "Halloween II" is without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies of ALL-TIME and is clearly a top all-time 10 horror flick...I analyze and judge horror movies based on the facts and whether a horror movie is a sequel or not does not matter.  "Halloween II" is a damn scary movie and a great horror flick that has and will continue to stand the test of time.<br /><br />My Halloween night always consists of watching: "Halloween" followed by "Halloween II", which are without a doubt the two best movies in the Halloween series and two of the greatest horror movies ever produced...like a fine wine, these two movies just get better with age...live it up horror movie fans, October 24-31 is the best week of the year for horror movie fanatics like myself and it just doesn't get any better than the immortal classics, "Halloween" and "Halloween II".</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Still a very good plotline follows our survivor from the original movie to the hospital in this sequel. Micheal Meyers is fast on her trail as she tries to get free of his rein of terror.<br /><br />A good plot twist showing that she is actually a Micheal Meyer's younger sister.  But besides that the terror and character empathy is not there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>First off, I DID like the movie, but the viewer is asked to suspend belief one too many times....mainly, that a hospital is SO dimly lit (even the halls are dark), and there are so few nurses. In one scene, Michael Myers is in a nursery full of babies and NO ONE IS WATCHING THEM. This large hospital is pretty poorly staffed! Two, Jamie Lee Curtis' parents can't be reached ALL NIGHT LONG? Wow, didn't they leave a number?  A nurse and EMT find plenty of time to sneak off into a hot tub. There is only the one doctor and he vanishes. NAH........not as good or suspenseful as the first. But maybe that was an impossible task.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>There are some acts you'd just hate to follow, and the original Halloween is one of them. The 1978 movie single-handedly created the slasher genre of the eighties; by three years later, it had become an entire cottage industry, with films like The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), The Dark (1979), Don't Answer the Phone! (1980), He Knows You're Alone (1980), Maniac (1980), Prom Night (1980), The Prey (1980), Schizoid (1980), and the first installment of the unstoppable Friday the 13th series (1980). Some were more slavish in their adherence to formula than others; Prom Night even went so far as to rope Jamie Lee Curtis into a similar lead role. All were inferior to Halloween, but as usual, crap outnumbered quality by a wide margin, and the genre had become defined by the imitators rather than the originator.<br /><br />  And then the powers that be realize that Halloween can be more than a movie -- it can be a franchise! Big given that they are now hemmed in by genre constraints that they unwittingly helped germinate, can even a largely-identical creative team recapture the honest terror of the original?<br /><br />  Well, no. But they can give it the old college try.<br /><br />  From what I've seen, Halloween 2 viewers fall into two camps: Those who credit it as a commendable film, though not approaching the original; and those who would consign all film prints to flames of woe. One rarely sees such a hardcore divide of opinion outside of an election year. While Halloween 2 may not universally be considered a terrible movie, it does have a reputation as being one of the most notorious sequels in moviedom, ranking right up there with Highlander 2 and Wayne's World 2 as being first against the wall when the revolution comes. Is all this rancor deserved?<br /><br />  Well, first off, nothing in the known universe approaches the sheer suckiness of Highlander 2, and Wayne's World 2 actually turned out to be exactly what should have been expected of the first one: a slack SNL-skit-turned-feature. Halloween 2 is actually a solidly-built slasher flick -- certainly scoring well on the bell curve of the genre (which may be more of a sad commentary on the genre than praise of this particular movie) -- but it commits that Great Sequel Sin which everyone dreads: It retroactively colors your appreciation of the original.<br /><br />  It what was probably one of the greatest ideas in this movie, we open exactly where we ended in the first movie: Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) has just burst in to save Laurie Strode (Curtis) from The Shape, aka Michael Myers, by unloading his full revolver into Michael, thus blowing him out the second-story window to the lawn below. (It's never a good idea to start a movie with a continuity gaff, and having Loomis' six-shot revolver miraculously fire seven times is a doozy. Not that the extra bullet did any good.) By the time Loomis gets to the lawn, though, Michael is gone -- leaving nothing but a bloody imprint in the grass where he had landed.<br /><br />  Let the festivities begin.<br /><br />  Largely, the rest of the movie can be summed up, plot-wise, in a handful of sentences. Loomis joins the small-town police to try to track Michael through the dark neighborhoods crawling with trick-or-treaters. Meanwhile, after doing in a few people at random, the bloody but still mobile Shape tracks poor Laurie to the understaffed hospital to finish what he started.<br /><br />  Sure, it's a simple-sounding plot, but so was the original Halloween's. The terror was in the details; unfortunately, in this outing, it's the details that sink the ship. [My official mixed metaphor for the day.]<br /><br />  The most visible flaw is the one that relates to the commentary above: Michael Myers succumbs to the "death by variety" temptation which is used to keep viewer attention in the more vapid slasher flicks. Some of new and novel weapons make sense; for instance, Michael enters the hospital through the maintenance shop, so it's not a problem that he kills the security guard with a claw hammer. The hot tub death is more problematic; aside from the ungainliness of using a boiling hot tub as a murder weapon, why would someone who's been catatonic for a decade know how to work the temperature controls? Both of these problems are showcased ultimately in the death of the head nurse; Michael has apparently subdued her and then syphons her blood onto the floor. It's too much a novelty for a driven killer, who in the last movie was intent on dispatching his victims in the simplest and most direct ways possible.<br /><br />  But even more damaging are the attempts to explain Michael's rampage. We find out, through Laurie's dream sequence and some later exposition from Michael's "hidden file," that Laurie was actually Michael's baby sister who was adopted by the Strodes in infancy. While it attempts to add a symmetry to the two movies, it manages instead to force the viewer to read back into the first movie an intent which was not there to begin with. Michael's rampage in the original Halloween was not an attempt to kill Laurie Strode specifically; it was a pointless rampage. It was senseless violence. That was the terror of the "boogeyman" -- that Michael was not a wisecracking pop cultural figure, maming murder fun and interesting until his secret weakness was spotted. "The Shape" was the personification of our worst fears: A killer who can't be defended against because a) there is no rhyme or reason to the killings, thus no way to outthink him, and b) he simply refuses to quit. Michael Myers was evil as a force of nature, without even a recognizeable motive beyond the pure act of killing itself. As Loomis went to great lengths to point out, Michael was "pure EE-vil," without the human niceties of personality or purpose. And by giving Michael a motive and a specific target, the powers-that-be brought the boogeyman down to size, until he's just a killer in a mask.<br /><br />  Thus, Laurie's terror is best exposed in the question she blurts out under medication: "Why me?" And in answering it, this movie negates that great fear.<br /><br />  It's kind of surprising that this flaw wasn't perceived by the filmmakers, as they even included a scene which shows that explaining the violence -- "making sense of senseless killings," as the headline goes -- helps defuse the fear. What do the people of Haddonfield do in reaction to the killer in their midst? Crowds of them gather at the abandoned Myers house and throw rocks at it. By finding a target, they find some sort of explanation to hold onto to keep the terror at bay. The filmmakers make the same mistake with the movie as a whole.<br /><br />  In this context, it's instructive to re-examine the ending of the original Halloween: Loomis, having emptied his revolver into The Shape, discovers that, beyond all rationality, the killer has gotten up and vanished. Looking back after two decades of inevitable sequels to any possible movie, our conditioned viewpoint is that such a non-ending was a blatant set-up for a sequel. But instead, it was a confirmation of those fears expressed in the dialogue between the shooting and the discovery of the missing body: Laurie cries that Myers "really was the boogeyman," and Loomis confirms: "Yes, he was." And the boogeyman is not stopped by bullets, because he will not be bound by the protections we rely on; he is the fear which lurks in the unknown.<br /><br />  And don't get me started on the completely gratuitous reference to "Samhain" and the Druids, which not only blurs the focus even further, but also allows the setup which putrified several of the later sequels.<br /><br />  Now, not to appear like a complete sourpuss, I should go back and justify my earlier assertion that this is a solid movie, despite falling so far from the original. Unlike most other negative reviewers, I had no real trouble with the fact that Laurie Strode was bedridden, comatose, or befuddled by medications through most of this movie; really, was she that much more active in the first movie? (Which is what I thought was one of the flaws of the original; the ostensible "heroine" doesn't even know there's a crisis until the last ten minutes.)<br /><br />  Also, remember when I said that starting this movie right where the previous one ended was a good idea? This is at least a good-faith attempt to keep the Halloween movies from simply becoming a Michael Myers franchise, by keeping all of the main characters instead of plugging a new set of victims in as fresh meat. Unfortunately, there's only so far a full cast could go, and after the unrelated interlude of Halloween 3, Michael Myers became a full-fledged franchise with Halloween 4 (though not a terribly successful one, as Michael lacks the pop-culture cachet of, say, Freddy or Jason) and while alot of the media dont like poor old Mikey, I think he's miles better than his opponents of Freddy and Jason.<br /><br />  After all this, what's the final assessment? Well, Halloween 2 doesn't do near the damage to the original as Highlander 2 did to its predecessor. And compared to most blade-wielding maniacs, this is still a taut thriller. (Granted, some of that stems from a timeline of events only slightly less truncated than that of Othello.) I suppose the most important thing to remember is that Halloween 2 is not an honest continuation of the first movie. Halloween was a complete movie, in and of itself; all sequels are merely hangers-on, progressively reflecting less and less of the light from the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>HALLOWEEN 2<br />HE'S BAAAAAACK<br /><br />Michael Myers returns to reek havoc on teens every where, and Jamie Lee Curtis is at the top of his menu. Of course Donald Pleasence is still on the hunt for the serial killer, and this film will be the one to leave a Permanente mark on him. When viewing this film it is easy to see that even though the film is good it just isn't the classic the first movie was. The thing that might be the answer to that is probably because a different director steps up, Rick Rosenthal. Don't get me wrong he does an excellent job but he's the having to follow up behind John Carpenter. Speaking of which John and Debra Hill {R.I.P.} return as both producers, and writers. Which pleased me greatly.<br /><br />The story follows as such, it picks up directly where the last left off with Myers being shot out of the house then not being there. Michael is after Jamie again and to get there he has to visit the hospital. Of course it's the same slasher thing, Horney people getting cut up, nothing new. But it still serves its purpose when Michael lurks from the shadows in one scene where his mask slowly comes forward. That was great, truly worthy of mention.<br /><br />Over all this is a worthy sequel all though at times it falls flat.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>This movie does not hold up well at all. I used to love it growing up because I was accepting what I was seeing at face value. When I forced myself to sit down and write a script for a video review of it, I found myself looking closer, and what I saw I liked less and less. The plot holes in this movie are gigantic, and for reasons unknown to me, no one else notices them. Is it because "Halloween III" was that much worse that this one looks so good in comparison?

[...]</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>After the surprise success of the original (and best) Halloween, a sequel was naturally churned out, and, as expected didn't hold a candle to the original.  Halloween 2 picks up where the first left off, with Michael Myers still on the loose and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) on his trail.  Survivor Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is nearly catatonic and is being taken care of at a hospital, but we soon find out that Michael is on her trail as well.  John Carpenter wrote the script but opted not to direct this second installment (although it is said that he re-shot some scenes here and there) which is a big drawback of the film.  Director Rick Rosenthal (who directed the latest Halloween: Resurrection) decided to go without most of the cat & mouse-esque Carpenter style suspense of the first film, opting instead to make the film much more graphic than the original.  This adds nothing to the film, and the momentary lapses of logic are almost mind numbing.  However, this is an important chapter in the Halloween saga, as we learn more about Michael's background including why he is so hell bent on killing Laurie.  All in all, Halloween 2 certainly isn't the worst of the series, but don't go into it expecting something as great as the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This flick doesn't hold up as well as it did thirty years ago.  Back when I was an impressionable undiscrimanating seventeen year old the body count was good enough for me.  It was also pretty cool watching it with an urban audience who shouted at the screen imploring in vain for the victims not to open door or closet.  Now it's no better or worse than any knockoff of the classic original "Halloween".  Events take place on the same evening as the original but it's more preposterous.  They open things up by having the action set mainly at a hospital but that makes it more ludicrous.  This has to be the darkest most sparcely staffed hospital I've ever seen.  Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the original but that only adds so much cred.  Proceed if you must but be prepared to be disappointed</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>After Halloween's success a lot of slashers were made to cash in on the craze of that era so the producers begged John Carpenter to make a sequel he wrote Halloween II while drinking a 6 pack he said h**l I'll make Michael & Laurie bro & sis. Donald Plesance came back as Dr. Loomis Jamie Lee Curtis returned as Laurie Strode we are also introduced Jimmy played by Lance Guest Dick Warlock plays Michael Myers. Ok the plot is straight forward it's the same night Halloween of 1978 Michael is on the loose Laurie is in The Hospital Loomis & Sheriff Brackett are looking for Michael. Brackett isn't in it for long cause they find his daughters body you do find out that Michael & Laurie are brother & sister I would've loved to seen the reaction it got back in 81. I've heard that this movie runs at a slow pace I feel it runs at a fast pace you want slow paced watch H2 2009 that's trying to be a Greek Tragedy it's a tragedy to watch. I liked Loomis,  Laurie even though she doesn't have a lot to do Jimmy aka Jamie's father & if I have characters I like the longest of movies go by quickly. The last 10-15 minutes own Michael Myers is burnt to death! Then Halloween III came out everybody hated it cause Michael Myers wasn't in it but I thought it was alright then Michael was brought back for 4. I also have a version with the TV scenes mixed in the theatrical version where you find out Jimmy is still alive. I'm hoping 1 day this gets a special edition. This can be watched with the 1st as a double feature you get The Night He Came Home & the Night He Stays for more. But it's hard to pick a favorite between 1&.2.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After the original "Halloween" film turned into the "little independent film that could" and ultimately set the standard for horror films for nearly two decades, John Carpenter and crew got back together in 1981 to churn out a sequel.  Though the entire Halloween franchise is now mocked for the absurdity of its installments, this is the only one that manages to maintain some of the magic of the original.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Halloween II" picks right up where the first one left off.  Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is being taken to the local hospital, while Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still trying to hunt down the psychopathic (and seemingly indestructible) Michael Myers.  When Myers finds out where Strode is being held, it sets up a final confrontation between the three.<br /><br />What I really have to give the "Halloween II" writers credit for is the foresight to realize that their shtick could only go so far.  They managed to created a taut, highly-suspenseful sequel to one of the most original films of all-time, and chose to "end" (if only they would have known...) the series while it was still going strong.<br /><br />This movie succeeds because it is basically just an extension of the first.  Michael is still terrifying, the jump-scenes still cause your heart to uproot, and the drama is still palpable.  Does it completely capture the mojo of the 1978 edition?  Not quite; but it comes closer than most horror flick "part two's".  There is a bit more gore and a little less innocence in this installment, but overall it is a very fitting continuation of the overall storyline.<br /><br />Thus, watch this film with confidence knowing that you won't be let down (this time...I can't say the same for the rest of the sequels).  If you're having that Halloween movie marathon on October 31st, make sure this one goes right into the DVD player after the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>I like to think of Halloween II as a movie that takes place mostly in the early morning hours of November 1, 1978.  This sequel to Halloween is generally a good movie that is designed to be a continuation of the night of October 31, 1978, when Michael Myers terrorized the babysitting Laurie Strode and her friends, one of which was also babysitting, while others were just goofing around having a good time.  Halloween is a classic.  That movie ends with Michael Myers being shot by Dr. Sam Loomis, only to run away seconds later.  That was supposed to be it.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill did not have a sequel in mind.  But they were pressured into making a sequel.  John Carpenter has said that when it was time to write the screenplay he was drawing a blank.  He didn't know what to write.  Finally he started to come up with ideas, even going as far as making Laurie Strode Michael Myers' sister.  Now that is a sign of somebody who is trying to come up with a screenplay for a movie he didn't even want to make (see my review of Halloween III - Season Of The Witch for a more thorough analysis)  You see, the original game plan after Halloween was to make a different Halloween movie every year with a completely different story and theme than the previous movie, sort of like the old The Twilight Zone TV show.  Michael Myers was never meant to keep appearing in movie after movie.  It was supposed to stop after Halloween.  Well, OK, they made the second movie, so it was supposed to stop after Halloween II, when Michael Myers burned to death.  It did.  For one movie.  Halloween III did not have Michael Myers in it.  It's a great movie that goes in the direction that Carpenter and Hill wanted to go into after Halloween - making a different Halloween movie every year with an entirely different story.  The general public didn't like Halloween III.  Carpenter and Hill then ended their involvement with the franchise.<br /><br />Now about Halloween II...<br /><br />This movie begins with showing the last few moments of Halloween, when Michael Myers is shot by Dr. Loomis.  This footage is mostly alternate unused takes shot while Halloween was being filmed in 1978, while some of the footage are the actual takes that were used in the first movie.  If you pay attention, you'll notice that Loomis fires seven shots at Michael Myers.  In the first movie, he fires six.  Anyway, Myers gets away and starts to stalk around town.  It is clear that this movie was influenced by the movies that were coming out at the time that featured lots of blood and splatter scenes.  It's unfortunate, because Halloween didn't rely on blood to be effective.  But in Halloween II it seems that Carpenter and Hill were feeling the pressure of the marketplace, so they made it like a Friday The 13th movie as far as the blood and gore goes.  To sum up the story, Michael Myers is trying to find his SISTER Laurie Strode, who was taken to the hospital after being injured in the first Halloween.  Myers stalks her at the near empty (and creepy) hospital and kills some of the hospital staff along the way.  At the end of the movie it appears that Michael Myers has burned to death.  He DID burn to death after Dr. Loomis flicks his lighter while gas fills the air that causes an explosion.  In fact, you have to believe that Loomis was killed in that explosion, also.  But seven years later there was this movie that came out called Halloween 4 - The Return Of Michael Myers.  What it really was was an opportunity to resurrect Michael Myers for the sake of making $$$$.  If Jason Voorhees and Freddie Krueger are invincible, why not make Michael Myers invincible?  It means $$$$, plain and simple.  If there's anything good about the continuation of the series beginning with Halloween 4, it's that at least John Carpenter and Debra Hill weren't involved.  They were long gone, because they were smart.  The first Halloween movie was an independent film.  That's one reason why it's so good.  Once Hollywood takes over a franchise, forget it.  That's why the whole series is so screwed up.  There is no continuity.  Halloween H2O is really the sequel to Halloween II.<br /><br />The musical score to Halloween II is good, but not as good as the first movie.  The movie overall just doesn't compare to the first one, but it is still a pretty good movie.  A lot of the feel of the first movie was absent in this second movie, though it does get major points for the creepy atmosphere at the hospital late at night.  You'll see some things that make this "continuation of the night" seem like a different movie altogether.  But if you take this movie at face value, it IS an entertaining movie.  Just not the same as the first one.  4 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>It's been a little while since our last entry but that doesn't mean we haven't been hard at work watching b. We hit a rough patch for about a month or so but now we are back in full force. For our comeback why not go with a heavy dose of Dr. Loomis? Which brings us to our title feature of the evening Halloween 2. Released in 1981, 3 years after the original masterpiece, Halloween 2 picks up where the first one left off as Myers is being pursued by the mighty Loomis and Haddonfield Police department.<br /><br />After Myers killing spree that Halloween evening he is on the run after being laced up by Loomis about 9 times. Naturally the bullets do nothing but inspire him to continue in his quest to murder Laurie. As he takes to the streets Loomis and the police chief cruise around looking for him where the first moment of hilarity occurs. These two see someone dressed up like Myers and assume it's him forcing them to chase him down with guns. As the suspected Myers takes off he gets wedged in between to moving cars forcing an explosion, which then leads to him being burned alive. When you get a brief shot of the victim on fire it is so obvious it's a dummy which just adds to the delight of the film. Talk about entertaining! Later at the lab they discover the burn victim wasn't myers but a regular kid doing some trick or treating. Now they realize they wasted all this time thinking they got him when really he's on his way to the Haddonfield hospital to finish Laurie off. Instinctively Loomis knows where Myers will be headed off to and makes his way to the hospital.<br /><br />Once in the hospital we are introduced to the human version of Quagmire which leads to many many laughs throughout the film. This guy is a nurse and seems his sole purpose is to get laid. Being the smooth operator he is he hides under a sheet pretending to be a dead body. Once his woman walks in the door he jumps up nearly giving her a heart attack. Yeah this guy has it coming. He finally talks he into a nude hot tube romp only to get choked out by Myers and his lady drowned. After this there is a lot of cat and mouse between Myers and Laurie. There were a few tense scenes and the hospital did provide a creepy atmosphere, but it wasn't quite a scary as we remembered it to be long ago. The best part came in the end when Laurie is cornered by Myers until Loomis comes to the rescue. He does enough to distract Myers while Laurie turns on some gas valves and shoots Myers in the face. Somehow he only acts like he has some dirt stuck in his eye and aimlessley swings his blade in the air trying to strike Laurie as she runs right past him. Loomis then gets his attention and ignites the gas fumes with his lighter blasting a wing of the hospital to shreds. Naturally Myers comes walking ot on fire but does eventually fall to the ground while Mr. Sandman plays.<br /><br />All in all it was pretty decent for a sequal but nowhere near the original. On it's own it would stand as a good flick so don't bother comparing the two. The scares really weren't there but the laughs sure were. This was some vintage Loomis that any Halloween fan can appreciate. Definately worth the watch but could use a little assistance (oh yeah) to gain a 5 star effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>This flick picks up the second the original Halloween left off. Michael survuved the fall and simply walked away. The majority of this flick takes place in a hospital where there are some grisly killings indeed. Who can forget the boiling couple in the therapy hottub, or the nurse who ended up donating just a little too much blood? Tomboy Jamie Lee Curtis and the Doctor are back for the ride and we discover the family secrets that Laurie and Michael share. A great ending with Michael walking through flames will leave you waiting for part III, unfortunately you had to wait for part IV.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>John Carpenter's chilling 1978 classic "Halloween" was a true benchmark for terror. Anything following it would not stand a chance of being as good. While some 'Halloween' sequels were very good(4 and H20), some were also bad(3 and 6). This follow up to the original is in the 'good' category. The film, however, fails to capture the real terror of the original. It tries very hard. The story continues on the same night as the original. Laurie has been transfered to the Haddonfield hospital. Michael has survived(!)and overhears on a kid's radio that the victims have been taken to the hospital. The kid with the radio is the son of Dick Warlock who played Michael. There, Michael hacks his way thru the staff to get to Laurie. Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. It is also in this film that we learn the truth behind Laurie and Michael's connection. So, in that regard, this movie is pivotal in the series' history. It is very eerily shot and looks good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original. It comes close at times. Director Rick Rosenthal definitley went to the ' John Carpenter School ' when he set out to direct this movie. He got the angles and the mood down right. What he didn't get down right was the characters and the emotional pull of the first film. The writers of this film also turned the Laurie Strode character into a nothing role. You rooted for her in the original, but in this one you barely remember she's even in the darn thing!. It was almost as if the Laurie Strode character was an after thought until the final chase and showdown in the climax. Donald Pleasence was great, but Jamie Lee Curtis was given way less to do. She has a much smaller part in this one. Her part kicks in in the last half. This film plays more like a standard "Friday The 13th" slasher film than the bloodless, suspense filled original. It works most of the time. The other characters in the movie don't fare as well as the few in the original. There is no one in the movie, besides Laurie, that you would care about one way or the other if they died or not. Very undeveloped. They are all just typical knife fodder who would of been just as useless in a Jason movie. Dick Warlock, as Michael Myers, is a very good Michael. At least I think so. He has the creep factor and the walk down pat. The mask is a little altered from the original. I have mixed feelings on the mask. Still, it's a fun, entertaining chapter to the series. Don't expect anything close to the original masterpiece. This film, along with the original and H20 make for a teriffic trilogy of films. The others, while some are okay, don't matter as much. Halloween 2 is not great art, but it's a fun horror film. It had a tough job to do to follow the classic original. It tried it's best, and even though it didn't completely succeed, it came okay. I enjoy it and I think any fan would too.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>Making a sequel is very easy and also very hard; it's easy in the aspect that you already have a basic idea to follow, but hard that when you make a sequel to a classic you are bound to fail. Halloween II though for the most part gets it right. While in my opinion Halloween II is far inferior to the original it's still in its own right a solid flick and better than most 80s slasher films.<br /><br />The interesting thing is how this movie almost never came to be. Originally Halloween was meant to be a one shot deal sort of. There was never meant to be a sequel with Michael. John Carpenter wanted to take the series in a very different direction. Make a few sequels with a new plot each time. But with a lot of money on the line the powers that be first wanted a direct sequel with Michael. A lawsuit was gonna be filed forcing John Carpenter and Debra Hill to return, than it got to the point to where the movie was gonna be made with or without them. So might as well end the Michael Myers plot and get paid as well.<br /><br />John Carpenter and Debra Hill return to write the screenplay and both produced the movie as well. The script is fairly good it's nothing brilliant, but overall well done. As much I love the original it's probably my favorite horror movie of all time, the script was a little weak in some areas. It was Carpenter the director that made it so brilliant. The idea here is interesting. Halloween II starts where the last one left off. And also I have to say it does feel like it's the same night. Many times in sequels if it's the same night or even next day it feels like time elapsed, but not here.<br /><br />But there is a slight problem; the original was so great because the story was simple, and the plot for Halloween II is a direct continuation of the last. So around the 20-min mark things to slow down a little bit. As great as Halloween was and still is actually the plot is simple and can only work for so long. Overall the script is well written though, but also times a rehash.<br /><br />Donald Pleasence returns as Dr. Loomis and once again does a great job. What I love about the guy is he can play a dramatic role, but also play an over the top role and not be afraid to ham it up. Here Pleasence once again is excellent, but only problem is he does the same thing here as he did in the original, and a lot of his dialogue seems like something from the original script that was cut out. But being the great actor he is Pleasence sells it and is a blast to watch. Jamie Lee Curtis is also back and really doesn't have much to do this time around. For a majority of the movie she's in a hospital bed until the final act. With little to do Jamie Lee still delivers an excellent performance.<br /><br />Rick Rosenthal makes his directorial debut and it was quite solid. What happened to this guy? Almost everything he's done since hasn't been very good with a couple of exceptions. Following up Halloween isn't an easy thing to do and to his credit Rosenthal makes a fairly creepy and even suspenseful movie. Not everything he does though works quite well. The original had great pacing. Every scene further advanced that movie and quite honestly the scariest scenes were ones with Michael just watching and stalking. From beginning, middle to end Carpenter had the audience on the edge of their seat and that is why it's so scary.<br /><br />Halloween II also features a lot of shots of Michael walking around trying to avoid capture and than later on the hospital and while these scenes do have a creepy tone to them they don't work nearly as well as they did in the original. The pacing here can lag at times it's mostly in the middle sections when the story starts to dry up, but a kill scene will get you right back into it. What worked so brilliantly in the original doesn't work fully as well here, but still gets the job done overall.<br /><br />The final act though is excellent and very creepy and suspenseful. While not as strong as the original it very much gets the job done and is bound to have the viewer hanging in suspense. The opening act is excellent and the middle sections do lag just a bit, but it's never boring. But the final act steps it up a notch and turns Halloween II from a good and semi-creepy movie to an excellent and creepy movie.<br /><br />John Carpenter did do some re-shoots since he felt the movie was lacking a little bit. I don't know all the scenes Carpenter shot, but if anything they did more help than harm. By 1981 the slasher film was in full bloom and when you trace the history of the slasher film 1981 was the golden year. After that there were still some good ones, but it was starting to fall a part. Due to more violent slashers with such a high body count what worked so well in the original wouldn't work as well at this point and again you cannot recreate the original it's one of a kind. H20 tried that and in my opinion very much failed at that. So I think Carpenter did the right thing.<br /><br />Overall Halloween II is an excellent if not inferior sequel, but it gets the job done. Rick Rosenthal does a good job even if his scenes aren't as creepy as the original. But he does a fine job and the scenes Carpenter shot also work well. While Halloween II may not be as good as the original, it's a solid and creepy flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite horror sequels of all time and to me is the best in the Halloween series. The origional was good, but this one... WOW! There's just not enough good things I can say about this movie. The acting was great, it had a lot more blood than the origional, and it was really suspenseful. If you haven't seen it than take my advice and BUY THIS MOVIE!</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis star in this 1981 horror sequel.<br />A doctor continues to hunt an escaped killer targeting a girl at a<br />hospital. This is a great sequel and should've been the last. This<br />dvd has good picture and sound, but only a trailer. I recommend<br />this for your horror collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>The blu ray has finally arrived for this one. First the picture is mainly impressive in comparison to the dvd. HOWEVER, they spent nothing to remove the white specks that pop up continually throughout the film. This is damage and Universal let us down in that regard. The specks are not huge though and most of film's scenes look clarity wise very good indeed. It's similiar to 'halloween h20' which also has the specks all over it. Universal should have cleaned the specks off but they did give you 'terror in the aisles' a film about horror movies. Starring donald pleasance as the host.  And also deleted scenes and such. So it's the best we can hope for I guess.  as for the film.<br /><br />This was a big hit at the time and the reason for it was that it was a direct sequel of the first with the two main cast members Donald Pleasance and Jamie lee curtis continuing the story.  In this one Michael is still killing off everyone around his sister to terrorize her,  before he finally finishes her off. But she of course is trying to survive and so it goes.  This is great horror and well worth seeing ONLY after you see the original Halloween.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>If this is true Michael Myers should enter into a world's strongest man competition.<br /><br />I loved the original Halloween, I think it is one of the greatest horror movies there is and a great movie period.  I liked the mystery of Michael Myers in the original and I bought into everything, any plot holes were ignored because I was so into the movie.  For me horror is scary when it is realistic or I can relate in someway or the movie does such a good job I buy into what I am seeing.  In this sequel i found myself annoyed by things or pointing out things that couldn't happen the movie never really got me.<br /><br />I'd like to also point out I am not anti remake or sequel.  John Carpenter himself has done one of the great horror remakes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3Q0A">The Thing [HD DVD</a>] starring Kurt Russell.  I didn't hate this nor did I love it.  I think it is essential for horror fans in filling in the connection between Michael and Laurie.  If this title had eluded you and you had seen the original and all other sequels you'd still know the connection but would be confused.  I also do not believe this was made just for money and think John Carpenter was giving the horror fans what they wanted which was more Michael Myers and I think he makes a good effort trying to feed that hunger picking up literally from the original.<br /><br />I always like to watch a movie fresh before reviewing and I did that with Halloween 2, however going by memory I would confidently say this is the strongest sequel of the bunch, and is worth a viewing.<br /><br />I would give the dvd features but on the Goodtimes home video version of Halloween 2 there are none at all.  The audio is only done in 3 channel Dolby digital and I have seen much better transfers.<br /><br />**Interesting facts from the Internet Movie Database**<br />- This is the only Halloween film to show the morning after the 31st, every other movie ends on Halloween night.<br /><br />- The film that the security guard and the Elrods are watching is Night of the Living Dead.  (Which actually gets interrupted with reports on Michael Myers, maybe someone is trying to say something here.)<br /><br />- The 17-year-old who was hit by the police car and burnt alive, at first believed to be Michael Myers, was supposed to be Ben Tramer, the boy Laurie confesses to have a crush in in the original Halloween.  (Talk about having a bad nite)<br /><br />- Believing Rick Rosenthal's version of the film to be too tame, John Carpenter shot a few gory scenes that were added into the film despite Rosenthal's objections.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, share any comments.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>HALLOWEEN II is probably the only sequel to the 1978 classic that tries to maintain the level of terror and suspense created in the original.  While nowhere as good as the original, this is a well crafted sequel which takes place right after the end of the first.  Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode and keeps her title of THE SCREAM QUEEN as she is whisked off to the hospital to recover from her injuries.  The late Donald Pleasance is also back as Dr. Sam Loomis, the psychiatrist determined to put an end to Michael Meyers' reign.<br /><br />This is the movie that establishes the connection between Laurie and Michael, a theme that will permeate following sequels.<br /><br />Of course, Michael the Boogeyman, is on the prowl and invades the hospital, dispatching several employees including early performances from Leo Rossi, Ana Alicia and Lance Guest.  Michael is more vicious in this one, coming up with more devilish ways to dispose of his victims, and while this is effective, it doesn't parallel the way John Carpenter used little gore in his first and still created almost unbearable tension.  Also, the people who make horror movies must never have been admitted to a hospital.  This hospital is almost deserted; if you've ever been in the hospital, you know it's just as noisy in the night as during the day, and we get no patients or pages in this hospital either---but the hospitals emptiness adds to the chilling factor so dramatic license wins out.<br /><br />All in all, director Rick Rosenthal keeps things moving and this is the best of the many sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N7YA81ZI4KAF.html">A1N7YA81ZI4KAF</a><br/><p>The second chapter in the never-ending series starts off where the first film left off. After her scuffle with the ever powerful and relentless Michael Myer's, a wounded Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is taken to a nearby hospital. Myers follows her there with the determined Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) hot on his tracks.<br /><br />The original "Halloween" is a classic of the genre and is held in high esteem not just by horror film fans but by movie buffs in general. The sequels on the other hand are not. But that hasn't stopped the "Halloween" series from being one of the most popular of the horror film franchises. "Halloween II" in my opinion, is the best out of all the sequels and definately one of the grisliest. The original used suspense to terrorize its target audience, "Halloween II" goes straight for the jugular. Although it's not always gory, the deaths are violent and gruesome. One disgusting highlight involves a beautiful young nurse sans clothing and a scalding hot bath-tub. You do the math.<br /><br />One of the problems I had with this film is with the setting. I liked the hospital idea but "Haddonfield" memorial is a hospital I would never want to be taken to. Although the nurses are all young and attractive, the entire hospital is eerily empty. There are about 5 nurses on duty and despite having a maternity ward filled with new borns, there is no one around to attend to them. Having said that, the empty hospital was creepy and added to the overall tension. Another slight problem was with Jamie Lee Curtis' appearance. Although I loved her in the original and in this sequel, I couldn't get past the fact that she looked too old to be portraying a teenager. However, "Halloween II" would not have been the same without Curtis so I can overlook that tiny little detail and Curtis' performance is outstanding. Her Laurie Strode is one of my all-time favorite characters in a fright film.<br /><br />Despite the negatives, "Halloween II" is still a great slasher flick. It moves along at a pretty good pace and the body count is high, 2 very important factors in a horror/slasher film. Michael Myers also does his part in keeping us entertained by using very creative ways in killing off his unsuspecting victims. We're also given a back story. The connection between Laurie and Michael is finally explained. Despite this, Myers remains mysterious since the motivation behind his murderous rage is never made clear.<br /><br />"Halloween II" may not be in the same league as the classic original but it's bizarre death scenes, chilling score and Jamie Lee Curtis' gripping performance makes this the best sequel in the series. Fans of the genre will be glad Michael Myers came home.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>After "Prom Night" and because the success of her first non horror film, "Trading Places", Jamie Lee Curtis vowed never to do horror again. She came back for the sequel, only because John Carpenter started her career and he was producing this one. Luckily she did, but her role is minimal because she is heavily sedated throughout the film which takes place where the first left off, but now in a hospital. Her dialogue is short, but her screams are back plenty. The film is pretty slow but the classic music is back,(a little higher synth), and the hospital does have many oportunities for different murders. The murders are a plenty and pretty graphic for that matter. A nurse scalded in a hottub, a doctor with a needle in his eye, a nurse with a needle to the head, and various others. This film relies on the gore to keep it going, unlike Carpenters original which showed very little blood or violence. That film was built on suspense and moodyness. This film just has Michael wandering all over the hospital in various shots. They try to build suspense toward the end, but we have all seen it before in the original. Heck as long as Michael was there, he should have had his gunshot wounds attended too, lol. Also a pretty big hospital and that small of a staff, and where are the other patients? I have never seen a hospital that dark either, they are probably the most well lit buildings on the planet. Not a bad sequel, but not awesome either. Also, no way any more sequels could have been made after this, Michael and Doctor Loomis were cooked....ahh, hollywood magic. Anyone else notice Jamie's fake wig, wow, big budget, looks like something my grandmother wore. Trivia, look for Annie, victim in the original, before the chief, her father in the film closes her eyes, she blinks. Also Dana Carvey is an assistant to the news crew when they discover the bodies from the original. Also nice ramp Michael backs up on as he falls from the balcony at the beginning.</p></br></body></html>

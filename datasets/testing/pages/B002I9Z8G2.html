With Jonathan Frakes (Riker) at the helm as director, veteran TNG screenplay writers Braga and Moore, production designer Zimmerman, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, this film truly contains the best family of TNG artists ever assembled.  The quality of the film reflects this collaboration.  It is far and away superior to either Nemesis or Insurrection, and objectively much better than Generations (although I have a soft spot in my heart for that film).<br /><br />The story - another Borg cube has decided to challenge the Federation, and the fleet assembles for battle.  This time, the fleet fares better than at the Battle of Wolf 359 (as shown in the TNG episodes "Best of Both Worlds" I and II).  The Cube is destroyed, but a small escape ship emerges and vanishes through a temporal (time-travel) rift.  The Enterprise is quick to pursue, knowing that the Borg must intend travelling back in time to change history and/or assimilate Earth in the past.  Our heroes arrive in the year 2063 (just after WWIII in Trek lore) to find the small Borg ship bombarding Earth.  Their target - Earth's first warp-capable ship which allows humans to make First Contact with an alien species and ultimately pave the way for the creation of the Federation and of Starfleet.  The TNG crew must fight off the Borg (who take over the Engineering decks on the Enterprise), set the timeline right (without themselves disrupting it), and save the First Contact event.<br /><br />This must be the most action-oriented film of all the Treks.  There is a big space battle, hand-to-hand combat with the Borg, etc.  However, the soul of the film is still in the interactions between the characters: Worf and Picard disagree about how to best fight the Borg, Picard must rescue Data, Troi and Riker must work together to ensure First Contact, etc.  Even fan-favourite Reg Barkley makes an appearance!  Seamlessly inserted into the cast are Alfrie Woodard as a 21st-century engineer and James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane, legendary pilot and inventor of Earth's first warp-capable ship.  A word about the soundtrack is appropriate here as well - veteran Jerry Goldsmith delivers a supurb score, weaving in elements of his other Trek scores.  Worf's action scenes are punctuated by the Klingon theme from ST:TMP, the space-walk music is reminiscent of the V'ger theme, etc.<br /><br />So why only the 3-star rating?  Unfortunately, there are a lot of little issues that detract from the enjoyment of the film upon repeated viewings, which is why you buy the DVD, after all.  For example, the first 45 minutes are fantastic - action, suspense, pacing, etc. are perfect.  After that, though, the editors and/or director allow the picture to slow down and it seems to run out of steam.  More alarming are more fundamental story problems.  For example:  the away team loses contact with the Enterprise (when the Borg take over part of it) but never seems concerned.  In addition, we get an extended Moby Dick reference, which is basically a rehash of Star Trek II - there's lots of literature out there to quote, it's sheer laziness to repeat the Moby Dick theme.<br /><br />But the most serious problem is the change wrought upon the Borg, relative to their civilisation in the TV show.  They are given a queen who, apparently, controls the collective consciousness.  Suddenly there is a leader who, when killed, fatally disrupts the collective so it can no longer function.  The original point of the Borg was that they were not hierarchical - the only way to kill the Borg was to wipe out every single one of them.  Now, suddenly, there is a simple magic bullet solution that all you have to do is find and kill the leader?  This completely negates the strength and fearsomeness of the Borg, making them another mundane enemy race.<br /><br />Naturally, I have no complaints about this special edition.  There are lots of goodies here, including three commentaries by (in order of decreasing interest) writers Braga and Moore, Trek guru Okuda, and director Frakes.  There are lots of little featurettes to keep the techies happy, talking about effects, design, etc.  And the price is very reasonable for a DVD of this quality!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>After all, with the Borg, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />The ILM effects are terrific, the performances by James Cromwell, Alice Krige (sp?) and Alfie Woodard are top notch .<br /><br />The best things about this film is Picard trying to control his lust for revenge, and Data being tempted by the human flesh he is given by the Borg queen!<br /><br />The plot is unique, and the action is varied.<br /><br />Alas, there are some problems...<br /><br />The early starship battle scene is too short, and the destruction of the Borg cube is too easy!!<br /><br />Some of the humor falls on it's face... like when Picard and Data are touching the starship "Pheonix," Troi asks them if the "three of  them" would "like to be alone."  later on, Troi plays intoxicated well, but it just ends up being silly. And Picard's line "rumors of my assimilation have been greatly exagerated..." made me groan out loud.<br /><br />And finally, the Borg Queen is too human like! Her behavior is emotional and tempermental. The scariest thing about the Borg as a race is their dispassionate, cold and mechanical motivations... and here their leader acts like some reject from "Desperate Housewives."<br /><br />And the "time travel" plot has a hole. If the Borg can time travel at the push of a button, why don't they try to assimilate Earth in the past... over, and over, and over again? With that type of power, the entire Universe should be "assimilated."<br /><br />Despite these problems, this film is the most consistent of the Next Gen films and is thoroughly enjoyable!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "the Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>First Contact is the "event" motion picture highlight of the Star Trek series. After so many films and so many years, the series finally achieves the lauded standards that could rival and even surpass other big-screen sci-fi adventures. What we have here is a mostly terrific and exciting adventure, filled with superior special effects and an engaging, complex plot to boot. <p>First Contact wastes no time getting into the thick of action. A borg ship (shaped like a cube and incredibly massive in size) is heading toward Earth and an all-out space battle ensues, with the Enterprise-E at the helm. With Captain Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) intimate knowledge of this cyborg race, the fleet destroys the ship, but a small pod is jettisoned, which then travels back in time and alters the course of human history, where Earth in the future will be completely inhabited by the Borg. Determined to prevent this nightmarish future from taking place, the Enterprise-E enters the time rip and must battle the Borg in the year 2063, the dawn of interstellar space travel. <p>The question for non Trek-fans is whether they'll like the movie. My advice is to watch a few of the Borg episodes and catch up on the previous film to get a feel for all the characters. Otherwise, they'll probably be baffled by the large cast and all the in-house references. But for everyone else, First Contact will play as first-rate escapist entertainment, a sci-fi thrill ride packed with action, suspense, humor, and even genuinely touching drama.<p>First and foremost, part of what makes the suspense so palpable is because the crew is facing the Borg, undeniably the best villains of the entire Star Trek canon. For those who know next to nothing about this alien race, they exist by assimilating other species into a collective whole, a hive if you will. They show and feel no fear, and that lack of expression can be quite creepy. As far as their appearances go, it's basically organic flesh with lots of cybernetic and machine parts grafted on. I'm not sure how the assimilation process works, but I'd suspect it's not too dissimilar from a virulent attack.<p>It's arguable that First Contact is the most consistently exciting Trek film to date. This one works as a pure thriller, with several standout action setpieces. Getting things off to a rollicking start is the fast-paced and tense opening space battle, complete with dozens of Starfleet ships attacking the giant Borg cube. Later encounters with the Borg on board the Enterprise (they're assimilating the ship deck-by-deck) are exciting and even a little frightening. You even get to see Data (the android) crushing the Borg with his bare hands, a physical display that he doesn't show too often. The film's best and most suspenseful sequence is the zero-g battle set on the hull of the ship.<p>First Contact is not without its problems. Easily the most significant flaw of the film are the scenes set on Earth. While vital plot-wise, these moments serve to interrupt the tense action on board the Enterprise. Thankfully, these parts only represent a minor portion of the film. Another problem, for me at least, is that Star Trek was often at its best when the crew set courses for alien planets or star systems. Virtually all of First Contact is set within a short distance to Earth, so that sense of awe and adventure is a bit lacking.<p>Then there's the climax, which is suspenseful and exciting, but it's a little abrupt and might come as a deus ex machina to some viewers. For those who want their space adventures to end with a huge bang, the twenty-five minute space battle finale to Star Trek: Nemesis might be more up their alley. One of the biggest flaws of Nemesis was that it was often too talky, and there's also a lot of talk going on in First Contact. The difference is that, here, the dialogue accentuates and even heightens the suspense, as we're always made aware of the stakes and dangers on-hand. <p>Acting-wise, First Contact is unsurprisingly solid. considering the cast has been in these roles for years. Patrick Stewart is the best here, delivering a riveting, power-house performance. The scene where he argues why the Enterprise should stay and fight as opposed to fleeing is simply the best piece of acting in the entire series, period. Brent Spiner is excellent as Data, a role he's fitted so comfortably in, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part. The other most significant role belongs to Alfre Woodard as a tough, 21st century woman who finds herself lost on board the Enterprise. The writers cleverly make her both an engaging character and an effective device for which to explain more confusing plot-points (to non-Trek fans, that is) and Trek history.<p>Directed by Jonathan Frakes (who also plays the part of Commander Riker), the man displays a supremely confident hand behind the camera. Visually, this one breaks the mold from its predecessors. The atmosphere and lighting are darker, and there's even an improved uniform change for the entire crew (obviously done only for aesthetic purposes, but who's complaining?). Too bad success wouldn't be repeated with the gag-inducing Star Trek: Insurrection. The Next Generation films have overall been successful from a quality filmmaking point-of-view. And without a doubt, First Contact represents a pinnacle for this often innovative franchise.<br />**** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>One editorial review is right:  the even numbers are better.<br /><br />There is a Next Generation episode which shares the name "First Contact", but the only common thread is the contact with a planet and those outside.  Actually, the emphasis is not as much on the first contact but the battle to allow it to be so.<br /><br />SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!  I found elements of different movies in this story, especially hints to Star Treks III (destroying the Enterprise) and IV (going back in time and telling select earth people something about the future).  Sometimes, it takes away from the originality of the story, but this is an exception.<br /><br />Unlike Generations, this movie developed the teamwork that made this series and all other Star Treks.  However, the movie gets right into the action.<br /><br />I find the Borg the most disturbing of the Star Trek villains, and this fit the bill.  Alice Krige was excellent in her role.<br /><br />There are themes that were great in this movie.  For example, the friendship between Captain Picard and Data and sacrifice.  The issue of revenge and obsession.  The issue of submission to authority and the boldness to take risks when necessary.  The fact that people we look up to as heroes are just ordinary people like you and I who are motivated by the same things we are (or maybe not as high a motivation).  As a Christian, I can see spiritual warfare implications in the movie, as well as illustrations of pitfalls we believers can fall into.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Everybody knows that Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered the best of the TNG films, and also probably one of the better Star Trek movies overall. I won't add much more except to say that the movie works so well because it blends the best of Star Trek - humor, action, and a morality play - into one package. The film has some genuinely funny moments, especially when Drs. Cochrane and Lilly are forced to adapt to 24th century technology and expectations.<br /><br />Given its reputation as an action-packed battle against the Borg, there aren't that many action sequences in First Contact, but those that are included are deliberate, emotionally tense, and advance the plot. Jonathan Frakes (also William Riker) made some interesting decisions in portraying the fighting scenes. Often, the best moments occur just before or after the battles start, when the Borg seem indomitable. Unfortunately, the producers learned the wrong lessons from First Contact's success and overdosed on the action scenes in Insurrection and Nemesis (which actually has its moments, despite the action scenes).<br /><br />Finally, First Contact contains two morality plays. The first focuses on Picard's thirst for revenge against the Borg. The second disabuses viewers of the notion that historical visionaries need have a saintly persona. Dr. Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive, comes across as a self-absorbed alcoholic. However, as viewers learn to readjust their expectations to fit the man, Cochrane also comes to realize that he can be a man and be part of history.<br /><br />It's a shame that nearly 10 years after the last TNG film aired First Contact is really the only TNG film that stands as unanimously beloved. Despite what many producers and market analysts claim, it's not simply because First Contact uses the Borg and time travel as plot devices - although both work well. Rather, it's because it combines the best of Star Trek. Hopefully future Star Trek movies will learn these lessons.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>Everybody knows that Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered the best of the TNG films, and also probably one of the better Star Trek movies overall.

Everything's going fine until a big Borg ball comes flying out towards Earth, spitting out "tachyon particles" which we Trekkers know means time travel.  Yummy.<br /><br />The better aspects of this film:  What would you do with a historic figure?  Would you tell him all about his future exploits?  Or when you find out he likes to drink moonshine, '60s rock, and only invented Warp Drive for the money, what would you think of him then?  Kinda like finding out George Washington had black slaves, that kinda thing.<br /><br />Deanna Troy getting tipsy was fun; Data apparently being lured by the Dark Side (sex); and Picard's obsession with the Borg being in line with Melville's obsession with Moby Dick (plus a quote from the book).<br /><br />Nice direction from Frakes and a good way to wrap up the Next Gen.<br /><br />The second DVD has various Trekkie things, such as Jerry Goldsmith tribute.  Gosh, I had no idea he did the music for Voyager, Star Trek The Motion Picture, and ALIEN.  WOW....<br /><br />What else you should beam up to your Wish List, Scotty:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305910189">Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6T262">Star Trek Movie Set (The Motion Picture/ The Wrath of Khan/ The Search for Spock/ The Voyage Home/ The Final Frontier/ The Undiscovered Country/ Generations/ First Contact/ Insurrection/ Nemesis)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRT">Star Trek - Nemesis (Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is by far the best of the Next Generation Star Trek films and probably second only to 'Star Trek IV The Voyage Home' in terms of all the Star Trek films. Its almost a direct continuation of the TNG episodes "The Best of Both Worlds" in which Jean Luc Picard is assimalated by the Borg.<br /><br />The story has been told by many other reviewers, so I will not repeat that. However, I will say that here you get an excellent story, which is well directed by Jonathan Frakes, and above all a marvellous leading performance by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean Luc Picard.<br /><br />The 2nd disc contains hours and hours of extras which are well worth watching. You can see from the interviews on the extras disc the enthusiasm of all those involved in the making of the film.<br /><br />All the things that make, or have made, Star Trek such a long-standing success are contained in this film: The marvellous interaction of the characters and cast with each other. Decisions that affect the future of humanity, a moral quality which may ultimately be the way forward for us all, and as with all the best Star Trek films and TV shows time travel.<br /><br />Of course I realise that 'a moral quality' sounds horribly pretentious, and in reality this is just a film that will have no affect on mankinds future (or lack of it). So forget about that and watch a cracking film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>That's the key question one should ask himself when viewing "Star Trek:  First Contact."  In this first solo outing for the TNG crew, Picard and the gang find themselves facing off against the highly popular villains called the Borg.  Having been defeated every time they've battled the Enterprise, the Borg devise a plan to travel back in time to stop a key event in Earth's history and then (big shocker) assimilate everybody.  In a heated and action-packed space battle, the Borg jump through time with the Enterprise E hot on their tale.  The Borg cube is destroyed almost immediately, but this is only the beginning of a fast-paced and highly enjoyable action/dramatic yarn that goes so far as to question a particular crewmember's sanity.<br /><br />While he isn't at the helm of the Enterprise in this film, Jonathan Frakes does call the shots behind the camera.  He takes the screenplay crafted by Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore and blends just enough action into the script to keep the story moving at a good clip.  As much as I enjoy TNG, I do have to say that the series was often weighed down by long and drawn out moments of dialogue.  Frakes puts the brakes on these sequences at just the right time.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart delivers a solid performance as Picard.  Matching him scene-for-scene is Alfre Woodard in an excellent performance as a fish-out-of-water aboard the Enterprise.  James Cromwell proves once again that he deserves bigger roles than the ones he usually gets.  Brent Spiner is sufficient as always as Data and the rest of the crew do an excellent job as well.<br /><br />The music and special effects are also very good.  As stated before, the space battle sequence is amazing.  There's also some zero-gravity action as well.<br /><br />This two-disc set is an excellent addition to any Trek fan's collection (or, in this case, collective).  The special features are a nice treat, and I personally enjoyed the audio commentary from Frakes.  I highly recommend this action-packed space yarn to Trek fans as well as fans of excellent science fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Another of my "retro-reviews","Star Trek:First Contact" is by far and away the best of the new generation movies made.<br />The movie sets the mood and pace almost right from the get go.The Earth is being assaulted by a Borg cube ship but the Enterprise is told to stand down and is sent to a remote section of the quadrant to do some star mapping.This step has been apparently taken by the Earth governing hierarchy due to Picards' assimilation by the Borg years before.<br />The battle is listened to closely by the bridge crew and all is not going well.When Picard cannot take anymore he hurries back to Earth to help.They arrive in the nick of time and help to destroy the cube ship.But a Borg escape pod gets away and hurls earthward.The Enterprise pursues and goes through the same time portal the escape pod creates.They are taken back to the year 2063 and it seems the Borg are here to stop Zephram Cochran(inventor of warp drive)from taking his first flight(due to be the next day) and conquer Earth itself;to change the future for their own purposes.<br />The Enterprise closes in on the pod which is firing Earthward and destroys it.Unbeknownst to the crew though,a party of Borg transported aboard the ship,seconds before its' destruction.The Enterprise crew lands on Earth and meets the warp drive inventor and assists him in every way possible so he makes the all important flight.Besides the flight being a first test for warp drive it will also lead to a first contact situation with intelligent alien life which in turn will lead the Earth on its' path towards permanent space exploration.<br />During all this time with Cochran the crew slowly realizes and starts to come to grips with the Borg threat aboard the Enterprise.<br />Several crew members are taken hostage and assimilated including Data.Picard eventually gives himself to the Borg who are lead by a queen.<br />It's touch and go but Picard with Data's help,eventually defeats the queen and her coterie.The ship is saved from destruction and Cochrans' historic flight takes place as it should with the positive resultant effects.<br />The movie rarely stops for a moment as the pace is relentless and it keeps you focused all the time.All of the new gen crew are there who do a good job playing the characters to a tee from the TV show and even DS9 is given a nod as Worf comes aboard after having lead an almost fatal attack against the Borg on the Defiant.The queen Borg is played by Alice Krige who gives a great performance with just the right amount of omnipotence and menace coupled with a good measure of faux sincerity in her voice and body language.<br />There are some very minor drawbacks here and there in this film.The biggest one however is Zephram Cochran himself.Anyone in the least familiar with Star Trek,and the original series in particular,knows  about Cochran.Captain Kirk met Cochran on a far away planet in one of the better known eps.There are slight differences in detail from the Cochran of Picard and the one of Kirk.Not the least of which being their physical appearances and mannerisms.There is very little if anything one can match up between the two actors or their characters,only that we are supposed to believe that they are one and the same Cochran.The writers knew they were taking a chance with this aspect and while over-all plot wise it works,with me there's always that thing in my head that keeps saying:"No,these are just NOT the same people".And that always creates that "bump" in an otherwise smooth ride.<br />Technically the print is crisp and clear and the transfer was very good.The two disc set here has alot of features to offer and should satisfy all the Trek fans.<br />In conclusion this is overall a really good movie and a worthy entry in the Star Trek cannon.Its' plot is quick and well thought out and the acting is spot on throughout and Ms.Kriges' performance as a Borg queen is a standout.If your a Star Trek fan this movie deserves a spot on your shelf.It's just too bad the follow ups to this didn't come close in script and execution.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew (Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates Mcfadden, and Marina Sirtus) have been given orders not to interfer in the battle between the Borg ship and the Federatuib ship. But the sinister Borg race with their sexy leader (Alice Krige) have a dastardly plan to go back in time so they can enslave the human race on Earth in the 21st century, the Enterprise follows them as their only chance in stopping the borg is to find the creator of warp drive known as Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell) and his assistant Lily (Alfe Woodard) and stop the Borg's plan.<br /><br />The greatest ST sequel since "Wraith of Khan" and yet the most satisyfying! The acting and special effects are fantastic, the storyline is well constructed and director/actor Jonathan Frakes has really made the movie into one of the best sci-fi movies ever. Ms. Krige is quite a dish for a cybernetic villainess in this movie, Jerry Goldsmith's score soars high as one of his best and is the best film of the Next Generation  part of the ST franchise, a real winner in my books.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent sound and picture that is better then the original DVD all the way! extras include audio commentaries, Text Commentary from Denise and Michael Okuda, Teasers and Trailers, Scene deconstruction, A tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The crew of the Enterprise-E pursues a Borg ship back in time to foil their plan to change human history by preventing mankind's first contact with another species.  This adventure is the best of the generally underwhelming Next Generation films, with good solid action and a fast-moving plot.  Still, my general criticism of these films remains--they all feel like expanded episodes of the TV series.  I really wish they had taken the opportunity to take these characters into new territory like the Original Series films did.  Even if they split up the crew, I'm sure that a talented writer could have devised stories that would have required them to come back together every couple years or so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>Coming off the disappointing film that was "Star Trek Generations", I was hoping that this film would give this series a boost. After viewing, I was thrilled that this film did just that, and then some. I really liked this one, its one of the best in the entire Star Trek film series. Again, the important thing is that the plot to the basic story to the movie is good. The crew has to travel back in time to stop the Borg from assimilating the human race in the past, and make sure that humans make "first contact" with alien lifeforms. Though, the whole time travel thing has been done a lot, when done right, it still works. But I do think that a bit of this story is borrowed from the original Star Trek episode "Assignment: Earth". Again, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation series, and I'm not too familiar with the cast, but I knew about the Borg storyline from the show. And it really does make for a good motion picture. The film starts quickly and flows nicely. Cast member Johnathan Frakes directs this one, and does a good job. And the acting is as good as you're gonna get in these films. Overall, this one is definitely worth watching and owning. Again, its one of the best in the Star Trek movie series.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>This was the last movie that was even halfway decent. After this one, I don't know why any more were ever made. There is so much you can do with the star trek franchise and THIS film proves it. It's the first time they have the screen all to themselves (which is to say without the old crew) and it's the only time that they do a decent job of carrying on the torch that was passed to them by the original crew.<br /><br />First Contact has some of the best actors around. James Cromwell and Alfrie Woodard are positively wonderful additions to the Star Trek phenomena. There were just too many questions left. Too many loose ends left untied. And too many times when I said "so what." during the show. The crew exists as cardboard cutouts of their television personas. The most dynamic character in this movie is the Borg Queen. And that is just amazingly disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>For one thing, it played upon the tv series's best episodes (Best of both world 1&2). It also featured the Borg, while they were still cool and menacing - before they were made absolutely pathetic and neutered by the Voyager series which I think was the worst of the newer Treks, even worse than Enterprise.<br /><br />Anyhow, the premise is your classic time travel to save the Earth from having its past altered. Of course, it did seem silly, that the borg would go to all that trouble when technically, they should be able to take Earth quite easily if they really wanted to.<br /><br />Still, the story of first contact is great cannon wise, because it shows the first time humans meet the vulcans. It's nice to see this part explained, although you will end up wondering, so, it was only because of Picard and his crew that the Federation was born? If you start dealing with time travel, then one usually gets into the muddy parts, like how their part in the past had already happened and they were merely replaying history, so technically their winning was already decided all along.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of action, and was pretty well directed by Jonathan Frakes. I've seen some of his other movies, and he's a decent director, when he's given a good script and a fairly sizeable budget.<br /><br />The Data subplot is interesting too, since it really plays out the paragon between your deepest desires and whether one has the fortitude to reject them for the good of friends.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be in your collection, especially if you are a TNG fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>(...)

He wasn't always given the best work in Star Trek and this is some of his finest work he has ever done.<p>Jonathan Frakes is great. Not only does he continue his role as Cmdr. Riker but he directed the film. He uses the suspense and unkown of the Borg well. He really does add to there race with what he does with them in the movie. He's funny as Riker and is less of the playboy that Riker is in the show.<p>Brent Spiner is great as well. It's a shame he hasn't done a lot more out of Star Trek. He really gets into his characters well and plays them well. Data is one of the most beloved characters in Star Trek and the film really shows why.<p>Levar Burton has a great role in the film. He plays Geordi well in what has become his signature role. He's argueably the most successful man ouside of Star Trek with his role on Reading Rainbow and from the hit mini series Roots. It's great to see Geordi without that stupid visor he had the show. I love his optical implants.<p>I love the score Jerry Goldsmith wrote for this film. I think it's the best work he's ever done. I think it got jipped at the Oscars. The woodwind and horns are beautiful in the theme. If your a classical music fan you should love the score.<p>Star Trek Fist Contact is one of the best Star Trek films ever made. Fans outside of Star Trek should like it. You don't have to be a trekkie to understand the film which really helps it a lot. It's a must for anybody that calls themself a Trekkie and I think all Sci-Fi fans should see it. It's a great movie that will do what movies are suppose to do: Teach us a lesson and Entertain us.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>MY REVIEW.  Star Trek movie rank #2 of 10.  Frakes did a great job with a very busy script here.  I was tempted to make this my #1 favorite Star trek movie, but Wrath of khan won out.  Within my family though this is the children favorite ST movie.  The borg are cool.  They like the Obe Dobe song.  They love the "Mean Queen".  Stewart is terrific as Picard, and I will miss him in future ST movies.  Maybe frakes can pick it up.  Or how about some movies about Captain Archer!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>Hey, I proudly call myself a Trekkie, but some of the reviewers here take this stuff WAY too seriously. It's only a movie, folks, and I suggest if you are so upset that Zefrem Cochrane is a drunken lout, that you should really find something better to do with your time. <p>This is a fun Trek back in time to, oh, about 50 years from now, after World War III but before Warp Drive. The Borg are trying to wipe out The Federation before they even exist (like most Trek time-travel shows, it's best to not think too hard about the science or even the plausibility of the plot, just accept it and you'll enjoy it far more).<p>The key interactions here are between Picard, who is bent on revenge and redemption owing from the time of his captivity with the Borg, and the Borg Queen. Data also features prominently, and well. There is plenty of Trek humor too.<p>Add in a decent ending and you've got a great Trek flick. Still only 4 stars because no Trek flick is worth 5 stars. (Although I did give 5 stars to &quot;All Good Things...&quot; TNG's 2-episode finale.)<p>Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>Even though Star Trek: Generations was a good first entry in The Next Generation era of feature films, it wasn't until Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga wrote Star Trek: First Contact's story and screenplay that Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew proved that they could carry a Trek film without help from The Original Series' cast.<p>It also helped that the film was more action-oriented than Star Trek VII.  Sure, the last battle of the NCC-1701 D was impressive and the brief meeting of Captains James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard did provide Trek fans with some exciting and moving moments, but what fans really wanted was a muscular...action movie with a mission (and antagonists) worthy of the Next Generation crew and the new, top-of-the line Enterprise E.<p>Star Trek: First Contact brings back the Borg, a race of half-organic, half cybernetic beings whose goal is to destroy other races by assimilating their technology and transforming the survivors by injecting microscopic nanoprobes that turn humans, Vulcans, El-Aurians -- anyone, really -- into unfeeling, relentless drones.  As fans of the 1987-1994 syndicated series know, Capt. Picard was once captured by the Borg and transformed into Locutus, a Borg strategist/spokesdrone whose intimate knowledge of Starfleet technology,its tactics and its officers nearly spelled certain defeat for the Federation at the Battle of Wolf 359.<p>Now, several years later, the Borg are back and meaner than ever.  Having been thwarted more than once in the 24th Century by Picard and his crew, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) leads a single-cubeship invasion force into Federation space, hoping to defeat the Federation by either conquering Earth in a battle against Starfleet...or tinkering with the timeline and going back to the 21st Century to prevent humanity's first contact with another spacefaring race.<p>Actor Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Will Riker) makes his feature film directing debut in this eighth installment of the Star Trek movie series, and although he would only direct the weaker Star Trek: Insurrection, he does a great job at helming a very high-octane action flick that involves time travel, space battles, a strong Picard/Data storyline and elements from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and the then-still new Voyager.<p>Guest stars James Cromwell (The Sum of All Fears, Babe) and Alfre Woodward join the cast of TNG as warp-drive inventor Zefram Cochrane and his friend and assistant Lily, who add a certain mixture of edginess and wit to the film.  Cromwell fares particularly well as Cochrane, a character first seen in The Original Series episode Metamorphosis. While Cromwell doesn't remotely look like the then-30 or 40-something Glen Corbett, he portrays the legendary "father of warp drive" as a very human and flawed genius -- he is cranky, cynical and drinks way too much -- who is bemused by the hero-worship he receives from the Enterprise crew.  He also gets some of the best lines. (My favorite: "You're astronauts...on some kind of star trek?")<p>Also contributing to the excitement is Jerry Goldsmith's score, a mixture of a lovely new main theme and such familiar touchstones as Alexander Courage's fanfare for the Original Series theme and Goldsmith's own "Main Theme" for Star Trek's first feature film (and later adapted as The Next Generation's main title).<p>Although First Contact does require some familiarity with the Star Trek universe and its history, it's clearly among the best of the 10 in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>While "Star Trek:  First Contact" rewrites too much of the original TV series' history--a debilitating addiction the current production people can't seem to shake--it delivers a rollicking adventure that is more in keeping with Captain Kirk's episodes than any other "TNG" film.  That's really good because on TV, talky Captain Picard and crew often seemed better suited for Monday morning board meetings than the intergalactic perils of space opera.  In this one, a race of cybernauts called the Borg decide to revise Earth history by stopping the first human excursion with warp drive.  Picard and crew follow the aliens back in time, meeting with a cynical, drunken inventor (a laconic James Cromwell) who revises their assessment of his place in history.  Unlike the other TNG films, this one's plotted more like a film than a TV show, meaning that the pace is less likely to put you to sleep, even if Star Trek still can't quite escape cornball humor or pure cheese.  (How many times does Data have to discover his humanity or Worf be told he's a warrior worthy of respect?  Why do characters rely so often on a pregnant pause and one last line before exiting?  Just how much technobabble can we really take?)  The regular cast is as good as it's always been--which is to say, adequate--but Alice Krige stands out as the creepily sexy Borg queen and though she's frequently bug-eyed with excitement, Alfre Woodard deserves more screen time as Picard's potential love interest.  The real stars here, though, are Jonathan Frakes as director, who seems to actually understand and respect the material he's working with, and Jerry Goldsmith, whose score is among the better in the series.  When the humans meet up with a surprise alien race at the end, the moment might actually give you goosebumps.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>The only reason why I'm giving the DVD 4 stars is because Paramount did  not go the extra mile for die-hard fans by putting in some of the  interactive content and added bonuses that DVDs were made for... &quot;The  Matrix&quot; is a prime example of how a DVD should be presented. The DVD  widescreen format is sweet and the DVD does include 2 theatrical trailers,  but that's it. :-)<p>Now that I'm off my soap box, I must say that this is  the best Star Trek movie made to date. Sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat movie  watching experience.<p>The Borg are back and now they're out to destroy  Earth.  Former assimilated Borg himself, Jean-Luc Picard is off to the  rescue in this extremely entertaining sci-fi adventure. What could be more  romantic that the captain of the best ship in the fleet off to rescue  mother earth from the most evil force in the Galaxy!<p>Alfre Woodard really  adds a lot to this film and to the development of Picard's character. You  don't have to be a Star Trek fanatic or even a regular watcher of the film  to enjoy it... a lot is explained to the ST neophyte in the opening  sequences... but this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the tv  series.<p>The best ST captain yet vs. the worst enemy the Federation has  ever met... an enemy with no soul - like a virus, they just spread and  consume and do it without mercy.  I had this movie on VHS but I watched it  so many times, the tape broke, so I got it on DVD.  Just a great flick -  emotionally thrilling and lots of eye candy and SFX thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>But this--this movie turned me from being a casual Trek fan into a huge Trek fan. I saw this movie in the local theater at a formative age, and I remeber being amazed not only by the remarkable visual effects and perfect dramatic pace, but also by the intelligent story and rich character study. It has been noted that Star Trek movies can often turn into long episodes you have to pay to watch, but this movie certainly can't be accused of that--it's bold, daring, and exciting, not to mention nearly perfect. Nearly--there are a few minor logical flaws in the plot, but this movie truly is space opera, and as with most opera, you have to suspend your disbelief a little.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) battling the Borg physically and psychologically. After foiling a Borg plot to assimilate Earth, the Borg go back in time to stop a pivotal moment in Earth's history from occurring, thus making Humanity an easy target. So, it's up to the Enterprise crew to a) get history back on track and b) defeat the Borg. It could easily have been standard-issue thriller material, but it is intelligently handled, emphasizing the characters rather than the action. We see Picard go from the stoic renaissance man to revenge-obsessed Ahab, and Data from loyal officer to Sampson (with the terrific Alice Krige supplying the Delilah as the sensual Borg Queen). The planet-side sequences have their moments, too, but like all the Next Generation movies, this is the Picard and Data show, and for good reason--the actors' obvious talent at making characters they had played for near a decade come up with new facets to explore. It's certainly a trip.<br /><br />Of all the Next Generation movies (heck, all the Trek movies, excepting Wrath of Khan), this movie is the most evenly paced and best plotted. Considering that this movie underwent half a dozen different shifts in what it was meant to be about--at one point it was going to take place in the middle ages and be called Star Trek: Renaissance--it's a testament to the actors and writers that the material never gets away from them--a temptation that proved all too powerful in the next installment (Insurrection). On the technical side, the direction from Jonathan Frakes (a.k.a. Commander Riker) is superlative--he manages to draw out Patrick Stewart's most complex performance as Picard, and the lighting, camerawork, and sound are all impeccable. The special effects, of course, are still impressive a decade later, thanks to George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic studios (this was the last Star Trek film they did). The Enterprise-E looks fabulous, and thankfully, there are no trips to Bronson Canyon in this movie (why do all the deserts in the Star Trek series look similar? Well...). Although it doesn't quite beat out the slightly more literate and philosophically dense Wrath of Khan for the title of Best Star Trek Movie, it finishes a solid second in my book. If you only buy one Star Trek movie, buy Wrath of Khan. But if you buy two, buy this one in addition to Wrath of Khan. You'll be really glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>If you're a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fan, this is the film for you. The Federation's most deadly enemy, the Borg, are en route for earth --- and in &quot;Terminator&quot; style, they're headed to  earth's past to assimilate earth while they've still got technology worth  assimilating, but are too vulnerable to fight off the Borg's superior  firepower.<p>Excellent performances by the entire cast including the  awesome Alfre Woodard and Oscar nominee James Cromwell.<p>Relationships  among the crew (especially between Worf and Picard) are explored and  developed further. The friendship between Picard and Data is also put to  the test when the Borg Queen seeks to seduce them both with her promises of  power and perfection.<p>The DVD is lacking in that it just has a couple of  theatrical trailers and that's it. It would have been nice to see some  behind-the-scenes footage, special effects, out takes, etc... it's almost a  waste of the medium.  I first bought this on VHS, which included an  interesting motion photo of Picard, the Queen and Data (who morphs into an  assimilated Data when you tilt the image)... the DVD doesn't have this cool  motion photo on the box/case.  I definitely prefer DVD to VHS because  (unless you set it on fire or let your dogs play frisbee with them) DVDs  essentially last forever and tapes are not a permanent medium and are  subject to skipping, tracking errors and eventually, decay.  It's nice that  you can quickly jump from scene to scene w/ a DVD and there is never a need  to rewind before you eject... but other than the inherent advantages of the  DVD medium over tape, the DVD offers nothing else you can't view on the  tape. The tape version is also in letterbox format.<p>Other than the lack  of extras, this film is awesome. I sat on the edge of my seat when I saw  this in the theater and I see it at least once a month now that I have it  on DVD. It is exciting and entertaining and definitely the best Star Trek  film yet.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>Naw, it doesn't really have the same ring as 'Damn it, Jim...' does it? However, this is still the only Next Gen movie that comes even close to the genius of The Wrath Of Khan, The Voyage Home and Undiscovered Country.<br /><br />First Contact is the Next Gen crew at their very best, and this intelligently scripted movie excels at all levels. There are also so many excellent performances in here, including a stunning Alice Krige as The Borg Queen, that this movie will keep the average fan on the edge of her/his seat.<br /><br />Yet it is not all intensity, and Marina Sirtis turns in a hilarious and quite frankly, very sexy performance as a tipsy Deanna Troi. It is the increased warmth between the crew members that stirs echoes of the Classic Trek crew, and had the Next Gen movies been able to duplicate the high standard set by First Contact, they would have won over a lot more fans. Sadly, Insurrection and Nemesis never delivered on the promise of this genuine classic.<br /><br />Will they make another movie to repair the lost credibility over Nemesis? I don't know. After all, I'm just a reviewer Jim, not a miracle worker.<br /><br />Definitely an important purchase. Damn it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>"Star Trek: First Contact" is the best of the films that feature the cast of "The Next Generation." It features all the classic "Trek" elements, while injecting horror, humor, and a bit of "Trek" history into the mix.

The featurettes are great, and the two commentary tracks (The first by Actor/Director Jonathan Frakes, and the second by screenwriters Ronald D.

The plot was superb, the characterization excellent (with one exception, discussed below), the action compelling and the visual presentation magnificent.  Our TNG crew again performed with distinction, revealing humanity's entire range of characteristics from weakness to triumph.  Captain Picard, the character first among equals in this film, prevailed over the Borg, extracting revenge for his assimilation years before.  The Borg Queen was, in all of her grotesque-ness, peculiarly seductive -- even to a guy just watching the DVD.  I hope everyone involved with this film had a great deal of fun working on it, because their results in the Star Trek genre are unsurpassed.<p>The only, only tiny difficulty with this movie -- small but eminently agonizing -- was that Wesley Crusher was not on hand to step in at some point, discover some problem/solution that all of the adults had completely failed to notice, and save the Federation from total annihilation (once again).</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Even numbered Trek films are known to be better, and this eighth installment isn't an exception.  Jonathan Frakes makes his feature film directorial debut here which finds Captain Picard and crew journeying back in time to stop the Borg from altering history and assimilating Earth.  Patrick Stewart gives his best performance as Picard ever, while Alice Krige is both seductive and terrifying as the Borg Queen.  The special effects are top notch, and the Borg look scarier and more grotesque than they ever have before.  This is undoubtadly the best Trek film to feature the Next Generation crew, and Frakes' nice balance of humor, action, suspense, and horror make Star Trek: First Contact one of the best films in the series.  Even though the DVD itself is in desperate need of being re-released with extras worthy of the film, the picture and audio quality is unbelieveably top notch and looks and sounds great on home theater systems.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This is far and away the best Star Trek movie.  What I liked best about it is the ultimately very positive and hopeful future that it envisions for humanity.  &quot;Disease and war, within 50 years, they'll all be gone.&quot;  YES!  And the movie ultimately explains how this will come to pass, in an entirely believable way that is consistent with &quot;Star Trek history.&quot;  Too bad they had to throw in another world war first...<p>I thought that the acting by all of the main characters was pretty good--some of their best.

He articulates the technical and artistic details with both cast and crew extremely easily.<p>Having directed some of the STTNG series epsiodes he certainly got his feet wet in the department of special effects photography.<p>There are great funny moments, lots of drama and another time-travel story that is very intriguing and detailed in its goal to save mankind once again. The score once again in my all time favorite, Jerry GOldsmith - and does he set the mood!<p>We have th eBorg to thank for this movie. Constantly trying to assimilate the universe...they make one more attempt to their fatality. They are the most enticing aliens since the Talosians of the original Trek.

A must!<br />"Make It So!"</p></br><a href="../users/A169I83JL8QJGN.html">A169I83JL8QJGN</a><br/><p>Time travel is a subject that is far too common in the Star Trek universe, when I first found out that time travel would be a focus of this movie I was worried that it would [NOT BE GOOD]. Thankfully this movie turned out to be the best entry in the series. The character of Picard finally showed a ruthless dark side that was in many ways as terrifying as the Borg he was so desperate to destroy. It's side of Picard that is rarely seen and very welcome. Picard has usually been the disciplined, yet kind hearted captain, and my favorite of the various Trek captains, so to see that he can be more than annoyed, to see that he can genuinely hate and hate with such an intense passion as to kill the Borg as ruthlessly as he did was a suprise, not out of character, mind you, just something that is rarely seen. The development of Data was nice as well. Data's child like innocence seemed destroyed in this film by the disturbing Borg Queen, who was played very well. The acting in this movie is stellar, which is not abnormal for the TNG crew as thet are all great actors. And to see the sides of these characters that is so rarely seen, thier dark sides, made this movie fantastic, even if the time travel bit is getting old, especially in Trek.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Of the four films featuring The Next Generation crew,ST:FC is the best ,even ranking among The Wrath Of Khan,The Voyage Home,and The Undiscovered Country.Unlike the other TNG films,this is not a two hour big budget TV episode,but a real movie that's fast paced,action packed and has agree of warmth and humor.<br /><br /> Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as Capt.Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence against the Borg is captivating as well as terrifying.And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.<br /><br /> A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending.<br /><br /> Aside from these minor flaws ST:FC is a movie to be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Although &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; is replete with flaws, it is the best film featuring the cast from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Jonathan Frakes, in his feature film directing debut, did a fine job getting great performances from Patrick Stewart, Alfre Woodward, and Alice Krige, among others. Patrick Stewart's recitation of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; when Alfre Woodward's character urges Captain Picard to abandon the new USS Enterprise is undoubtedly one of the film's finest dramatic moments. And there are others as well, such as fighting the Borg over the Enterprise's deflector screen array. Indeed, much of the film's mood is almost as dark and foreboding as &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Aliens&quot;. Yet there are occasional moments of humor. A star-struck Lieutenant Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) following Zefrem Cochrane (James Cromwell) is a welcome sight, along with cameo appearances by &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; cast members Robert Picardo (An Emergency Medical Hologram trying to fend off Borg soldiers, while Dr. Crusher and her medical team flees Sickbay.) and Ethan Phillips (A holographic Maitre D' who welcomes his Borg guests to a Prohibition Era lounge.). Not to be missed either is Counselor Troi (Martina Sirtis) refusing to admit to Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that she is drunk.<p>Devout &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will be highly critical of the plot. Although Alice Krige's performance as the Borg Queen is a first rate display of malice mixed with contempt towards humanity, her character is a radical departure from the television series. Surely, the Borg don't need a queen to direct their heinous crimes against other sentient life in the galaxy. Although I'm not a devout &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, I was appalled by James Cromwell's portrayal of Zefrem Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive. It's preposterous to think that Cromwell's Cochrane was sufficiently sober to invent it. And how humanity makes first contact with an alien civilization at the film's end is also played strictly for laughs. Poor Gene Roddenberry must be tossing over in his grave, wondering what producer Rick Berman has wrought.<p>Jerry Goldsmith's fine score is another of the film's artistic triumphs. His Klingon march from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; becomes a stirring anthem for Lieutenant Commander Worf. He also offers memorable themes for the Borg and their Queen. And of course, his memorable &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; main title is heard again in this installment of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.<p>Inspite of its flaws, &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; is a fine action adventure film. I strongly recommend it to those who aren't &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. And &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will enjoy it, regardless of its flaws.</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>I am proud to own this copy, nice transfer and sound.

The Borg, led by a creepy queen (the same actress who played the White Witch in the 2005 Chronicles of Narnia), seek to assimilate the entire population of Earth by traveling back in time to stop the first launch of the warp drive.  Will, Deanna, and Geordi travel to Earth to assist the scientist in his launch.  But the scientist is a drunk, and very turned off by the adoration and idolization proferred by the folks from the future.  He runs away.  Meanwhile, the Borg Queen is hard at work trying to figure out how to assimilate Data (Brent Spiner).<br /><br />Great action from the moment the movie begins to the very end.  The only thing I didn't like were the new hairstyles of Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Blehh!  They look very bland as Deanna has straight brunette hair and Crusher has a shorter blond style.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There is a rule that many are familiar with: every even-numbered Star Trek rules. Many consider the 2nd film the Wrath of Khan to be the best, just like the 2nd Star Wars Empire Strikes Back the best(I'm going by release order here). First Contact then would be the Revenge of the Sith(or A New Hope, depending on your tastes) for Star Trek.<br /><br />In Generations, you had the old cast passing the torch to the new one. Here we have Generations' cast first film by themselves and it's quite good. Previously in the series, Captain Picard got assimilated by the Borg, a race that turns others into them and are part of a collective. During a battle with a Borg cube, a getaway vehicle creates a time portal and assimilates Earth in the past, thus present-day Earth is all Borg.<br /><br />So the Enterprise has to go back in time and stop the Borg. Only the Borg picked a peculiar date: the day before mankind makes first contact with an alien race which then kickstarts the science to make galaxy travel possible. The ship that starts first contact is damaged so the crew on Earth have to fix it by the next day. Not only that, the crew on the Enterprise have to deal with invading Borg, who are trying to signal other Borg for help.<br /><br />What films like Alien and Star Wars brought to sci-fi was the idea of a used future. This meant things were broken down or barely working(I still get a laugh after Han Solo has to punch the Falcon to get it working in Empire). Star Trek on the other hand like 2001 looked to sterile, too neat. Generations suffered from this and even here when the ship gets overrun, it still looks too neat. Character-wise, it's showing signs of change like when Picard found out he was the last Picard in Generations or here when he deals with his Borg experience.<br /><br />I'm not a Trekkie, in fact I haven't seen a single episode of the old show, even the one where Spock and Kirk fought or one from Generations. However, I still liked watching this film. Although it doesn't have as cool scenes as the Ribbon and stellar cartography in Generations it's still a good film nonetheless, and most likely your 2nd favorite Trek film.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>I love this movie I must have watched the movie more than one hundred times and I am still not sick of it.

And its hard to go wrong with a stellar cast, especially a cast that influences the script ( Stewart made considerable story "suggestions" that shifted the balance of the story flow).<br /><br />As a film, yes it is good, but as a Star Trek film, I would rate this  even less than Star Trek 5, and its problems were  enormous. By all accounts the production of FIRST CONTACT was a breeze in comparison.<br /><br />And the great thing is that you decide how you feel on all these issues, because the two disc set is extremely comprehensive in basically  all  areas of the film.<br /><br />Love the Role  Alice Krige plays, but hey, I would see a film with her in it, same  way I would watch anything  by Sandra Bullock.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>There are no deleted scenes included in this dvd, which makes sense, because this is the only film besides Forrest Gump which test audiences said was fine as is. I read another review of this which consisted of a list of complaints abotu the film. That being said, anyone who really appreciates movies will love First Contact, both in the context of Trek, and as an action/scifi/drama movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>I have to agree with another review I saw here.  This is the best of the Star Trek films.  Still, there are a whole bunch of episodes in the series better than this film.  All Good Things, Tapestry, Q Who, Family, Chain of Command Part 2, Future Imperfect, Elementary Dear Data, The Chase, Who Watches the Watchers, all of these episodes are better than any of the films.  The film is still okay, but it just can't top some of the episodes in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Directed by Jonathan Frakes.<br />In the last film, STAR TREK: GENERATIONS, Captain Jean-Luc Picard was with Captain Kirk at his death who both were fighting Suran.  At the moment, Kirk did indeed die alone.  Picard buried Kirk under stones in the rock canyon.<br />  Note: James T.

Wolf (Michael Dorn) is aboard the Defiant.  Picard destroys the Borg Cube, however just before destruction, the cube releases an escape sphere to Earth.  Data (Brent Spiner) discovers the Earth contains 9 billion lives.  They are all borg.<br />The Enterprise has travelled to April 4, 2063, perhaps after World War 3.  They have destroyed the dangerous sphere. So Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Troi (Marina Sirtis) meet down on earth, Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell), but first they have a female renegade, Lily (Alfie Woodward) to deal with.  To make matters worse, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige, GHOST STORY [1981]) has captured Data.<br />  Also in the cast: Levar Burton as "LaForge", Gates McFadden as "Dr. Crusher", Robert Picardo makes a cameo appearance as "the hologram doctor" (Deep Space Nine 1993-99).<br />Computer voice is Majel Barrett.

This is the kind of soundtrack where you can just crank up the soundtrack CD (which I own) and enjoy it as a piece of music without even seeing the movie.<br /><br />Top it off with a moving tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and a wealth of other bonuses that I haven't even got around to watching yet.  This is a Trek movie that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>I'm not sure of the "even sequel" rule (which stresses even-numbered episodes of Trek films as superior to the odd-numbered), but this flick was more entertaining than I would have expected from a "Next Generation" movie (and that's not even counting the horrible "Star Trek: Generations").  <p>In this episode (I meant movie!! I mean it!!!), the Enterprise again confronts the Borg - the implacable alien race of cyborgs committed to "assimilating" every intelligent race it meets (unlucky races find that their members are turned into drones under the command of a "collective conscience" while their technology and everything else about them is appropriated by the Borg). Despite destroying the Borg's ship, Captain Picard quickly realizes that even victory was futile: a Borg shuttle escapes the carnage and journeys back to Earth's pre-Federation past.  Halfway through the time-slipstream, the crew of the Enterprise catches a glimpse of their Earth having already been assimilated.  Realizing that the Borg have somehow changed history, Captain Picard leads the Enterprise through the rift and discovers that the Borg have journeyed to the moment where mankind achieved "first contact" with intelligent extra-terrestrial life.  Historically, the moment came when inventor Zephram Cochrane (James  Cromwell) first tested his revolutionary spaceship, one powered by the then unknown warp-drive, and attracted the attention of a passing Vulcan survey vessel.  The Enterprise destroys the Borg ship - but the Borg survive somehow manage to invade the ship and begin assimilating it.  With his crew reduced and his ship barely under his control in Earth's orbit, Picard leads the remnants of his crew against the Borg infestation.  On the ground, an away team meets with Cochrane himself and help him repair his experimental ship - damaged earlier by a Borg attack.  <p>I'm no fan of the "Next Generation" but this sequel was a surprise.  Jonathan Frakes's direction is tense and captures the fear the Borg inspire and the claustrophobia of the new Enterprise (this was the debut of Enterprise-E).  On the downside - the film never becomes more than an exceptional episode of a TV show, as opposed to the more cinematic films of "classic" trek.  The crew is inexplicably forthcoming with Dr. Cochrane and other denizens of the "past" - Kirk and company were a lot funnier trying to hide that they were from the future.  Also, Dr. Cochrane's mountain base is so remote, he might as well be set in the future himself - there's no frame of reference linking him to Trek's past aside from what the script just tells us.  The script also makes a critical mistake with the Borg by giving them a queen.  Though Alice Krige vamps sexily as the queen, it undermines the Borg as being a force of nature blind to the destruction they cause - now they're just a bunch of aliens having a technology that can't be stopped, and led by an evil ruler.  Also, the basic plot left me scratching my head, if the Borg had achieved time travel, would they really need to conquer Earth?  And as logical machines, how would they get past paradoxes of time travel?  All in all, still a superior "Next Generation" Effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>I have to own up up front that my favourite Star Trek series is TOS and while I did enjoy DS3 and the later seasons of Voyager a great deal somehow TNG didn't really do much for me.  Let's just say I'm much more excited about DS3 and Voyager coming in Blu-Ray than I am about TNG doing so.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot and after Star Trek 6 this is now my favourite Star Trek movie.  I truly hope that the recent alternate universe version of Star Trek finds a new younger audience but the really bad science throughout i.e. the manufactured black hole made me totally disinterested in that movie early on and so if I had to choose just three Star Trek movies to take with me to a desert island they would be "The Undiscovered Country - Thearetical Release", "First Contact" and "Star Trek 1 - The Movie - Director's Cut".<br /><br />Regarding "First Contact", it looks great in 1080p and sounds good in Dolby TrueHD although I personally would have preferred a DTS-HD MA option.  Unlike too many other blu-ray releases, the BD-Live here is actually more than just a trailer of other movies to sell vehicle and I enjoyed the Star Trek IQ interactive quiz.  As for the content, we get a nice mixture of adventure and excitement as well as an homage to one of my favourite TOS episodes "Metamorphosis" where Cochrane is first introduced and a little drama with Picard which echoes another TOS episode "Obsession" as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Star Trek movie irrespective of series and both the picture and sound qualities are vastly improved over the standard dvd versions.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, at least one of those five stars is just for Patrick Stewart, for whom I have considerable lust. I understand this is the second of the Next Gen series. I really must get the rest.<br /><br />As hard-core fans know, Zefram Cochrane made his historical first warp flight on April 5, 2063.  Anyway, it turns out that the Borg took a time warp back to the day before in order to destroy Cochrane and his ship, thereby preventing first contact and making the population of earth easy to assimilate. Since this would destroy the time line on which the Enterprise exists, it has to be stopped.<br /><br />So the Enterprise goes back in time (the method is a clever one; I won't reveal it), following the Borg to try to stop them and protect Cochrane and his warp ship. Try? Why do I say try? Captain Picard does not merely try things; he succeeds. How he succeeds is one very good adventure story. Complicated, as all time travel stories are, but it is possible to follow it.<br /><br />Zefram Cochrane is a fascinating character; he even manages to get Deanna Troi drunk! The Borg Queen shows up, trying to seduce Data and then the Captain. Data even gets some real skin! But of course our intrepid heroes win in the end; otherwise they wouldn't exist in the 24th century, and we know they do</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This movie soars above the previous outing in film-making quality, writing, action and just about any way you can think of. It is also much darker, contributing to this outing becoming the first movie in the Star Trek series to receive a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Taking a page from the lesson learned from The Wrath of Khan, they decide to bring back a known foe: the Borg. Granted, each time we meet the Borg, it is a different group, thus not necessarily qualifying as a simple recurring villain, but given the hive-minded nature of the Borg, it makes little difference. They are all basically programed to behave the same. However, while TWoK showed Captain Kirk being pursued by a man who felt wronged by him (even quoting Captain Ahab in his last moments before dying), here we see our beloved Captain Picard take on the role of Ahab in his personal quest for vengeance against the cybernetic whale that had crippled him so many years ago. (Again, "Moby Dick" is brought up specifically in this movie too.)<br /><br />As a first motion-picture outing for director Jonathan Frakes (who had directed several episodes of the series), this more than satisfies. In coming up with a directorial style for this movie, he watched movies like Alien, Jaws, 2001, Close Encounters, etc. and it shows. He more than competently creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere, yet still manages to appropriately work in bits of humor (a standard of Star Trek).<br /><br />The effects are great, the performances top notch and the DVD is a must have.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Excellent action and special effects.  The opening battle scene is probably the best of the series.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*The storyline is good.  Includes a great deal of excitement, comedy, and drama.<br />*Incorporates a good deal of stuff from the Star Trek universe.  The Borg make for the best bad guys of the series.  They are quite menacing (and it's about time they stopped bringing up the Klingons!).  Also an original and refreshing look at the history of the saga, involving the guy who invented Warp Drive.<br />*Characters are good.  Picard shows a great deal of pain and compassion.<br />*Writing is good.<br />*Music is good.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />To start with, this film has some of the best action and battle scenes in the series.  It also boasts some immersive drama, comedy, and suspense.  And it ties in a lot of aspects from the TV shows to create a coherent plot.  It's probably the best film done by the Next Generation crew, and is certainly worthwhile watching.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality.  The two-disc version still has good quality, and has a number of featurettes and trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>This film, "Star Trek:  First Contact", being the first official `Next Generation' only `Star Trek' movie, the creative teams behind this picture had their hands full with trying to come up with an original storyline that would be exciting to audiences, both `Trekkies' and non, while still maintaining the quality and tone of the TV series that this crew hails from.  To solve this problem, the writers came up with a brilliant story that would serve as a closer to a few episodes that occurred during the series that were held as fan-favorites, of course the episodes I'm referring to deal with the deadliest villains this crew ever faced, the Borg.  The Borg are cybernetic beings that are linked into one another in a sort of hive, in their society there is no individuality, everyone is the same, and their collective goal is to assimilate every being in the universe, adding their characteristics and culture into theirs, therefore making them the ultimate beings.  In the series, the first appearance of the Borg was a 2-part episode arc titled "The Best of Both Worlds", in the story the Borg capture Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), assimilating him and all his knowledge into their collective.  This leaves the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-D in a massive dilemma, do they stage a rescue for their beloved captain, or do what is right for Starfleet and destroy the Borg cube and their captain along with it.  In the episodes, the crew led by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) led a rescue to get Captain Picard back, and after successfully removing the Borg influence from him, gained some very helpful insight into the inner-workings of this new villainous species.  So for the story in this movie the writers chose to force Captain Picard and his crew to face that terrible time yet again, and this time the Borg are much more powerful, and have some new tricks up their sleeves.<br /><br />"Star Trek:  First Contact" as I stated above finds the crew of the newly commissioned Enterprise-E coming face-to-face with the Borg yet again.  However, the difference this time is that the Borg has learned a new trick, time travel.  During a conflict between the Enterprise and a Borg cube, the cube launches a Borg sphere in an attempt to escape before the destruction of the cube ship.  However, this sphere contains the capability for time travel, so with the Enterprise in hot pursuit the cube travels back in time with the Enterprise close behind and transporting both ships into the past.  The specific moment in time that the sphere picked to return to seemed random at first, but instead held a much more sinister reason, the sphere returned to the past to stop a scientist from conducting the first warp drive test.  If the Borg succeeds in stopping this warp drive test, two things happen, the future that the crew of the Enterprise knows ceases to exist because without warp drive there is no Starfleet, and the second thing is that if the test doesn't occur, first contact with the alien race known as Vulcans will not happen.  So, not only does the Enterprise-E and her crew have to save the people of the past from the assimilation of the Borg, but also save their own futures before its too late.<br /><br />In their second adventure on the big screen the crew of the Enterprise-E were forced to tackle their deadliest villains, the Borg.  Many fans that were disillusioned by the previous `Star Trek' movie effort, "Star Trek:  Generations", were very pleased to learn that the Borg were being chosen as the villains for this film.  With the expectations for this movie very high, the stage was set for `Star Trek' to once again be number one at the box office.  The problem with hype is that most of the time the hype overshadows the movie, and though the movie may still be successful, it would still be considered somewhat of a failure if the film even remotely disappointed any fans.  This problem was easily bypassed by this movie, the creative forces behind "Star Trek:  First Contact" crafted a terrific story of intense drama, fast-paced and energetic action, and some bits of humor, and needless to say audiences were not disappointed in the least.  In fact, many `Trekkies' hold "Star Trek:  First Contact" in high regard, and view it as possibly one of the best `Star Trek' films ever, and definitely one of the best for the `Next Generation' crew.  The actors were all very solid in their performance, which was expected since these are characters they portrayed for 7 seasons on the TV show, and in the previous movie, so by now their characters are instinctual to them.  The special effects were top-notch, some of the best effects work in this series can be found in this movie.  In truth, there isn't one single negative comment I can make regarding this movie; this film is definitely top-notch for this franchise!<br /><br />"Star Trek:  First Contact" is rated PG-13 for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>Not having seen any other Star Trek feature film for years, I can't compare 'First Contact' to any other film and exclaim that 'This is the best Star Trek film ever!, etc. I'm not even a ranid fan of the show, but I &aacute;m fimiliar with the TNG characters & 'mythology'to have a solid enough background for enjoying the film.<br /><br />The film itself is a nice action filmwith a Star Trek twist, and a nice & interesting twist at that. It's only drawback is the fact that it does need some fimiliarity with the Star trek universe & mythology, which would make it very hard for non - trekkies to understand, enjoy, ad get into one of the most wonderful TV series ever!</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>One of the best Next Gen Movies to hit the Silver Screen; this one takes the mystery of the Borg a step further. The producers throw out the hive mind concept and introduce the Borg Queen. It's Trek like it should be. Not all the actors get equal screen time but it a rollercoster ride from start to finish.  If you like the galactic space battle scenes this one is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>While I very much enjoyed 'First Contact' it left me asking a few questions...such as how did they come to all be on the new Enterprize E?  Or when/where/why did Geordi get Ocular Implants? Or my personal favorite: why did they alter established Trek History with the way they handled First Contact with Zephram Cochran?  Albeit only the true Trek nerds will understand that last one, but it seemed to me as though the story was unfolding before I came in at the beginning and I feel like I missed something important, and left me wanting more.  Now while wanting more is a good thing, it isn't necessarily so good when you feel that the storyline was incomplete, even if by just a little.<p>With that criticism out of the way, and I apologize it if is too big, but other than that, I very much enjoyed this 2nd outing on the big screen for the Next Generation.  It allowed a lot of humor which had been missing from the previous film, and gave us an exciting story mixed with a great deal of Trek History (even if it was altered a bit to suit Studio heads).  The effects were as usual top notch and while I am STILL waiting for a Trek movie to deal with the greatest nemesis the Next Gen folks ever faced (namely 'Q') I am fervently hoping that Paramount will give the folks a chance to redeem what a fiasco 'Insurrection' ended up being (not unlike how Trek VI more than made up for how horrible Trek V was...).  Folks, contact your Congressman, or whoever it takes to convince Paramount that a 4th Next Gen movie IS possible and SHOULD be made--provided they actually come up with a decent script.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUZOJZM9008Y.html">A3TUZOJZM9008Y</a><br/><p>The Next Generation cast has had one really good movie so far, and this is it.

Misplaced hero worship. The ironic twist of Picard as Captain Queeg (since that was to be his next role following this). <p>But as usual, the movie falls apart when they try to do comic bits. Star Trek excels when the humor comes from the character interaction, not from jokes about &quot;taking a leak.&quot;<p>Patrick Stewart leads the familiar cast, adding Alice Krige to the mix as the heretofore unknown Borg Queen.<p>Great concepts.... adequate execution.</p></br></body></html>

The movie production is pitch perfect in every way.  There  are no misses in the casting, the set design, the dialogue and story.  The audience is never insulted with any pleas that Mr. Brooks is the innocent in the clutches of an evil separate demon.  His daughter is a born gold digger who treads carefully around her rich parents accordingly for fear of losing her inheritance.  I didn't really get to see much of Demi Moore in this movie.  Kevin Costner really dominates and Dane Cook gained just enough weight to be off-putting.  William Hurt is for once not grey and beige and vague.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks is an outstanding thriller that does the impossible - gets you to sympathize with a serial killer.  The film relentlessly explores the gray areas of sin and addiction.  Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) runs a successful box factory.  He has a loving, beautiful wife and a daughter who is a freshman in college.  His alter ego (William Hurt) is a main character in the film.  Yes, he goads Mr. Brooks to kill, but he is also as three-dimensional as any other "real" person, as revealed as the film progresses.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is neat and orderly in all areas of his life, and this includes his murders.  This is turned upside down when a photographer witnesses and photographs Mr. Brooks at work.  But what the photog wants is much more shocking than blackmail.  How will the protagonist/hero (yes, it is the killer) protect his reputaton and his beloved family?  And things do get even stranger, folks . . .<br /><br />The music is exceptional as is the screenplay.  For once, a well-thought out movie with no plot holes.  Whouda thunk?<br /><br />This film is not for everyone.  If you feel that things are often not what they seem, and that sometimes bad is good, then check it out.  Highly recommended.  Graphic violence, some nudity and sex.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GMUNBN9HKRZS.html">A2GMUNBN9HKRZS</a><br/><p>This is a most clever murder mystery thing, with enough surprises and twists to keep you glued to your lazy boy. John Hurt is always a pleasure, and he gets to dig in deep into a very different character. It's good to see Kevin Costner in a subdued but powerful role. Demi Moore  has a role where she can "act out" as a trait of her character, something she is good at. This fim is enjoyable and intriguing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>This movie did not get much hype, but it should have.  It is a great suspense thriller.  Kevin Kosner is deft at playing the very sane serial killer who has a stellar regular life, marred only by an addiction that he is actively seeking treatment for through AA.  Wonder what the others in the support group would do if they knew his addiction was cold blooded murder.  William Hurt is also very good as the evil persona, his alter ego that eggs him on to do his evil deeds.  Good to see Marg Helgenberger in a movie role.  All of the twists and turns are very creatively crafted.  If you have not viewed yet, you will not be disappointed when you do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>I hate Kevin Costner. I hated his smug romance-figure status from the 90's; I hated his arrogance and his acting and his hair and all of his movies post-Dancing with Wolves. This made me doubtful about watching this movie, despite my general liking for clever murder in the movies. So it took em a good long while to get this movie, and then another long period of looking at it doubtfully every time I walked past my DVD's before I actually got bored enough to put it in.<br /><br />And it was fantastic. There's only one real flaw, and that's the loose end of his daughter; it's not a bad plot device but they leave it hanging there like an Irish pennant on a fine suit. It begs for a sequel which will never occur.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is wonderful. Of course it bears no resemblance to reality as far as serial killers go, but as a story it's a success, with engaging characters and excellent acting. Even from Kevin Costner. Especially the way he and William Hurt play off each other... those scenes are the best in the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>We find in the opening moments of Mr. Brooks that Kevin Costner's title character is a serial killer.  We also find out that he is a devoted husband and father, a dedicated community philanthropist, and terrified at the prospect that he will be exposed as a killer.<br /><br />His character is the best thing in the movie, even if it makes the audience uncomfortable that you are pushed into identifying with a murderer.  The most interesting thing about the writing is that a second character, played by William Hurt, is created only to represent that part of Mr. Brooks that is compelled to do bad things.  It's tricky and as you watch you have to accept that Brooks is "talking" to "Marshall" (sometimes in extended sequences) while other characters in the room not only don't see "Marshall", but don't notice that Mr. Brooks is taking time off from his conversation with a "real" character to dialogue his inner demon.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is good at being a serial killer, choosing his victims so carefully and leaving no condemning evidence behind that the police are not sniffing his trail.  He's more careful and anal than "Dexter". (Perhaps more narrative tension would have been generated if the police WERE closer to catching him.) He hasn't killed for two years when the movie opens.  He attends AA meetings trying to shed his addiction to murder.  ("Marshall" sarcastically chides him that he is a hypocrite in the sense that he only says that he is an "addict" and not "I killed two people last night".) Mr. Brooks is deliberately careless in his return to murder, and has his picture taken by photograph voyeur Dane Cook from the apartment building across from his latest murders.  Rather than informing the police (believable), saying nothing (believable in our real world), trying to blackmail Mr. Brooks for money (certainly believable in a movie world), or selling his photos on ebay (believable given the intelligence of Mr. Cook's character), Cook's voyeur instead blackmails Mr. Brooks into making him an apprentice.<br /><br />I don't know how many serial killers a movie needs, but "Silence of the Lambs" got it right and Mr. Brooks misses by at least one.<br /><br />An interesting subplot develops with a daughter who abruptly drops out of her freshman year of college after a mysterious murder of a classmate.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the police are not close to catching Mr. Brooks.  The cop most closely following the "Thumbprint Killer" is played by Demi Moore, and a sharply written deftly performed female detective would have added another satisfying dimension to the film.  Unfortunately, "Detective Atwood" is written as a 2-dimensional rich Daddy's girl who became a cop because Daddy never loved her otherwise, although he left her 60 million dollars, which her dirtbag restaurateur about-to-be 2nd ex-husband is trying to get in negotions.  Even more unfortunately, this shallow character is portrayed by Demi Moore with little more skill than a cardboard cutout.  Where is Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling (or even Julianne Moore's?) when you need her?<br /><br />So - do I recommend it?  Yes, but not enthusiastically, and I lament what this movie COULD have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>This is an interesting an intelligent movie about a man's obsession--addiction--for the thrill of taking human life.  Mr. Brooks, although prominent and successful, is otherwise an ordinary Joe.  Maybe a little too ordinary.  He is efficient, loves his family and is a mild-mannered, low keyed guy.  Unfortunately, he has an alterego in the form of a man, more forward and assertive than Brooks, constantly giving him dangerous advice.<br /><br />His advice is to give into his impulses, track down people and kill them in cold-blood.  Brooks does it, too, swearing each will be his last.  He doesn't enjoy it, he tells his alterego, but justifies it as an addiction.  Unfortunately, he is identified at the scene of one of his kills by a young voyeur.  This man, quite unexpectedly, blackmails Brooks into taking him along on a thrill-kill.  Brooks toys with the blackmailer, taking him along to scope things out and track people.  The younger man is frustrated.  He wants it now!<br /><br />Brooks, by now, fearing the humiliation of discovery is considering the possibility of suicide...maybe the young guy will help him out.<br /><br />As I said, it's a good movie but it's not fast paced.  Also, as an exposition of serial homicide it is not characteristic.  Almost all of these guys are serial sexual psychopaths.  They sexually abuse and torture their victims before they murder them.  Brooks doesn't.  I think this is cinematically explainable.  A graphic film of the 'average' serial sexual psychopath would necessarily be worse than hard core pornography.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>By day Mr. Brooks is a philanthropic businessman, loving husband, and doting father.  By night he is a serial killer who is "addicted" to killing.  He is spurred on in his killing by a voice inside of him who is personified by William Hurt.  In the past Kevin Costner has been over-rated in some of his movie roles, but this time he shows some real acting skill and succeeds in creating the "flat affect" that is so often part of a psychopathic personality.  As has been pointed out, the plot is full of holes big enough to drive a tank through, but certainly the movie keeps your attention and has some very intriguing moments.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>While some movies try to thrill you with a sub-standard plot, and others try to make you think and end up getting you confused, this movie finds the perfect balance between the two.<br /><br />The premise is that the main character, a successful, highly-regarded doctor played by Kevin Costner, finds his mind suddenly haunted by the overwhelming urge to commit murder.  After a run as the most notorious serial killer in his home town, "Costner" thought he had put those demons to bed...only to be reacquainted with them once again, this time with a thriving career and family.<br /><br />Two psychological factors really made this movie memorable to me: First, is how absolutely compelling "Costner's" murdering impulses are.  No matter what he tries (until the end, when his entire life is thrown into question), he can't seem to shake them.  Secondly, because of that absolute obsession, Costner's character actually becomes sympathetic.  Despite the fact that he is murdering people in cold blood, he still feel for him, knowing that in some way he wants to break free as much as we want him to.<br /><br />Overall, this film stuck with me awhile after viewing it, as it grapples with the age-old philosophical debate of why humans kill other humans?  The film suggests that the violent, horrifying personas we stereotype serial killers as could be completely false...and that is really where the creepiness lies.  The urge could be in any one of us.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>With all of these different versions of slasher and serial killer films out there today, "Mr. Brooks" is an overall breath of fresh air. Rather than focusing on the victims of the killer, the film focuses on the killer himself. This gives Kevin Costner, an underrated actor in Hollywood, a chance to play a character that is different from any he has played before, and does so surprisingly well. While the crimes he commits are truly horrible and unforgivable, Costner's performance allows us to empathize a little bit with the character. At the same time, there are scenes where he really creeps the audience out. While his performance isn't perfect, it is overall powerful and chilling.<br />The supporting cast for the film is also worthwhile. Dane Cook's Mr. Smith is great, while Demi Moore turns in a surprisingly good performance as Detective Atwood, who is hell-bent on bringing Brooks, who is known only as the "Thumbprint Killer" by the cops, to justice, while also struggling with personal problems, and another killer bent on destroying her. Marg Helgenberger and Danielle Panabaker are good as well. But the real treat among the supporting performances is William Hurt as Marshall, Brooks' alter ego. He is at once chilling, but frighteningly likable at the same time.<br />The script itself, which focuses on the power of addiction, is a bit of a let-down in some places. There are some slow passages that drain the tension at times, and there are some truly unbelievable moments as well. But the fantastic performances, coupled by some truly shocking and surprising moments, make up for these slower passages. Overall, "Mr. Brooks" is a fascinating look at one man's addiction to murder, and how he tries to hide it from his loved ones while fighting the urges. Even if you don't typically watch this kind of film, it is still worthwhile to check it out.<br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>**** 2007. Co-written and directed by Bruce A. Evans. A serial killer, affected with remorse, tries to cope with William -temptation- Hurt. This cynical thriller is a UFO in the Hollywood landscape and deserves your attention. The dialogues between Kevin Costner and William Hurt are extremely well written, Demi Moore is on the verge of a nervous breakdown during the whole movie and if I were Mr. Brooks, I'd immediately despatch my daughter to Australia. Or to a European country. Because I'd rather not want her to like me too much. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>Since the disasterous failure of Waterworld in the late 90s, Kevin Costner retreated to more modest projects.  Truth be told, I picked this up at the video store the other night and decided to give it a whirl.  It's ten years after Waterworld, and I was a bit disappointed to see that Kevin Costner's acting skills have not changed.  Still, this was a good movie.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is Mr. Brooks, a white collar Oregon businessman who seems to have everything - a successful business, wealth, a wonderful wife, etc.  He is hiding a dark secret, unknown to all.  He is a serial killer known locally as the Thumbprint Killer.  William Hurt is his alter ego, the little devil on his shoulder who is egging him on to give into his urges and invisable to all.  He's resisted temptation (in physical form of Hurt) for two years, but one night he gives into his urges and kills again.<br /><br />It's hard to read into this too deeply, because the story eventually becomes convoluted and a little too hoaky.  Demi Moore is the ambicious policewoman after him, dealing with her own personal issues (the cheating husband she is slugging it out in divorce court with, her boss, her father, etc.).  A man across the street from the house where Mr.Books murders a couple just happens to be taking pictures and attempts to blackmail Mr.Brooks into teaching him how to.  Mr.Brook's daughter returns from college, announcing that she is dropping out and clearly hiding something from her family.  Here Mr.Brooks attempts to play several roles.  He is the father trying to make everything alright for his daughter; but, I guess if your father is a serial killer and you as the child have inherited his need to kill, the only solution is to kill someone else at the college and lead the police investigation someplace else.  When Mr.Smith chooses someone to kill, you know who he chooses is going to somehow interlock with the rest of the story.  And the circumstances about Demi Moore's father issues are just a rip off of Clarice Starling (just like every movie with a female cop has been since).<br /><br />It is a good movie.  It makes some valid points about addiction and how people are willing to do anything and everything to satisfy their wants.  Still, it was a little too complicated and a little too hoaky to be considered very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is way better than I had expected.  Costner is mostly a miss these days in the roles I have seen him in.  This is by far his best character and acting in years.  William Hurt is great as his alter ego.  I enjoyed Demi's performance and Dane Cook wasn't bad in his first true dramatic turn.  This is a really interesting character study.  Even though you know Costner is the killer, it is full of twists and turns.  Without giving anything away, I wish they would have cut the last 30 seconds and left the ending with him and his daughter.  Either way, it was a good ending and a strong movie overall.  The blu-ray is a crystal clear transfer and the sounds are incredible.  Gunfire seems to be much higher and I jumped when it came blasting out of my back speakers.  This is certainly worth watching and purchasing.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>At the end we are left with lots of questions. What was he before the thumbprint killer? What trauma did his daughter suffer, is he that twisted? Why doesn't Demi get a better lawyer to end the negotiation? Is his wife that dumb? I enjoyed it. It's not your usual Costner flic.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner is one of those actors that I never quite know what to expect from his movies. He's had plenty of hits throughout his relatively long career, yet he's also had his fair share of stinkers to balance things out. This is the man who made the terrific film's "The Bodyguard" and "Wyatt Earp" that were well received by fans, yet followed them up with movies like "The Postman" and "Waterworld" that were utterly horrible. He's the kind of actor that after certain movie roles such as, "Dragonfly", you just want to go, "What the heck were you thinking when you made that movie? Did you actually think that sounded like a winner?" But then he'll turn around and crank out a hit like "The Guardian" and you'll feel like saying "Now that's more like it. That was a good movie from start to finish." Anyways, with all that being said, when I saw the trailers for Costner's first truly villainous role in the thriller "Mr. Brooks", I was truly intrigued to see just what he'd do with such a part, because if handled properly this could prove to be one of his best roles to date. Yet, at the same time I was a little skeptical about the quality of this obviously serious movie with the likes of Dane Cook in the film, I thought maybe Costner had once again chosen a stinker to follow up his last couple of hits.<br /><br />"Mr. Brooks" is the story of a successful businessman named Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) who has his own business, a lovely wife (Marg Helgenberger), and college age daughter, essentially he has a perfectly normal, happy life. But on the inside Earl struggles with a very dark, evil side that is embodied by a creation he calls Marshall (William Hurt). Earl struggles on a daily basis to overcome Marshall's dark desires of murder, he prays often and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly, but both to no avail, in the end Marshall seems to win out, and Earl is growing tired of his weakness. During an attempt to sate Marshall's thirst for blood, Earl makes a costly error by killing a couple whose window shades are open, and to Earl's dismay a man across the street saw everything. Now that same man (Dane Cook) is blackmailing Earl into taking him along for the ride during his next murder, a fact that further complicates Earl's life since he had decided the previous murder would be his last no matter what. On top of all of this a detective (Demi Moore), who is struggling through a nasty divorce, is on the trail of Earl, and will not rest until this elusive murderer is brought down once and for all.<br /><br />As unsure as I was in regards to what my thoughts would be on "Mr. Brooks", after watching the movie I must say that this film is definitely one of Kevin Costner's best movies, and definitely his best performance to date. All of the actors in this movie are in exceptional form; each brings such richness to their individual characters making it easy to become completely enthralled in the movie. As I said Kevin Costner gives the best performance of his career, his character of Earl is so complex with so many different identities to comprise him, from businessman, to loving husband and father, to cold and calculating killer. Each identity Costner handled so well, of course most were not unfamiliar to him as he had played the businessman, husband and father in previous movies, but playing a killer is new territory and Costner plays it to eerie perfection. Each of the supporting actors were equally solid in their roles, with Dane Cook being the biggest surprise, who knew he had such a knack for drama. But the best supporting performance would have to be that of William Hurt's devilish portrayal of Mr. Brooks' dark side, Marshall. Hurt's performance was so engaging that he stole every single scene he was in, and he delivered every line with a hint of malice and complete disregard for human life, that you'd swear if this guy was in complete control of Earl, he would be the kind of guy that would rather kill you than talk to you.<br /><br />What's surprising is that director Bruce A. Evans is by no means an accomplished director, with "Mr. Brooks" being only his second film to date, and the fact that most of his time behind the camera is spent as a writer and producer, but you wouldn't know that by watching this film. Bruce A. Evans handled double duty on this film as both writer and director, and still managed to pull off an incredibly gripping crime drama mixed with a psychological thriller that will give you chills from start to finish.<br /><br />"Mr. Brooks" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A well made unusual thriller "Mr Brooks" features Kevin Costner in the title role in a fascinating conceit--serial killing is like an addiction and like addicts Mr. Brooks believes he can reform.  Although the various subplots don't always quite gel, "Mr. Brooks" is still a fascinating thriller with a trio of strong performances. Costner's performance is a complete contrast to Anthony Hopkins turn as Hannibal Lecter which, along with the unusual approach to the character, gives "Mr. Brooks" a very refreshing take on a popular subject.<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUW0">Dexter - The First Season</a>, "Mr. Brooks" takes an unusual approach to its subject that pays off in the end.  I have to give Evans and Gideon credit for such an ambitious film tweaking Costner's nice-guy personna. Even if the two parts don't fit together seamlessly, "Mr. Brooks" is still a terrific thriller that coasts along on the strong performances of the actors even when the film doesn' quite gel. I was a bit surprised by the negative critical reaction to the film given the strong writing and performances.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN THE NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS:<br /><br />What's a conflicted serial killer who wants to just be "normal" to do when he's forced to kill again a blackmailer? Or does Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner giving a terrific performance) want to give up killing? He says he does and yet he and his alter ego Marshall (William Hurt equally marvelous)slip opening the door to a fan "Mr. Smith" (Dane Cook in an excellent oily, slimy performance)a wanna-be serial killer that wants to learn the tricks of the trade.<br /><br />The problem is that Mr. Brooks has Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore)a troubled cop that wants to put him behind bars. Complications result when his daughter returns from college with a dark secret of her own.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />Directed and co-written by Bruce Evans ("Stand By Me", "Starman")and William Gideon, this psychological thriller is well worth a rental if nothing else. The DVD has some nice extras--there's a featurette "The Birth of a Serial Killer: The Writing of Mr. Brooks" where Evans and Gideon discuss the genesis of the project and how they really wanted to get away from the sweet and adolescent ensemble films they had written in the past.<br /><br />We also get "Murder on Their Minds: Mr. Brooks, Marshall and Mr. Smith" which allows the Costner, Hurt and Cook to discuss their characters and their approach to playing the roles.<br /><br />We also get a commentary track with Evans & Gideon. They make some pretty intelligent observations about the film and how it turned out. We also get deleted scenes as part of the package.<br /><br />although "Mr. Brooks" is flawed by two very different tones for its plot and subplot (the latter feels like it was lifted from a different movie), Evans and Gideon manage to bring it together to a surprisingly firm and powerful conclusion. The performances of Costner, Hurt, Cook and a scenery chewing Moore will pull in viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Mr. Brooks" is great! The cast led by Kevin Costner (as Earl Brooks), Demi Moore (as Detective Tracy Atwood), Dane Cook (as Mr. Smith), and William Hurt (as Marshall) is excellent. The interactions between Costner and Hurt is interesting to watch. The directing by Bruce A. Evans is great. The story and screenplay by Evans & Raynold Gideon (both who wrote the screenplay to "Stand By Me" (1986) is great. The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also composes the music to the tv show "Prison Break") is great.

The film editing by Miklos Wright (who also did the film editing to "Open Range" (2003), & "3000 Miles To Graceland" (2001), both which starred Costner) is great. The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to "Open Range" & "The Postman" (1997), both which was directed and starred Costner) is great. The production design by Jeffrey Beecroft (who also did the production design to "Message In A Bottle" (1999), "The Bodyguard" (1992), "Dances With Wolves" (1990), which also starred Costner) is great. The art direction by William Ladd Skinner (who also did the art direction to "The Bodyguard", "Dances With Wolves", also did the art direction to "Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End" (2007) & the upcoming "I Am Legend" (2007) is great. The set decoration by Anne Kuljian is great. The costume design by Judianna Makovsky (who also did the costume design to the upcoming "National Treasure: Book Of Secrets" (2007) & its prequel, "National Treasure" (2004) is great. This is an interesting thriller that keeps you guessing and thinking at the same time. This is an excellent change of pace for Costner and he should do it more often.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>I was definitely entertained by this serial killer with-a-twist thriller.  Kevin Costner plays mild-mannered philanthropic family man Earl Brooks exceptionally well.  I appreciated him in this role more than any other I've seen him in in at least ten years.  No, I take that back.  I really enjoyed him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TANUI">Open Range</a>, too.<br /><br />William Hurt, who plays the id portion of Earl's subconscious (unseen and unheard by all except Earl) acts out Earl's psychopathic desires and addiction to killing.<br /><br />Dane Cook steps out of his comedy comfort zone and plays voyeur/wannabe killer Mr. Smith and does an amazingly credible job of it.<br /><br />There is also Demi Moore playing a millionaire police detective.  Her role just added a bit too much fluff to the overall plot.  She had too much going on in her personal life and it wasn't needed for the clarity of the movie.<br /><br />Earl also has a wife, Emma(Marg Helgenberger) and daughter, Jane(Danielle Panabaker).  Jane's role was an integral part of the movie although I think it could have been cut some.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I actually jumped during a movie from surprise/fright but they got me on this one.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys thrillers, murder movies, stories about serial killers.<br /><br />WARNING:  There is violence in this movie, some nudity, strong language, sexual scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks has a disease: he is addicted to murder.  He tries to treat himself by going to AA meetings and prayer, but eventually he will give in.  His alter-ego, played quite well by William Hurt, is the side of him that he doesn't like to let out.  The chemistry between his two selves works well -- and the filmmakers do a good job allowing his conversations with his other self to integrate seemlessly into the action, so that he can think out loud in the presence of others and not be heard.  To others he simply appears distracted.<br /><br />Probably the best thing about this film is the brilliant casting of William Hurt as Kevin Costner's alter-ego. Costner has been criticized for only playing variations on the same part in all his films: handsome, charming, pleasant but giving off the impression that he's not saying all he thinks, that there is a brooding undercurrent.  In some roles he plays up the charm and in others the brooding undercurrent -- here, it seems, William Hurt gives voice to the brooding and dark and sly hidden persona underneath all of the charm.  He is also charming, but much more sinister -- an ideal counterpart to Costner's screen persona.  One important touch on the part of the filmmakers was to make clear that it was Costner as Brooks who ultimately made all the decisions and committed all of the murders -- his alterego could suggest, encourage, even beg, but he himself was conscious of and took responsibility for all of his crimes.<br /><br />So far this makes for an interesting twist on the serial killer theme that has become a staple of Hollywood film.  It establishes clearly the internal conflict and allows the audience (at least the non sociopaths among us) to achieve the necessary partial identification with the main character -- since he hates what he sometimes allows himself to do, when he yields to the urgings of his alter ego.  The complication arises when he messes up and someone sees him -- but instead of wanting to bribe him, "Mr. Smith" (played convincingly by comedian Dane Cook) wants in: he wants to go along for the next time.  This is another intriguing twist, so at least this far the movie sounded like something different and interesting -- I'm not generally a huge fan of serial killer films but at least this one seemed unique.  There is a bit of a reflexive moment here: "Mr. Smith," like us, was watching the crime through a window just as we are watching on the screen, he was entertained and wanted more, just as, presumably, we are being entertained and will wait eagerly for more action and violence.<br /><br />The real trouble is that the filmmakers try to build a series of subplots into the story that are increasingly implausible.  There is the cop (a badly miscast Demi Moore) who is investigating the "thumbprint murderer" (Mr. Brooks), whose first husband was killed, who is extremely wealthy but feels the need to be a cop, is now involved in a painful divorce with a former male model who apparently married her for her money, is being hunted down by another serial killer who she had put in prison but recently escaped, ... it all starts to seem a bit hokey.  Then add in the story of the daughter, who has recently withdrawn from college, and is apparently pregnant, and is being questioned in relation to a brutal homicide with an ax ... it started to feel like some kind of absurd parody of serial killer film plots, but it was all played so seriously that I think the absurdity was unintended.  At times the film really seemed to switch genres -- as when the cop (Moore) gets into an intense, MTV style shootout with a couple of killers in a hall, with flickering flourescent lights creating a strobe-like effect.<br /><br />This is not without some entertainment value, and has a few things about it that are interesting from the standpoint of thinking about film, but I can't say I found much else to be valuable here.  It wants to be a film suggesting that all of us have a darker side, that at the very least all of us get turned on or entertained a bit by violence or we wouldn't be watching this film.  I don't know, though -- I'm not sure I find that message enlightening or convincing (and how many times have filmmakers tried to "enlighten" their audience about their own complicity in the subject matter of the film -- as if the filmmaker were seeking to exculpate themselves for making a film about violence by saying to the audience: "isn't this what you want to see?  It's not my fault then that I make it for you."). I picked this film up because I like the doppelganger theme, and am generally intrigued by William Hurt's performances and thought the pairing of William Hurt and Kevin Costner would be interesting -- not because I enjoy watching violence (not to say that I am generally put off by it either -- it just has to work in the context of the film).  It is to the filmmaker's credit that they don't push too hard on the "everybody has a dark side" theme -- at least there is no condemnatory monologue or anything like that.  A few intriguing performances, and a few interesting twists, but as a whole I just don't think it all worked together in a satisfying way.<br /><br />Nate Andersen<br />www.eckerd.edu/sundance</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Having heard the thriller nature of MR. BROOKS, I had my doubts that someone as feel-goody as Kevin Costner could pull off such a role. I was wrong. Costner his loving, creepy, and pathologic all in the same breath.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks (Costner) has a loving wife, a strong local business, is a respected community leader, and he has an addiction problem. An unusual one: he loves to kill people. We catch up with Mr. Brooks at an awards ceremony where he's being presented an award for citizen of the year. But on the way home, something (someone?) lurks in the back of his mind. This something/someone is named Marshall (William Hurt, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZN802W">Into the Wild</a>) and he is part of Mr. Brooks' broken psyche. Not having killed in nearly two years, Marshall wants to be let out to play (reflections of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451528956">Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde</a> are easily seen).<br /><br />Mr. Brooks battles Marshall but, in the end, loses to his darker side and begins killing again. But, unfortunately for all concerned, someone witnesses the murder and wants to blackmail him. But not in the way most would think. Mr. Smith (Dane Cook, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U93C">Good Luck Chuck</a>) wants Mr. Brooks to teach him how to kill. A strange method of blackmail to be sure, but Mr. Brooks takes this would-be killer under his wing and begins showing him the bloody ropes.<br /><br />Trying to hunt down Mr. Brooks (the police have dubbed him `The Fingerprint Killer' because he does some interesting things at the crime scene with the victims' fingerprints) is Detective Atwood (Demi Moore, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYJI8">Bobby</a>). The meticulous nature of Mr. Brooks, though, makes her job exceptionally tough. No stray hairs (Mr. Brooks vacuums the crime scene prior to leaving), no gun shells (he's got a special way making sure the shells stay with him), nothing to show who this killer might be. Atwood, though, also has problems of her own. She's going through a messy divorce while trying to solve The Fingerprint Killer crimes. For Mr. Brooks, her marital discord becomes an avenue of surprising revelations.<br /><br />The story of Mr. Brooks is morbidly fascinating. He's the guy next door. The successful business man. The good-looking success story. A family man. But he's also a damaged dude. This gives the story a nice multi-facetedness that many movies lack. The added tension surrounding his only daughter who may have inherited some of Daddy's traits makes it even more so.<br /><br />I was surprised again and again by the strong performances from previously unknown areas. As noted earlier, Kevin Costner tends to lean toward the cute-and-fuzzy, but here takes on a role that is anything but, and does some exceptionally great work. Dane Cook, best known as a comedian, plays the role of a twisted wannabe killer with an amazing quality. Demi Moore as a roughshod cop who wants to do it her way and be damned the consequences is very believable.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film is that every time Mr. Brooks gets ready to kill someone, the people he's ready to rub-out are having sex. That seemed very convenient and only an addition to the film to give it more sex-play rather than something realistic.<br /><br />But that's my only complaint.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>the film was interesting,but  predictable. Kevin Costner was cool and William Hurt was interesting in a Anthony Hopkins kind of vibe. Dane cook just didn't show me much in this film and Demi Moore's was ok,but the film tried to take on way too many things and just  was all over the place. too many storylines and not any real answers. this film should have been really good,but it fell over it's ownself before it got going. this film reminded me so much of the  Showtime show "Dexter" except Dexter catches who he is after. this film just leaves alot of tracks but so many things  are left with a question mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>A brilliantly clever thriller, Mr. Brooks delivers enough shocks and revelations that you'll never know what's going to happen next. Kevin Costner is at his absolute best as the crafty Brooks, and William Hurt's supporting performance is equally magnificent. Perhaps the most innovative and unique film involving a split personality, Mr. Brooks introduces us to an antagonist we simply have to side with and one that is comparable to cinema's most fascinating villain, Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) leads a normal life, running his box design business, admiring his lovely wife and coping with a typical troubled teenage daughter. Normal, that is, except for Marshall (William Hurt), his alternate personality, who continues to coerce him into murder. Constantly fighting his addiction, he is photographed one night committing a particularly grisly murder, by "Mr. Smith" (Dane Cook) who blackmails Earl into taking him along on the next murder. Meanwhile, Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is in search of the mysterious "Thumbprint Killer" and believes Mr. Smith is harboring some undisclosed clues. As Mr. Brooks' family life and his life of crime slowly converge, he must decide how to permanently stop his literally murderous addiction.<br /><br />Kevin Costner's performance is nothing short of phenomenal. He captures the screen and portrays a wickedly clever character that you simply can't take your eyes off of. Cold and ruthless as a murderer, yet also calm, collected and grotesquely artistic, he calculates every possibility and scenario to plan the perfect murders. Having a unique idiosyncrasy, the "Thumbprint Killer" (as dubbed by the authorities) repositions the victim's bodies into various poses after he kills them. And of course the major twist to this psychopath is his alternate personality, here played by a separate actor, also mustering up an outstanding performance. William Hurt is Marshall, Earl's darker, more malevolent alter ego who instructs and advises him, especially when it comes to murder. His role is used for comic relief at times and to demonstrate Earl's complex thinking. The most innovative aspect of this split personality concept is that Marshall truly exists only in Earl's mind. He cannot control Earl, he can't physically interfere with anything, and Earl is constantly aware of him.<br /><br />Much like the demon and angel that sits on either shoulder of the lead character in countless cartoons and comedies, Marshall influences Earl's decisions but is unable to physically alter anything. And yet Mr. Brooks enjoys killing enough that even without his alter ego we are lead to believe that serial killing is not beyond his reach, which conflicts with the popular Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy; both personalities instead lean toward psychotic dispositions. Marshall's personality doesn't actually progress the story, essentially making it ironically unnecessary, except for how engrossing and innovative that particularly uncommon aspect is portrayed.<br /><br />Demi Moore is Tracy Atwood, who has been investigating the Thumbprint Killer for years. Easily the weakest link in the film, her character takes a backseat even to Hurt's alter ego (who is most often literally in the backseat). At several points in the film she dons the armor of a serious action star, which feels sorely misplaced. Her subplot could have been cut entirely to shorten the running time of the film.<br />I was a bit worried about Dane Cook's appearance in a serious thriller but he pulls off his role without a hitch. And the reason is once again because of a twist. A hilariously eccentric take on the blackmailer, Cook doesn't want money; rather he wants to accompany Brooks on his next murder. Obtaining a similar adrenaline rush for killing, he is a bold new form of accomplice.<br /><br />Director Bruce Evans throws in an ample helping of comedy elements into the violence and murders, presumably to break up the occasional incredibly graphic bloodshed. Brooks is perhaps even scarier because his family life is so normal. He has seemingly basic problems controlling his teenage daughter, and a healthy relationship with his wife.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is complex and morbidly intriguing and is perhaps the most innovative twist on a serial killer movie in decades. Brooks prays for forgiveness and prays to God to cease his never-ending killing spree, but his guilty conscience continually haunts him. A Hannibal Lector of sorts, Costner's Brooks is a bad guy so ingeniously scripted that we root for him even though he is the most psychotic of all the characters introduced. Curiously, we prefer to see him get away with murder just like Hannibal, and side with him not for his obviously flawed morals, but because he's just so much fun to watch.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I'm baffled at the four star rating this movie has here on Amazon, and find myself more in agreement with the scores on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, 45/100 and 55/100 respectively. The script felt loose, cluttered, and unorganized. Not quite a first draft, but not polished enough for a final. In writing, whether it's a script, a short story, an essay, a novel, or a simple Freshman Comp assignment, first, second, and third drafts often contain unrealistic or extraneous information that eventually is weeded out by good, solid editing. This script obviously lacked good, solid editing. Or, at best, perhaps too many hands were in the pie.<br /><br />We had one story line - Mr. Brooks, an acknowledged addict of murdering people, and the battle with his inner demon. Very typical of the very old bit where a devil sits on one shoulder egging the person on to do horrible or dishonest things, and an angel on the other trying its always futile best to dissuade. The battle itself wasn't interesting, because it didn't introduce anything new, and Costner simply wasn't the right actor this role. He's not an "actor's actor", someone who can comfortably fit into many different roles. He's more like Brad Pitt, an actor who can shine in certain films, and stink up others to the point of nausea. Costner was terrific in Bull Durham and Tin Cup, not so good in Wyatt Earp, JFK, or Robin Hood. William Hurt, an excellent actor with terrific range (see Kiss of the Spider Woman) didn't do much with what he was given, although to be fair, he wasn't given much. Make no mistake: watching Hurt and Costner duel wasn't like watching Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino (now THAT would be interesting...perhaps even with bad material).<br /><br />This story line should have been enough. But it wasn't. There was the addition of female cop, Demi Moore, who was worth $60+ million dollars, but because she wanted to prove to her father that she was as good as any boy, was a cop. This was supposed to create some interesting tension between Costner's character and Moore's, at least on Costner's side, but didn't. There was also *another* serial killer who had just escaped, one who vowed to get back at Moore.<br /><br />In addition, there's a photographer who liked to watch a certain couple "get it on", who was watching when Mr. Brooks killed the couple, and he too wants to become a serial killer.<br /><br />But wait! There's more. I won't say who (even though it's not much of a surprise)...but we have FOUR serial killers, or would-be serial killers, in one movie.<br /><br />I'm a believer in listening to stories. Only give a story what it needs. Nothing more, nothing less. And every element needs to be absolutely believable. If one story line in a story isn't cutting it, if it doesn't make sense, or doesn't have enough to make it stand on its own, then it needs to either take a hike, or have something else removed so that it receives the attention it deserves.<br /><br />That's what I felt happened here. There was too much going on, and most of it was unnecessary and unbelievable. Perhaps if the story focused only on Mr. Brooks himself, and the specific struggle he had, there could have been a good story. The story did not, however, and it suffered. Mightily.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Pretty good psychological thriller with Kevin Costner playing a serial killer. He does a good job playing creepy, and William Hurt is funny and hammy as his alter ego. Even Dane Cook is decent (I thought someone else could have done a better job, but he didn't embarrass himself).</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Definitely breathing new light into a tired genre, this film is interesting to watch.  It begins sinister and ends creepy, with the ride between vacillating from dull to melodramatic.  The high point of this flick is the story, not the acting.  Costner played the straightman half of his serial killer persona with the same flat, deadpan delivery he's played every character he's played in the last decade.  It works to a degree, as he is after all the passionless half of his persona.  He hits his stride in the scenes where he loses his cool.  Hurt, however, is very compelling in his role as the half of Brooks' that is the inner crazed killer.  He's got some great lines.  I do think that with both playing different sides of the same character, often in tandem, that brings a new challenge to being in the same scenes.  They had great timing and were the only actors who seemed to have chemistry in the film.  Mrs. Brooks may as well have been a prop, for all of her function surrounded validating the normality of Mr. Brooks.  His daughter's secrets brought the story to life, and in many ways her character was the real foil to Mr. Brooks and not the inner persona played by Hurt.  Moore overacted most of her role and just generally did not bring her to life at all.  That was a disappointment.  The story is incredibly sinister, which did not leave its visual needing much in the way of graphic gore.  However, the final hardcore scene of the film is definitely gratuitous shock, so much so that it detracted rather enhanced Mr. Brooks' fears of the future.  If you like shockers and thrillers this is a good film to see.  Don't let the stodgy acting distract you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>I'm one of those people that didn't mind seeing Kevin Costner fall from grace in the post Dances With Wolves orgy of pee-drinking fish men and roles stolen from Kurt Russell. But part of me was always hoping that he'd climb back on that horse. This is similar to the 1980s Steve Martin.<br /><br />What I like about this movie is that the director manages to use Kevin Costner's main weakness to his advantage. Kevin Costner has been compared to Jimmy Stewart since his first role. However, that Jimmy Stewart persona conveyed a certain amount of arrogance as time wore on. He was still doing the "Gee Shucks Ma'am" routine but you didn't buy it. So having Kevin Costner playing a very well hidden serial killer is genius. That's the bit that's been off all this time. He's really evil.<br /><br />And even better is Dane Cook's role. He's one of those divisive comedians in that for every one person that loves him, there are about 3 that want to punch him in the mouth. As the serial killer tag-along (the one that witnesses the murders but gets off on them) he's the perfect foil as the funny guy that you just want to hurt badly. And oh does he ever get hurt.<br /><br />Oh and William Hurt as Kevin Costner's Mr. Snuffalupagus - awesome in so many ways. William Hurt is usually pretty bland for me, but what better companion to Kevin Costner than a slightly bland but ultimately malevolent character?<br /><br />Beyond that, it's a fairly taut thriller with enough surprises to keep you going. There are many silly moments such as Demi Moore's multi-millionaire police woman and the weird subplot about Costner's daughter but you pretty much expect silly moments when you have a serial killer movie.  Oh and the plot tries to incorporate all these elements and a few other serial killers that Demi Moore has to chase down (as well as an ex-husband that wants her money) and it all comes together at the end - more or less. It's still an enjoyable ride.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I liked the psychological and suspense aspects of this movie quite a bit.  However, I marked it down a star because there is a scene of a couple engaging in sex that is unnecessarily graphic and two scenes of murder that have more blood that your local Red Cross.  Explicit sex scenes in "mainstream" movies seem silly since our society is so saturated by porn.  Hollywood can't really compete with it (and shouldn't), and half-measures have the worst of both worlds.  They offend people like me and can't titillate those seeking porn.  I will just point you back to "North by Northwest" and the steamy sexual tension that passed between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.  Nothing was shown but the adults had no doubt what passed between them without having to shove anything in anyone's face.  As for the gore in this film, well, it just spoils the psychological elegance the suspense has put in place.  Remember "Jaws" worked well because we rarely saw the shark!<br /><br />What is best about the film is the way Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) and his psychopathic alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) work together, talk to each other, and struggle against each other as Earl continues his career as a serial murderer while trying to resist it (by going to AA meetings).  Dane Cook plays a Mr. Smith who becomes aware of who Earl really is behind his Citizen of the Year reputation and tries to blackmail him into allowing him to participate in a murder.<br /><br />We also have Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) who is a millionaire heiress nutjob who has decided to be a cop to work out her issues with her dead father.  She is also trying to work through a divorce (she picks men poorly, too) from a boytoy who wants millions to go away and she doesn't want to give it.  She is bent on solving the "thumbprint" murders and begins closing in on Earl Brooks.  However, she also has to look out for an escaped prisoner who is determined to kill her for putting him away in the first place.<br /><br />On top of all this we have Earl's home life.  He is a rich businessman with a wonderful wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger), and a troubled daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker) who has dropped out of her freshman year of college for reasons beyond what she is willing to admit to her parents.<br /><br />How all this mixes together and comes to a head is quite entertaining, at least as entertaining as serial murder can get.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>a neato serial killer movie this is probably the realistic serial killer movies-- kevin costner was great and dane cook was outstanding this was well put together and should be part of ur dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This by far is Kevin Costner's best film he has been in about 15 years. Costner plays "Mr. Brooks" who leads a double life. On the outside he is a successful businessman and loving family man, on the inside, he struggles with his addiction, his addiction to murder. For about two years he has been able to resist until he listens to his alter ego (played devilishly by William Hurt) to play again. He then goes into the apartment of a couple and proceeds to kill both of them.<br />The next day he is visited by Mr. Smith, who blackmails him to take him to his next killing. All the while he is being followed by a detective trying to solve the "thumb print murders" and juggles his personal life which is thrust into turmoil. His daughter "drops out of school" and is pregnant, but is that all of it? Soon he discovers she shares the same addiction and sickness as he does and out of compassion "fixes" her situation as well as his own predicament. What to do with and about Mr. Smith? Fulfilling his promise to Mr. Smith he takes him on his next job and decides he wants Mr. Smith to end his suffering and make him disappear, but is this the true end of Mr. brooks?<br />This one will keep you on your toes, on the edge of your seat and guessing until the end. I haven't personally seen a film executed this well in many years, by far the best Costner has done in a decade, and I wish he would do more films of this caliber more often. A great script, cast and great performances played deliciously by both Costner and Hurt. This one is not to be missed, and I promise you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>If it hadn't been for the dumbest cop ever born (the one played by Demi Moore), this would have gotten one more star.<br />Anyway, Costner does a marvelous job as a tormented serial killer addicted to thrill killing while also holding down a great job and doting on his wife and daughter.  The daughter, however, may be a budding serial killer herself, and he wants to save her from becoming like her father.<br />William Hurt also is in full creepy mode as a manifestation of Costner's dueling personality, while comedian Dane Cook plays a would-be killer who wants Costner to tutor him in how to do it and not get caught.<br />There is some intrusive techno music and a Matrix-like hallway shoot-out that could have been done better.  However, these are quibbles.  I had a bigger problem with Moore's distracting divorce battle, impulsiveness, and general arrogance.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Bruce A. Evans' "Mr. Brooks" deserves praise for at least bringing a certain degree of freshness to the well-worn serial-killer genre.<br /><br />Kevin Costner portrays Earl Brooks, a devoted husband and father and the recent recipient of the Man of the Year Award from the city of Portland, Oregon for his work as a successful businessman.  He also just happens to be a cold-blooded murderer, known to the media and the law enforcement community as the Fingerprint Killer, so named because he leaves that telltale sign behind at each of his crime scenes (we must assume it is not his own fingerprint, although the script never actually spells that out for us).  As the movie opens, Brooks hasn't killed anyone for two years, having chosen to resist the temptation by attending AA meetings and focusing on his wife and daughter.  However, lately, Brooks has begun to succumb to the pull of his "addiction," once again allowing his darker angel to lure and goad him into seeking out unsuspecting victims as a means of alleviating the pressure.<br /><br />What separates "Mr. Brooks" from all other previous serial-killer thrillers is that it has chosen to actually incarnate that bad angel on screen in the form of an unnerving William Hurt, who appears by Brooks' side at strategic moments in the movie to advise, berate and commiserate with Brooks as he contemplates his next homicidal action.  Generally, in these movies, we rarely get a sense of the intense mental struggle taking place within the deeply disturbed, psychotic mind of the killer.  Through the use of Hurt's character (referred to by Brooks as Marshall), however, the writers, Evans and Raynold Gideon, are able to verbalize that conflict and show us the two warring factions co-existing within this single warped psyche.  Despite the absurdity of it, Brooks truly believes that his "condition" can be "cured" if he regularly and faithfully attends a self-help group for alcoholics.  Thus, against our better judgment, perhaps, we find ourselves almost feeling sorry for the man, a position one rarely finds oneself in in a tale such as this one.<br /><br />The complex plot also includes a wannabe young killer (Dane Cook) who blackmails Brooks into taking him out on his next killing spree; an expert homicide investigator (Demi Moore) who was investigating the Fingerprint Killer case until the trail turned cold; and Brooks' own college-aged daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker), who may have inherited her dad's killer "gene" and might just possibly have a murder or two of her own to account for.<br /><br />The storyline may not always pass the credibility threshold (particularly in the suggestion that psychosis might have a genetic component and can be passed down from generation to generation), but the cleverness of the approach and the genuine creepiness of many of the scenes go a long way towards mitigating the imperfections.  Moreover, Costner, Hurt, Moore and Cook give spellbinding performances as the killer and the various persons and pseudo-persons caught in the bloody web he has woven.<br /><br />Working as a team, Costner and Hurt bring complementary opposing qualities to their roles which, when taken together, add up to a single, well-rounded character.  In a complex variation on the Jekyll and Hyde, Faust and Mephistopheles dichotomy, Costner conveys the poignancy and vulnerability of the "good" Brooks, while Hurt shows us the steely-eyed cold-heartedness of the "bad" Brooks.  Yet, there are times when even those roles switch, as when Costner coldly laughs at the prospect of a victim's potential suffering and Hurt provides words of comfort to a hurting Costner.<br /><br />Together, the two talented stars create a complex symbiotic relationship that lifts "Mr. Brooks" several rungs above the ordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks has a Man of the Year award, a loving family, some seemingly-mundane hobbies, and a little nickname the papers like to use calling him: "The Thumbprint Killer." Only they don't call HIM the killer; they just refer to some of the handy work he seems to have left behind and this addiction keeps him killing. He doesn't like to do it, mind you, going to AA meetings because he is trying to keep his addiction in check. Still, an addiction is an addiction is an addiction and relapses to occur. His latest relapse, a dancer he sees and her lover, change things when something changes in his pattern.<br />Namely, a loose end comes to visit and builds a world within his world by asking him to show off what killing is made of.<br />And that's where things get started.<br /><br />When I first rented the movie, I didn't expect that much. Costner is oftentimes hit-or-miss and, frankly, I was afraid he would miss in this role. Happily I have to say I was wrong, with Costner making an excellent killer and also kicking it in a dual role. One of the many things Costner showcases in this movie is the way he can play with the mentality within a role - here Mr. Brooks has an imaginary friend we are lucky enough to see and the two of them share laughs and plans and suspicions on what is what. Honestly these are some of the best scenes in the business, making you really like Mr. Brooks and appreciate his humor. Costner does great work making Mr. Brooks a sympathetic character, too, with his murderous life balanced well by a family he sees to really love.<br /><br />Along the way, we pick up a counterpart to Costner, one Demi Moore, and she does some good work in this venture, too. I was equally surprised by this because I didn't expect to be able to take her seriously in any sort of way as an officer, much less an officer with a plethora of secrets. One of those things is a little bit of a distraction, mind you, one called The Hangman, but that just seems to be a little piece of a giant puzzle trying to keep the audience engaged.<br />I'm glad the writers at least remembered that Mr. Brooks was the focal point of the tale.<br /><br />For people wanting some hardcore murder, this is a mainstream piece and doesn't offer up a thick helping of doom. It does have its moments and it does have its beauty, and it should still offer up something to that side of the spectrum. People who don't like graphic horror should be able to keep on keeping on with their watching, able to love Costner and able to watch some death together.<br />I liked the movie - it had a lot to give to - and think people should check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>Please stay out of my neighborhood.

Demi Moore and Dane Cook are simply miscast in my opinion. Danielle Panabaker plays the same character she does on the television show Shark, but she is cute as a button, so she has that going for her. Mr. Brooks never really bored me, but some of the dialogue and situations seemed too unrealistic. The hallway shootout towards the end is a fine example of this. When did Demi enter the Matrix? You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film, but one to wait for on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>Apologies to those who track me solely for non-fiction.

It is absolutely engrossing, and the manner in which they use William Hurt to play the ghostly inner alter ego (fully visible throughout) of a man (Costner) addicted to killing, is world-class.<br /><br />Demi Moore is also superb as a driven cop who just happens to be worth $60 million.  This is easily one of my favorite crime thrillers with psychological nuances.  Very strongly and highly recommended for any thoughtful adult that would like to spend a couple of hours on the wild side.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000050FEN">Seven (New Line Platinum Series)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RGN2JI">Vacancy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061QJ8A">John Le Carre's A Murder of Quality</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790739739">The Negotiator</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304711883">Ransom</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8DV1W">Firewall (Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGCR38">Black Book</a></p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Thanks to an outstanding performance by Kevin Costner, this "been there done that" psycho-killer film is worth watching.<br /><br />We are all very familiar with Costner's "gosh gee-whiz" persona in his early career with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322611X">Field of Dreams</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007MAO0M">Silverado</a> and later at playing either a villain, as in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCOA">A Perfect World</a>, or a very flawed and unfriendly hero as he was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783219857">Waterworld</a>, but we have never quite seen him as such a complex psychopathic villain as in he is in "Mr. Brooks."<br /><br />Here Costner takes a stab (pun intended) as a serial killer trying to stop his murderous addiction, but ends up being blackmailed by a witness, oddly played by comedian Dane Cook, to his last murder.  Unbelievably, he is turned on to murder after seeing Costner's Mr. Brooks do away with his neighbors and wants him to take him under his wing or he will go to the police with his proof that puts Brooks at the scene of his last murder.  Mr. Brooks decides to string this guy along until he is no longer useful and that is where some really decent plot twists take place.  One significant plot twist is that Mr. Brooks' daughter, well played by Daniella Panabacker, is accused of murder back at her college dorm.  Is she innocent or just like her father?<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is a compelling film that has a few distracting and significant problems.  This film is both graphic in its violence and sexual scenes, but neither seems really gratuitous.  That's a plus for me.  In addition, Costner's brilliant performance is absolutely captivating, especially to his long-term followers who have never seen him in a role like this one.  He has definitely grown as an actor and this is one juicy role for him.  The performances by all others in this film, including Demi Moore's are good, if nothing special.  The problems come from some unbelievable elements within the plot and one actor who is a great distraction, William Hurt.<br /><br />Plot Problems:<br /><br />(1) What are the odds that a neighbor who witnesses a murder would get so turned on by it that he would contact the killer to seek "training"?  That is just too far-fetched even for me.<br /><br />(2) Why does Demi Moore's character of a cop have to also be a millionaire, be going through a divorce, and have a convicted killer be after her?  It is all just too much for this story.  The film comes close to sinking under its own unnecessarily heavy plot weight.<br /><br />(3) The film comes off as being too contrived like many of Alfred Hitchcock's films had been.  All enjoyable, but you feel very manipulated afterwards.<br /><br />Acting Problems:<br /><br />(1) Dane Cook as the guy blackmailing Mr. Brooks to teach him murder is never quite convincing in the role, but perhaps that is because his role, as a whole, is just too far beyond belief to take seriously anyhow.  To his credit he does play "slimy" pretty well.<br /><br />(2) I swear to God that if I never see William Hurt in this kind of role again, I'd die a happy man.  He's done this bad guy with no conscience thing to death in his older years that he now comes off as a parody of himself.  He is a distraction in what should have been a key and captivating role as Mr. Brooks' alter ego convincing him to keep on killing (no one sees or hears him but Mr. Brooks).  An unknown actor might have been a better choice for this role.<br /><br />Well, in spite of its serious flaws, this was still a riveting thriller and well worth your viewing.  In a year of so-so films and no big standout performances, Kevin Costner's work here is Oscar nomination worthy (and about time too).</p></br><a href="../users/A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL.html">A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie.  It has great acting and actors in it and the story line I found to not be quite as predictable as I thought.  Especially at the very very end.<br />Kevin Costner plays a serial killer, Earl Brooks, who seems to have such a normal regular life.  He's married with one daughter in college (or just dropped out).  After one last killing, he is blackmailed by a photographer who captured it all.<br />William Hurt plays his subconcious/tempter really well, and Demi Moore plays a detective on the hunt for him.  I loved the music/score throughout the movie and even though I know how it ends now, I bought it to watch over because it's so enjoyable and dark and I really love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks is an interesting suspense about a man who takes pleasure in killing other people.  Along the way, or rather, after the first killing that we see in the movie, he meets someone who's apparently a photographer.<br /><br />The guy happened to take a picture of the killer shooting a couple... um... "doing it" in a bedroom.  He even positioned the bodies in a sick sexual way after killing them so the cops would see the bodies in that position when they arrived to the scene.<br /><br />The story gets interesting when the killer meets the guy who snapped the picture of him in the middle of the killing, because it turns out the photographer doesn't have ANY plans to turn the killer in after showing him pictures of the killing he just committed.  Instead, the photographer actually wants to go with the killer on his next "kill job".<br /><br />So the killer and the photographer go around town searching for the next victim.  This takes up a good portion of the movie, building suspense the entire time.<br /><br />This movie is great because it builds suspense and shows you what's it like to get inside the head of someone who has no compassion for human life.  The entire film focuses on the killer having a make-believe friend helping to convince him go through with the killings.  The invisible friend is just the voice in his head.<br /><br />Also, the killers daughter plays a big part in the film with some neat twists you won't see coming.<br /><br />Anyway, when the story gets going, the movie turns into a really solid film overall.  I recommend this film to just about anyone interested in violent movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks, 2007 film<br /><br />A man is in a washroom. Earl Brooks, businessman and philanthropist, is being honored at a banquet. Another person, Marshall,  talks to Earl. "What's wrong?" [Talking to an imaginary man!] We slowly learn about Earl's secret life. Brooks changes to dark clothes then enters an apartment. Two shots [that no one hears?]. Then he drives away with his pictures. The imaginary man talks to him. The police investigate the crime scene and recognize the modus operandi. "Nobody saw a thing." We see Earl at a meeting, he admits to being an addict. We see his large factory. His daughter visits him with news about leaving school. "College is a waste of time." A visitor brings a packet of surprising photos! We see how spoiled his daughter is. "Mr. Smith" tells Earl what he wants! "Do we have a deal?" They talk and make an appointment.<br /><br />Detective Atwood and her lawyers discuss a divorce settlement. "Get over it!" A dangerous convict escaped and could threaten Tracy! Brooks visits "Smith" at night. [How did he get in?] The daughter tells the truth to her parents. They accept this news. The detective examines the scene of the double murder, and across the street. The pair will drive around and look for a victim in the rainy night! "Never kill someone you know." A pickup truck presents a victim. They will research the victim to avoid loose ends. [Can they get all that information from the Internet?] There is a shocking surprise on the street when a man grabs a woman. [Were you lulled by the preceding conversation?] This exciting action should wake you up! The two wait for their selected victim when they see a couple.<br /><br />The police continue to search for the "Thumbprint Killer". Brooks explains his reasons to Mr. Smith. Two detectives from Palo Alto want to question Jane. Emma calls a criminal lawyer for Jane. What will the detectives do? [The apple falls near the tree?] Brooks makes new plans. Detective Atwood follows "Mr. Smith", she has a hunch. A newspaper has a coded message for "Mr. Smith". Atwood questions "Mr. Smith" again! They search for Meigs and find a shocking surprise! Brooks returns from Palo Alto. He is unhappy with his existence. There was another murder with a hatchet last night, Jane had an alibi. What will Brooks do now? [Is the talk confusing?] We see the selected victims. "Hello!" Mr. Smith is excited afterwards. Bafferd is gone! Detective Atwood gets shocking news!<br /><br />There is a surprise in the car. Brooks explains how he will disappear. Atwood searches for Bafferd and gets a lucky break to solve a case! Brooks visits a cemetery. There is another surprise! [Didn't you suspect this would happen?] Brooks resolves to end his addiction. He makes a call using Bafferd's cell phone and explains what he did! Atwood asks his location; no reply. Later there is a final shocking surprise! [I didn't expect this.] What a nightmare ending!<br /><br />I think this would be better as a short story than a full-length movie (where you can question some of the assumptions). I don't think its probable that a successful businessman could be serial killer (as shown here). His time would be taken up by normal activities so wouldn't have time to spare for his addiction. I would not recommend this movie, but is has some interesting plot features that make up for the time spent watching it. There are better movies to watch. I's sure this was a deserved flop at the box office.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks is a delightful movie, spiced of black humor about a very respectable personality, labeled as "The man of the year" who has a dark behavior. A lovable wife, a peaceful life, a beautiful daughter but in last instance a boring life who induces him to find in the murder an exciting motive to live, eluding the multiple rules that govern him here and there.<br /><br />His alter ego, William Hurt is his hidden mind, his dark side of the moon as so speak. In many ways this film keeps a narrow resemblance with an overlooked cult movie of the past decade "Fight club" . The main difference is that this one works at four levels. Mr. Brooks, the female detective, Mr. Smith and finally his own daughter and these four stories are solidly developed to bring us an attractive script with many riddles to solve.<br /><br />Watch it. It's rewarding.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>The premise of MR. BROOKS is an interesting one,but the execution of this film is very muddled.<br /><br />Is Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) a multiple personality, a schizophrenic or merely a person with a "killing" addiction who tries to achieve sobriety through AA? I kept thinking that he was definitely a multiple "Sybil"-type because the alternate personality had a name,Marshall (William Hurt), as multiples do. I kept noticing the "glasses on, glasses off" routine throughout the film which is straight from SYBIL. Addictions do not have proper names.Having worked with multiples and addicts in real life this just didn't ring at all true to me.First flaw.<br /><br />Did Earl's wife ever wonder or question how and why he was out every night in a row? She always just went to bed! What kind of a mate is that? Second flaw.<br /><br />Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) is thrown from a van going breakneck speed and is thrown back first into the air, crashes through a windshield with a deafening thud and only receives a small wound to the head? What is she made of? The scenes following reveal NO HEAD WOUND? In fact,this character had become "Wonder Woman" in order to prove to her father that a girl is a worthy person? C'mon!!!Third flaw.<br /><br />Were we ever sure that what  any of what the daughter said was true (not to give any spoiler!)? Fourth flaw.<br /><br />The film MR. BROOKS will not answer these questions and more? Was the idea for the film unique and interesting?-Yes. Was I entertained?-mildly. Was the acting anything special?-not really. Does the ending leave an opening for a sequel? Yes, but I don't think that would be prudent! Was alot of the dialogue pretty inane?-most definitely. Was I glad I saw this for $3 at a second-run Moviehouse? You betcha! Totally flawed.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks takes an interesting stance on the whole psychological thriller/serial killer genre, with Kevin Costner in the title role.  Earl Brooks is a successful businessman with a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger) and daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who is unexpectedly home from college.  Unbeknownst to them though is that Earl is addicted to murder; an addiction which he has unsuccessfully tried to keep in check.  To make matters worse, he's being blackmailed by a slimy individual (comedian Dane Cook) looking for a thrill, and trailed by a millionaire cop (Demi Moore, yes you read that right).  While it offers some good moments (mostly from William Hurt, who appears as Mr. Brooks' murderous alter ego), the majority of Mr. Brooks falls flat thanks to the somewhat convoluted and above all non-sensical story.  Costner himself is good once again in a villainous role, and William Hurt is a blast in a film he has far too few appearances in.  Dane Cook is more annoying than anything else, while Demi Moore is about as believable as Demi Moore can be.  The film does offer a small twist at the end, but for the most part, Mr. Brooks is a mediocre thriller that could have been better than it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"Mr Brooks" was a disappointing film.  It had a good cast with Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in lead roles and a wonderful co-starring role for William Hurt as the alter ego to Mr Brooks.  In fact, the film started well but thereafter fell apart.<br /><br />My major criticism of the film is that it just became plain implausible and far too contrived.  Perhaps many people are credulous and just accepted the plot.  I couldn't manage this part.  By the time the film ended, I felt relieved.  Murder had been heaped upon murder with each twist of the plot becoming increasingly unrealistic.<br /><br />Overall, given the quality of the cast, this film left me feeling cheated.  Potentially, it had much to offer but, in the end, delivered little.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner) is businessman of the year in Portland, Oregon. His adoring wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger, TV's "CSI") looks on as he receives his award for running a successful box manufacturing company. But Mr. Brooks has a secret; he likes to kill people and his alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt) will not let him escape this addiction, goading him to kill again and again. He tells his wife he is going out to the pottery studio to glaze some pots when in fact, he is staking out and figuring out how to kill his next victim. When the alter ego convinces him to kill again, independently wealthy detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) realizes the Thumbprint Killer has returned. But Mr. Brooks desperately wants to lead a normal life, which means he has to struggle to stop the killing, and `Mr. Smith' (Dane Cook) might just be the answer; he has pictures of Mr. Brooks killing the last couple, a pair of lovers he was spying on anyway, and confronts the businessman/ killer. He doesn't want money; he wants to be shown how to kill, for the thrill of it. As Mr. Brooks is trying to escape this addiction, this isn't necessarily good news. As all of this happens, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks daughter, Jane (Danielle Panabaker) returns home from college, dropping out because she is pregnant. But that isn't all she is hiding.<br /><br />"Mr. Brooks" is better than you might think. It is a good movie, telling an involving, complicated story, with a lot of plot twists. Most of these twists resolve nicely in the end. Yes, there are a couple that don't connect, and this mars the film. But the film also deserves credit for its tongue-in-cheek narrative; "Brooks" takes some `narrative license' and seems to challenge you to laugh at it. The good outweighs the bad, but just barely.<br /><br />Costner goes dark with his role as Mr. Brooks. It is always a little interesting to see a movie star play against his established persona and here Costner takes on the seldom seen dark side of a character. As Mr. Brooks, he is a successful businessman, very successful judging from the look of his corporate headquarters, they look like they were designed by Frank Gehry. But he has this little addiction he has to deal with. To help with it, he attends AA meetings and verbally spars with Marshall, his alter ego.<br /><br />We get the idea that Mr. Brooks is a very careful killer. He thinks out every detail, which is how he has eluded the police for so many years. When he returns from a murder, there is a plastic sheet laid out at the precise spot he will step out of his car. He immediately removes his shoes and clothes and takes the clothing to the pottery kiln (an elaborate machine that looks more like a crematorium) and disposes of them. He is such a careful killer that he has even taken up the hobby which he uses as a cover.<br /><br />But he also wants a normal life, and starts to feel resentful that he doesn't have this. So he starts to get sloppy, perhaps in an effort to convince Marshall he should stop or they might get caught. He forgets to pull the curtains of his last kill, which leads to Mr. Smith's pictures and a wrinkle to his plan.<br /><br />When Mr. Brooks completes the kill, he shakes a bit with near orgasmic pleasure. This is where I began to have a problem with Costner's performance. This is a hammy role, but there is a fine line between acceptable hammy and just plain hammy. Mr. Brooks already has an alter ego, whom we see and he talks to. They chat, laugh together and exchange ideas and barbs. This is hammy enough, but it works. I get the idea they are trying to put across with Brooks' orgasmic shaking. But it just seems silly. It isn't enough that he has this little shake. He has it again after he strips his body and stands naked in front of his kiln. If a film is going to play fast and loose with the characters, there is a limit and this moment goes beyond that.<br /><br />At one point, Mr. Brooks tells his wife "I'm going to try out some glazes on a pot. I have this Chinese glaze I'm trying to get just right" and she accepts this and goes to bed. Of course, Brooks is using this as an excuse, to get out of the house and satisfy his addiction. This line of dialogue would probably make most people laugh, but all of the characters deliver and react to these types of lines with such seriousness that they seem perfectly natural.<br /><br />William Hurt plays Marshall, Brooks's alter ego. Appearing when the businessman needs confirmation, or as a sounding board for his problems, he goads Mr. Brooks into feeding his hunger. But like any true psychotic, he also has a mind of his own and pushes Brooks to do things against his will. This is a superb showcase for Hurt. Much like his brief role in David Cronenberg's "A History of Violence", Marshall is a memorable, off the wall performance that will be one of the most memorable things about "Mr. Brooks". At one point, as Marshall and Brooks are talking, they turn to each other and start laughing hysterically.<br /><br />Demi Moore plays a detective who has been tracking the Thumbprint Killer for years. Just as he reappears, and it looks like the investigation will continue, her impending divorce from her younger, philandering restaurateur husband threatens to sideline her. He is trying to extract every penny he can from her, and his lawyer seems to be holding out for $5 million dollars. As this storyline continued to cut a swath through the film, I was getting ready to turn to my companion and ask "Where in the hell does a police detective have enough money to pay her spouse $1.5 million dollars in a divorce?" Then the film establishes how and why this is possible. Yes, they tie it in, but it also seems like an unnecessary distraction.  Then there is also the problem of another killer she helped put away. See, that killer has just escaped and could be out trying to find and kill her. This distraction plays better and ties into the rest of the story more completely.<br /><br />As Moore's character investigates, and deals with her divorce, we realize she is a very complex character, and I'm sure this attracted her to the role. She does a good job, but she doesn't seem to be a very good detective. And there are just too many things going on with her character.<br /><br />My biggest problem with "Mr. Brooks" lies with his daughter. Jane returns home from school, ready to quit after only a few months. As she makes her case to her parents, Marshall turns to Brooks and says, "She's hiding something". She's actually hiding two things and to talk about either would reveal too much about the plot. I won't do that. But this is another case where this storyline is not tied in as well to the rest. Because of this, this character just doesn't work and brings down the rest of the film.<br /><br />Dane Cook is surprisingly good as Mr. Smith, the smarmy voyeur who stumbles onto Mr. Brooks and realizes he may have a way to finally realize the ultimate thrill. As he explains his proposal to Brooks, he is extremely confident, but as they go about the `training', he becomes more nervous and nervous. Then, when he participates for the first time, he is thrilled and quickly becomes addicted.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about "Mr. Brooks" is the fact that even with all of these story lines; most are tied into the main story very nicely, providing a tight, amusing, mostly satisfying ending. The writer and director have done a nice job of making almost all of these story lines connect. Too bad they didn't exactly tie up everything, and make the `daughter' storyline more believable. If they had, the film would be a great example of suspense. But because this part of the film falls flat, "Mr. Brooks" is just barely worth seeing.<br /><br />The daughter storyline and Costner's hammy overacting almost completely derail the film. As it is, it is worth a bargain matinee.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_Mr. Brooks_ is a film which glorifies killing.  The killing in this film is not done for a higher purpose, it is not done in self-defense, it is done purely "for pleasure".  Kevin Costner, who plays the killer, is made to appear cool and suave.  His character is made to appear likeable and noble.  As such, I cannot recommend this film because I find its general premise disgusting.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Like many I was dubious approaching this film and really, the reason I started watching it is that my brother-in-law is called "Mr. Brooks" and I thought I could get some ammunition for pulling his crank.  Well the laugh was on me, for after about ten minutes you know you're watching something really special.  I've always liked Costner, but even his mother might tell him that in recent years it seems he's lost his way, but without all that baggage, say if he was a new actor, the critics might have noticed that this performance here is worthy of an Oscar, as the businessman tamped down tight as a drum.  He runs a box factory which is perfect for his part, for he is like Pandora's box, pretty on the outside but with all the evils in the world just waiting to be tapped and let loose on an unsuspecting world.<br /><br />His opposite number, Demi Moore, is awesome also.  Again, another stunning actress who doesn't get the praise people award say, Dame Helen Mirren and why?  Bad choices in the past methinks!  If you have the DVD be sure to watch the deleted scenes feature--practically all of them feature Demi's character, Tracy Atwood, and at least one of them has a splendid and unexpected twist in Atwood's character--all I can say is, for an actress to have so many meaty bits left on the cutting floor is a real slap in the face, and the wonder is, the movie didn't even need those missing parts and neither did Demi's performance, though if she's annoyed I can't blame her!<br /><br />Though they make a big deal out of the fact that Costner is Portland's man of the year, the landscape looks very un-Portland.  I was expecting to see a motice at the end of the movie that the location scenes were filmed in Vancouver or Toronto...  the way most pictures for the past 20 years have been--to save money I guess.  Perhaps the falling dollar has made Canada not so attractive to film companies nowadays?  I was thunderstruck to see that the footage in question was filmed in Shreveport Louisiana!  No wonder it looks nothing like Portland!  You'd think they could just tweak the script a little and instruct the actors to play it Southern style.  As it is, the disjunction between what the script is saying and what the camera is telling us leaves audiences off balance, a foot on two stools as it were</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner builds a field of screams in this psychological thriller written and directed by Bruce A. Evans, who also wrote the screenplay for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G89G4">Stand By Me (Deluxe Edition)</a> which earned him an Oscar nod.<br /><br />Costner plays Mr. Brooks a successful self made business man who just earned man of the year and an efficient serial killer that battles with his inner demons; one takes the form of Marshall played by William Hurt.  Brooks thinks before he speaks and knows how to say the right thing in a soothing way that makes everything seem like it's not that bad.  At times you find yourself rooting for him or nervous for him as viewers did in the character Norman Bates in Psycho as the car stops sinking into the bog and we are nervous for him, although we don't worry as much about Mr. Brooks we still somewhat like him.<br /><br />If that wasn't enough Brooks gets blackmailed by Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) who wants him to teach him to be a killer all while being pursued by the nothing to lose cop (Demi Moore) and dealing with family issues.<br /><br />Fans of serial killer films Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer, Silence of the Lambs, American psycho or the show Dexter should enjoy and Costner's character is still unique.  Also for people that like their films without a ton of hidden symbolism, Mr. Brooks is pretty straight forward although you could analyze Costner's character thoroughly as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The interaction between Costner and Hurt works in spots in the movie, but that is about the only thing this movie has going for it. The plot is too contrived and complicated. Brooks's daughter drops out of college as a freshman, she is pregnant, she loses the car and is probably a mass murderer. Demi Moore is a homicide cop, going through a very messy divorce, is running from a mass murderer, and she is a millionare. She is very unlikeable and tougher than any man. Brooks commits a murder, but doesn't notice the drapes are open. Excuse me, this guy researches the couples he is going to execute for days. Everyone in the neighborhood knows that this couple has sex with the lights on and the drapes open. Brooks misses this fact in his research? This lapse makes it convenient for the neighbor who is a photogapher to catch him the act. However, the photographer wants to join in with the killing and not turn him in. This is lucky for Mr. Brooks and is unlucky for the photographer of course. How could the photograper plausibly think he could escape being murdered?<br /><br />The only thing this movie has going for it is that Costner does a decent job holding the movie together. The Hurt as the alter ego usually works. Demi does not work at all. The style of the movie smooths over the gigantic plot holes, but the movie is a mess if you start thinking about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Mr. Brooks" presents us with fascinating dualities, which in turn shows a depth and complexity that's rarely seen in films about serial killers. For cardboard tycoon Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner), there's a duality between his everyday life and his secret life as the Thumbprint Killer: the former is picture perfect, a wealthy man with a loving wife and daughter; the latter is an unfeeling monster who readily admits that he's addicted to murdering. I initially thought that I was supposed to choose a version of this man to root for. I eventually came to the realization that making this choice would be pointless. I say this because this story is not meant to instill sympathy or even hatred; it merely wants to show Mr. Brooks for who he is, in both good and bad ways. This is very appropriate because, when you get right down to it, there's very little about this man to emotionally invest in.<br /><br />The biggest duality is between Brooks' rational state of mind and his deep-seeded, animalistic urges. His murderous tendencies very cleverly manifest themselves as a man named Marshall (William Hurt), who can only be seen and heard by Brooks. Marshall acts as a driving force, temping Brooks simply because murdering is so much fun. The dynamic between these two characters is incredibly unique, especially since one is nothing more than the other's subconscious mind. In a sense, Marshall is the true serial killer; Brooks is merely a tool, a physical means to commit murder. It's obvious that, at times, Brooks is purposely not trying hard enough to control Marshall--taking a life is just so intoxicating.<br /><br />At other times, Brooks genuinely tries like hell to fight against his urges; on some level, he knows that what he's doing is wrong. At the film's start, we learn that he had managed to avoid temptation for two years, and by then, the possibility of relapsing seemed remote. But then he learns of a young couple attending a dance school, and the urge proves too strong to fight off. With the extreme precision of a master calculator, he's able to break into their apartment and shoot them as they make love. As an extra thrill, he poses their bodies and photographs them. His final touch--his trademark--is to press each victim's thumb into a bloodstain, leaving behind a print.<br /><br />If only Brooks had noticed that the couple left their bedroom drapes open. His carelessness comes back to haunt him in the form of a young voyeur only known as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). He presents Brooks with incriminating photos; the couple's apartment complex is within range of Smith's camera, and apparently, he had been photographing them for months (they always had sex with their drapes open). But Smith is not interested in turning Brooks in; rather, he wants to join Brooks during his next murder spree. There's a restrained intensity to this character that I really liked, suggestive of an immature teenager desperate to prove himself when he's clearly not ready. Cook played this character brilliantly, giving him just the right mix of arrogance, anger, and naivety. Brooks does agree to Smith's terms, but not before discussing the situation with Marshall. Let's just say that everyone here has a few hidden agendas.<br /><br />All this paves the way for some interesting scenes of victim hunting. At one point, Brooks describes the process as something similar to falling in love: you come across many people, but only a select few have the ability to make your heart pound with excitement. I must admit, I've never heard it put that way before. I must also admit, I loved it; there's a definite charm to this character that shines through despite the fact that he's a sociopath. This doesn't make him a likeable character by any means, but it certainly makes him a bit more compelling. One wonders if he's capable of feeling any emotion, especially when it comes to his family. Without giving too much away, a subplot involving his college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) leads him to question certain things; even after moments of reflection, his feelings remain unclear.<br /><br />Hot on the Thumbprint Killer's trail is Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), who's involved in her own subplots: one is about a bitter divorce; the other is about an escaped criminal threatening to track her down. When Brooks is made aware of her, he finds her more fascinating than problematic (the same can't be said for Marshall). Her father is a wealthy businessman, and because of that, she's worth millions. But instead of following in his footsteps, she decided to be a cop. Why is this? Indeed, she is a fascinating character, someone so fragile despite her tough-as-nails appearance. Again, duality comes into play, an ingredient that prevents the film from becoming a run of the mill psychological thriller. Ultimately, every ingredient of "Mr. Brooks" makes for one the most well crafted film of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.4 stars<br /><br />Not bad, but it could have been a lot better, mainly with others doing Moore's and Cook's roles. Neither is very convincing. Costner is good and Hurt is very good, however, and the basic story is pretty interesting. Looks good on blu-ray but hardly mind-blowing.<br /><br />I would have liked more Hurt and that side of the story; the devil on the shoulder has rarely been done as well as this. Cook is no great dramatic actor, and Moore's part is pretty badly written and she's no Kate Hepburn, so they slow things down, and all in all it's worth watching mainly for Hurt and Costner.<br /><br />Not a classic, but a decent enough thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>I don't know why this movie didn't make more of a splash in the theaters. It's a very good psychological thriller with some superb acting.<br /><br />As an alter-ego or imaginary "friend," William Hurt beams his counsel, like dangerous moonlight, over the shoulder, into the ear of Kevin Costner. He is the undermining Iago of this drama. But at the same time, his whispered warnings are amazingly astute, always right on target. Except for the fact that he often urges giving vent to homicidal impulses, that he plies Costner with justifications and permissions to proceed into psychopathology - he might be the ideal imaginary playmate carried over into adulthood. He would be the sort of conjured companion we'd all like to have.<br /><br />Danielle Panabaker is similarly brilliant as Costner's daughter. The exchanges of subtle, knowing looks between Costner and Hurt, between Costner and his daughter, make for chilling preludes, almost more frightening than the actual murders. This movie might in fact be all prelude, because in the DVD commentary, it's mentioned that some of the actors were specifically chosen based on their likely availability for a sequel.<br /><br />As absorbing as this movie is though, it does suffer from some serious lapses in logic. For one thing, it is strongly suggested that Costner comes by his nearly uncontrollable urge to commit murder - as a result of genetics. Well, that sort of theory of specific inheritance went out a long time ago. A number of otherwise good movies made in the 30s now look laughable and dated because their tragic drama revolved around the tendency to inherit "madness." Leading ladies were consigned to spinsterhood more than once because there was insanity in their families. Most doctors would now dismiss such determinism as an absurdity. However the producer and director of this movie still maintain this kind of inheritance as a definite possibility.<br /><br />Then it doesn't seem likely that a serial killer could, in reality, lead such a compartmentalized life - a sincerely loving soccer-Dad by day - an orgiastic killer by night. It's true that many serial killers might appear to the outside world to be normal, devoted husbands and fathers. But somehow, their wives must almost always suspect, their wives who are privy to the sorts of pornography their husbands revel in, the sorts of midnight indulgences they solicit. Mr. Brooks so successfully becomes another person in his workaday life though, that his wife, well-played by Marg Helgenberger, could have no inkling. I don't think so.<br /><br />But who knows? For all the CSI serial killers that we've been awash in over recent years, there are still precious few episodes that truly illuminate the motives of a serial killer, that truly put us in the mind, in the shoes of a serial killer. Mr. Brooks takes a good stab at doing just that - eerily, evilly, imaginatively.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>very basic story cleverly told......mr brooks has a disease and its name is marshall.marshall (w.hurt)is to costners brooks as t huttons charactor was to himself in ''the dark half''.mr brooks is a well respected business owner and family man.marshall is his alter ego with a craving for killing.the difference between the dark half and this is mr brooks has a relationship with marshall.mr brooks has quelled marshalls lust for mayhem for 2 years with the help of AA groups.well,marshall can no longer stay dormant and mr brooks gives in.<br /><br />a monkey wrench in the machine appears in the form of his home from college too soon daughter.he instantly knows somethings amiss.she wants to forgo college and prepare to help him with his business in box making.not only does she show up unexpected but so does an unforeseen problem.before this occurs,another crisis has popped up and things are looking bleak for the deadly duo.<br /><br />demi moore also gave a very believable performance as a detective hunting for the ''thumb print killer'',what the tabloids have dubbed mr brooks.she has her own issues that muddies her mission (messy divorce with money grubbing husband).she is in fantastic shape as well.<br /><br />this is a well crafted little thriller with enough blood and drama for me to hope mr brooks keeps the business in the family.....an ''inside'' hint to a hopeful sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>When you finally decide the "serial killer" genre in film has exhausted possibly every avenue, another one comes along. Co-writer and sole director, Bruce A. Evans has created something a little original with this genre; a successful pillar of the community: loving husband, father, philanthropist, self-made man and apparently humble about his success; Mr. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is not exactly what he seems to be because, like a lot of people, we have our addictions and like normal middle-class families, keep them from public view: alcohol, drugs, dangerous sporting activities and sex... et al. Mr. Brook's "addiction", however, is serial murder.<br /><br />Contrary to the fantasies of literature and film, most career criminals are stupid and usually spend the greater part of their lives in jail. Except those, of course, who work for powerful governments and trained in the art of subterfuge and murder in the name of patriotism. But normally, as the stats reveal, most murders, somewhere around 90%, are so-called crimes of passion or "drug-crazed" related. True pre-meditated murder, popularly known as "joy killing" or the other, assassination for hire, lies somewhere around 5 to 10%... Mr. Earl Brooks is addicted to joy killing and does it extremely well.<br /><br />The originality of Mr. Brooks is the character's alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), who, like the "monkey on the back", prompts Brooks to commit more killings. Hurt is excellent in this role, pushing, seducing, persuasive and charming to pull Mr. Brooks into another random killing. The dialogue between Brooks and Hurt was performed with utter believability, giving this film-goer hope that Kevin Costner still has something to give us as an actor. Costner did not play Costner in this film but became the character of Mr. Brooks: our faith in this actor has now been restored.<br /><br />Despite the great acting talent, credit should go to writer's Evans & Gideon for a well paced and sharp script. To the point, dialogue without fillers, yet relevant at every turn of the plot. There was never a second in this film where it was thought: "Ok, c'mon people, get to the point." The audience sat captivated from start to surprise ending.<br /><br />Most reviews never focus on the finer aspects of a film. Conversely, the brilliant editing in this film by Miklos Wright was outstanding: tight, appropriate and right on the mark.<br /><br />One of the clever ironies of Mr. Brooks is that he attends AA Meetings to stop his "addiction" of murder. He goes and stands up and says, "Hi, I'm Earl and I'm an addict." The man never goes into his "story", however, which in real life would make fascinating listening. "Serial Killer's Anonymous"... now that would certainly be interesting.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is well acted, superbly executed and a great surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>In a summer movie season where there are at least nine or ten mindless sequels (six of them are PART III's!) being shoved down our throats, MR. BROOKS is a refreshing dosage of original thrills, surprises, twists and good solid acting from Kevin Costner and William Hurt (Brook's evil alter-ego).  Hell, I even enjoyed Demi Moore's performance as the wealthy detective.<br /><br />The only flaw in the story (spoiler), in my opinion, is the suggestion that Earle Brooks's daughter may have contracted her father's "addiction" to killing people.  Very far-fetched and over the top for me.  Beyond that, this movie was a rare good reason to even bother going to the movies this summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW.html">A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW</a><br/><p>I have to admit that I was extremely disappointed in this movie. I mean what potential...Demi Moore and Kevin Costner! However, that is where the magic ended. Costner (known as Mr. Brooks) is a successful businessman by day and a serial killer by night. Soon he realizes that during his most recent escapade someone has seen him and "wants to learn how to be a killer". I thought that that was the dumbest thing ever. Someone would see a murder and want to be become a killer. On top of that, Demi Moore is an ambitious, rich detective who is going through a divorce from her "pretty boy" husband. Meanwhile, Mr. Brook's daughter is caught up in troubles of her own, that only add to the mystery. As the tale unfolds, the plot continues to disintergrate into a series of misfortunes. There was potential in the storyline, but it fell short by the end. I thought that the storyline involving Demi Moore and her divorce was stupid, and really added nothing to the storyline, with the exception of a forced plot. If someone has it and wants to loan it to you, see it. Otherwise, save your time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>"Hello. My name is Earl Brooks, and I'm an addict."<br /><br />Yes indeed. Mr. Brooks is an addict alright. But unfortunately what Mr. Brooks is addicted to isn't killing *him*...it's killing unsuspecting, innocent people.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is fabulous as Mr. Brooks. In Costner's last movie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KF0GWW">The Guardian</a>) he was an instructor (reluctantly) at The Coast Guard Academy (teaching Ashton Kutcher); in Mr. Brooks he is being hunted by Kutcher's beau Demy Moore, and Costner has again been (reluctantly) put into an 'instructional' role.<br /><br />Instead of the traditional Hollywood approach of following the cops hunt for the serial killer, you're mainly with Mr. Brooks during his daily routines.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Bruce Evans takes the directorial reins for only his second time in 15 years, and the job that he did with Mr. Brooks just goes to show that you don't need a popular, long-time director to get a great movie.<br /><br />In Mr. Brooks there are terrific thrills. Excellent twists. And there's plenty of action. Some of the situations require a stretch of the imagination, but the acting by a great A-list company and the fast-paced story flow keep viewers from spending too much time deciding whether it's 100% believable or not.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is one of the better, more entertaining movies that I've watched in 2007. Add it to your cart.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Director Bruce A. Evans' previous project behind the camera was the 1992 movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBM">Kuffs</a> with Christian Slater.  After 15 years, he helms "Mr. Brooks."  Perhaps by 2022, he'll direct again.  While he did have an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay for "Stand By Me" & is one of two writers for this film, the major flaw for the movie is its premise.  One cannot successfully have a main character through which the audience views the action that is a serial killer.  Whoopi Goldberg tried it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LAZ5">Homer and Eddie</a>, playing a character whose brain tumor caused her to kill.  That film didn't work either.  The fatal flaw is that you can't root for a serial killer.  Yes, Earl Brooks does TRY NOT to kill, but he isn't successful.  Trying to suggest prescriptive screenwriting, we could twist motivation where the character is killing for a higher purpose, such as a soldier in war or a patriotic spy on a mission.  The screenwriters could have shifted viewpoint and seen the movie through Tracy Atwood's eyes.  But as is, "Mr. Brooks" simply doesn't work.  It is a well-done failure, but the film does not work because of the screenwriting.<br /><br />Demi Moore may or may not have been the actress chosen if her character Tracy Atwood had been our focal point.  Moore has had some great films including the classic "Ghost" and a couple of very interesting films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NVDE">The Butcher's Wife</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006472Q">The Scarlet Letter</a>.  She even played bad girl in "Charlie's Angels."  As Tracy Atwood, she has an edge, going through a divorce.  She plays a detective who is wealthy and yet has something to prove, which causes her to catch bad guys.  One of the thrilling film sequences comes from a convict's vendetta as she is abducted in a great car chase.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is the star of the film.  As a movie star, we like to root for Kevin.  His Oscar is for Best Director for "Dances with Wolves," and we like to see him cast as the good guy.  As Mr. Brooks, he's simply too nice.  He is not the quiet guy next door.  He's the man of the year.  He heads a major business.  The part could have been written for a man bored who needs sport to add spice to his life.  Instead, we have a psychologically splintered murder addict.  The screenwriters try to make him nicer, even sending him to AA meetings.  The scariest part of his performance is when at several times he breaks out into a big laugh at something that's not funny.  Other than those few moments, he seems sane.<br /><br />William Hurt plays his alter ego Marshall that urges him to satiate his craving.  Hurt won his Best Actor Oscar back in 1985 for "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and was nominated in 2005 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ0Q">A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)</a>.  As Marshall, he is creepy.  Maybe if we'd seen Marshall enter Brooks' body and actually commit the murders, the film might have worked better.  Hurt does a good job playing someone who is not actually there.<br /><br />The supporting players do good work.  Comic Dane Cook who had the small part of George in "London" is immensely unlikable as Mr. Smith.  Marg Helgenburger who has two Golden Globe nominations for TV's "CSI" looks great as trusting wife Emma.  Danielle Panabaker from "Yours, Mine & Ours" & "Sky High" is somewhat spooky as Jane.  The film never totally lets you know if she's actually inherited her father's penchant for gore or not.  There is always a question mark.  Jason Lewis who had a small part in "The Jacket" has a cameo as Tracy Atwood's husband.  He looks good and does an adequate job in a small role.  Reiko Aylesworth who has played on several episodes of TV's "24" does a VERY nice job as Jessie's lawyer, anxious to screw Tracy Atwood financially on behalf of her client as well as some extraneous screwing around.<br /><br />From cinematography to sound, the technical aspects of the film are excellent.  It does provide a few scares along the way.  Unfortunately, while well done in many ways, it is fatally flawed because of the screenplay.

BROOKS is a surprisingly good film, one that from the response of critics and audiences at the time of the theatrical release last Spring might make the casual viewer pass by the DVD.  But step into this strange world of the successful, philanthropic, loving husband and father Mr. Brooks and discover one of the more clever twists on the themes of addiction and serial killings, courtesy of a smart script by writer/director Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon.<br /><br />Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner, in what may be his best role) has it all: wealth, fame, Man of the Year, a gorgeous home in Portland, a stunning wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger), a perky college freshman daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker) - and a secret: though he has not been active for two year while attending AA meeting for his addiction to killing, Brooks has a history of being a serial 'Thumbprint' killer.  Brooks is accompanied in his darker life by an alter ego Marshall (William Hurt) who encourages him to take up his old addiction to killing 'because he is so good at it'.  Brooks follows the need and performs another staged murder of a couple during intercourse.  Mistake - he forgets to close the drapes in the room, opening the possibility that he has been seen, a possibility which is realized when he encounters a funky young 'Mr. Smith' (Dane Cook) who just happened to have photographed Brooks' latest adventure and blackmails him into promising to allow 'Mr. Smith' to accompany him on his next murder!<br /><br />Twists and turns occur: daughter Jane returns from college having dropped out apparently because she is pregnant, though there are darker reasons for her move.  A spunky detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), a distraught woman plowing her way through an ugly divorce, takes interest in the newest episode of the return of the Thumbprint killer and faces her own demons from her past experiences as a policewoman. Feeling that Atwood may uncover his crime and thus history, Brooks plans a strange caper that includes 'Mr. Smith' and fearing that daughter Jane may have inherited his bad genes for killing addiction, he takes care of her threatening business before the surprise conclusion of the story.<br /><br />To tell more of the plot would deprive the viewer of the any secrets that unfold in the hands of Brooks and his man Marshall.  The story is smart, well scripted, intense, and exciting.  And in addition to the very fine performances by the stars, there are excellent cameos by Yasmine Delawari, Aisha Hinds, Jason Lewis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Matt Schulze.  Give this poorly reviewed little thriller a chance.  It is very much worth watching on every level. Grady Harp, October 07</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>The 2007 movie thriller "Mr. Brooks" features a strong cast, an interesting premise, and some truly creepy momemnts.  Keven Costner leads as Mr. Earl Brooks, a mild-mannered box manufacturer and philanthropist with a secret "addiction" to serial murder.  His addiction manifests itself in part as an alternate personality, Marshall (well-played by William Hurt), with whom he conducts internal debates over his killing.<br /><br />After a two-year lull, Mr. Brooks indulges his need to kill, but gets careless.  A peeping tom photographer named Smith (Dane Cook) blackmails Brooks for a piece of the action.  To complicate matters, Mr. Brooks' daughter unexpectedly comes home from college, pregnant and trailed by a murder investigation.  Mr. Brooks himself is under suspicion from a Detective Atwater (Demi Moore), a good cop with a tangled personal life.  Mr. Brooks will attempt to resolve the conflicts in his life in the way he knows best, playing a cat-and-mouse game with Atwater and Smith.<br /><br />Costner is superbly convincing in the role, playing loving husband, father and serial killer in a way that likely earns sympathy from a reluctant audience.  His meticulous execution of his crimes has a chilling fascination of its own, while his final confrontations with Smith and Atwater are priceless set-pieces.  William Hurt is equally convincing as Brooks' alter ego.  Since we know from the beginning who the murderer is, the suspense is in whether he will be caught, and how.  A trick double-ending adds to the suspense.  The story might have been streamlined by eliminating at least one of the sub-plots.  "Mr. Brooks" is highly recommended as something different in a murder mystery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Sure, there's plenty of blood and gore and violence and bullets and guns in this unlikely Hollywood thriller. But at least the script is intelligent, and the plot twists are enough to keep you interested. Few are the recent films which I can watch without long pauses due to extreme boredom. This was not one of those. Kevin Costner plays against type here as an extreme bad guy with a real voice in his head, played by William Hurt. These two hadn't worked together since "The Big Chill," and they succeed. Demi Moore is finally looking a bit jowly in certain shots, but she still does well as the wily and wealthy detective, even though she doesn't solve the crime. Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>There's a pretty impressive cast in this different tale of a serial killer who argues with his evil counterpart while planning his next murder.

Probably could have been great if they had made those flaws tighter.  The angle with the daughter was a nice touch as was the wanna be dude.

Earl falls off the wagon, murdering a young couple in their bedroom. The "fingerprint killer" has struck again. MR.

Suffice to say if you like modern-day film noir, or "neo noir," as its often called.....then check this out.<br /><br />This is pure entertainment, two hours of a story that grabs you right from the start and never lets go; a very involving story. Kevin Costner and William Hurt are tremendous in here, and worth the price of the rental alone. The whole cast was good but the dialog between those two guys - one real and one imaginary - have to be heard to be believed. (After a second viewing, I'd have to add Dane Cook's blackmailer character as equally fascinating.)<br /><br />If you want something a little thought-provoking, edgy-yet-moralistic, good acting and photography, this is a pretty good value for your rental money.  I've read where the Blu-Ray version on this movie looks and sounds outstanding, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner usually plays the good guy or at least a little bad, but never have we seen him be a monster, and the change turns out to be a refreshing jolt in the somewhat flat serial killer genre. In Mr. Brooks, Costner goes from the wealthy family man stereotype to hideous fiend in a flash. You have never seen Costner like this and never in a film that lets the sets spray red.<br /><br />The story is about the mild-mannered family man and wealthy entrepreneur Mr. Brooks who harbours a dark secret double life as `the thumbprint killer' (beastly played by William Hurt). He kills young couples in their bedrooms to satisfy his ferocious hunger for murder. Even though he has managed to abstain for a number of years, through alcoholic anonymous group therapy, he returns to his nasty misbehaviour only to be caught in the act by a wannabe killer who blackmails Brooks into taking him on a murder spree. Demi Moore appears as the detective who has devoted her life to tracking down the thumbprint killer. A third killer emerges on the scene to make things even more complex.<br /><br />It is a very good story for the most part and there is a subplot involving Brooks' daughter possibly committing a murder. The interplay between Costner and Hurt is very interesting but maybe the film leaves a few loose ends untied but nothing detrimental to what is a well above average thought provoking well acted violent drama. Makes you think Costner should have done bad much earlier.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>It is rare to see so many great elements brought together in a typical genre movie. MR. BROOKS is the proof that, from time to time, a great film comes by and renews our faith in genres.<br /><br />It is a precise and suspenseful thriller/domestic drama with depth, humor and some true great moments.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks (COSTNER)is successful man. He is happily married and has a teenage daughter. And he has a secret: he has an imaginary friend (HURT) who compels him to murder. Again and again. So Mr. Brooks is the "Thumb print killer" who's being hunted by a relentless detective (MOORE) with problems on her own. But being rich and intelligent, Mr. Brooks never makes a mistake. Or does he? One night he gets photographed by his latest  victim's neighbor who makes him a proposition: "take me with you".<br /><br />And that's just the beginning because from then on, everything will fall on top of Mr. Brooks: dealing with the police, dealing with his daughter (who too has a secret), dealing with his blackmailer, choosing a next victim, trying to quit... etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />I recommend this film to all of those who like a great screenplay with great characters and great actors who really enjoy their roles (you can really see Costner and Hurt enjoying themselves through each scene). It all makes this film a joy to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I'm not a Costner fan, generally, but I think he did a great job with this role.

Earl Brooks has just been named businessman of the year.  The owner of a carton manufacturing firm, he lives quite the life; married to the more than attractive Marg Helgenberger with a fine Portland, Oregon home, and a cutsey-tootsey college aged daughter who wants nothing but to quit school and get down to business, following in her father's illustrious footsteps.  Calm and collected as only Kevin Costner can play it, Earl seems a portrait of the all American dream incarnate.<br /><br />Except for one thing--he blows off steam in a profoundly interesting way.  Reminiscent of Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho, Earl cruises about town accompanied by Marshall (the diabolically amusing William Hurt) the definitive backseat driver who acts not only as Earl's confidant but the ultimate pusher--egging Earl to treat himself to a little well-deserved R&R--in the form of a well-planned murder.  In fact, Earl has stymied the police for years--known as the Thumbprint Killer, he remains virtually undetectable.<br /><br />Cleverly Marshall acts ala Howard and Glazer's "A Beautiful Mind," as Earl's other persona--existing only in Earl's mind but entirely visible to the audience.  Together Hurt and Costner gleefully feed off each other in a titillating pas-de-deux that illuminates the dark side of the typical Costner role.  Usually taciturn and noble, this Costner plans his murders with a fiendish abandon while Hurt plays the goading devil's advocate.  As the brains and catalyst, Hurt often enables with the frenetic energy of a naughty child; Costner brilliantly plays his part with more stoicism, but frequently and delightfully cannot contain himself.  His bursts of maniac laughter are well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Alas, all good fun must come to an end when the criminal duo commits a faux pas that has the potential to bring them down.  Voyeur photographer Mr. Smith (comedian Dane Cook) captures Earl on film at the scene of the crime.  He desires a small recompense for keeping his mouth shut--Earl's watcher fancies himself as a serial killer wannabe.  His price for silence?--being able to participate in the next murder and learn from Earl's years of grisly experience.<br /><br />In addition to this, Mr. Brooks must attend to a little problem on the home front. Imagine the tumultuous conversation between Earl and Marshal when Earl sniffs blood on Daughter Dearest's hands and comes to the rather 21st century conclusion that he has passed on his murder addiction to her genetically.<br /><br />What a hoot!  An extremely tired looking Demi Moore ups the fascination ante as the police officer that swears to apprehend the Thumbprint Killer.  Burdened by a wayward husband and side issues of her own, her character, albeit it as ludicrous as the rest maintains this wild ride's momentum to the very end.<br /><br />Most satisfactory however remains Kevin Costner.  An actor that I have never liked, he excels in this role, shining like a multi-faceted jewel, he shifts from stodgy and austere, distraught and distracted to frenetic and abstracted.  Brilliant!  Bravo, Mr. Costner.<br /><br />Okay, the film may suffer from a little too many plot twists and turns.  But rather than make this film less enjoyable, this overkill technique serves to render "Mr. Brooks" with a graphic novel-esque feel not unlike `A History of Violence', especially with Hurt again hamming it up in a campy cameo type performance that is hard to beat.  In the same comic book sense, the idea that murder can be a byproduct of success like alcoholism or white collar drug addiction and curbed by regular meetings at the local AA hammers my funny bone to the point where I cannot stop giggling and letting out an occasional howl that sounds much too similar to the vulgar laughter Hurt and Costner share while in Marshal and Earl personae.<br /><br />Bottom line?  `Mr. Brooks' sparkles with a Sweeney Todd type humor that toys with the graphic novel technique employed in "A History of Violence."  Costner surprises the audience with a nuanced performance well worth looking at more than once.  Hurt cannot disappoint; he cannot be more superb.  Not for everyone, especially with its themes of serial killings and violence, I, nonetheless recommend "Mr. Brooks" wholeheartedly and unabashedly.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This is the best thing Kevin Costner has done in some time and he's entirely believeable as Earl Brooks, Portland's Businessman of the Year, and very experienced serial killer. It's an addiction with him, one he's been able to control for two years by going to AA meetings (and praying a lot), but now he's fallen off the wagon. And even though he takes extreme precautions -- and has remained free because of them -- now someone has seen him. In exchange for keeping his secret, "Mr. Smith" wants to ride along on Brooks's next homicidal outing. What really makes the film, though, is William Hurt as Earl's alter ego. (Superego? "Dark Passenger," in the Dexter sense?) Hurt gives us a marvelous insight on how Earl's mind works, and is sort of a foil for what the viewer wants to know. Demi Moore, as the independently wealthy detective trying to track down the serial killer while also being involved in a messy, greedy divorce, is much less good. She's also -- the third thread -- involved in trying to locate a previous killer she had captured and sent to prison, which doesn't actually have anything to do with Brooks. And I was sure Brooks was going to arrange that particular psychopath's death, but no; he has a different target in mind. Then there's yet another sub-plot involving Earl's daughter, a college freshman, who has quit school and come home pregnant, and who may have murdered another student in her dorm. Or may not have. Her father thinks she did, and goes to some lengths to protect her. But his certainly (which he sees as her inheriting his "murder" gene) may be only in his own mind. There are some plot holes here and there -- we all know that obtaining the camera's memory stick doesn't mean having "all the copies," and there was a lot of traceable blood left on the ground and on the shovel at the cemetery -- but this is generally a very well written, well acted, and thought-provoking film. And there are apparently going to be sequels, so I'll be waiting for them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Kevin Costner plays a well off business man at the top of his game, awarded Man of the Year in the business world, loving wife and daughter, living the good life.  Little does the world know that he has a constant companion with him that only he can see, and a closet full of secrets that none could imagine.  Surrounded by an excellent cast including Demi Moore, Dane Cook and William Hurt, this movie is slightly predictable, but a couple of nice twists at the end that will leave you speechless. Only one small flaw in it at the end, careless of the Mr. Brooks Character, but doesn't change the ending.  Very graphic with the gore though, not one for the family, but one worth buying and watching again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>To really captivating and original movies with great screenplays, meaningful dialogue, and great acting..... And this movie has it all. It isn't so much of a thriller, as it is a different take/point of view on the serial killer that we normally don't see in most Hollywood films of today.<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays Mr. Brooks and this is one of Costner's best performances to date. Mr. Brooks is a respectable business man, whom has won a business man of the year award, is a loving husband & father. He seems like the guy next door, whom you could trust with your life. Yet Mr. Brooks has another darker, secret side of his life, that of a serial killer and he somehow has managed to compartmentalize his two different lifestyles. One lifestyles never meets the other one.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks sees himself more of an addict, much like that of an alcoholic or drug addict and attends meetings aimed for recovering substance abusers in hopes that a 12 step program will help him curb his addiction to killing (Of course, Mr. Brooks never states he is a serial killer at the meetings, just that he's an addict).<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of this movie is William Hurts role, which is that of Mr. Brooks' conscience/counterpart. We see the two interact throughout the movie and are given insight to what Mr. Brooks is thinking and feeling, which is an interesting perspective and nicely done.<br /><br />This movie is very captivating/engaging throughout its entirety and keeps you guessing to the end as to how it will turn out.... will the police catch him or will he get away with his crimes?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>"Hello. My name is Earl Brooks, and I'm an addict."<br /><br />Yes indeed. Mr. Brooks is an addict alright. But unfortunately what Mr. Brooks is addicted to isn't killing *him*...it's killing unsuspecting, innocent people.<br /><br />Kevin Costner is fabulous as Mr. Brooks. In Costner's last movie (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KF0GWW">The Guardian</a>) he was an instructor (reluctantly) at The Coast Guard Academy (teaching Ashton Kutcher); in Mr. Brooks he is being hunted by Kutcher's beau Demy Moore, and Costner has again been (reluctantly) put into an 'instructional' role.<br /><br />Instead of the traditional Hollywood approach of following the cops hunt for the serial killer, you're mainly with Mr. Brooks during his daily routines.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Bruce Evans takes the directorial reins for only his second time in 15 years, and the job that he did with Mr. Brooks just goes to show that you don't need a popular, long-time director to get a great movie.<br /><br />In Mr. Brooks there are terrific thrills. Excellent twists. And there's plenty of action. Some of the situations require a stretch of the imagination, but the acting by a great A-list company and the fast-paced story flow keep viewers from spending too much time deciding whether it's 100% believable or not.<br /><br />Mr. Brooks is one of the better, more entertaining movies that I've watched in 2007. Add it to your cart.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>hi Folks,<br /><br />I saw this at the theatre and enjoyed it very much.  I just  watched it on DVD and enjoyed it as much or more.  Costner is solid in the role..but the surprise is Dane Cook , who I think is an overated comedian..way overated but was spot on  perfect in his  part. William Hurt on the other hand was even better..oh my goodness he  is diabolically devilish and just delightful  beyond the words  I find. Moore is  perfect as the manish  girl/cop and the story twists  and  turns  I  greatly enjoyed.  There  is  violence  and a little gore  but really not problematic levels of either.  I wish there were more movies of this caliber out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"If I thought my reply were meant for one/ who ever could return into the world,/ This flame would stir no more; and yet, since none/--if what I hear is true--ever returned/ Alive from this abyss, then without fear/Of facing infamy, I answer you" Dante's `Inferno' Canto 27, lines 61-66<br /><br />(2 1/2 *'s) Enjoying `Mr. Brooks' in many ways has to do with your take on Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner).  At first conversing with his alter ego, Marshall (William Hurt), one wonders if he has flipped out or made a major pact with the devil.  One thing's for sure, it doesn't take us long to find out the answer.  Mr. Brooks is in many ways a respectable man.  He is loved by his wife, Emma (Marg Hegenberger), and he truly loves his spoiled, wayward daughter who has mysteriously dropped out of her first semester of college. His inner life and his outward appearance are like a case study from Psychiatrist M. Scott Peck's book, 'People of the Lie'.<br /><br />We know he is having internal conversations with his alter ego, for on the way home from an awards' dinner done in his honor, Brooks is talking to Marshall about his next murder. Marshall is in the back seat while his wife is in the front seat, oblivious to anything but changes in her husband's facial expressions.  In another scene Brooks and Marshall are sitting side by side and both turn their heads in synch, like they're one.<br /><br />By outward appearances, the only indication of anything amiss in his life are his frequent AA meetings, which vex Marshall, but please him with each new resolution of reform.  Much like the pact made in 'Ghost Rider,' Brooks seems uncomfortable with his real addiction, which in this case is to murder.  Oddly, as a homicidal addict he has enough composure to keep himself from leaving any traces he might leave behind.  Going for a second dessert after the awards dinner, Mr. Brooks spots a couple at a dancing school on a loft within sight of the ice cream parlor.  They will be his next victims.  At home he has a wardrobe room that keeps all the means to keep all traces of his crime behind.  Later, catching the couple at their apartment having sex, he coldly announces himself and shoots them dead.<br /><br />As his first murder in two years, things start to stick.  Detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) has been on his trail for years.  She is no closer to finding "The Thumbprint Murderer" than before.  Brooks is scot-free until a man, Bafford (Dane Cook), shows up at work delivering pictures of Brooks at the scene of the crime.  Bafford is a voyeur, one who enjoyed the open curtain bedroom scenes of the deceased and found an extra thrill with their demise. Bafford (bka "Mr. Smith") offers Brooks a proposition:  In exchange for the camera's memory and all the pictures, Brooks will allow him to tag along his next homicide.<br /><br />Bafford causes great problems for Brooks who argues against Marshall's persistent wishes.  He's on the wagon and has great difficulty fulfilling Bafford's part of the bargain.  For his part, Marshall only offers murder as a constant solution every time Brooks' gets closer to suspicion.  Meanwhile, Atwood has more than serial murderers on the loose:  She's distracted by a harassing ex-husband who is trying to extract inheritance money from her in a divorce settlement. How these plot lines come together, including the daughter's, is both amazing and unbelievable at the same time.<br /><br />Watching `Mr. Brooks' I kept thinking that most films would have been made from Detective Tracy Atwood's point-of-view.  She'd be the protagonist, and we'd see her go through corridors with a gun in her hand.  Maybe that film was done with Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins, and it was called `Silence of the Lambs,' a brilliant movie.<br /><br />Why see `Mr. Brooks`?  As a twisty plot movie, it offers a couple new ideas.  Is it plausible?  Probably not, but there's enough suspension of disbelief to find it reasonably entertaining.  Yet, there are too many plot points that neatly intersect together.  Just like the classic Faustus story of a man making a blood pack with the devil, is it a modern fable?  Possibly, but that's not the focus or import of the movie.  Is it a fascinating portrait of a man gone wrong?  I was intrigued, but only for so long.  Mr. Brooks brings some mystery, but I was absorbed and fascinated about him until the end.  Then, I was disappointed.  He loves his daughter; he wants to go straight; but in the end he doesn't care anything more than about his reputation.  (See Dante quote at the beginning of the review.)  It's understandable that Mr. Brooks is conflicted.  He couldn't be anything less, but when he can't decide what's most important hiding his reputation from his family or never receiving proper recognition from the detectives, we start to lose interest.  Okay, so there's the "banality of evil" presented, but realism does not always a good movie make.  There's something about the movie that lacks tension and cohesiveness.  Almost entirely devoid of sympathy, we do end up caring about Detective Atwood.  As an arcade, almost every picture I can think of is better developed.<br /><br />As talented as William Hurt is, he never brings the script home the way 'Danny Darko' did.  Not his fault.  This voyeur ride isn't as entertaining (much less suspenseful) as 'Disturbia'.  After being on the edge of my seat with fascination, 'Mr. Brooks' bored me, and a comparison with the relationship of a Faustian figure and the Devil in a more effective movie like 'Angel Heart' with Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro reminded me why.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was pretty entertaining. Costner finally finds a good movie to star in. I was skeptical of Dane Cook being in this but he does a good job and is perfect for his part. William Hurt is also very good as Mr. Brooks bad angel. I thought Demi Moore was ok but to be honest I thought that her entire part could have been left out though I think they were going with her bing the Clarice Starling to Costners Lechter.<br /><br />I recommend it. It was creepy, smart and had some pretty funny things in it to break up the tension.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>As the movie opens, Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is being honored as the Man of the Year.  A successful businessman with a loving family, Earl is  a pillar of his community.  What people don't know is that Earl has a secret:  He can't stop killing people.  He knows he's addicted to killing, but he also knows he won't stop, because the little voice in his head (William Hurt) keeps egging him on.  So, Mr. Brooks has it all - family, money, and a little hobby that makes him happy - until someone sees him commit his latest murder.<br /><br />I thought this movie would never end.  It just kept going and going and I honestly hated every minute of it.  It was so crushingly one-note, and that one note was boring.  All of the actors play it deadpan; there's no excitement or fear or drama.  It's just unremitting blandness all the way.  Costner, of course, has often been accused of being a wooden actor, but this time it isn't his fault.  His character is completely without feeling; he is actually dull. Demi Moore is featured in one of several tiresome subplots, playing the detective on Mr. Brooks' trail; she's angry, unappealing, and poker-faced.  We never learn why Mr. Brooks is a killer or why he has an alter ego talking to him all the time, and none of the storylines are resolved; the movie just ends.  Granted, there are a few scenes that made me jump, but that was because of loud noises - especially the gunshots.  Way too loud.  I kept hoping the plot would get better, but it didn't.  Too bad; it should have been great.</p></br></body></html>

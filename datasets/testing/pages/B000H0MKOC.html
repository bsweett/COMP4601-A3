The movie is extremely funny and educational. It teaches people, and Aaron's son, not to accept the status quo in thinking, that there are alternative realities depending on how one wants to use spin it. A truly libertarian film to the point of absurdity. Great comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>No one could ever accuse this movie of being subtle.  But hey, look at the title and the premise.  How could it be?<br /><br />Nick Naylor is one of the most interesting protagonists to come along in quite a while, and the topic is a very blunt "smoke smoke smoke!" message.  The movie is based on a novel which I haven't read but which must surely also be about him.  He's an interesting guy.<br /><br />What I see here is a brilliant balancing act.  The humor manages to go over the top without ever sacrificing character, credibility, or even plot.  I honestly didn't expect a plot, but rather a one-joke film.  So it was a pleasant surprise there.<br /><br />I will say that you have to be in the right mood, though.  The first time I fired up the DVD, I stopped after about 30 minutes and put it aside for later.  The second time, I was very impressed.<br /><br />(Fired up?  Oh no, I've been subliminally programmed!)</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>This movie was an unexpected delight, and I say this as someone not even remotely familiar with the book. Eckhart's work is suburb as his character manages to be both a caricature and a very real person. This is a portrait of the last days of Big Tobacco's arrogance before the states came in and nearly broke them. Nailer's speech to his son's class was absolutely hilarious as was the send up of the talk show used for the introduction. This is a truly equal opportunity spoof because it casts aspersions on practically everything and everybody including politics, the press, big business, and even child custody arrangements. Nothing is sacred here which is just how it should be.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Well, how compromised can the morality of a story be and still be funny?  This story is not about smoking, but about lobbying for the smoking industry (and alcohol and guns and ...).  The compromises are on every side of this story.  The politicians who uses causes and principles as poses for re-election, the family members who want to distance themselves from the lobbyist standing up for the "bad" thing, but still willing to live well off of the proceeds.  It is also about all the lies we tell ourselves and the excuses we make because we "have to pay the mortgage".<br /><br />Nick Naylor (great name for the character, huh?) is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry and is at the top of his game.  The movie opens up with him on the Joan Lunden show with a whole host of anti-smoking folks including a teenage boy dying of cancer.  Nick turns it around by explaining to the audience that the tobacco industry wants the boy to get well and live so he can continue to smoke.  It is the anti-smoking government agency who profits with a bigger budget if the boy dies.<br /><br />Naylor is divorced.  His ex-wife is living in what used to be his house with their son, Joey, and her boyfriend.  When Nick goes to career day and greets Joey on the way to the front, the boy whispers a plea begging Nick to not ruin his childhood.<br /><br />I don't want to take away the enjoyment of discovering this wonderful plot from you, but one of the great bits in the story is the weekly lunch Nick has with his friends who are lobbyists for the liquor and gun industries.  Together, they call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death).  One of their ongoing debates is who is responsible for the most deaths.<br /><br />In the end, while things move on, they don't really get much better.  Some things are learned, but the world remains what it is even if the cast changes a bit.  But it was a fun ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there is NO smoking in the movie.  There are quite a number of uses of the f-word and other swearing - so keep that in mind.  And since there is a plot twist that involves Nick having an unwise affair, there are some sexual situations, but no nudity.<br /><br />A fine cast with some pretty big name stars (Robert Duvall, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, with Aaron Eckhart as the Beaver - I mean Nick).<br /><br />Enjoy the shenanigans.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>Aaron Eckhart has to be one of the most underrated actors today.  He makes another flawless performance in "Thank You For Smoking" - a comedy about tabacco, spin control, and public perceptions.  "Smoking" does a great job of showing how today's PR departments and "Spin Doctors" operate and just what their MO is exactly.<br /><br />Young Cameron Bright (Running Scared, X-Men 3) shows why he is a promising young actor in doing a superb job of playing Eckhart's son.<br /><br />The one funny thing about this movie - there is not one single scene with someone smoking a cigarette.<br /><br />Watch it - you will not be dissappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Thank You for Smoking' is one of the funniest and freshest comedies I've seen in a long time.  It's smart and witty and capitalizes on its assets brilliantly, leading Aaron Eckhart to what has to be is greatest performance to date (a Golden Globe nod should be a lock at this point).  As Nick Naylor, Eckhart is smart, effective and confident as the voice behind big tobacco.  He's so into his job that he even goes as far as to somewhat promote smoking to his son's elementary class.  Nick regularly meets with his fellow lobbyists (David Koechner & Maria Bello) for lunch, donning the name MOD squad (merchants of death), where they discuss and or compete for the greatest death count.<br /><br />When Nick becomes involved with a reporter (Katie Holmes at her most delicious...screw you Tom Cruise) things slowly spiral out of control, and as his son (Cameron Bright) becomes all the more interested in his fathers line of work Nick begins to wonder if he's really setting the right example for his son.  He goes from shameless to selfless by the end of the film, but he does it all with his confident yet cocky demeanor.  The film was a riot, I mean utterly hysterical from start to finish (Rob Lowe was brilliant as the Asian obsessed motion picture tycoon...I mean that whole Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones discussion was priceless), and it was original enough to deem itself worthy of multiple viewings.  A wonderful surprise...highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>The "joke" here is a tobacco lobbyist encouraging us to be free thinkers while knowing he can manipulate those thoughts.  At last, a movie that both Ralph Nader and Karl Rove can enjoy!<br /><br />On the upside, with so many movies conveying the message, if you're really good looking you'll always come out on top, here's a movie that tells us being clever is just as important, if not more so.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm making it sound as if its not funny and there are some funny bits.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>If you're anything like me, you've probably gotten pretty annoyed by the anti-smoking crowd these days.  I swear, if cigarettes are cancer, some of these people are chemotherapy.  We've all seen those obnoxious TRUTH ads where a bunch of unkempt, college-know-it-all types harass people trying to do their jobs and use all kinds of manipulative devices and questionable "facts" to push their anti-cigarette agenda (I should note in passing that I've never had a cigarette in my life, so I don't have a horse in this particular race).  With their prohibitive taxes and bans on smoking on private property, they've become even more controlling and arrogant lately, as they've done everything but force smokers to enjoy their habit in their basements while wearing haz-mat suits and spraying a fire extinguisher after each puff.  Whatever happened to personal choice?  Whatever happened to independent thought?  Whatever happened to open and honest debate?  Well, Thank You For Smoking is here to address those very questions for your viewing pleasure, with plenty of hilarious moments to accompany its amoral anti-message.<br /><br />Based on the excellent comic novel by Christopher Buckley, Thank You For Smoking isn't a satire so much as a classic black comedy in the Dr. Strangelove mold (not to say this movie is as good as Dr. Strangelove; I'm not about to commit movie heresy), aiming less to critique anything in particular than to defend the indefensible, so to speak.  The indefensible in this case is Nick Naylor, divorced father and fast-talking vice-president of the Academy for Tobacco Studies, a Washington firm that lobbies on behalf of Big Tobacco.  In lieu of a conventional plot, the movie basically just consists of a series of looks into Nick's life and work, with tons of little asides, flashbacks, and voice-overs from Nick giving it a sort of stream-of-consciousness feel.  The tone of the whole thing is pretty slick and smirky, but given its subject matter and protagonist I really don't think it could've worked any other way.  Aaron Eckhardt, who hasn't really impressed me that much in the past, was seemingly born for the role of Nick, as he pretty much embodies what I imagine a tobacco lobbyist would have to be like: cynical, smarmy, and utterly resistant to idealism of any sort.  He's made himself a pretty nice living by exempifying the truism that if you argue correctly you're never wrong, and he always manages to find a way to undercut the emotional appeals of the moralists who think they have him in a rhetorical corner.  Nick is actually rather similar to Nicolas Cage's soulless gun dealer from Lord of War, but not quite as much of a moral vacuum.  Nick's a friendly enough type, and a good dad to his too-smart-for-his-age son, but his line of work has made him very good at compartmentalizing and playing the role of devil's advocate.  I for one couldn't help but like the guy, especially since many of those on the other side were so obnoxious.  Besides, he's gotta pay the mortgage somehow, as he points out in what he terms the "yuppie Nuremberg defense."<br /><br />It also helps that for such a short movie, Thank You For Smoking manages to generate a lot of memorable supporting characters, even if it doesn't quite have the time to develop them all.  Thankfully, Nick's informal membership in the MOD (as in Merchants of Death) squad, one of my favorite aspects of the novel, made it into the movie, and the roles of Nick's compatriots were cast about as well as you could hope for.  Maria Bello was a bit underused as alcohol lobbyist Polly Bailey, but she's still just as great as she was in A History of Violence, and David Koechner is brilliantly over the top in the role of vaguely rednecky gun advocate Bobby Jay Bliss (sure, it's not all that different from the role he played in Anchorman, but it's funny just the same).  The MOD Squad's lunch meetings provide some of the most blackly funny moments in the movie, as Nick, Polly, and Bobby Jay compare strategies and death tolls and argue about who's the most hated.  It's sort of interesting in a morbid way, seeing three people brought together by the common bond of their seemingly despicable jobs.<br /><br />Going outside Nick's main circle, the movie provides a pretty unflattering portrayal of those who inhabit Washington in general, which isn't really anything new but still ends up being pretty refreshing in this case.  If there's one thing Thank You For Smoking makes clear, it's that lobbyists aren't the only people in the District with their hands dirty.  The movie shows us a political climate where pretty much everybody has a hidden agenda, from Katie Holmes's scheming reporter to J.K. Simmons's backstabbing boss to William H. Macy's grandstanding senator, all of whom make Nick look downright decent.  Indeed, the most honorable character in the movie is probably The Captain, the drawling, unreconstructed tobacco magnate who founded Nick's lobbying firm.  Brought to memorable life by Robert Duvall in what's basically a series of cameos, the Captain may have gotten rich by selling a hazardous product, the movie seems to be saying, but at least he's not bullying or manipulating people.<br /><br />In the end, how much you like Thank You For Smoking will probably come down to your stance on smoking itself.  If you think cigarettes are a scourge and those who produce them the embodiment of evil, you probably won't be able to make much of a connection with this movie's impious stance.  However, if you think the U.S of late has become too PC, too uptight, and too totalitarian, you'll probably appreciate seeing something that (at least partially) turns the moral tables for once.  Sure, it probably won't change the world, but Thank You For Smoking should at least help you laugh at it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking is a well written, well acted satire on the political correctness of the late 1990's. The film tells the story of tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) as he goes through the process of bringing smoking back to the movies and in turn reconnecting with his young son.<br /><br />The film has a great ensemble cast and witty dialogue but doesn't really develop its story line to the point I would have hoped. As political satire it walks a thin line between high comedy and silliness.<br /><br />The high point of the disc comes in its special features. The disc offers two commentaries, an episode of the Charlie Rose show, two making of featurettes and various art galleries.<br /><br />This really could have been a great  movie as it turns out it was merely good. Worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Politically incorrect, and full of mordent humor Thank You for Smoking is a dark comedy of the most devilish kind, and it stars the hunky Aaron Eckhart in one of his most multi-faceted roles yet. Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, the brash, smooth talking, sexy and smart headed spokesman for the tobacco lobby. He's so revered by the medical and anti-smoking establishments that he's become the self-proclaimed "merchant of death."<br /><br />No one in Nick's life is particularly happy that he does this job, least of all his ex-wife Jill (Kim Dickens), who worries about the powerful influence Nick has on his young son Joey (Cameron Bright), who absorbs dad's key lesson: "The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly, you're never wrong." Although Nick has never been to college, he has an ineffable talent to put the spin on any subject, and he has no moral hesitations about being a spokesperson for an industry, which is responsible for the death of millions.<br /><br />A chief anti-smoking combatant, liberal Vermont Sen. Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), is lobbying to emblazon a skull-and-crossbones on every cigarette pack label. The Captain (Robert Duvall), heads the Academy of Tobacco Studies and Nick is enlisted to combat the senator's plan. Desperately searching for a way to get people smoking, Nick comes up with the idea to show glamorous movie stars smoking again so he heads for Hollywood to schmooze Zen-spouting uber-agent Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe).<br /><br />While Nick deals with death threats, a near-lethal kidnapping plot and the angry original Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott), now dying of cancer, the real stumbling block comes from a devastating profile in the Washington Probe by Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). Is Nick's world going to come crashing down? Or is he going to survive the witch-hunt against him to fight another day?<br /><br />The film is packed with irreverence, mostly in the form of clever one-liners as it skillfully skewers corporate spin culture, political correctness, ultimately twisting the idea of personal freedom.  Nick's argument is that everyone has a right to smoke, regardless of how bad other people think it is for them. The film might have been merely another sarcastically slick smack down of a culture dominated by doublespeak. Instead, director Jason Reitman's script and his incisive cast - including the wonderful Maria Bello - gives sufficient analytical foundation to the film's wry cheekiness.<br /><br />Eckhart is perfectly cast. He's a smarmy, handsome, clever corporate confidence trickster, who exudes a breezy confidence and oozes a moral elasticity always with a smug smile that never excludes likeability. And although the movie's ending doesn't quite hold together and maintain the same level of coolly cynical insightfulness that comes before, it also doesn't sell Nick out and go for fake deliverance. We see him achieve a kind of epiphany when he thinks of his son and smoking, but the old Nick is still there, as amorally ambiguous and as self-righteous as ever.

His young son isn't so sure about the ethics of Dad's job, however.<br /><br />This is a very funny, sarcastic movie.  I've seen Eckhart before but was never impressed, until now.  He is perfect as the fast-talking lobbyist with his dazzling smile and charismatic charm.  The cast is full of good actors in small but witty roles:  William H. Macy plays an anti-cigarette senator, Rob Lowe is wonderfully slimy as a Hollywood publicity man, Robert Duvall plays the tobacco boss, and Sam Elliott is the Marlborough Man.  It's filmed in a quasi-documentary style with lots of deadpan humor.  No one actually smokes in the movie, which is a good thing considering the cancer statistics that are quoted.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film; it really delivers big laughs while poking fun at the tobacco fat cats.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>'Thank You For Smoking' is a satire/comedy of the industry of Big Tobacco.  Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and calls himself the Colonel Sanders of Nicotine.  He's divorced, but stays very involved in Joey's (his twelve year old son) life.  Joey (Cameron Bright - Running Scared, The Butterfly Effect) looks up to his father, often seeing him in a Godlike way.<br /><br />Nick belongs to what they call the MOD Squad (Merchants Of Death).  He and his two friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello - Secret Window) who works for the Moderation Council and is an alcoholic, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) who works for SAFETY (The Society for the Advancement of Firearms and Effective Training for Youth), meet for lunch one a week and discuss the deaths related to their current jobs.<br /><br />The movie begins with Nick appearing on the Joan Lunden show, against anti-tobacco groups and a young boy suffering from tobacco related cancer.  Nick, the best of the spin-artists, walks away smelling like a rose.  On his case over his defense of Big Tobacco is Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who leads a sub-committee dedicated to labeling cigarettes with the skull and crossbones poison symbol.<br /><br />Nick, while waiting for the sub-committee hearing, travels to see The Captain (Robert Duvall), head of the tobacco company and founder of Nick's employer.  Nick's boss stole his idea to use Hollywood to promote tobacco (by getting stars to smoke on screen) and the Captain wants Nick to fly to California to get the ball rolling.  Taking Joey along, Nick meets with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood super agent who heads up EGO (Entertainment Global Offices).  (Jeff and the whole Hollywood scene is so over-the-top "typical" that it's hilarious)  Jeff and Nick agree on 25 Million dollars to get Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones to smoke on screen after a futuristic $ex scene. (unbelievable!)  While in California, he takes a huge money payoff to the original Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott) who's now dying of lung cancer.  He also appears on the Dennis Miller show against Senator Finistirre, and receives a death threat from a caller.<br /><br />Nick comments on his life as being the most hated person on Earth.  It's pretty much true.  He's kidnapped, stripped, covered in nicotine patches and left at the Lincoln statue.  He almost dies and can never smoke again because of the overdose, but spins it into how cigarettes saved his life because a non-smoker would have died.  The reporter he's dating, Heather, takes all their private pillow talks and publishes an extremely derogatory article about him.  (You'll have to watch the movie to see how he pays her back)  Nick has to balance his life between his moral-less job and being a father to his son.  The things he teaches Joey aren't right or wrong but how to win, an approach Joey's mother disapproves of.<br /><br />Whether you're a non-smoker or even a smoker, the actions of the Big Tobacco will make you red with fury.  Eckhart plays a good role as Nick, totally unconcerned with his job as lobbyist for a known killer.  (as expressed in the meetings of the MOD Squad)  Though not based on a true story or even real statistical facts, the casual way Big Tobacco treats their "customer's" lives rings true.  Adding in Polly and Bobby Ray as advocates of alcohol and firearms holds a certain irony to the film.  Though the movie has a good premise (as far as satire goes) and an excellent cast who all perform well, it never quite advances itself into either comedy or drama.  The pace is a little to slow, and the debates not long enough or heated enough.  It's interesting enough if you want to watch a benignly evil man do his effort to spread poison, but not worthy of a purchase.  Rent first.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>For all of its nicotine and addictive natures, I never once got into cigarettes. Sure I had a couple but they never once became an addiction. Ironically there are people out there whose sole job it is is to get people to smoke. Criticized for having no moral compass, they basically smooth talk their way into media's hearts by saying the wrong words the right way. As Aaron Eckhart's character says, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong. That is the basic for this film: nobody is really right or wrong, it's just a question of who sounds the most convincing.<br /><br />Eckhart plays Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies whose basic job is to downplay the dangers of tobacco and smoking and turn things around in their favor. He doesn't necessarily lie, he just makes the truth sound so cool. But when politicians want to put a more grim warning label on cigarettes, Naylor is called into action but a reporter has that come crashing down and he has to once again, talk his way out of rough waters.<br /><br />A film like this usually rests on one actor, unlike most where it's an ensemble film. Eckhart is one of those kind of actors that he's so good when he's actually given a good part to play although roles in Paycheck and the Core were at least watchable but here he kind of flexes his muscles. The rest of the cast is great as well with funny cameos from Adam Brody of the O.C, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot as the Marlboro Man. The only thing about some of the cast members is that they do feel like cameos with Naylor's ex dating a doctor that practically appears in 2 scenes and Katie Holmes as the reporter just feels miscast (someone like Rachel McAdams would've been perfect).<br /><br />What's enjoyable about the film is that not only is it funny (one favorite is the senator who wants to eliminate all incidents of cigarettes from movies, complete with hilarious alternatives) but it never really feels like an anti-smoking ad in the guise of a film. It argues its pro-smoking points just as well as its anti-smoking ones and leaves it to the viewer to figure out who seems better to you. If its got any faults is that when we start to learn more about Nick the man and not Nick the silver-tongued man on a mission, it doesn't really have the energy when the film ramps up in satire.<br /><br />I'm not sure if you'll end up buying this, but it's a great rental and up to you whether to completely go ahead and buy it. Which isn't a bad thing since it's so funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Very smart, funny and interesting movie. I seldom say that about any movie. The story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry who's job is to put a spin on cigarettes, improve their image, make them cool again, and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack sold.<br /><br />Nick Naylors character is brilliant. While he was "selling" the public on his ideas and views and convincing them, his own son, and everyone else that he is correct he actually sold me too with his good looks, charm, and logic.<br /><br />Everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and anyone who attempts to sell or promote it won't garner any sympathy for lagging sales. That's where the spin doctor Nick comes in to teach everyone that smoking is cool.<br /><br />Excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a spin master. He travels around the country defending the tobacco industry as its main spokesperson, making sure their voice is heard along with the cancer survivors, health advocates and doctors. He deserves every penny he earns. Appearing on the daytime talk show "Joan", he manages to get a 15 year old cancer victim to side with him. Appearing at his son's career day, he proves to a little girl that her mother is wrong about cigarettes. He does his job, and he does it well. Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) proposes putting a new graphic label on all packages of cigarettes, a none-to-subtle skull and crossbones. This stirs the debate up, causing Nick to look for new alternatives. He decides to enlist the help of Hollywood to make smoking sexy again, prompting a trip to Los Angeles, to meet with the most powerful agent in town, Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe). He decides to take his son (Cameron Bright) along, for the experience.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking", directed by Jason Reitman, son of Ivan ("Ghostbusters", "Stripes", "Twins", "Junior") and based on the popular book by Christopher Buckley, is a very funny film.<br /><br />In "In the Company of Men", Aaron Eckhart played a despicable man, but we still enjoyed spending time with him. It says a lot for his acting ability that he was able to charm us into liking his character, despite all of his flaws and bad qualities. Nick Naylor is a variation on this theme. As he meets with various people, he works hard to convince them the tobacco industry is not evil. A large part of Nick's likeability lies in the relationship he has with his son, Joey (Cameron Bright). Joey is at an impressionable age and Nick is not above trying to persuade him that smoking and tobacco are not bad. But he realizes that as a parent, everything he says is soaked up by his son. Nick talks to Joey about the art of argument, trying to explain to him what he does for a living. But Nick's character is more than just a father. As a spokesman for Big Tobacco, he is also trying to persuade his son that what he does is not bad. He seems proud when his son seems to be learning a little too much about his father's life and job. He knows he has to be careful about what he tells his son, but he isn't above trying to slip in some backhand promotion of the industry at his son's career day or in casual conversation. It almost seems as though he is letting his own spin get the better of him.<br /><br />When he meets with his friends, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello, "A History of Violence"), the spokesperson for the alcohol industry, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Hoechner), the spokesperson for the firearms industry, they frequently argue about whose job is tougher, based on the number of deaths caused every year. (Hint: Nick will always win this argument.) They also sit around giving each other help for their upcoming battles. For instance, Polly dreads an upcoming story by Diane Sawyer on alcohol fetal syndrome. How can she spin that? When the two friends find out Sawyer will be doing the interview, they conclude Polly is screwed. Why? Because Sawyer will hug the mother she is interviewing, getting the sympathy.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Nick walks a tightrope. He is charming, well-spoken and enjoys his job, but his job is to defend Big Tobacco, so he isn't beyond spinning the truth. Eckhart does a masterful job of making this character funny, intelligent, smarmy and evil.<br /><br />There are a lot of stand outs in the large, well-known cast. William H. Macy is hilarious as the senator from Vermont. In one scene, we watch the senator, sitting at his desk, mulling over a problem, surrounded by bottles of maple syrup and cheese figurines and advertising mascots and wearing Birkenstock sandals and thick socks, all made in his home state. Rob Lowe is very funny as the uber-agent Jeff Megall. Clearly modeled after Michael Ovitz, we get a glimpse of the character even before we meet him as his assistant gives Nick and his son a tour of the new, Asian-themed office, complete with Zen-garden keeper. When we meet Jeff, we realize he has taken the Asian thing way too far. Adam Brody (TV's "The OC") is very good as Jeff's hyperactive assistant. Robert Duvall makes an appearance as The Captain, the oldest surviving member of Big Tobacco and their leader. He has made a fiefdom for in himself in Winston- Salem and Nick can't help but be impressed. Sam Elliot plays the original Marlboro Man, now wracked with cancer, but not beyond considering a little payout. Katie Holmes is also very good as Heather Holloway, a reporter doing a piece on Nick. She has some complexity and guts and isn't above sleeping with someone to get some inside information. Her character is a little unexpected; sexual, ruthless, cunning.<br /><br />Director Reitman does a very good job of balancing all of these diverse characters. Each and every one could easily be the basis of a film on their own, so there is a real danger of losing some of these major personalities in the shuffle. Each character is very distinct and provides a unique part of the overall effect. With all of these well-known actors, it seems remarkable each makes a lasting impression, but they are all memorable, unique and interesting. More importantly, just about all of them are both good and bad. From Nick on down, every character realizes they are on a slippery slope and it is just a matter of how much work they put into slowing down the inevitable slide.<br /><br />Reitman also seems to have a good ear for dialogue. The arguments, conversations and debates he writes for these characters are always amusing, at the least, and quite often, hilarious. He seems to have the most fun when the three representatives from alcohol, tobacco and firearms, are sitting around at lunch, debating whose job is the toughest. But he also has fun taking pot shots at politics, the movies, education and more.<br /><br />Very often, a comedy will start off great, throwing jokes left and right, setting up characters and the story with quick shots, creating a fast momentum, causing us to miss some of the jokes because we are laughing through them. Then, the story kicks in and things slow down a bit. Hopefully, towards the end of the film, things pick up again, creating a momentum similar to the beginning. Often, films slow down too much in the middle and don't regain the momentum through the end, leaving us feeling let down, giving us a less than favorable impression of the film. "Smoking" sidesteps most of these problems, starting at a fast clip, causing us to laugh through many jokes. However, it does slow down a bit as it begins to deal with the mechanics of the story and then picks up again for the last act. Thankfully, it doesn't fall victim to its own early success and manages a fairly consistent feel through acts two and three. But the film is a little unbalanced. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just a predictable thing. It would be nice to go to a comedy and laugh your head off consistently throughout, leaving the theater exhausted. "Smoking" is very funny, well-written and well-made, but it gives us a chance to rest and recuperate.<br /><br />"Thank You for Smoking" is not really a polemic against smoking or the tobacco industry (although, there are certainly some fine jokes at the expense of both), but the main focus is on spin and how it affects many aspects of our life and how it has come to control our lives. Seek out this film and you will watch one of the better examples of the comedy genre we have seen in some time.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>For some reason, I thought that *Thank You for Smoking* was a documentary.  I don't know what led me to assume that.  So, it was a surprise for me, both in genre and the story.<br /><br />Nick Naylor is a spinner of a spokesperson for the tobacco industry.  He's so savvy with words that he could convince anyone that smoking is actually good for you.  Even if he doesn't necessarily believe it himself.<br /><br />Nick has everything going smoothly for him.  He meets once a week with 2 other lobbyists (guns and alcohol).  They call themselves "the MOD" (Merchants of Death).  He isn't afraid of his boss because he knows that THE man of tobacco (Duvall) has his back.  He's off to Hollywood to get cigarette smoking back on screen.<br /><br />The governor of Vermont (Macy) wants a televised political debate with him.  However, he needs leverage.  Unknown to the governor, a reporter (Holmes) wants to do an article on Naylor.  Drawn to her charm, wits and sexiness, he spills the beans to her.  Well...as long as he is getting a "side dish".  Of course, the reporter has an ulterior motive, which is to expose Naylor as who he really is.<br /><br />Predictably, things spiral down as soon as the article is released which contains secrets and identities of those behind the tobacco industry.  The governor just cannot wait to debate with Naylor as well as making him look like a fool.<br /><br />Can Naylor turn things around and save face as well as the tobacco industry?  Has the provobial cat gotten his tongue?<br /><br />I like *Thank You for Smoking* because it was stimulating for discussion with friends after the movie.  It just makes you wonder who is lobbying and are they lobbying for you or not.  In addition, you'll soon realize the looming and eminent presence of the tobacco industry in America.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Thank You for Smoking" is a superbly assured effort from first-time director Jason Rietman.<br /><br />Based on the book by Christopher Buckley, "Thank You for Smoking" tells the story of Nick Naylor, a big tobacco spin doctor who slowly comes to realise the error of his ways.<br /><br />Cleverly, Naylor - in a brilliant performance by Aaron Eckhart - is portayed as a likable guy - even at his most oily. The film lands solid punches on big tobacco executives, politicians, reporters, and of course lobbyists.<br /><br />"Thank You for Smoking" is a nice companion piece to "Fast Food Nation", which takes its aim at the fast food industry and if you loved that film you will love "Thank You for Smoking".</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>The most surprising and refreshing thing about writer/director Jason Reitman's THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that no one smokes--not tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, not the alcohol and guns lobbyists, not the investigative reporter, and certainly not the Vermont cheese senator.<br /><br />This is a nutty and witty comedy satire that reminded me fondly of the 1940's Preston Sturges comedies, with their zany dialogue and flawless supporting casts.  SMOKING's key character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in the performance of his career to date), is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic.  Divorced, with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for, Naylor believes that Americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will.  He knows he manufactures a product that causes death, but he can be wickedly hilarious about it.  Like with Cancer Boy on THE JOAN LUNDEN SHOW:  "Why would I want this young boy to die?  We would lose one more potential adult smoker."  Then he invades an elementary school classroom, where one little girl tells him, "My Mommy says that cigarettes can kill you."  "Oh?  Is your Mommy a doctor?  A scientific researcher?  Then maybe she doesn't have all the facts."  This is a hysterically funny and inspired satire.<br /><br />Curiously, the villain of the piece may be William H. Macy as the unpleasant Vermont Senator who sells "cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks," replies Nick.  Nick also has a reporter (DAWSON CREEK's Katie Holmes) want to do a story on him; the two end up as literally strange bedfellows.  Meanwhile, the head of the Tobacco Lobby, Robert Duvall, dies of lung cancer.  And the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for Americans' rights to drink and fire guns, hopefully not at the same time.<br /><br />The source here is a novel by Christopher Buckley and it must be a lulu.  It would be fun to know whether or not Mr. Buckley smokes.  I am a lifelong non-smoker with asthma.  Nick Naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke, knowing the dangers of cigarettes.  The movie makes such a complex case for both sides, which is a tribute to director Reitman's brilliant screenplay.  One wishes both it and Eckhart's fabulous performance could be Oscar nominees next Spring for this 2006 comedy delight.  But the whole cast is a dream--Macy, Holmes, Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody; and the dialogue is brilliant.  If you want a good time at the movies, don't even consider missing the wonderfully funny THANK YOU FOR SMOKING on DVD.<br /><br />The movie is in Panavision and letterboxed on DVD.  Bonuses include a superb CHARLIE ROSE SHOW with Buckley, Reitman, Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; an audio commentary I do not recommend until a second viewing of the movie; two filmmaking featurettes; and deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>This is some good entertainment.  By that I mean that it's not necessarily original or profound, new or amazing in technique, or really that important.  Yet it's a decently written, well-acted observational satire, one that can give or take depending on what you want to receive or expect from it.  The trailer gives away some of its best jokes, we know that "everyone will become a better person at the end," and there's nothing really offensive in it.  Yet it's still, if anything, a great way to pass your time if you have the opportunity to see it.<br /><br />Frankly, this is the type of movie that Hollywood SHOULD be making while the medium-sized movie (AKA Indies by those who don't know better, AKA Indiewood, AKA movies with stars that aren't expected to be blockbusters) should be attempting something "different."  Instead, we have Hollywood making complete crap, medium-sized movies making the well-done formulas like this, and the really independent films trying to make the midsized movie, but with the unfortunate side-effect of selling the frankly ugly and annoying handheld camera effect as, "that grainy independent feel."<br /><br />But enough about the shoulda coulda woulda.  This, a highly comic and entertaining feature by Jason Reitman, is about a guy named Nick Naylor who must defend Big Tobacco against a nation of health warnings, fear of cancer, anti-big-business terrorist groups, and basically everyone in the nation who frankly hates him as a person even though he's a decent, caring guy who really just cares about taking care of his son.  What keeps this movie flowing and interesting is its comedic timing, a lot of nice quotables and one-liners that keep the audience at least amused until it finally is able to show the character express what's really on his mind: the importance of personal responsibility towards everything, even morally questionable businesses.  For all the talk and spin, Naylor never really says, "Smoke cigarettes", he says, "Make your own decisions."  The unfortunate thing is that in order to make a living saying that, he has to do it under the name of Big Tobacco.<br /><br />I, personally, love any movie that's willing to tackle issues of media and able to do it without being condescending or terribly misinformed.  That's where a lot of this film's strength lays, in its ability to analyze public relations and various forms of media as they operate without really being all, "Da Media is trying to kill you oh noes!"  This movie has some very important lessons to show in terms of understanding spin, how it works, and also understanding that sometimes the talking heads are real people too.  However, what really keeps it from being "brilliant" or "progressive" or anything like that is the fact that it really needed to have come out about fifteen years ago or thereabouts.  Nowadays such subjects are pretty much common discourse.  At least this movie has the ability to humanize it and make us empathize with someone we've been taught to hate.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman directs the satire THANK YOU FOR SMOKING. This movie isn't worthy of blockbuster status, but is definitely one you should check out. The cast is great, the style is addicting, and the message of the movie, is, well I'm not sure.<br /><br />Smoking is an incredibly political issue now. Politicians have to have the cigarrette industry to make money. They can talk all they want about how bad they are, but if Big Tobacco goes out of business, then the politcians lose billions of dollars. I think the movie hits its mark pointing out the hipocracy of the critics of industries that take the place of personal responsibility. This movie is based on a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative men in US history.<br /><br />The movie stars Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor, the incredibly suave lobbyist for Big Tobacco. His job is to fight the spin that tobacco is bad for you, and he does a great job. Some of the finest scenes are his lunch meeting with fellow lobbyists from Alcohol and Firearms. The movie gets its heart because if Nick's son. Nick struggles with the life he leads and tries to reconcile it with the impression he is leaving his son.<br /><br />If you enjoy smart, intelligent movies, then I urge your to check this one out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Thank You for Smoking, 2006 film<br /><br />The film opens on a TV show with Joan Lunden. A 15-year old was diagnosed with cancer. Neil Naylor, a lobbyist for a tobacco company, is one of the guests. Twelve hundred people die each day from smoking tobacco. Is there a link between nicotine and cancer? [No, it's the tars and residue from the smoke.] Naylor is a "spin doctor", an advocate for his cause. Watch him work! The "St. Euthanasius" school? Lobbyists talk for living. People who tell you what to do and what to think (like newspaper columnists). "Challenging authority"? Does an "endless appeals system" make our government the greatest? Can it be proved? "If you argue correctly you are never wrong." [Can that be proven?] "That was unnecessary." Do movies sell cigarettes? [Yes.]<br /><br />Senator Ortolan Finisterre is from Vermont, he is against smoking. Big Tobacco hopes to put cigarettes in all the movies, like in the past. The conversation is comically cynical. "What motivates you?" "Population control." "California is not a safe place." Jeff McGall is a power in Hollywood. He has ideas for cigarettes. [Are multinational corporations like child murderers?] Naylor has to deliver a suitcase full of money to a man in Southern California. "Let's talk." The talk is funny. "How did you know he'd take the money?" One man calls in a threat to Naylor. What will he do? Terrorists kidnap Naylor in broad daylight from a street in Washington! Where is Homeland Security? He wakes up in a hospital. "Cigarettes saved your life." But he must quit cigarettes. "Nicotine patches are deadly." Public sympathy is on Naylor's side now. Reporter Heather Holloway has a story on Naylor: he is doing it for the money. Bad publicity! Naylor is fired because of this scandal. He is going downhill. Joey cheers him up.<br /><br />Naylor has new ideas. He has a press conference to say he will testify at the Senate Hearing. Naylor proclaims the dangers of cholesterol from the cheese of Vermont! His advocacy of "personal choice" and individual freedom trumps the idea of a skull and crossbones on each pack of cigarettes. He will be rehired as a lobbyist now. Or will he? The last scenes show what happened to the other people. "There is no direct evidence that links cell phone usage to brain cancer." [But they carry this warning label in Europe!]<br /><br />I suspect the book was better than this film. It is funny in spots as a satiric comment on advertising in society. But the humor requires a point of view to agree with the story. This film is clever in presenting situations that are ambiguous so it plays to both points of view. Big Tobacco and its lobbyists are the heroes, a Senator from Vermont is the villain. Isn't that too perverse?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>You might mistake this for an anti-smoking propaganda movie, and there is just a little of that. But this is really about modern spin and how it's taken over every issue in society, making it difficult to filter out fact from fiction. This is unexpectedly entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Aaron Eckhart made his first vivid big-screen impression as the misogynistic Chad in Neil LaBute's scathing 1997 "In the Company of Men". Since then, he has been waffling in leading man roles, but luckily, he comes back to form as the appropriately named Nick Naylor, tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire, in first-time director/writer Jason Reitman's wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills. The film's perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters morally ambiguous, but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors. The zigzag plot follows Nick from the bogus, cigarette company-funded Academy of Tobacco Studies to the pretentiously Zen office of an equally pretentious Hollywood Studio mogul to a dicey encounter with a former Marlboro man to the welcoming arms of an ambitious reporter. The unpredictable journey provides Reitman an opportunity for both broad, whack-a-mole comedy to piercing, observant zingers that resonate with the truths they expose.<br /><br />Reitman has recruited a first-class cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by Eckhart, who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable. At their favorite watering hole, Nick's two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by David Koechner as the Bush-sound-alike firearms specialist and especially the wondrous Maria Bello as the sharp-tongued alcohol representative. There are also inspired turns from very unlikely sources with Rob Lowe hilarious as Jeff Megall, the honey-voiced, Asia-obsessed mogul; Sam Elliott defiantly cagey as the Marlboro Man; and even Katie Holmes surprisingly convincing as Heather Holloway, the morally bankrupt reporter who appears to be Nick's kindred spirit. Scene stealing is quite democratic with clever turns by Robert Duvall as the tobacco kingpin; William H. Macy as the unctuous, anti-tobacco senator from Vermont looking to put a skull-and-crossbones logo on all packs of cigarettes; J.K. Simmons as Nick's immoral boss BR; and a very funny Adam Brody as Megall's obnoxious assistant.<br /><br />Beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits, the plot goes in unexpected directions, and while the ending is a bit soft, the overall movie more than satisfies. In fact, I doubt if I have laughed harder in a movie theater since last year's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin", but the smart, provocative barbs really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful to the audience. Even the comparatively soft-centered scenes of Nick with his son have a nice edge, and with his translucent blue eyes, Cameron Bright strikes the right, non-judgmental notes as Joey. Reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most Capra-esque situation. This one is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Nick Taylor (Aaron Eckart)makes his living by using smoke and mirrors to sell the following concepts-Smoking. It's evil. It kills. Everything kills. It's not smoking that kills. It's people killing people by making the choice to smoke. It's all about choices. Your choice, my choice everyone's choice smoking is a choice just like driving, deciding to get out of bed and having a mammogram. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) makes a living using this type of logic (and debating with little girls among others) and justifying the existence and use of cigarettes by everyone. He's a lobbyist. He's there to argue that common sense and decency are malleable. He works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies where most of the studies about smoking goes on. That's like letting companies dictate the studies that should be done about their medication; they'll always design the studies to the best effect for the company. Nick uses the same arguments that Captains of Industry use to excuse gouging you for gas, medicine and any other essentials in life. Naylor and his friends (The MOD Squad or merchants of death) justify their existence by protecting the corporations of the world via spin. The spin suddenly changes when he becomes more than hated but a target and has to examine his core values.<br /><br />Brilliantly acted, scripted and directed by Jason Reitman the film brilliantly captures Christopher Buckley's book without being too literal. "Thank You for Smoking" features perfect casting as well. Aaron Eckhart is probably our most underrated actor. He's brilliant at playing confident and conflicted equally well.<br /><br />It's a marvelous film.<br /><br />Some of the special features are cooler than what you'll find in a carton of Kool; We get a feature length commentary one with Jason Reitman solo and a second with the director and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. There are also deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman. "The Charlie Rose Show" episode featuring Buckley, producer David Sax, Aaron Eckhart and director Reit man discussing the challenges of translating Buckley's novel to the screen also appears.<br /><br />"Unfiltered Comedy" is a making of featurette with the standard clips and talking heads but it's the comments that make it worthwhile to watch. "America: Living in Spin" features plenty of clips from the film along with cast and crew discussing the world of spin that we live in where everything bad can be good. We also get a trio of galleries including poster art, behind-the-scenes stills and a storyboard which focuses on the first 15 minutes of the film. From the storyboard it looks to me like they were originally aiming for Oprah for the talk show. We wind things up with the theatrical trailer and a promo spot for the inspired soundtrack.<br /><br /> A very funny book gets a very funny cinematic translation to the screen. I had hesitation going into this only because I felt that Reitman might ruin it because while it may be his eighth film as director it's the first major feature film that he's done.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The Merchants of Death, the MOD Squad, meet weekly in a bar for mutual support and to share tales of weal and woe. The Mod Squad consists of three spin masters, one each for the tobacco, alcohol and gun industries. We fallow Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart who is the Spin King of the Tobacco Industry. Nick is great at what he does, and that is talk, or shall we say spin. He does damage control and promotes the tobacco industries. No matter what is thrown at him and regardless of how bad the allegation, Nick is able to make tobacco come out looking like the good guy to his audience.<br /><br />Nick Naylor does not know the meaning of the word ethics, and won't let them get in the way of his arguments or our laughs. He weaves his way with twisted phrases and the ridiculous spin; you cannot help but laugh, even when you know you shouldn't. He does le his guard down and lets a reporter, played by Katie Holmes, get to close too him and shares too much information with her which she publishes. The only time you see that Nick may have a heart is when he sees that his 12-year old son is starting to follow in his foot steps and spins things to get his way, even his own mother.<br /><br />This film will have you laughing out loud and though you do not want to, you will be rooting for Nick Naylor. What this movie shows is that all large industries that have the probability of bad press will have spin masters. And we know politicians use them as well. So take a comedic look at how they work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>corporations & thier lackeys, the lobbyists, are the good guys. The anti-smoking groups & individuals are evil & stupid. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a a pleasant, likeable guy. He has a gift of gab. He's a very good father & has b.s. to burn. Important to note. He loves his son & respects him as a person. His son an intelligent but quiet, reclusive child responds to the attention. Nick promotes the use of cigarettes or as he points out the promotion of free choice. His boss in this movie, says "they're cool they're available & they're addictive, they should sell themselves". Well, almost. An actual cigarette executive quote was, "Our future customers are poor, young, black & stupid".  Nick's life is threatened & he is almost killed in an unusaul way. He is kidnapped & literally, covered with nicotine patches, almost dying from an overdose. He recovers but is not longer allowed to smoke for health reasons. He becomes a sympathetic victim. The underlying message is, free choice, an idea that resonates well as a very American value. Lots of bit parts to go around: William Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes & more. The dvd extras on the copy I viewed were excellent. A Charlie Rose Show with all the principals (writer, producer, director & star) was very worthwhile. Deleted scenes  were shown with an explanation why they were deleted. I thought that they did a very good job editing them out.

I'm sure you've heard that it's a satire of the tobacco industry, in which a "spokesperson" for big tobacco (played by Aaron Eckhart) twists the words of others, scoffs at science and shows not a whiff of conscience.  He appears on talk shows and wins over skeptical audiences.  He's constantly spinning the truth, always grabbing at a chance to defend cigarettes and smokers.  He's very good at his job...mostly because he's VERY likeable.<br /><br />The fun thing about the film is that Eckhart makes his character sympathetic.  His nerve is flabbergasting and admirable (while he spouts the most ridiculous things, he oozes sincerity.  We know he doesn't believe his spiel, but he sure sells it).  He has a great relationship with his teenage son.  He's whip-smart.  He's funny, but not unbelievably so.<br /><br />The movie is a satire of many things.  Some of the best jabs are taken at the expense of "big" Hollywood, personified by Rob Lowe as a movie-mogul in a kimono, who helps Eckhart seal a deal on some product-placement in a big-budget sci-fi movie.  Lowe is priceless...just seeing him brings on laughs.  It also satirizes "Birkenstock-wearing" liberal politicians (embodied in William Macy).  There are jabs at the alcohol and gun industries.  It's really more about now brazenly industries, politicians, Hollywood, individuals (you name it) will spin lies into truth to help their causes.<br /><br />If you like satires, this will be a treat...whether you smoke or not.  And the movie has moments of real power (the scenes when Eckhart approaches a dying Marlboro Man [wonderful Sam Elliott] with what amounts to a bribe is chilling), plus moments of warmth...such as the scenes between Eckhart and his son, who is trying to get a handle on what dad does for a living.<br /><br />Everyone is great.  J.K. Simmons (a real favorite of mine) doing a spin on his character from Spiderman...just better.  Robert Duvall in a small but fun role.  Katie Holmes.  Maria Bello.  William Macy.  Cameron Bright. Sam Ellliott.  And especially Eckhart, who has found a perfect role.  While he was brilliant in IN THE COMPANY OF MEN...he was also VERY easy to despise.  Here, while his character's actions are quite despicable...he is charming, handsome, smart, well-dressed and vulnerable.  I hope people see the film and start appreciating this guy more.<br /><br />It wasn't a often a laugh-out-loud film.  It's humor evokes smiles, chuckles and knowing "ah-ha's."  There's no slapstick.  But there is the pleasant feeling throughout that you are in the hands of skillful artists who are making a point while thoroughly entertaining you.  I highly recommend the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>Based on a best-selling 'insider' novel of the same name, this film examines how the multi-million dollar tobacco industry promises one thing to the public and then privately does another.<br /><br />People who would be 'crying foul' with almost any other industry are actually convinced the tobacco industry is on their side. It is an unspoken truth that Big Tobacco's 'anti-smoking' initiatives are actually enticing kids to try--and become hooked on their products. Constantly producing a new generation of consumers (especially important when you are producing a product whose only result is to kill people!) is very important for this industry.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, Vice President of and the chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, a tobacco lobby funded by cigarette companies to "research" the links between smoking cigarettes and health. Naturally because this is an in-industry organization, no links are ever made--and his other job requires him to defend 'smokers rights'.<br /><br />After a 'skull and crossbones' bill is proposed, Nick suggests that Hollywood do their part to publicize smoking again, people seeing their favorite stars light up will think it is 'cool'. The dichotomy between this, his membership in the self-referenced Merchants Of Death (M.O.D. Squad) and then attempts to build a loving relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright) are wide. He is not a moral man, but Naylor is not subhuman scum either.<br /><br />Other powerful performances are delivered by Katie Holmes. She plays investigative reporter Heather Holloway, skeptical of M.O.D. Squad. An article she writes ultimately allows Nick to really light up his son's life.<br /><br /> Everybody needs to see this film at least once if they want to understand the full power of marketing upon the human psyche and the political power of effective advertising. This film isn't an anti or pro-smoking diatribe so much as an examination of industry marketing techniques with the industry being examined just happening to be tobacco.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Thank You for Smoking sheds light (as it should do) on several important matters, including: how powerful the Tobacco giants and their associate companies have become, the health hazards associated with cigarette smoking, the power of the media, and the hypocrisy of so many who oppose tobacco.<br />The film brings to the screen the story of Nick Naylor, a spin-doctor, as he travels with his 12-year-old son across the country showing him what he does for a living.<br />Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duvall, J.K.

It's original, quirky and funny.  An unusual mix in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />The essence of the film is the story of Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart.  He is a lobbyist for big tobacco.  Typically, such a person is to be reviled.  We all know that smoking is not good for your health.  So, how can anyone defend the indefensible?  Well, Nick does it with humour and he does a good job of it.  Nick is a man of great charisma notwithstanding the fact that his bosses are deemed by many to be the devil incarnate.<br /><br />If this film has a message it is that tolerance still has a place in our society.  All too often, individuals and groups think it is there right to impose their values on others.  Think not just tobacco, but anti-alcohol lobbyists, Christian vigilantes and environmentalists.  The list is almost endless.  These people think they know what is good for you even if you apparently don't.  To question these zealots is to leave oneself open to attack.  Only they know what is good for you and society.  There opinion matters.  Your opinion is of no value.<br /><br />"Thank You for Smoking" is not an excuse for smoking.  Rather it is a black comedy about those who strive to make decisions for you.  The plot is quick paced and the acting is wonderful.  Eckhart is supported by Maria Bello as a liquor industry lobbyist and David Koechner as spokesman for the firearms industry.  Together they are "merchants of death".  They are also a very clever trio that works well as a unit.<br /><br />I'm sure the self-righteous amongst us will condemn this film.  Too bad!  Life entails risks that we can determine for ourselves.  This film is a breath of fresh air!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Once in a while a movie comes along that totally tears apart the society that spawned it thru the use of wit, irony, sarcasm and pointed remarks.  This comedy is one of these movies.  The movie revolves around the life and career of Nick Naylor, PR person for Big Tobacco, and begins with him taking on and taking out his political opponents live on a national talk show.  We then come to see him comment and explain his work to his son, his son's classmates, his counterparts in the alcohol and firearms industries, his boss, and unfortunately for him, an investigative reporter with a knack for twisting words every bit as much as him.  Put together, we see the tobacco industry and the PR industry stood on its head and examined from the top down.<br /><br />Though smooth, ironies abound in the life of Nick.  First, his ex-wife is now married to a doctor who hates smoking.  Second, his opponents in the health care industry and Congress actually make him invaluable to Big Tobacco by their efforts to limit smoking.  Third, he uses the most roundabout reverse psychology possible to bribe an ex-smoker into keeping mum about the hazards of tobacco use.  Watching the movie from beginning to end, and seeing how the foes and friends of tobacco act, we get an interesting, and funny, examination of American society.  All in all, a great movie.  It is rated R for sex scenes between the protagonist and Katie Holmes' character, but nothing is shown so the movie is appropriate for anyone in their teens and older.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>This is a great film.  By placing ethical and political dilemmas in pure and absolute "win-lose" terms, Chirstopher Buckley forced us to see clearly that our systems of justice and democracy demand forceful, effective advocacy.  If this makes us squirm with righteous indignation, well, then we should try to make a different system - and so far, no one has.<br /><br />Demagoguery can be found on any side of any issue.  If this movie draws a moral line, it is around how loyal a boss needs to be with a high-performing subordinate.  I found is fascinating that even the main character, himself, would fairly conclude that his employer had no option but to fire him for what he did.  Yet, from a moral/dramatic view, we must side with him when he "pays back" his former employer.<br /><br />It's complicated and I don't want to spoil the movie by revealing plot, etc.  However, you'll have a great, if unsettled, time watching it.  And the acting is great!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor (Eckhart) works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies as a spin doctor.  He is their primary weapon in defense of Big Tobacco, and that is not an easy job.  Bribing the cancer stricken Marlboro Man (Elliot), making smoking sexy in movies, and spinning an expose about him are all on his agenda.  Through it all, he has to baby sit his son (Bright) and show him what dad does for a living.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" is a funny, edgy movie.  Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the somewhat soulless Naylor.  His reasoning will make you cringe, but he is hard to argue with.  The supporting cast is star studded, and all the actors do a solid job.  Those on both sides of the smoking issue can enjoy this movie as well, and that is perhaps the most impressive trick that the movie pulls off.  If you are looking for a thought provoking, funny movie, this one is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AF3X7J0XC391L.html">AF3X7J0XC391L</a><br/><p>Perhaps my expectations were too high but it was not nearly as funny as I was expecting it to be.  At first the story was funny but then it was like an old joke that keeps getting repeated until it is too worn out to be funny any longer.  A good idea, perhaps, but not quite as good as I had expected or as good as it might have been.  Still, it was good for a mild chuckle from time to time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Thank You For Smoking is one of those few dark comedies that truly had me laughing all the way; and I can't remember how long it's been since I laughed so much watching a movie! The lines are funny; the acting is convincing and the movie manages to make a great point about "spin" (aka bulls***) in today's world.<br /><br />The action begins with tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) appearing on a talk show to put a spin on the fact the smoking causes cancer. Nick, smirking all the way, says that the tobacco companies want a boy with cancer to live so they could keep another customer. Nick argues further that health officials would love to see the young "cancer boy" die so their budgets would be fatter. This is just the tip of the iceberg, folks; Nick goes through his whole life putting a spin on tobacco to make it seem safe, romantic and glorious.<br /><br />Nick's partners in crime include two people he meets for lunch from time to time; and they call themselves "The Mod Squad." Look for great performances by Maria Bello as Polly Bailey and David Koechner as Bobby Jay Bliss who work for the alcohol and gun lobbies respectively. Nick's slave driving boss, B.R. (J.K. Simmons) puts in a great performance and the head honcho of the tobacco group, simply referred to as "Captain," is played wonderfully by Robert Duvall.<br /><br />Nick's personal life isn't peachy--he's separated from his wife. When a seductive female reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) gets the real scoop on Nick's secrets and lets it all out in a tell-all article in a prominent Washington, D.C. newspaper, Nick's world comes crashing down around him.<br /><br />Will Nick be able to bounce back from the negative publicity he gets? Will he keep his friends and his job? What will his young, impressionable son Joey (Cameron Bright) think of him when the whole truth comes out? Watch the movie to find out these answers and more, folks--there are no spoilers here!<br /><br />The DVD comes with a plethora of extras. We get an interview with Aaron Eckhart and others on The Charlie Rose Show; there are quite a few deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; there's a brief "making of" featurette; a director and cast commentary; storyboard and more! I am very impressed.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend Thank You For Smoking for people who enjoy indie movies that are really funny and try to playfully make a point at the same time. You'll notice that no one in the film is ever filmed smoking a cigarette! However, this is not a family movie; there is a fair amount of swearing and there are some violent scenes that could upset small children. (The kidnapping scene is one of them; but I won't say much more to save the juicy plot for you.)<br /><br />Now THAT'S what I call a great flick!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor: Right there, looking into Joey's eyes, it all came back in a rush. Why I do what I do. Defending the defenseless, protecting the disenfranchised corporations that have been abandoned by their very own consumers: the logger, the sweatshop foreman, the oil driller, the land mine developer, the baby seal poacher...<br />Polly Bailey: Baby seal poacher?<br /><br />Dr Spin meets Dr Alcohol and Dr Gun, three spin doctors, 'MOD Squad' (Merchants of Death), who meet weekly to discuss their woes, a support group of sorts.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor is the Dr of Nicotine, spinning the web for his company. He is good at what he does, and what he does is talk> He can spin anything. "It's really about the Age of Spin, where with the right TV spokesperson even Adolph Hitler might come off as a misunderstood individual."  Christopher Buckley wrote the novel, and irony outdoes irony in this flick. What greater good for mankind than to lobby for the cigarette industry, of which up to 1200 Americans die daily.<br /><br />The supporting cast is fabulous. Kim Dickens is his ex-wife, who is trying to protect their son, played by Cameron Bright, from the evils of Dr Spin. Nick Naylor is led by something other than common sense when he takes up with a writer/reporter, Katie Holmes. He spills his secrets which are duly reported. Nick's boss, Robert Duvall, wants him to go to Hollywood and engage the Hollywood crowd in smoking in the movies for big money. He meets 'The Marlboro Man' and soon the man has taken his money. Nick takes his son to Hollywood and does his job. He meets super agent Rob Lowe, who is very funny in this movie and disguised as an Asian soothsayer. All the while Nick is trying to show his son that you can do this kind of job and maintains a semblance of order. A kidnapping and court appearance showcase Nick Naylor's expertise. Aaron Eckhart is a smooth charming character and delivers this film. In the end, however, Nick Naylor pays the right price.<br /><br />"Another plus: Ethics never get in the way of the jokes. Both sides of the political fence will feel royally skewered. All that's lacking is a warning from the Surgeon General: This film will make you laugh till it hurts." Peter Travers<br /><br />This is a laugh out loud film if you are rooting for Nick Naylor. The tobacco business does not take the fall, all corporations and spin misters are involved.  Highly recommended. prisrob 11/26.06</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>George S. Kaufman once said, "Satire is what closes on Saturday night," and Hollywood has pretty much heeded that advice ever since. There are few political satires that come out of La-La Land, and even fewer--"Dr. Strangelove" comes to mind--that are commercially successful. This is why Jason Reitman's "Thank You for Smoking," based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, is so welcome. Particularly in today's poisonous political atmosphere, it is wonderful and refreshing to see a movie that is so clever, so witty, and so worldly-wise about America's true national sport--spin-doctoring--and how all sides play it to their advantage. Aaron Eckhart is wonderfully sleazy as Nick Naylor, a hired gun for the tobacco industry who delights in unleashing his brilliant verbiage in the service of making anti-smoking advocates look like the Gestapo. Only occasionally--such as when he's with his young son (Cameron Bright)--does Nick feel any twinges of conscience about using his talents in order to persuade people to suck poison down their lungs. But then again, Nick is positively cuddly compared with some of his adversaries, such as backstabbing reporter Heather Hathaway (Katie Holmes) and self-righteous Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), whose crunchy-granola politics mask the heart of a ruthless political hatchetman. "Thank You for Smoking" is stuffed with excellent comic performances, including Maria Bello and David Koechner as Nick's fellow spin doctors in the alcohol and firearms industries; J.K. Simmons as Nick's treacherous, blowhard boss; Rob Lowe and Adam Brody as a couple of flaky, motormouthed Hollywood egomaniacs; and especially the great Robert Duvall as "The Colonel," a courtly throwback to the time when Big Tobacco was King. For lovers of cinematic sarcasm, "Thank You for Smoking" is a welcome breath of smoky, mentholated, nicotine-tinged air.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Here's a good example of how smart, literary satire doesn't translate well onto the screen.  Thank You For Smoking does have some big laughs, but it just doesn't hang together as a movie.  The titles are extremely good - and it does contain one high concept joke - no one is actually ever seen smoking a cigarette throughout the entire picture.  But film is a "show me don't tell me" medium, and Nick's tiresome monologues, required to set up point of view and plot turns, show the fingerprints of a director with young and heavy hands.<br /><br />What this film does get right is the pitch; cynicism is rampant and shows up consistently, there are no heroes.  Robe Lowe is perfectly cast as the completely soul-less super-agent, and the brief moments his assistant spends on screen are memorable.  The reliable Sam Elliott is note perfect - his moral outrage quivers visibly with the proximity of cash.  Robert Duvall, who by now could mail in a performance like this, is very comfortable as the "Captain" - tobacco industry ruler - and even seems to exhibit some remorse at the idea of killing his grand-daughter.  J.K. Simmons - a consistently excellent actor - is outstanding as BR, our protagonist's ruthless boss who pretty much epitomizes opportunism.  Katie Holmes as Heather Holloway is enchanting as she steals our hope that the fourth estate might be on a morally higher plane than everyone else in the miasma.<br /><br />The kidnapping episode, the book's lynch pin, is used, but abused, it seems to drop out of the air then conveniently disappear.  But that's not the film's overriding problem.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick is winning, but completely uninteresting.  Any engaging substance this film might have generated would have come from Nick's personality, and inner struggle with the facile way he bends truth.  Since we never see anything remotely resembling a personality, we can't like him or dislike him, we just look at him as a hideous reflection of what we've become, a symbol of the manipulative and disingenuous forces surrounding us.  For Nick, and for everyone here, truth isn't even an issue anymore; the issue is, what is sell-able?  It's an accurate social observation that would have made a good essay, did make a good book, and didn't make a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>The fact that this film saw the light of day in our society where smoking more and more becomes somewhat a taboo is already a miracle and a merit of its creators. This movie should have been done especially after Michael Mann's The Insider, just to show us the "other side", to hear arguments of the people who have a right to be heard as everyone else in any free country. And in its cynicism and recklessness Thank You For Smoking came out to be extremely ruffian-like and hilarious as for example People VS Larry Flynt or Private Parts. You can't resist admiring this picture as girls usually can't resist bad guys' charm. What's even more preposterous and outrageous, but inevitable I guess, is that you feel empathy for Aaron Eckhart's character, a character who earns money by persuading people into smoking, who profits from others' misery if you will. You like his character. I just loved him! He is smart enough to prove his point even if he's wrong, more than that - he's smart enough to persuade people to do something they absolutely don't need to do. He's the ultimate puppeteer, a Dr. Evil. You'll ask how it is possible to admire such person? But see, he doesn't put cigarettes into anyone's mouth, people do it themselves, and only they are to blame. We usually tend to blame everyone else in our misfortune, but it's us and only us who is responsible. I smoke myself, but if I get ill of it I'll never start blaming a tobacco industry - I have my own head on my shoulders to make decisions. In another words if people are fools it's nobody's fault except their own. And if you can manupulate people with a spoken word you're a genious, and I personally admire such persons. And this film is not about proving the point that smoking is good, Aaron Eckhart's character says himself he doesn't think smoking is good, he just thinks everybody is entitled to his own opinion and has a right to share it with others. It's parents' and schools' business to educate and teach to distinguish right from wrong.<br /><br />There was only one thing that seemed strange at first glance in this film. Just imagine - it's a movie about smoking, but there's no single person smoking on screen throughout the entire picture! Was that an attempt to make the flick politically correct or director Jason Reitman's deliberate concept? I think it's rather the second, and if it's really like this it's extremely funny. I also had a feeling about the film trying to seem politically correct, when Aaron Eckhart's character quit his job as a tobacco lobbyist in the end. But moments later we see him explaining to some executives in a mobile phones company there is no evidence phones cause brain tumor. Long live the cynicism!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman may have gotten into movies via nepotism (his dad is Ivan Retiman of "Ghostbusters" fame), but with "Thank You for Smoking," he proves that he belongs in the game.  This is one of the smartest, funniest satires in years.<br /><br />Two things make the movie work.  The first is Reitman's restraint.  This is a movie about smoking, and yet we don't get any of the obvious scenes of people miserably puffing away on cigarettes, slowly killing themselves for our amusement.  Instead, nobody really smokes in the movie - the best humor in this situation, lies in America's hypocrisy about smoking rather than the act of smoking itself.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" examines the ludicrous truth that one of America's most profitable industries essentially kills 1,200 people a day.  And why does it do so?  For several reasons, but mainly because Americans are sheep willing to be sheared, so long as we are told what we want to hear.<br /><br />Enter Nick Naylor, played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart ("In the Company of Men," "Erin Brockavich").  Naylor is head spokesman for the tobacco industry, and he was born to do it.  The self-proclaimed Michael Jordan of spin can go onto a TV talk show, face an audience of sanctimonious nitwits who want nothing more than to boo the evil tobacco industry, and walk off the stage having received the handshake of a teenaged lung cancer victim and also having created the impression that the tobacco industry cares more about its customers' lives than the public interest groups who merely want a martyr.<br /><br />Naylor is riding high, and becomes the heir apparent to the Colonel (Robert Duvall), Mr. Big in Big Tobacco.  Naylor goes to Hollywood to negotiate with Mr. Hollywood (Rob Lowe) about getting cigarettes back into movies.  Naylor does this while lunching with fellow MOD Squad ("Merchant of Death") members, lobbyists representing alcohol and firearms, and trying to educate his son about what is great about America.  Our greatness boils down to two things, Naylor tells his son - our endless appeals system, and the fact that if you can argue correctly, you are never wrong.<br /><br />Eckhart nails this role (pardon the pun).  What makes this a great performance is that Eckhart does not play Naylor as a true believer, either in tobacco or the morality of the game he plays.  He is just very, very good at his job, and he's got a mortgage.  "99% of what goes on in the world, for good or evil, is motivated by the fact that people have to pay the mortgage."<br /><br />Naylor's life takes a sudden turn south as he is (a) threatened with murder (and there is something about the threat that makes it realistic) and (b) starts sleeping with a probing journalist (Katie Holmes), when he should know better than nothing will be 'off the record.'  But these two scenarios merely create a higher wire for our acrobatic hero to negotiate, and he does so with style and panache.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" may make you shift uncomfortably in your seat a few times, but it will make you laugh a heck of a lot more.  And, rarest of all for movies these days, it will make you think.  What a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>It would be difficult to live up to the hype I heard about this film, and in fact, the movie does not quite rise, in my opinion, to the estatic reviews I read several months ago when it was on the big screen in big cities. There are indeed some big laughs, and many smiles and smirks generated by the cynical story line: honorable man, good dad, makes a living shilling for a horrid product. Along the way he meets and beds a dishonorable reporter, confronts and bests sleazy talk show hosts and Congressmen, and tries to balance loving his son with a public promise to "buy him his first pack of cigarettes when he turns 18 if he wants them." It was an interesting choice for the film's creators to try to humanize a tobacco lobbyist, and in my view, they succeeded at that. Despite despising the product he promotes, I had to root for Nick to prevail in his various trials. If there could exist such a compliment as "At least he is honestly dishonest" Nick would have earned it. Worth seeing for its twisted heroes and villains and smart writing, yet not quite the dark comic masterpiece it might have been.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"Thank you for smoking", directed by Jason Reitman, is a wonderful satirical comedy that is likely to offend some people, but that is nonetheless witty and entertaining. If you merely want to watch a feel-good film, I strongly urge you to avoid this dvd. On the other hand, if you are eager to think a little bit more, and don't mind a sometimes acerbic sense of humour, this is the right movie for you.<br /><br />The main character is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist and spokesman for the American tobacco industry that is a master of media spinning and doublespeak, and that is glad of having "a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people". Nick has a son, Joey, and thus has to try to be a role model to him, despite his polemic job. That is specially difficult after a beautiful reporter (Katie Holmes) with whom he had an affair betrays his trust, writing a tell-all article about him.<br /><br />It is pretty interesting to watch Nick as he twists logic in order to defend the right of everybody to smoke, saying that has to do with freedom of choice. In his words, "that's the beauty of arguing, because if you argue correctly you are never wrong". This film has fictional characters, but is also based on some real facts, something that makes it specially interesting. From my point of view, "Thank you for smoking" is a caustic and ironic film, but also a must see for everybody that is interested in the power of words.

Immigration, for example. Or health care. Or foreign policy. To sit in on a round of this debate is to inhabit a world where, according to the affirmative team, the apocalypse is imminent if the plan is not adopted, and, according to the negative team, apocalypse is imminent if it is. And the kids speed spit the words auctioneer-style, the better to overwhelm the opponent with evidence, arguments, subpoints. A judge has to sort it all out, take on faith that the evidence says what the kids says it does, and tab a victor.<br /><br />A lot of Washington lobbyists cut their teeth on this stuff, as do media pundits, lawyers, and GOP strategists named Karl Rove. Policy debate teaches a variant of the Michael Corleone philosophy: You can convince anyone of anything. Considering we live in an America that cuts taxes during a war we must win for our survival - but must also be won without a draft - well, this is a pretty true and murderous thing.<br /><br />So "Thank You For Smoking," a clever satire about tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) just isn't sobering enough. It's engaging intellectually - enough so to recommend it - it's very funny, snarky, at times thoughtful. But writer-director Jason Reitman - son of 80s comedy icon Ivan Reitman - is comfortable right there. It's a solid debut, but he never lingers too greatly on Nick's life as a tool. Working from Christopher Buckley's novel, the movie puts Nick in a few tight spots and gives him pause, but its final scenes either reward Nick for his fraudulence or advance some libertarian philosophy not previously articulated. Nick may wiggle away to jerk chains for another focus group - but he's just running another hamster wheel.<br /><br />The lead lobbyist for an "institute of tobacco studies," Nick is charged with insisting cigarettes are safe - he presents "facts" on talk shows and in congressional hearings - and fun, which he intends to do by partnering with a Hollywood agent/producer (Rob Lowe). He also has to pay off a former cigarette pitchman (Sam Elliott) dying of cancer while bedding an agenda-driven magazine reporter (Katie Holmes), which he fits around weekly lunches with The Merchants of Death, his lobbying pals from the alcohol and firearms industry. Nick's inquisitive son (Cameron Bright) is stuffed into several scenes as minor conscience, but mostly as a prompt for Nick's monologues about the American Way. And then there's a bizarre, left-field sequence that gives Nick a taste of the opposition and his own product.<br /><br />There's a lot happening, and a lot of faces for Nick to wear. But Eckhart nails it. Maybe too well - he's too likable and having too good a time. Unlike Eckhart's attractive-yet-amoral persona in "In the Company of Men," Nick wears his burdens lightly, convinced his smooth resourcefulness can slip him out of jams. And it does, including a moment in which he's asked a question that any parent would answer one way, except Nick. Reitman's handling of this scene suggests he has a greater affinity for his lead than a sense for how pitiful it is to lie out of integrity for a faulty position. Reitman depicts of Holmes' character cynically too; reporters may not have scruples, but they have more savvy than this.<br /><br />We're left with a distinct, original portrait of America that preaches moral equivalency years after the Big Tobacco question has been answered. A smarter movie than "Thank You for Smoking" doesn't pretend Nick got out just before the roof caved in, but shows a tobacco lobbyist in post-lawsuit era free to admit cigarettes kill to a nation happy to smoke anyway. I'm looking at a courtyard full of smokers right now, who will return to work in 10 minutes to pass another wave of smokers. Few of them<br /><br />- maybe none of them - will see this movie. What Jason Reitman and Nick Naylor do, the nicotine does so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>This has been described as a "razor sharp" satire. It isn't. The main character is a tobacco company lobbyist who defends tobacco interests. The problem here is that we knew that these guys were weasels over forty years ago - this is hardly cutting edge material. Many, many obvious jabs at this type are made. This film will only be an eye opener to someone who has been in a coma for the last few decades. The ending, where the lead character feels some moral responsibility toward his son is phony. The movie spends most of its running time showing us how utterly amoral the character is. Are we really supposed to believe that he suddenly feels remorse because of his son? More likely (and I know this type), he would keep his son in the dark about the true nature of his work. Katie Holmes looks horrible here. She can't act, has bad skin, and seems badly miscast as the "hot" reporter who seduces the handsome Eckhart (you would think that the gorgeous Eckhart would have women lined up but he seems so desperate that he has to settle for the odd looking Holmes).</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY.html">A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY</a><br/><p>I'm kicking myself for not appreciating my high school and college lit courses until it was too late.  Because it seems like every time I go to the movies I remember back to one of the classics in literature that I callously never read.  It was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal I thought back on after finishing THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, because I now realize that modern satire is joke.<br /><br />Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt, In The Company of Men)  is as smooth as the cigarettes he's promoting.  As the main lobbyist for big tobacco, it's his job to look America in the eye and say "Want to smoke."  The film follows him as he convinces group after group that Big Tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains.  There are bumps along the way, including a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy), a nosy journalist (Katie Holmes), and a few attempts on his life.  But with some good old American B.S. he may just make it.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is an almost biting satire, it presents all the characters a great satire needs, and it's full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it.  But squanders them by playing too safe, by not taking sides, and by coping out at the last moment.  Great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical, psychological, or farcical bloodbath. Like in Swift's A Modest Proposal, where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism.  The hero of the story should be standing next to God, or burning in hell for his misdeeds.  THANK YOU FOR SMOKING just winks at you, provides a couple of laughs, and that's all.<br /><br />The major problem is that the screenplay, by Jason Reitman (who also directs), falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything.  That's would be fine, but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victory's seem paltry.  His Villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound.  Satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointless.<br /><br />As for the performances they just sit there.  No one is big enough.  That actors wander in and out of each scene, and the only one we really get to know is Nick.  But Nick is not that vulnerable, even when the script tries to paint him that way.  Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once.  Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.<br /><br />THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie.  It's pretty funny and  It's quite timely.  But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches.  I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Witty, sometimes laugh out loud funny, entertaining for sure, "Thank You for Smoking" could have been a lot more effective had it been a lot harder and more acidic in tone. For primo examples of this genre, think "Network" or "Wag the Dog," to which "Thank You" seems mild in comparison though there are several real positives about this film: for one the Nick Naylor of Aaron Eckhardt. As a spin-doctor for the Tobacco Industry, it is Nick's job to promote cigarette smoking in a world in which everyone mostly is against it...except of course, for those of us who smoke.<br /><br />Eckhart's Nick is quick talking, handsome: a man who can think on his feet. But director Jason Reitman has chosen to humanize Nick by making him a dedicated and concerned father which makes Nick a warm, caring human being, yes but it also saps his strength as basically an  s.o.b. There are no real heroes in Satire.<br /><br />With that said, some of the best scenes in "Thank You" are those between Nick and his son, Joey (Cameron Bright) and those between Nick and the M.O.D. (Masters of Destruction...Polly (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay (David Koechner) as fellow spin doctors for the Alcohol and Firearms industries.<br /><br />Unfortunately what "Thank You for Smoking" lacks is the steel backbone necessary to make it a complete success as Satire though it nonetheless offers some genuinely funny and intelligent moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>because it is on fire in my backyard!

Macy in another jewel of a role), ex-Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), and journalist Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). How he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story, a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the anti-smoking brigade.<br /><br />The lines are fast and furious and Eckhart is superb in his role. Somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between Eckhart and his son (Cameron Bright - as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today)  make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum, but that is Hollywood covering its tracks.  Not a great movie, but a movie that is much better than you would expect!  Grady Harp, October 06</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>The old saying is that satire is what closes on Saturday night, but I hope "Thank You For Smoking" belies the rule because we need all the wry and sardonic laughter we can get in these days of being squeezed by the religious Right on one hand and the politically correct Left on the other.<br /><br />Absolutely politically incorrect is Aaron Eckhart's fast-talking, unabashed, unrepentant Big Tobacco spokesman in this very funny film about lobbying, spin, and turning a few conventions on their head.  Eckhart's great charm and enthusiasm invigorates a story that may not be plot-heavy but is laced with wry observance and sharp asides, one-liners and telling character details.<br /><br />Fast and light on its feet, the film benefits by a first rate cast turning in nicely nuanced turns, and congratulations to Jason Reitman and his backers for keeping the film true to its vision and not allowing it to go soft and mushy or copping-out in any sense all the way to its conclusion.<br /><br />Amazingly, every once and awhile one of these films comes along that gets made the way it should, and is allowed to remain intact and un-Hollywoodized or otherwise reduced to mass comfortability.  This is one of those, and while it wears its cynicism lightly, it doesn't miss jabbing at the pomposity and hypocrisy found in Washington DC, Hollywood, the Media and the culture in general.  There are a lot of other targets out there that could use similar treatment.  Let's hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>So many critics heaped so much praise on this movie, I came to it with high expectations. But I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Its idea of making a lobbyist for a tobacco consortium the "hero" of the film held promise. This could have been an opportunity to satirize a lot of the political correctness that has been surrounding the whole subject of smoking and health and big business. But I don't think that promise was even remotely fulfilled in this film.<br /><br />What I saw was essentially (and no doubt inadvertently) just another dreary public service ad like the ones that lamely try to convince people not to smoke. The ads on TV pander to teens with slogans like "Smoking stinks" or "Smoking isn't cool."  In this movie the clich&eacute;d message is conveyed by having anyone who ever smoked die. The Marlboro Man, played here by Sam Elliott painted in embittered wasting purple hues - dies. When our lobbyist hero needs to talk to Mr. Big of the tobacco consortium, played by Robert Duvall, our hero can't because, of course, the Duvall character has - died.  I expected a lot more of this movie than such obvious lecturing.<br /><br />In addition to its overall failure though, I found this movie to be made up of many little failures. It's a series of non-sequiturs, loosely cobbled together.  The disconnect starts early with the lobbyist's opening monologue when he says, "Manson kills; I talk."<br /><br />Later, he gets kidnapped by some unidentified group, and is plastered over with nicotine patches. He survives this assault, but his system is left so compromised, he can never again take even one puff of a cigarette without risking death. I'm not aware of any medical consequence like that. Nevertheless, when he later defies Doctors' advice and takes a puff, he does pass out with near-fatal anoxia. This and a dozen other scenes are not funny exaggeration - they are simply ridiculous, random insertions.<br /><br />The writer's/director's lack of any coherent vision for this film becomes plainer yet if you watch the DVD extras, such as the deleted scenes. One of these shows the lobbyist coming down the steps of the Capitol after having delivered a rousing speech on freedom of choice before a Congressional Hearing Committee. As he pauses on the Capitol Building steps, his son (about 12-years-old?) takes a cigarette out of his pocket and starts to light up. His father, glancing over in alarm, slaps the cigarette out of the boy's hand. What was supposed to be the point of this scene - that the father is a hypocrite and is willing to override any "freedom of choice" argument when it comes to HIS son who is smoking? But why would such a young boy even be carrying cigarettes to such a formal occasion in the first place and why would he choose that most public moment to flaunt his smoking habit? It doesn't make sense! But the writer/director didn't axe this scene on the basis of logic. They say in their commentary that they loved the scene, but were forced to cut it simply for reasons of pacing.<br /><br />The DVD commentary overall reveals how flimsy and illogical this whole project was. That commentary degenerates into what is essentially just a round of good old boy jocularity and mutual admiration. The men involved in this project congratulate each other on every point. They praise the tricky brilliance of making the blinds in one scene into the shape of enlarged cigarettes. This touch is absolutely undetectable to the viewers, and would be meaningless even if evident.<br /><br />Then the actors and director repeatedly laud Christopher Buckley, who wrote the book on which this script is based. I can't help but think his father William's reputation for verbal cleverness got transferred to Christopher, unjustifiably at least in the case of this film. Because really, this movie is just blowing smoke.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>When he's not publicly advocating for the tobacco industry (a seemingly daunting task), lobbyist Nick Naylor (Eckhart) hangs at a D.C. tavern booth with two fellow "merchants of death," a firearms tout (Koechner) and alcohol spokeswoman (Bello). Friendly but competitive chats of this "M.O.D. Squad" often entail how many die annually from products they espouse, the point being: the more dangerous the product, the more lofty its spokesman's mission.<br /><br />Nick is fearless in his defense of Big Tobacco. On panel shows, he runs smoke rings around cancer patients, scientific studies and experts who declare that cigarettes are deadly. When tasked with increasing movie product placement to supplement his employers' new "smoking is cool" campaign, Nick takes his adoring 12-year-old son (Bright) along so he can watch daddy in action.<br /><br />Eventually, Big T's front man grows a conscience, albeit not a fully developed one. He grudgingly admits to the hazards of smoking but hedges by falling back on the right of ADULTS to choose and the personal responsibility this entails. The correct message is sent when a horrified Nick instinctively knocks a lit ciggie from his boy's mouth during an impromptu press conference.<br /><br />Of special note are Robert Duvall's amusing caricature of a tobacco company CEO, William H. Macy's virulently anti-smoking senator from Vermont, Rob Lowe as a kimono-clad Hollywood producer and Sam Elliott's cancer-stricken yet mercenary Marlboro Man. Snickering laughs and intelligent dialogue are plentiful in this well-paced film. It's a satire that skillfully walks a fine line, ultimately providing satisfaction to those on both sides of this hot button issue.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.8) Thank You For Smoking (2005)- Aaron Eckhart/Cameron Bright/Katie Holmes/William H.

Suckers who are willing to forgo every piece of information available as long as they have one person telling them what they want to believe is right, as long as it's what they want to hear. Into this void steps Nick Naylor (Adam Eckhart), a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, whose job is convincing everyone to take a rolled up tube of paper stuffed with carcinogens, set it on fire and suck the fumes into your body because you have the right to do so. Naylor is the best in the biz, making everyone around him take pratfalls while he tries to be a good dad to his precocious son (unfortunately a clich&eacute;d part, played up by Cameron Bright).<br /><br />While predominantly a satire on spin and the gullibility of consumers, "Thank You For Smoking" often misses the bulls-eye for the very thing its premise is based on: SPIN. No-one in the movie smokes. Even the wizened old Patriarch of the firm (played great by Robert Duvall) never lights one up, even as he tells everyone about his great discoveries. Naylor is momentarily seen fidgeting with an empty pack, but that's as close as it gets. It gets difficult to believe the bleating about being too PC when everyone in the film as politically correct as they can be. Even Katie Holmes, as a sleazy journalist, gets one-upped by the ever cunning Naylor.<br /><br />This is a deep and darkly funny film, but it just doesn't go far enough. The best film in this genre, the Political Satire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780622561">Wag the Dog</a>, both hit the funny bone and slugged your gut, while TYFS pulls the final punches after about 2/3's of the way in by taking away Naylor's smarminess and turning him into a Disney Dad. Satire can be outrageous, but there also has to be an endgame. The feel-good ending here seems tacked on rather than thought through. It was fun watching Nick spar with the hapless Senator (William H. Macy, delightful as always), but had his name been something less convoluted than Ortolan Finistirre, it might have been less of an obvious ploy. (Ooo look! All American Lobbyist takes on nerdy Gov-Wonk with dopey name!)<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" wussed out when it really could've taken the Spin-Zone to task. Otherwise, it might have been the dark comedy it wanted to be. By trying to have it both ways, however, it simply goes up in smoke.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>A dark comedy that pokes fun at the tobacco, gun and liquor industries. Specifically it focuses on the career of Nick Naylor. Naylor, played by Aaron Eckhart, is a single father who loves his job. He is a tobacco lobbyist slash "spin doctor" and his whole job is to make tobacco and cigarettes look good enough that people will buy them or at least not stop buying them.<br /><br />Eckhart delivers one laugh after another and keeps the film moving and entertaining. He also proves that anyone with the right charisma (and a good smile) can get away with anything. One of the funny things about this film is that there is virtually no smoking in the film.<br /><br />There are lots of guest appearances by actors such as Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody and many more that add to the entertainment value of the film. I think smokers and non-smokers will get a kick out of this political satire.<br /><br />Feature wise, there are a bunch of deleted scenes, the usually "commentary" options, an interview segment with the author, director and star of the film from Charlie Rose, and two documentaries on comedy. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Aaron Eckhart carries "Thank You for Smoking" with his witty edgy performance.  His teeth are all sunshine and front words that exist in a moral vacuum called the profit motive.  The film satirically highlights how profit motive must be tempered with service motive.  Eckhart is famous for his work with Neil La Bute such as "In the Company of Men."  He has also branched into other films like "Erin Brockovich" & "The Black Dahlia."  He deserved his Best Actor Golden Globe nomination for this film.  His son is played by Cameron Bright who was the creepy reincarnated soul of Nicole Kidman in "Birth" and has also appeared in "X-Men 3" & "Ultraviolet."  Nick's best friends are also lobbyists, Maria Bello ("Assault on Precinct 13" & "A History of Violence") plays Polly Bailey and Saturday Night Live's David Koechner plays Bobby Jay Bliss.  William H. Macy plays a neurotic senator; Robert Duvall is the Captain of tobacco; Sam Elliott's the Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch; and Rob Lowe is the Hollywood super-agent Jeff Megall.  For his first directorial project, Jason Reitman creates a funny, offbeat comedy that certainly twists our moral expectations.  There are plenty of deleted scenes for an excellent special feature.  "Thank You for Smoking" is hilariously drawn.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>"Thank You for Smoking" was an entertaining movie. I enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of Hollywood types. The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing you know. Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.<br /><br />It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in "The Gift". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like "I want to f*** you, when I watch you on TV" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye.<br /><br />Even though this is Jason Reitman's first feature film he is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that "Smoking" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.<br /><br /> I like the message behind "Thank You For Smoking" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking. It's a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards. It's a satirical look at the smoking issue although I still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other. But at the end of the day, it's a good independent film which you will be able to enjoy and appreciate.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I'm not really sure what I think of this film. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, more darkly humorous and ironic. Tragic in the right lighting. I did not know what to expect of it, and it did not go in the direction I thought it would. Likely that means it went in a better direction, as the crux of it begins and remains that it's not what you say but how you say it. Given that, this film shows great insight into rhetoric, which is poignant data about our entire means of distributing "information" at present.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman makes an impressive debut as director with this entertaining comedy `Thank You For Smoking,' which is more satirical than any of the comedies his father Ivan Reitman made. Despite the film's plot about one Nick Naylor, ace spokesperson for the tobacco industry, `Thank You For Smoking' refuses to take sides while keeping us hugely entertained with its dialogues.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart delivers a superb performance as Nick Naylor, a chief spokesman and lobbyist for tobacco industry, who in his `spin' mode can easily manipulate the opinions of the suspicious audiences on TV show. Nick is also a good father to his son Joey (Cameron Bright), before whom Nick tries to be a role model. Today Nick thinks of a brilliant idea of production placement - how about showing Hollywood stars smoking in a spaceship? - he flies to California with his son, meets a suave movie producer wearing kimono (Rob Lowe), and in his free time delivers a package to an ailing old man (Sam Elliott) who is about to sue the tobacco company.<br /><br />The satire is funny, but its target changes frequently. It could be tobacco industry (why not), but also could be those politicians (represented by William H. Macy's senator) who seems very hostile to Nick, and Nick himself. Sometimes the story goes too far, which includes a brief episode of abduction, but it is most effective when it shows Nick's darkly funny conversations with his friends, lobbyists for alcohol and guns (Mari Bello and David Koechner, calling themselves MOD Squad) over their lunch.<br /><br />Other cast includes Robert Duvall, Adam Brody, Kim Dickens, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. The acting is unanimously good, but the film belongs to Eckhart's Nick Naylor, or his art of spin.<br /><br />The film may lack the thought-provoking ideas about the on-going social issues. Still what you see in `Thank You For Smoking' is always amusing, clever, and even absurdly funny, and is never boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The casting was brilliant. The dialog was witty. It was not so much a diatribe against smoking as poking fun against lobbyists. There were a few misplays. The kidnapping was just strange and I am not sure how that explained anything.<br /><br />There is another review talking about smoking in the movie. I disagree. After the first few minutes, I noticed there was no smoking. I started to play close attention. There was very little or no smoking in the movie. Ebert comments on the same observation in his review. Again, the movie is poking fun at lobbyists. Everyone knows smoking is bad for you. What's the point of spoofing the tobacco industry?<br /><br />My favorite part in the movie was the debate about the MOD (ministers of death) squad about who caused more deaths: smoking, drinking or guns. Another good point is the father/son relationship. The son knows his father is hated by everybody, but his father is very good at what he does, which is talking. The father doesn't apologize for what he does, except, maybe at the very end. The son respects his father's decisions.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect, but it made me laugh and made me think about lobbyists, senate committees and our inadequacies and strengths of our political system.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>For his first feature-length film, Jason Reitman has adapted Christopher Buckley's 1994 novel "Thank You for Smoking", a satire of Capitol Hill lobbyists, Senators, and, most of all, political correctness. The hero, or anti-hero, of our story is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), hustler extraordinaire and lobbyist for the tobacco industry. His job is spin control, and Nick delights in the hatred that his powers of persuasion inspires. Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy), a Birkenstock-wearing liberal from Vermont, wants to require that a skull and crossbones be displayed on cigarette packages. Nick's hard-nosed boss "BR" (J.K. Simmons) is panicked at the state of cigarette sales. It's up to Nick to save the day by promoting onscreen smoking in Hollywood and taking on Finistirre in Congress. But a certain pretty reporter (Katie Holmes) is out to dish the dirt on the tobacco lobby.<br /><br />There is some very funny stuff in "Thank You for Smoking", and Aaron Eckhart is perfect for the part of this fast-talking, energetic, unscrupulous charmer. The self-described Merchants of Death, or "MOD Squad", the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms lobbyists who meet for lunch to brag about their deceptions and compare death tolls, are hilarious. I could easily watch alcohol's Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), the gun lobby's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), and tobacco's Nick Naylor gab for half an hour. That would be a side-splitting short film in itself. My hat is off to that trio of actors. J.K. Simmons' barking "BR" is equally comical. Where the film arguably fails is in being too sentimental. Jason Reitman has given Nick a young son, Joey (Cameron Bright), who is not in the book. Joey humanizes Nick by looking up to his father. Reitman's reasons for creating the boy are obvious, but I wonder if it was wise to soften Nick's character. A relentless Nick would have been better.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" skewers political correctness and spin doctors in line with the novel's intentions. It doesn't condone or discourage smoking. It pokes fun at the people who manufacture spin and the people who eat it up. I can only speculate, but I assume that Christopher Buckley chose the tobacco lobby because it is absurd and essentially innocuous. The tobacco lobby has gone to extraordinary lengths to tell people a bunch of lies that no one ever believed. This is a lifestyle lobby. It's perfect fodder for satire, as are self-righteous anti-tobacco crusaders. "Thank You for Smoking" excels in characterizations but doesn't have the guts to be uncompromising satire. Still, it's enjoyable if you're looking for politically incorrect comedy.  Ironically, no one smokes in this film.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features include 13 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary; a Charlie Rose Show (18 min) with Jason Reitman, Christopher Buckley, Aaron Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; 2 featurettes; a Poster Art Gallery (7 posters); an Art Department Gallery with logos and artwork from the film; a Storyboard Gallery of 112 storyboards from quite a few scenes; a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min); and a Soundtrack Spot (30 sec). "Unfiltered Comedy: The Making of Thank You For Smoking" (9 min) features interviews with cast and Jason Reitman, who talk about characters and the film's think-for-yourself themes. "America: Living In Spin" (5 min) is examples of "spin" from the movie and real media with commentary. I recommend the Charlie Rose feature and the Making Of feature. There are 2 audio commentaries: The first is by director Jason Reitman. The second is by Reitman and actors Aaron Eckhart and David Koechner. Most of what Reitman says in the 2nd commentary repeats what he said in the 1st. So, if you're going to listen to one commentary, listen to the 2nd one. Reitman talks about changes he made to the book and provides some technical information, while the actors recall their experiences filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>This is an intelligent, excellent satirical film, so don't get caught up in the title, for I think it can be misleading.  Smokers, for example, will likely suspect this film of being a vengeful attempt to make Big Tobacco look like Satan's most loyal servants, while anti-tobacco's attack dogs may suspect some hidden agenda to actually make smoking look cool.  Neither would be correct.  Thank You For Smoking launches its barbs into both sides of the tobacco conflict, shining a good bit of the harsh light of truth onto both.  No matter which side you're on, you can enjoy this brilliant little film.<br /><br />The sad fact is that the debate over smoking oftentimes has nothing to do with cigarettes; it's really all about money and power and politics.  Look at Al Gore, who could cry about the loss of his sister to cancer even as he profited from tobacco, or Bill Clinton (who did things with a cigar that even Big Tobacco would never condone), whose attack on Big Tobacco conveniently served him as a smokescreen to distract the public from his many personal problems.  Obviously, many people do oppose smoking for very sincere reasons, but some politicians jump on board merely as a means to power and influence.  In this movie, they're represented by Vermont's Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy), who is leading the effort to put a large poison label on cigarettes.  He's not exactly all heart, though: berating his assistant for not choosing someone obviously on death's door for his "cancer boy," lamenting the fact that one of his enemies didn't actually die after being attacked by anti-smoking vigilantes, and generally engaging in the same kind of self-profiting spin as the representatives of Big Tobacco.<br /><br />Finistirre's nemesis is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the smooth-talking de facto spokesman for the tobacco industry.  Eckhart's brilliant performance keeps the film far away from the many pitfalls that would seem to dominate the landscape for this kind of satire.  Naylor is almost untouchably good at his job, able to deftly and quickly take a hostile crowd and win them over (or at least stave them off) with his defense of freedom and personal choice in America.  What does he do what he does?  That's never definitively answered, but paying the mortgage is alluded to by Nick and several other characters.  One thing that Nick alone has, however, is a human and sympathetic persona, as revealed in his relationship with his son.  The presence of the boy adds to the story's otherwise absurdist atmosphere, as we watch the boy look up to and begin to emulate his father's debating skills.  More than that, it shows us a human side to Nick, and that is something this film almost had to have in order to succeed.<br /><br />Nick's character is sort of morally ambivalent, but you can't help but like him - and he certainly comes off in a better light than Senator Finistirre and a certain reporter played (passably at best) by Katie Holmes.  Nick should have known better than to sleep with a journalist, as Heather Holloway goes about doing her job much the same way Nick goes about doing his.  Her only concern is the story and the attention it will bring her.  She and Finistirre, much more than Nick and his fellow spokesmen from the alcohol and firearms industries (who jokingly refer to themselves as the MOD [Merchants of Death] Squad and argue over which of their products is more deadly) are the real villains of the story.  Even if and when they might do the right thing, they do it for all the wrong reasons.  Nick may engineer good spin for Big Tobacco, but at least he doesn't pretend to be someone he isn't.<br /><br />The film features a surprisingly good cast (excepting Katie Holmes, of course, whose "steamy" scene with Eckhart is almost too far away from the camera to be seen with the naked eye), including the likes of Eckhart, Elliott, Macy, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, and - in a really funny cameo - Dennis Miller.  Jason Reitman may be a young filmmaker, but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film.  Making a film about Big Tobacco that never deviates from its satirical position to moralize either for or against smoking, skewers all concerned parties equally, defies the dangerous modern-day obsession with political correctness, and maintains a consistently intelligent, funny atmosphere throughout, is quite an accomplishment indeed.  Unless you simply can't take a joke (or you're the reviewer from the LA Times or some similar leftist rag), you're going to enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There's something to be said for a film that makes no apologies for being completely politically incorrect, and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING certainly has something to say.<br /><br />That audiences may find themselves cheering on "the bad guy" will make this movie all the more entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (SUSPECT ZERO) stars as Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the tobacco companies, and he's very good at what he does. One of his sayings is "If you argue well enough, you're never wrong." The moral flexibility Nick has is akin to an ethical gymnast. But his son Joey (Cameron Blight, ULTRAVIOLET) is growing up fast and is learning the ways of the father. We see Nick navigating these parental waters with a touch of dignity and a splash of chagrin. Can he be a good father while towing the line for the tobacco companies and telling everyone that cigarettes are a personal choice rather than a death sentence?<br /><br />William H. Macy (EDMOND) stars as Senator Finistirre, "the good guy" who is trying to get a skull and crossbones image stamped on every carton of cigarettes. But he's also a politician, trying to further his own career. He represents a state that produces tons of fatty cheeses, thus adding to Americans weight and cholesterol problems. And he most certainly isn't above taking campaign contributions from businesses, is he?<br /><br />That the film is filled with contradictions and hilarious moral dilemmas is a tribute to the author of the book, Christopher Buckley. That he can turn the tables on alcohol, tobacco and firearms (all of which are addressed in the name of "business") is a testament to some damn fine writing.<br /><br />What makes the movie work so well is Aaron Eckhart's affable portrayal of Nick. He's so darn likeable yet utterly incomprehensible (in the moral sense) that the audience will be grudgingly cheering him on. That he can out-maneuver his opponent (Macy) makes the movie-watcher dislike whom they really should be cheering for! What a turnabout!<br /><br />The ensemble cast is incredible, too. In addition to Eckhart, Macy and Blight, there's Mario Bello (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE), Sam Elliot (TOMBSTONE), Katie Holmes (PIECES OF APRIL), Rob Lowe (THE WEST WING, TV series), Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE), and quite a few other notables.<br /><br />This film must certainly be on people's top-ten list of movies to watch ...if they haven't caught it already.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is perhaps the most detested man in America.  As a smoking lobbyist, he must put a good face on the hated and waning tobacco market.  He is savvy and smart, making appearances on news interviews and daytime talk shows.  He creates spin in the cleverest ways.  (For instance, he must address a panel on "The Joan Lunden Show" and face an-ex smoker, a child who is dying from cancer.  He says that they don't want people to die of cancer because they would lose their customers, and he only recommends cigarettes when they are grown up.)  He must lobby "to pay the mortgage," but he also must keep his son's respect.  Eventually, like many others, his son is caught up in the spin of his father's saviness.  He learns to become as persuasive as his father. Yet, for Nick, persuasion is still a challenge: He must stand up to a back-stabbing boss and his two partners in crime, one (Maria Bello) the alcohol advocate, and one for firearms.  Although his biggest nemesis is the senator of Vermont (William Macy), a pompous politician whose attempts to squash Naylor seem futile.  His second biggest contender is a beautiful reporter who exposes him when he is oddly vulnerable.<br /><br />Based on a Christopher Buckley novel, "Thank You for Smoking" is a satire that hits the right delivery.  It is not subtle, but it doesn't really become self-righteous.  The movie is funny, yet obvious, without beating the viewer over the head.  Sometimes the tension of the plot wains, but it is seldom unengaging.  The performances are good--especially Aaron Eckhart as the smooth, conniving Naylor.  It should be said that the previews are excellent, but they do give away too many of the punchlines.  (For those who are uninitiated, plug your ears if they start to show this film before you see it.)  For others who are sensitive, there is a great deal of profanity and a sex scene (which does make a point, by the way) that may deter some away.  Overall, it is a solid comedy with fine portrayals and enough punches to go around (politics, entertainment, and the tobacco industry).</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice President of an organization created by the cigarette conglomerate, a position that carries with it responsibility of being the chief spokesperson for Big Tobacco. He does not have the advanced degrees that other successful businessmen have, but he has a self-proclaimed bachelor's in "kicking ass and taking names." Nick is a talker and he is very good at what he does. And he must juggle his job (spinning on behalf of cigarette companies) and being a positive role model for his son.<br /><br />As if a man in such a position is not accustomed to conflict, he encounters further trouble from an outspoken Senator (William H. Macy) and a feisty newspaper reporter (Katie Holmes).<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart was great. He really did a fabulous job. The sly, "I've got a secret" smirk he wore for so much of the movie was fantastic. You have probably seen a movie he has been in, if you are wondering who he is. He has played some small, though decent roles. The movie for which I am most familiar with Aaron is In The Company of Men. To see him transition from that small production nearly ten years ago to playing a part for which he should receive an award or two is great. He was very engaging in this role. He will keep your captivated. Aaron Eckhart sells this role like Nick Naylor sells Big Tobacco.<br /><br />The slow development of Joey Naylor, Nick's son was done very well. From the early part of the film when he pleads with his dad to not ruin his childhood to when he finally takes his dad's advice about how to present an argument through to the end, Joey was a great side story.<br /><br />Maria Bello and David Koechner round out Nick Naylor's MOD Squad in expert fashion. Their constant sparring around the lunch table is definitely one of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />The writing was fast and funny. The movie is full of one liners, but they come at you from all directions so be sure to keep up.<br /><br />Rob Lowe's cameo was perfect. The setup of walking through his office building, his assistant Jack, the late night phone call, it was all hilarious.<br /><br />Thank You For Smoking kept me entertained and kept me laughing. I really enjoyed the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.<br />I had heard about it for years but I still wasn't entirely sure what it was about.<br />Was it a comedy or a documentary style movie?<br />It turned out to be a very dark comedy.<br />A somewhat unrealistic comedy but still a good one.<br />Aaron Eckhart is the big tobacco lobbyist who is trying to convince the government and the public that smoking isn't bad for you.<br />He's divorced, and pretty much a dirt bag.<br />That said the movie has excellent acting.<br />Pacing is spot on.<br />Pretty much everything was done well.<br />I recommend a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>Aaron Eckhart (Two Face) plays the ultimate spin doctor as a tobacco lobbyist. The movie is extremely funny and educational. It teaches people, and Aaron's son, not to accept the status quo in thinking, that there are alternative realities depending on how one wants to use spin it. A truly libertarian film to the point of absurdity.

It features an intelligent script, sharp and disciplined acting, and smooth yet brisk pacing. There are plenty of laughs, a perfect dose of heart, and a filleting of not only the lobby world, but of government, Hollywood, power, and the gullible American public that is surgically precise. There are no punches pulled here, Eckhart leads a brilliant cast of actors and Thank You For Smoking is easily one of the best satire comedies I have seen in a long time. When you look at how much praise Tropic Thunder got for trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the same skewering satire, it should make you appreciate a gem like TYFS that much more. This is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>One of the many ironies in this blatant satire (which is NOT a documentary) is that at no time is anybody seen smoking!  No Hollywood cinematic light ups.  Even Nick Naylor, who is vice president of the smoking PR conglomerate, does not actually light up on screen.  We see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one, that's it.<br /><br />The joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way.  Now you might think that, well, a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does, certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see.  However, if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away, the message would surely be mixed.<br /><br />No mixed messages here.  Aaron Eckhart who stars as Nick Naylor is a sort of charming sociopath.  He describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed.  In an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have Katie Holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the "Washington Probe" newspaper who gets him into bed, all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks.  He was owned, so to speak, and taken advantage of sexually.<br /><br />Eckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways.  You may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film In the Company of Men (1997), which I highly recommend.  (See my review.)  Here he is a little sweeter, a little more charming, and amazingly enough a good role model for his son Joey (Cameron Bright), who, by the way, has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well.  How this is pulled off is something to behold, for sure.  But basically the rationale is that Nick is doing it all "to pay the mortgage" ("the yuppie Nuremberg defense") and that is the lesson that Joey learns, and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows up.<br /><br />Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy) holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while Nick tells him that the Vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks; Nick hanging out with a RP person representing the interests of alcohol (Maria Bello), and another (David Koechner) whoring for the gun industry.  They like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killed.<br /><br />Robert Duvall has a modest part as the "Captain" of tobacco and Rob Lowe gets to play Jeff Megall, a big time, Machiavellian Hollywood money man, who is lining up Catherine Zeta-Jones and I forget who, to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenes--for a price to be paid for by Big Tobacco.  The joke here is that this practice has long been a source of Hollywood film production up-front revenue.  There's a scene showing old Hollywood stars with PC touch ups of their movies, showing them with lolly-pops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettes.<br /><br />The script (adapted from a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of conservative pundit William F. Buckley) and direction by Jason Reitman deserve some kind of award for originality.  The film is definitely a put down of industry PR people, yet somehow it makes them look human.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Thank You for Smoking is hilarious in the same way that watching Sasha Baren Cohen pretend to be an immigrant in Borat is hilarious.  It's funny because it's a film that can laugh at itself--and does so for nearly two hours.  For instance, in one scene the president of the Academy of Tobacco Studies says, "(Cigaretters) are cool, available, and addictive. The job's almost done for us."  This movie is satirical without being too over the top and that's what makes it great. I mean what isn't funny about a group of best friends who call themselves the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death) and work as lobbyists for the tobacco, alcohol, and firearms industries.  It's almost too much, but it's done so well that you can't help but laugh.  Also, one of the best parts of this movie is the far underrated performance of Adam Brody as the assistant of a Hollywood superagent played by Rob Lowe. Brody's scenes are some of the best in the movie and his immersion in the vapid, Los Angeles movie market makes for great movie-watching. I would definitely recommend Thank You for Smoking the next time you're in the mood for a laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Dialogue. Dialogue. Dialogue. It's all about the dialogue.<br /><br />Nick Naylor has the gift of gab, and he uses it to defend Big Tobacco. And Thank You For Smoking really doesn't take sides if that's what you're thinking. This is not a documentary or a "Super Size Me" reality trip. It's entertainment in the purest form of the art.<br /><br />Whether you hate smoking or smoke like a chimney, Thank You For Smoking will make you laugh. It'll dazzle you with quick-witted rhetoric. It indeed will provide food for thought about how this country is not lead by leaders, but by those that can spin a tale in their favor with the cleverest amount of craft.<br /><br />And most importantly, Thank You For Smoking epitomizes the notion that you don't necessarily have to win an argument to walk away with all of the chips; all you have to do is make the pubic believe that your opponent is wrong.<br /><br />Thank You for Smoking is intelligent, thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Not a single boring moment.<br /><br />SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING:  Aaron Eckhart's (Nick Naylor) performance is killer.  Katie Holmes' precarious positions could cause blindness. William H. Macy's perfect reflection of the people that run our country could drive you to drink. Seeing J.K. Simmons portray a brash pompous jerk again could cause deja vu.

Reality or fiction? Whether you realize it or not, we are constantly bombarded with messages about what is cool, or hip, or deadly, or immoral.<br /><br />This is a fictionalized account of one such battle:  smoking tobacco.  When the evidence is so clear that smoking harms both the smoker and others inhaling the smoke, why is smoking tobacco still legal?  It is because there is a cadre of professionals whose job it is to make sure we hear and absorb certain messages, like the government wants smokers to die so that agencies can get larger budgets, while tobacco companies want smokers to live because smokers are their best customers (example taken from the movie)!<br /><br />This film is very entertaining, with a number of great, great actors.  Rated PG-13, and highly recommended.  I give this film 4 stars instead of 5 because the sex scenes (admittedly limited) and language will keep younger children from seeing this film... and I'd like to see more people, not less, view this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>"Thank You for Smoking" which marks the debut of Jason Reitman (son of Ivan) quickly became one of the most acclaimed films of 2006. Not hard to see why. This movie is probably one of the best American comedies of the year; Satire doesn't come around as often in film as it used to and when it does, it's usually not done very well. "Thank You for Smoking" does it perfectly. Aaron Eckart ('Suspect Zero') plays Nick Naylor, the Vice President of The Center of Tobacco Studies. Nick's job is to talk to people and convince them that smoking is not as bad as it seems. He even gets together with friends (Maria Bello & David Koechner), who work to make light of simalar products, to see who's product causes the largest death toll. This group, I might add, is called The M.O.D. Squad (short for "Merchants of Death"). Nick's job interferes with his personal life. He's divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens, 'Truth or Consequences, N.M.') and only sees his son (Cameron Bright, 'Birth') on weekends; A sexy reporter (Katie Holmes) is using him to score a big story; And he even ends up getting kidnapped at one point. The movie's all-star cast also features Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons (who plays Nick's boss BR), Adam Brody, Rob Lowe, and Dennis Miller. The movie's got some great one-liners, countless great scenes, and some in-your-face politically incorrect humor (when BR talks about an environmentalist, the word "Pussy" flashes at the bottom of the screen). The opening scene is truly hilarious. One of the most critical elements of this film however is the performances. The things the main character represents are despicable, so you need to like the character. Having said that, Eckhart is brilliant. He plays the character so convincingly, you half-believe a lot of the stuff he says. The critics were not lying about this film. This is one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Regardless of which 'side' of the Big Tobacco debate you are on, you have to tip your hat to the writers, creators, producers of this crackling satire. If you like your comedies crisp and caustic, you will probably get a kick out of this look at the absurd yet powerful world of corporate lobbyists.<br /><br />Rest assured, no one escapes unscathed. It takes an actor with a great deal of charm to pull off the role of a devious spin-doctor and still be likable, but Aaron Eckhart fits that to a tee. His scenes with his son are laced with such humor and dichotomous morality that they form some of the most engaging moments in the film. William Macy is always a stamp of high quality. Here, as a dogged senator with the right vision but poor debating acumen, he evokes just the right touch of sympathy and rancor.<br /><br />Whether you smoke or not, the banter is hilarious. For instance, the refrain "The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly you're never wrong" is probably baloney, but it is delivered with such pizazz that you nearly find yourself wanting to believe it. The script is strewn with memorable quips, but it all leads to a denouement that has its heart in the right place.<br /><br />The DVD is very satisfactory. Besides several interviews with the production team, it also contains almost a dozen deleted scenes, many of which are interesting, but one appreciates the editing effort that led to their exclusion. There's also an interesting mini-feature with the cast and crew that admits that the film should leave audiences laughing but also asking some educated questions. Oddly enough, Eckhart is the only one who sees the movie as a straight comedy and not political in its undertones.<br /><br />All in all, this one's a keeper. Get it. You'll watch it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Just got done watching Thank You For Smoking. This movie was simply hilarious from beginning to end. I love the dark and very smart humor. It was well written, had a fantastic cast and the acting was superior. Now as I am writing this and thinking that this movie was just great and flawless... I remember one glaring FLAW. Katey Holmes was completely and totally miscast. I can only imagine that she got the role because of her recent publicity filled relationship with the grinny idiot Tom Cruise and their sham relationship. The character is described by somebody in the cast before you even meet her as this bombshell babe of a reporter with great chest that would melt and had melted many a man into spilling his guts. So who do we get? Who is this brick you know what house that can seduce any man? Why it is 14 year old looking and acting Katey 'Kate' (to her grinning ingnoramous of a sudo husband) Holmes. I don't think much of her in any role unless it is of a 14 year old and certainly she was totally miscast in this movie that has cast every other character dead on. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine them filling this cast with Aaron Ekhart, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot, Maria Bello or anybody else in this top notch cast and then saying, "you know who we should get for the bombshell sexpot reporter?!!! Why let's get KATEY HOLMES!!!" And somebody saying, "I have to have her! She is our first and only choice!" Give me a break.<br /><br />The best thing is that even this total miscasting did not hurt this movie. It is 5 stars and Oscar worthy.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Rarely has political incorrectness been as clever, as funny, and as thought provoking as it is in "Thank You For Smoking." There's really no need to point out that it's a political satire; the title alone makes that perfectly clear, and for that, we can thank Christopher Buckley for writing the original novel. This is a movie that couldn't have been released in any other period of film history; only recently has American society planted such an obsessive focus on health within the mainstream consciousness, and only now is it falling on deaf ears. (Don't believe me? Just look at the stats on obesity to see what I mean.) What better time is there to examine the various stances on health, especially when it comes to smoking? Granted, it's a humorous examination, but if you stop and think about it, the way that opposing groups go about defending themselves--which in this case involve the tobacco industry and anti-smoking parties--is shamefully comedic. Maybe a movie like this will help people understand just what goes into arguing for a particular side and gaining the upper hand through persuasion.<br /><br />And when it comes to persuasiveness, no one is better at it than Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a smooth talking tobacco lobbyist who knows just how to get a point across. He works for a company headed by Budd "BR" Rohrabacher (J.K. Simmons); a hardheaded boss-type who only cares about financial success. Naylor doesn't seem to mind that he's one of the most hated men in America (at one point during Dennis Miller's call in talk show, an anonymous caller claims that Naylor is going to suffer). He also doesn't care that he's promoting a product that kills thousands of people a day. According to him, it's all about "paying the mortgage," making a living only because it's necessary for survival. Talking is just something he happens to be good at, and what better way to use that skill than in defense of a powerful (and some would say evil) corporate entity? In today's day and age, they certainly need all the help they can get.<br /><br />Naylor is but one lobbyist seen in this film. He regularly dines with spokespeople from two other controversial industries: Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), who represents alcohol; and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), who represents guns. The three call themselves the MOD Squad (meaning Merchants of Death), and they always seem to be conversing on how to work with the system in order to get their unpopular messages out to the public. One piece of advice Bliss has is to be careful around female reporters with nice looking breasts; while it may appear pleasing on camera, it can result in a potentially damaging scenario. Naylor finds this out the hard way when he gets physically involved with Heather Halloway (Katie Holmes), a reporter with an agenda.<br /><br />Things get complicated when Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy) launches a new campaign aimed at putting a permanent dent in the tobacco industry's goals. The idea is to print a gruesome skull-and-crossbones logo on every pack of cigarettes; maybe then people will understand that inhaling a puff of smoke is akin to inhaling poison. In order to fight against this, Naylor suggests using movies as a tool to make cigarettes appealing again. It would be like it was in the old days of Hollywood, when stars like Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis made smoking seem sexy. What follows is one of the wittiest representations of movie industry-banter I've ever seen. Naylor flies to Los Angeles to meet with Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), the head of a talent agency called Entertainment Global Operations (or EGO, if you get the joke). The two decide to make a science fiction film and have a brand of cigarettes tie in with its release. Supposedly, the product would be featured during an interstellar sex scene between Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta Jones.<br /><br />But there's more to "Thank You For Smoking" than feuding industries. This is also a very human story, and it shows through the interaction between Naylor and his twelve-year-old son, Joey (Cameron Bright). He's a smart, articulate young man who seems genuinely interested in what his father does for a living, not so much in what he endorses but in how he endorses it. A couple of very important scenes show them engaged in fascinating conversations; basically, Joey wants to understand the methodology behind arguing and winning an argument (which is a skill he's rapidly developing). He also just wants to spend more time with his father, which is why he goes with him on his business trips. This is something that Naylor's ex-wife, Jill (Kim Dickens), has never been thrilled with. However, she does recognize the good relationship they share.<br /><br />There's also an intriguing subplot involving Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliot), the former Marlboro man (who supposedly only smoked Kools). The fact that he's dying of cancer has understandably made him bitter and resentful towards Big Tobacco, and because of this, Naylor is sent with a suitcase full of cash. Hopefully, this will get Lutch to keep quiet for the remainder of his life. Obviously I can't say whether or not the money is accepted, but I will say that the thought process behind the decision is quite original. Naylor's people skills are used to their full extent during this scene, especially in the way he weighs Lutch's options.<br /><br />I think what makes "Thank You For Smoking" so entertaining is its refreshing honesty and its uncompromising commentaries on American business. And despite what some may think, it's not a film that attempts to label any political stance as right or wrong; neither side is entirely correct just as neither side is entirely incorrect. It's enough to make one think about the decisions we make. Are we influenced to try something dangerous, or are we able to make up our own minds? There are no easy answers to those questions, and that's exactly the point this film is trying to make. Its ability to look beyond previously conceived notions made this a worthwhile experience. I urge anyone of moral conviction to see it; it may just make you look at your ideals in an entirely different light.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Although the title implies that this movie is soley an attack on the tobacco industry, it's really a hit at lobbyists and spin specialists in general. The focus of the movie is the art of forming your argument so that you are always right. Stephen Colbert has created a term for this idea: "truthiness".<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart portrays tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor as a very human guy who understands that he "gets paid to talk." He justifies his job to himself (and his son) and explains that we "all have to pay the mortgage". The entire cast performs well in this film, aside from Adam Brody, who's turn as Rob Lowe's "yes man" is stiff and unfunny.<br /><br />While Thank You For Smoking is enjoyable and well-done satire, the story starts to run a bit long and in the end I think an hour and a half of The Colbert Report would provide more biting satire for this particular topic.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Jason Reitman`s "Thank You For Smoking" would make an interesting companion piece to "Lord of War," since both are sharp, acerbic satires about industries - one tobacco, the other small arms - whose practitioners are often referred to as "merchants of death."<br /><br />Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, "Thank You For Smoking" centers on Nick Naylor, a smooth-talking lobbyist for Big Tobacco whose job it is to counter all the medical charges leveled against cigarettes so that people will go right on using the product despite the fact that Americans are dropping dead from heart disease, cancer and emphysema at the rate of well over 430,000 people a year.  The triumph of the film is that it resists the temptation to paint everything in broad strokes or to reduce all its figures to the level of simpleminded caricatures.  Naylor may be an amoral cretin in the profession he has chosen to pursue, but as played by the brilliant Aaron Eckhart, he also has a bit of a conscience and the semi-redeeming traits of insecurity, vulnerability and a deep and abiding love for his devoted young son.  Writer/director Jason Reitman "humanizes" the characters even as he skewers them mercilessly for how they have chosen to live their lives.  Naylor, for instance, is part of an informal group labeled "the Mod Squad," - short for "Merchants of Death" - consisting of Naylor plus two other lobbyists, one from the alcohol industry and one from the gun manufacturers, who meet regularly at a local bar to bemoan their standing as social pariahs and to argue over which of the three industries scores the most deaths per annum.  These characters could easily have been overdrawn and turned into callous villains, but we find ourselves actually liking them - much as we do Naylor - partly because they remain loyal to their buddy when the going gets tough for him and his world threatens to fall to pieces around him.<br /><br />Indeed it is this feeling of ambivalence we have towards Naylor that makes "Thank You For Smoking" more than just an anti-smoking jeremiad, for the movie beautifully approximates the seductive power of men like Naylor and makes us aware of how easily we too fall under their spell.  Eckhart is so charismatic, charming and convincing in the role of Naylor that we find ourselves in the unusual position of practically rooting for him to prevail, even though, intellectually, we can pretty much see through the speciousness of his arguments.  The filmmakers are to be commended for not softening the material by turning Naylor into the conventional anti-hero who eventually sees the evils of his ways and does everything in his power to make reparations for the damage and suffering he has caused.  For even though Naylor does have a "soft," likable side to his personality, it isn't always enough to make him do the right thing in every situation or to make all the politically correct speeches the audience believes should be coming from the mouth of a reformed wrongdoer.  The filmmakers make it clear that Naylor "reforms" only up to a point, for there is still a great deal of flimflamery lurking in the core of his genes.  Moreover, Buckley and Reitman don't let the anti-smoking forces entirely off the hook either.  The movie often shows them as both extreme (one group even kidnaps and nicotine-poisons Naylor to get him to stop what he's doing) and insufferably self-righteous and petty (one senator wants to digitally erase all the cigarettes from old movies).<br /><br />Eckhart, who has always been a very fine actor despite never having achieved superstar status in Hollywood, should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his dazzling, finely-tuned turn here as a man it is easy to criticize but hard to hate.  He is bolstered by an outstanding cast that includes J.K. Simmons, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Kim Dickens, William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe and Sam Elliott.  Special note should be taken of young Cameron Bright ("X-Men 3"), who brings spirit and depth to the role of Naylor's impressionable but clear-eyed and levelheaded teenage son.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" is a rarity among American films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>When I saw the previews for Thank You For Smoking for the first time on a new release DVD I was intrigued.

I know what you're thinking.  I didn't like the movie.  Right?  Wrong! Thank You For Smoking is a good movie.  It's thought-provoking and clever and feindishly un-PC and I like that.

Well-written and perfectly casted (Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, and more!) Thank You For Smoking follows along with the exploits of Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aron Eckhart) who's greatest asset is his ability to BS and argue.  While pushing a product like cigarettes onto the citizens of the world Naylor still manages to keep himself grounded,trying to teach life lessons to his 12 year old son.  Are cigarettes poison?  Not enough evidence to suggest that, as Naylor would say.  It's big business vs. anyone with so-called morales.  Poignant without being pushy, Thank You For Smoking makes you think while you laugh.  There are alot of subjects touched upon here that will make certain people squirm or look away, and that I think is why I enjoyed it so much.  Was it drop dead funny?  No.  No like they tote it in the ads and previews.  But it is good.

Why would a movie that shows the main character going to Hollywood to convince studio executives to feature its stars lighting up, but then not have its star light up?

The tobacco industry is used to showcase how PR can make anything, even a lethal product, acceptable to the public. The insane thing is that you find yourself cheering for the spinmeister himself! A great cast including Katie Holmes in a sexy, hilarious role that makes you wonder why she has settled for being Mrs. Tom Cruise. Robert Duvall is terrific as the tobacco exec who falls victim to his own product. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Nick Naylor is the Vice-President for the Institute of Tobacco studies, in other words the "spin Dr." who speaks for the tobacco industry in an attempt to counteract studies which have shown that tobacco is harmful to your health.  In the opening scene, he appears on a t.v. show and makes a Vermont senator and others look ridiculous for suggesting that people should not smoke.  Like a magician, Nick distracts the audience with a seemingly true statement while managing to twist what others say.  On the other side of the coin is Nick's young son who lives with his mother, but still considers his father to be "a god" (in the words of Nick's estranged wife.)  Nick's dilemma is how to keep both sides satisfied while, as he puts it, he manages to "pay the mortgage".  This movie is a fresh and clever satire, well-acted by Aaron Echhart and his supporting cast.  It is a refreshing change from many of the trite and predictable movies which are currently produced in Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>"Thank You for Smoking" is a mixed bag, mixing sharp observations about the American Political System with occasional droll humor... but it fails to realize its full potential for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost, it is ambivalent as to whether the lead character, Nick Naylor, is a hero or a villain.  Personally, I liked a lot of what he had to say about freedom of choice, but the way it was presented, it seemed that the movie was mocking those sentiments. Of course, the liberal do-gooders also get their fair share of mocking, but ultimately the movie lacks a point of view.<br /><br />Second, I found it odd that although a crucial plot development centers on the fact that Nick would have to be a fairly heavy smoker to survive one particular event, he is never shown actually smoking. In fact, hardly anybody smokes throughout the entire movie, including all the tobacco industry people.<br /><br />Also, although I have no problem with profanity or "bad language" when it serves a real purpose, I thought they used the "f" word far too often in this movie, when it didn't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but not as much as I thought I would. I'd give it 3.5 stars if that were an option; I'm going with 3 to bring the average down from its current 4-star level.  (I thought the funniest moment was in one of the deleted scenes, where the tobacco guys are considering various versions of a skull-and-crossbones logo. They should have left this in the movie!)</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This is a movie about the world of Lobbyists and the life of "spinning".  A note up front, you have to keep an open mind with this movie. This movie was actually very funny and pointed out a number of thing that I think we all realize but never verbalize.  This is based in the late 90's prior to the tobacco settlement, the main character is a Lobbyist for the tobbacco industry.  It explores his job and his life and why he did the job. Many people write him off as a murderer, but this movie adresses this and more.  Throw in his dinner meetings with his Lobbyist friends from Alcohol and Firearms, I would not have thought i could laugh at the movie, but I did. The movie was well written, great voiceovers where needed, and dialog flowed well.  The movie is best summed up by one of the lines "you have to pay the mortgage".  So if you want a thinking comedy, and don't mind some dark humor on occasion, i think this is worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>Big tobacco is of course an old, broad and very deserving target, but the real bullseyes of the satire in Thank You For Smoking are the people in those institutions -- mainly Washington pols, Hollywood and the media -- that assert with a straight face that they are serving the public interest instead of, as Nick Naylor (an excellent Aaron Eckhardt) is happy to admit, paying the mortgage.  Watching that skewering -- which is aided and abetted by the fine performances of Rob Lowe, William H. Macy, and Katie Holmes -- provides most of the fun in Thank You.  It's also amusing that the only remotely human and appealing characters in the movie, aside from Nick and his son, are Nick's fellow Merchants of Death and Robert Duvall as the tobacco company mogul.  The movie goes badly wrong just once, when Nick is kidnapped by anti-smoking vigilantes who almost kill him by covering his body with nicotine patches and make him momentarily an object of sympathy.  Otherwise, Thank You For Smoking is quick on its feet, bright, and often very funny.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Lobbyists; it is their job to defend the "defenseless" big corporations that people hate.  Tobacco companies, gun manufacturers, alcohol producers and distributors, fast food chains.  All of these businesses are enormous and often villified (often times for good reason).  The lobbyists' job is to spin the facts into positive arguments for their employers or to make the opposition look bad.  Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is one such lobbyist, and he sure is good at it.<br /><br />Thank You For Smoking is narrated by Naylor, who refers to himself as a coked-up version of "that guy who could pick up any girl at a party".  Talking is what he's good at, and it seems to be the greatest job imaginable.  He didn't need an advanced degree to get his job, and yet he makes a considerable amount of money defending Big Tobacco from health organizations and the US government.  Naylor's boss is known simply as B.R. (J.K. Simmons), a tough-as-nails Vietnam veteran who gets results from his constant insults to his employees.  Nick is divorced from his wife (Kim Dickens) who is sick and tired of him always sweet-talking her, and, in a bit of irony, is now seeing a doctor.  Nick's son Joey (Cameron Bright), an impressionable young boy, begins to take an interest in his father's work, and shows that he may have inhereted his father's flair for persuasion.  Every week, Nick meets up with his two friends who are also lobbyists.  Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) work for the alcohol and gun lobbies, respectively.  Their conversations tend to focus on whose product kills the most people and the best ways to get around negative press.  The thing about Nick is that he knows that he's BSing people, but he needs to pay the mortgage somehow.<br /><br />The great thing about this movie is its shameless satire.  No one is safe; yeah, the tobacco company has a lot of shots taken at it, but it also skewers the government, Hollywood, and reporters.  Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) is made a fool of numerous times, and Naylor's "cheese defense" is priceless.  What's even more amazing about the film is that, due to the way he spins things, many of Nick's arguments for cigarettes really work (the car/airplane one he uses right before the cheese one don't work in my opinion though, but most of the others actually do, which is pretty scary).<br /><br />It's a shame that this movie is only getting a fairly limited release, which means that not a lot of people will see it.  I think that this is a movie that everyone should see at least once.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't so that people can learn from it, because it definitely does not preach, but because it's such a great satire.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Normally, I am not a very big fan of satire.  In general, I think that satires are too smart for their own good.  By saying that, I mean that most satires tend to identify their target in too serious of a manner that greatly affects the film's ability to make you laugh.  Thank You For Smoking definitely does not fit into that category, I am happy to say.<br /><br />The film's main character, Nick Naylor, is a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, which is based in Washington and is funded by conglomerate tobacco to get statistics that are favorable to cigarettes, their dangers, and their addictiveness.  Naylor is immediately identified as the "bad guy," as we first see him on The Joan Show, where he has to defend himself against an army of experts and "cancer boy."  Naylor shows off his ability to defend himself, and cigarettes, to a bitterly hostile group of people ready to devour his soul.  When a senator from Vermont launches a campaign to put a "poison" label on cigarette packs (complete with a skull and crossbones), Naylor is summoned by his company and "the Captain" to go out to Hollywood to persuade a major Hollywood talent agent to get his stars to start smoking in films again, to make it cool.  While that is the basic storyline of the movie, the film also goes out of its way to create a really cool relationship between Naylor and his son.  Apparently, this wasn't in the book and is totally a creation of Reitman's script, and it is what really makes the movie complete and somewhat meaningful.  Naylor's grooming of his son to become as talented a talker as he is is really entertaining, and is what really holds the film together.<br /><br />Not only is the story good, but the jokes are also very funny.  Unlike most other satires, Thank You For Smoking directly identifies its target very clearly, but it remains entertaining and light-hearted by basically playing both sides of the fence.  Both sides of the political spectrum will be reddened by some of the things that are depicted in this film.  And, it seems, the film applies smoking (a very controversial issue these days) to many other situations that have a very similar concept that are also very prevalent in our society.<br /><br />I have to also mention the amazing all-star cast that is in the film.  Whenever your film's cast list includes the names of talent such as Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, William H. Macy, Maria Bello, and Rob Lowe, you know that acting is pretty much an ace-in-the-hole.  Surprisingly enough, the best performance in the movie, in my opinion, was by far David Koechner.  Koechner plays the representative for the gun companies in the weekly meetings of the MOD (merchants of death ) squad.  Whenever Koechner was entered into a scene, I almost started laughing immediately, and I hope his performance in this film makes his name a little more widely known around Hollywood, because he has great talent (as also shown in Anchorman).<br /><br />This movie is a definite recommendation for anyone that enjoys not only satires, but what most would refer to as "intelligent comedy."  It is really great to be able to go see a film and laugh your butt off while also feeling like your IQ level didn't just drop 50 points.</p></br></body></html>

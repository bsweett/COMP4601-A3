In addition, it contains the greatest villain in cinematic history - Dr. Hannibal Lectar - played by Anthony Hopkins who gives as oscar-winning performance (easily his most memorable of his career).  Add an oscar-winning performance by Jodie Foster as the investigator in training "Clarice Starling" and a great supporting cast, incredible story, and just the right amount of gore and creepiness and you get just about a perfect movie that can easily entertain anyone who loves movies.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, you don't know what you are missing out on.  Maybe its the disturbing imagery that has kept you away, or the sickening themes attached to the villains, but in reality its kind of mild compared to movies today such as Saw and Hostel.  Unlike Saw & Hostel, Silence of The Lambs is a classic, that shows just the right amount of disturbing imagery and sickness to fill the balance of the movie.  There is no overload, for the movie's finest achievemnt is told within its superb story, and not through its R rating.  The film has many layers of story being told, and its kind of three dimensional.<br /><br />There are two villains in the story.  The first is Buffalo Bill, who everyone is attempting to capture.  He's kind of the villain on the surface of the film, but the real person to admire is Hannibal Lecter.  He is behind bars in the start of the film, but he is a very deep and complex person, and unlike any villain you've seen before.  He eats the rude and loves to search deep into your mind, as he does with the young Clarice who he develops a unqiue likeness to.  As for Bill, Hannibal knows a great deal about him, and is the only source Clarice can find for information, but not before Hannibal dives into he mind and forces her to recall her troubling past and apply it to her present situation.  It is a very deep connection the two share, that both actors share a wonderful and unique chemistry for.  Truly the best thing about this film and adds real depth to the story.<br /><br />In favor of a terrific and suspenseful film, I will not give away any more details about the story or Buffalo Bill.  It is also a great mystery and puzzle-solver, attempting to locate this villain who has committed crimes that, well, you just have to see for youself - though a bit disgusting.  Silence of The Lambs is a must own to complete a great home movie collection.  It is one of the most memorable movies of all time, that creepy enough, will probably stick with you for the rest of your life.<br /><br />Acting - 5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Horror - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>The Silence of the Lambs brought GOLD to the arms of HORROR films<br />in 1991 and I can still remember it like it was yesterday watching<br />that Sunday night.

The film stars Jodie Foster in her 2nd Oscar-winning role as Clarice Starling, a fledgling FBI agent assigned by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychiatrist doing time in a maximum security facility. There's a serial killer on the loose dubbed Buffalo Bill, who has been kidnapping innocent young women and taking portions of their skin. People often mention that this movie and its book are based on the legendary serial killer Ed Gein. It's not, but that aspect of the story is. As Clarice begins interviewing Lecter, she finds herself drawn further into the case and finds herself forming a sort-of friendship with Dr. Lecter. Now, this is a film that is much like "The Godfather" in the fact that it's been parodied endlessly ("Joe Dirt" and "Family Guy" have recently parodied this film), yet when we actually see the legendary scenes of the film we don't start laughing. Most people who haven't seen this film can still recite the lines "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again." This movie is not just filled with legendary portions of dialogue, but also legendary scenes. Notably, the introduction of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. This scene is simple, yet unforgettable. Clarice is walking down a hallway, to the final cell at the end. When Lecter is revealed, he is merely standing in his cell completely erect waiting for Starling. It's this kind of body language (among other things) that won Anthony Hopkins the Oscar. Few other actors have created characters that have had so much effect on our society (other examples would be Marlon Brando and Al Pacino). Ask someone to identify a line of dialogue from this film and it will either be the line I listed above or "I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti." This is a film in which Hopkins proved (much like Pacino did in "Dog Day Afternoon" and John Malkovich did in "Of Mice & Men") what a complete actor he is. In a lot of films you watch, you see an actor and think, "there's [insert name here]." When Lecter first appears, my thoughts were "there's Hannibal Lecter." Foster is also effective as Starling, considering she's in damn near every scene of the film. She's also the moral center of the film, as well as the protagonist. Hollywood is nervous about giving a woman the lead role, especially in a role that requires the woman to be both vulnerable and strong-willed at the same time. Foster does both and makes it completely believable. Ted Levine is one of the only actors who could've played Buffalo Bill (the only other actor I can think of that could have pulled off the role is John Malkovich). It's the voice mostly. Much like the line "I coulda been a contender" probably wouldn't have been much had it not been Brando who recited it. "The Silence of the Lambs" is a perfect film, at least of it's genre. The reason it has stood the test of time is for the same reason movies like "Pulp Fiction" and "Casablanca" have. Like those movies, every scene is absolutely necessary for the film to function as a whole. Howard Hawks once defined a great movie as "three great scenes and no bad scenes." "The Silence of the Lambs" has more than three great scenes, several legendary ones, and no bad scenes. After 16 years, more people still see this than they do its sequel and prequel "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon." I'm sure in 16 more years, it will still be seen more than those two films and it's recent 2nd prequel "Hannibal Rising."<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>What a masterpiece! There is not much more I can say that hasn't already been said about this movie!I think it will always stand out as an excellent thriller. I will say that Anthony Hopkins is simply Brilliant as Hannibal Lecter. There is no one else who could have played the role like he did, much less carry on 2 more movies..... Hannibal and Red Dragon. It is no wonder why he and Jodie Foster are both Oscar winners, for she gives an outstanding performance as Clarice Starling. Winner of 5 Academy Awards, this movie will always remain a true classic in every way. Hopkins is mezmorizing in his role. A non stop thriller with twists and turns that keep you glued to this movie. Hats off to Jonathan Demme for giving us a masterpiece than no one will ever forget!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme achieved movie perfection with his adaptation of Thomas J. Harris's novel about  brilliant, pathological, cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is interviewed by FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) in an attempt to find information about another serial killer currently terrorizing a multi-state region.  The critics obviously agreed, as this was the third movie in history to sweep all five of the top Oscar categories.  The true brilliance of the film lies in its ability to chill the viewer without the use of gore or special effects.  Hearing Dr. Lecter say, "Clarice" will always send chills up my spine.  His demand to get information about Clarice's personal history, in exchange for his help in the serial killer hunt, makes Dr. Lecter all the scarier as a villian.  He has some unforgettable lines in the movie (and Anthony Hopkins only required a mere cumulative 16 minutes of screen time to earn his Best Actor award for this role).  The viewer can't help but ask themselves why we (and Clarice) are all attracted to this charming man who eats people for fun.<br /><br />This movie has a well-deserved place in history, and it chills the viewer well, even a decade after its original release.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>Now this movie is really good and is not just the creep moments you get from watching it,the parts when clarice and lecter have conversations on who is killing girls arcoss america, makes you want more. The movie is long and very interesting because Clarice has to get information out of a psychopath to help her catch a man name buffalo bill who is skining girls for a reason ,but you'll have to fine out yourself why he does that.<br />The special Edition comes with lots stuff ,but watching the movie is enough if you ask me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Jonathan Demme.<br /><br />Cast:  Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Anthony Heald, Ted Levine, Tracey Martin, Charles Napier, Brooke Smith.<br /><br />Running Time:  121 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br /><br />Rivaling "Seven" as the best thriller of the decade, "Silence of the Lambs" is the quintessential blockbuster thriller, driven by marvelous performances, a polished, intelligent adaptation from the best-selling novel, stupendous cinematography, and a first-rate musical score.  Highly respected in the movie-making industry, the film is one of the few true horror/thrillers to ever win the Best Picture Academy Award (1991).  Tailored from Thomas Harris's incredibly popular novel with an unforgettably astute screenplay, "Silence of the Lambs" lunges into a world of madness, dread, and cannibalism never seen before on the big screen and is portrayed by director Jonathan Demme ("Philadelphia") in near-perfect fashion.<br /><br />Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster, in her best role since "Taxi Driver") is just a regular, hard-nosed wannabe FBI trainee-agent looking for her shot at the big time when she is summoned into the office of her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn), for a special task.  An unattainable, sex-demented serial killer (Ted Levine) who preys on obese women and whose media-given title as "Buffalo Bill" is still on the loose and is striking with an escalating frequency that Crawford will go to any lengths to get some answers.  When the daughter (Brooke Smith) of a successful politician shows up missing, the FBI feels amplified pressure to crack the case.  Crawford suggests to Starling that she investigate the matter by profiling a similar cannibalistic serial killer named Hannibal Lecter (performed perfectly by the talented Anthony Hopkins), who is now located at a maximum security prison and knows the ins and outs of the notorious Buffalo Bill.  As Clarice learns more and more about the anomalous killer from the horrific Lecter, she also has to confront her own inner demons in order to save future victims.<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" is superbly directed by Demme, who uses the camera as a painting canvas to illuminate the horrors that the human mind can produce, mixing spine-tingling close-ups, many accented long-shots, and one famous "night-vision" sequence to enhance the eerie ambiance.  Foster is truly brilliant, showing true performing range as a mixture of woman determinism and psychological sprite in search of internal peace.  Hopkins is shockingly delightful as the tongue-in-cheek maniac with a sly sense of humor, a mesmerizing lisp, and one intense thirst for human blood.  The screenplay adaptation by Ted Tally is pin-point and meticulously designed to pay homage to the exceptional novel, capturing the essence of the troubled young FBI agent and the sexual perplexity of our film's main antagonist.  A genuinely transfixing classic.  One of the finest of its kind-ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>Oh my, what a movie!  Young FBI trainee Clarice Starling(played by Jodi Foster) goes to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins) to learn more about the serial killer Buffalo Bull.  I think we all know the story, we have all seen the movie, but never has a movie had such an effect upon my mind.<br />There were scenes of gore, but the psychlogical effect of this movie runs deep, perhaps it is because we know that there are people out there like Dr. Lecter who prey upon our loved ones.<br />That is a scary thought! One that is always lingering in our minds even if we do not let it surface.<br />The acting was excellent, the story line chilling and the conclusion outstanding!  A great nail bitting movie right to the end!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>This movie is an intense study of a serial killer and the methods used by the FBI to track him.

Look inside the mind of a serial killer, with non-stop suspense - and you have one hell of a film.  Too frightening to watch on your own, this film boasts not only a well structured script, but fine performances all round.  <p>Jodie Foster stars as Agent Starling who &quot;consults&quot; with Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins) to work out the identity of a serial killer.  This is Jodie's finest film, and one which you will return to time and time again.<p>DVD SUMMARY:  Released now for the third time on DVD, after two attempts, which featured non-anamorphic transfers.  The latest edition features a 5.1 remix and a beautiful anamorphic transfer.  Missing however is the famed audio commentary from Foster which was one of the earlier DVD's.  Oneday we will get  a DELUXE version hopefully.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins deliver amazing performances as, respectively, Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent on the hunt for a serial killer called Buffalo Bill, and Hannibal Lector, an imprisoned killer whose psychiatric genius can provide valuable insights that may lead to Bill's capture.  Every element of this film is dead on.  Foster plays Clarice as sensitive and uncertain, yet brave, brilliant, and unwilling to succumb to her fears.  Hopkins gives a performance of such stunning power that the figure of Hannibal Lector immediately attained pop icon status.  Jonathan Demme's direction, incorporating numerous point-of-view shots, draws us right into the story and keeps the tension building.  Ted Tally's screenplay (from the Thomas Harris novel) cuts right to the essentials of the story and Howard Shore's score is atmospheric yet unobstrusive.  This is an essential film for anyone who enjoys horror or suspense./</p></br><a href="../users/A138826JMC0J3T.html">A138826JMC0J3T</a><br/><p>Easily one of the most notable and recognizable suspense thrillers, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS delivers each and every time.  It's a total psychological, suspense thriller that will intrigue you and even creep you out a little.<p>Jody Foster is Agent Clarice Starling and she's been assigned to find the mysterious serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill.  After doing some research on Buffalo Bill she finds out that he has a connection to imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lechter (Anthony Hopkins).  She has no choice but to trust the deranged psychologist because she'll need every bit of information she can get from him.<p>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is probably my favorite out of the trilogy (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON).  There isn't as much gore as there is in some other movies but this will creep you out from a psychological stand point.  This movie gets into your head a little and also into the mind of a serial killer.  Hopkins also puts on an outstanding performance as Hannibal Lechter.  He is simply amazing in this role.  Jody Foster is also very good in the role of Clarice Starling.<p>This is a hihgly recommended movie for all movie lovers, suspense thriller fams will definiarely get a kick out of this one.  Seriously, check out SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and also check out HANNIBAL.  You'll be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>I was lucky enough to buy my store's last copy of the Criterion Collection version of "Silence of the Lambs," which features, most notably, a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. This is, arguably, the best commentary track ever placed aside a grand film. None of the other DVDs have this feature.<p>If you can find this anywhere, grab it.<p>Foster talks about how she was intrigued by the feminist aspect of the role of Clarice Starling. An FBI agent who served as a consultant on the film chimes in with tales of true gore and how the film fared in its portrayal of FBI training. And Hopkins speaks of how he makes Lecter both endearing and creepy.<p>The movie itself looks great, still causes a chill and a thrill. But the commentary is to die for.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>This is the quintessential 'serial killer' film that other moviemaker's have been tirelessly attempting to emulate without success.<p>After viewing it again for the third or fourth time, there are aspects of the film that became prominent - subtle techniques in direction and photography, which has made the film a masterpiece. For example, take a close look at the camera's constant change in perspective: we are able to see the story from each character's point of view, adding to the film's many layers of meaning. From the start, we are introduced to Starling - a vulnerable and intelligent female fighting to compete in a male dominated environment. This, of course, creates an instant empathy for the character, and sets us up for the first terrifying meeting with Hannibal Lecter. We are also permitted to view the world from Hannibal's perspective, looking through the glass cage of his cell at the vulnerable, Clarice. We are also permitted to see the world through the eye's of Buffalo Bill - as he plays-out his fantasies of becoming a beautiful woman in front of the mirror in his home. These techniques in cinematography are meant to hook our attention and submerge our minds into its world. And it works beautifully.<p>The other significant ingredient in the film that contributed to its massive appeal, both critically and at the box office, was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. I've always been intrigued about Hannibal Lecter's appeal for so many people. What is it about this character that fascinates? He's educated, artistic, has good taste in the finer things in life - wine, music, and literature and exudes a feeling that he is one of those individuals that really knows how to live, and live well. The man has class. However he's also a monster, a killer who enjoys eating his victims. The appeal, I believe, is in the contradiction: we don't associate 'class' with calculated slaughter - it just doesn't make sense. Hopkins's interpretation of this literary character, too, is right on the mark. Hopkins has brought this disturbing character to life with such realism that we can't imagine anyone else as Hannibal Lecter. And any other actor attempting this role in the future would be doomed to failure.<p>This film won a score of Oscars, including best picture, directer, best actor and best actress. Jodie Foster has always been a pleasure to watch in her many performances over the years. Her performance as Special Agent Starling deserved the Oscar and all the critical acclaim she received.<p>~Silence of the Lambs~ has to be one of the great films of the twentieth century. I believe it out ranks its sequel and the prequel, (though these films are also well done) because everything from the screenplay to the soundtrack is first rate. This DVD should be owned and viewed at least once a year to demonstrate what the art of filmmaking can achieve. Brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Every so often there is a movie that really makes you sit up and take notice, something that restores your faith in the entire genre.  'Silence Of The Lambs' is just one of those movies, earning cult status and getting numerous awards.  It's an undeniably tense thriller that follows Clarice Starling (Foster) as she trails a serial killer nicknamed 'Buffalo Bill', who has kidnapped a senator's daughter and murdered several before her.  When all leads seem to have dried up she turns to Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lectre (Hopkins), a dangerous serial killer and psychologist who Buffalo Bill has been writing to for help.  However, he'll only give Clarice information if she'll talk about herself, her career and her upbringing.<p>It's not so much the story that is groundbreaking here rather than the way in which it mounts up tension so precisely.  Whilst there are admitedly several violent scenes here it will be the meetings between Clarice and Hannibal that will really make your hair stand on end.  Foster and Hopkins give the performances of their career as a young officer eager to impress and an eloquent killer respectively.  There are no characters that fail to make an impression and this is perhaps the movie's strongest point in that all its characters have become so instantly recognisable in movie lore.<p>With its gritty and compelling photography, 'Silence Of The Lambs' is very different to both its prequel 'Manhunter' and the much glossier 'Hannibal'.  It is often regarded as one of the best thriller/horror movies ever made, and rightly so.  Not only is it scary but it's also gripping and intelligent.  It is a memorable movie that impresses on every level.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>Over the last couple of years, it seems the major studios have taken the hint from Criterion and decided to release the kind of &quot;special edition&quot; discs they made famous. As a proud owner of the Criterion release of Silence of the Lambs, I almost passed on this one. But I had a feeling about it, since it sports a new Hi-Definition, anamorphic transfer and Dolby 5.1 sound, as well as a new documentary and its own collection of deleted scenes. I was not disappointed by the purchase. While it is missing the wonderful Criterion commentary track, the documentary is surprisingly good; the deleted scenes - one in particular with Hopkins doing a surreal monologue about what makes a serial-killer tick - are quite illuminating. The picture looks great. The sound has greater definition, too - I can actually hear nuances in the orchestration of Howard Shore's moody background score that are simply lost in the Criterion release. As for the film itself - by now, everyone knows that it's a Campbell-esque &quot;hero's journey&quot; dressed up as a gothic horror/suspense yarn. Unusually, the hero is a woman - FBI agent trainee Clarice Starling (played by the deservedly Oscar-winning Jodie Foster). Her humanity is played against the rather baroque extremes of self-loathing serial killer Jame Gumb (Ted Levine), who kills women and skins them to make himself a &quot;girl suit&quot; and escape his identity. It is a meditation on institutional sexism as much as anything else, as Clarice must fight the continued &quot;little woman&quot; stereotyping and perverted leering of her almost exclusively male coworkers. The subtext rather uncomfortably reminds us that the serial killer's behavior is really just an extreme version of what often passes as normal &quot;boys will be boys&quot; behavior in the &quot;real&quot; world. In this respect, Silence of the Lambs is, paradoxically, a very feminist film about men who destroy women because they - again, paradoxically - hate their own male-ness and see it as a fraud. Except for Dr. Hannibal Lecter (the brilliant, also Oscar-winning Anthony Hopkins). He does not hate women any more or less than men. He hates rudeness, and is an equal-opportunity killer. The grim joke is that he is the most civilized and humane male character in the film: he treats Clarice with courtesy and respect. Hannibal is like the Shadow Self inside all of us - that vampiric character who stands at the end of the long, dark hallway of our nightmares, the one with the quiet, insinuating, evil voice. In Thomas Harris' novel of Hannibal, he becomes Clarice's shadow in an almost literal sense, and she learns to embrace him. But we can't have that in the movies, so Silence of the Lambs restricts its focus to the mythic/heroic aspect of the story, which ends up working very well, if it also ends up lacking a certain edginess or depth present in the novels. I would recommend buying this disc along with Hannibal, then watching the two films one right after the other, to get the full effect. Thomas Harris, in his novels, did not want us to get so hung up on Clarice as a hero that we missed the bigger picture about the seduction, corruption, and eventual purification of the human soul. Both films of his Clarice Starling books aim a lot lower, but they do manage to hit their somewhat reduced targets.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>In a marketing no-brainer, MGM  Home Entertainment has dove-tailed a new version of the Oscar-winning &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, &quot;Hannibal.&quot; &quot;Lambs&quot;  is offered in both a widescreen and full-screen version (the widescreen disc has a 1:85:1 aspect ratio). The release follows the Criterion and Image versions of 1998. It is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital but offers little punch in the rear sound mix. My disc required more of a volume push than most. The muted greens that saturate the film are adequately rendered and there are almost no signs of wear in the transfer. By far the better film of the two, it unfortunately comes with fewer extras and goodies than its sequel. Watching Anthony Hopkins' work in &quot;Lambs&quot; after viewing &quot;Hannibal&quot; only adds to appreciation of his decade-old performance. Hopkins was little known in the States when he took the role and, of course, it took him to stardom. Hopkins' original Lecter is a ghostly presence, lean and powerful, with cat-like movements that sell his sexuality and menace. Jodie Foster plays her Clarice as a young woman still exploring her world and the potential of her sexual powers. Tak Fujimoto's camera loves her, in shades of Hitchcock's female stars. In the DVD's accompanying new documentary, production designer Kristi Zea cites the art of Francis Bacon as an inspiration for much of the film's visuals. Other souces were photos of the Nuremberg trials and the fouled home of real-life serial killer Ed Gein. The &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; documentary tells of a surprising party atmosphere on the set, with none of the traditional supernatural intrusions that seem to befall most shoots of this type (according to their publicists). Most of the interviews are contemporary, although Foster's footage appears dated. Hopkins goes on at length about his thinking behind the Lecter character -- &quot;I knew that he was the shadowy figure inside all of us.&quot; Special features include some great clips of Hopkins trying out a series of masks for Hannibal, 20 minutes of (routine) deleted scenes, a making-of featurette from 1991 and an outtake reel. There is no director's commentary track.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>A truly brilliant film worthy of the five major Oscars it won:  Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay.  In bringing Thomas Harris' blood curdling novel to the screen, director Jonathan Demme keeps everything moving and adding some truly creepy atmospheric touches.  Jodie Foster is marvelous as FBI agent Clarice Starling who enters into a bond with notorious serial killer Hannibal Lechter in trying to uncover the identity of Buffalo Bill, another heinous killer on the loose.  Anthony Hopkins won his Oscar for a little over 16 minutes of screen time, making him the only actor to win the big prize with the shortest screen time.  However, his performance is so mesmerizing and chilling he is unforgettable.  Scott Glenn offers fine support as Jack Crawford, Foster's boss whose respect and subtle admiration for her character spearheads her chase.  Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he is perfect as the demented killer.  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS spawned two rather inferior sequels, but this film is picture perfect from start to finish.

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is deservedly a legend, which was followed by three sequels (chronologically, the film occurs after it's second sequel, RED DRAGON).  Let me try to sum up my good thoughts in words.  Jonathan Demme turns this from a masterpiece to a work of art with his outstanding direction and intriguing Point-of-View shots; Ted Tally writes the creepy, intelligent screenplay; then there's a short but very nice score by Howard Shore.  Foster is at her best and portrays the character better than anyone else could try; Scott Glenn is good as her section chief, and Anthony Heald is good as the annoying and ignorant Dr. Chilton; Levine is very good as well, and brings out the character just as he should be.  But the true highlight of the film is Anthony Hopkins as polite and genius Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter; Hopkins gives his best performance and one of the best performances ever captured on film - there is no doubt in my mind Hannibal Lecter is the ultimate villain.  THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS must be seen to believed.  Make sure you take a bite out of this artful masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>This is certainly one of my favorite scary movies. It has great acting and a great story. Highly recommended for any horror movie fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>For many years I refused to see this film, as some friend had told me about the cannibalistic scenes.<br /><br />At the same time I received many laudatory comments about the movie.<br /><br />Finally I was able to overcome my repugnance and give a sight to this opus.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed; "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991) is a great suspense film that keeps the viewers eating their nails from the very start.<br /><br />The story chronicles the strange relationship between young Special Agent Clarence Starling and jailed mad genius Dr. Hannibal "Cannibal" Lecter.<br /><br />Dr. Lecter gives Sterling clues to discover who is another demented serial criminal known as "Buffalo Bill" who has just kidnapped a Senator's daughter.<br /><br />The film follows the tortuous puzzle constructed by Hannibal and how Clarence is able to clear it up step by step paying the cost imposed by the psycho.<br /><br />Awarded with five Oscar, including Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Director and nominated for two more, "The Silence" is an unforgettable experience.<br /><br />Judy Foster as Agent Sterling confirms all her artistically virtues shown since she was a teenager in "Taxi Driver" (1976), her first Oscar nomination, thru "The Accused" (1988), her first Oscar award, the present film and finally, by the moment, "Nell" (1994).<br /><br />The other Oscar Monster is Anthony Hopkins, winner of one for this movie and nominated three more times: "The Remains of the Day" (1994), "Nixon" (1995) and "Amistad" (1997). He fleshes Dr. Lecter with such sinister accuracy that his memory still haunts me.<br /><br />IMHO this is the best film directed by Jonathan Demme, closely followed by "Philadelphia" (1993), light year away in quality from more recent "The Manchurian Candidate".<br /><br />This film is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen! I will recommend it only for adult audiences due to very violent scenes.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Fear.  Many things or people can evoke this emotion, many of the most popular movies of all time feature villains that provoke this emotion from their prey.  Darth Vader, Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, but one of the names that will always evoke fear, and is a more realistic villain, is none other than Dr. Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.  After the successful adaptation of Thomas Harris' first novel featuring the psychotic Lecter, "Red Dragon", though the first movie based on the novel was called "Manhunter", it was later remade with Anthony Hopkins in the title role in the movie "Red Dragon", it was really no big surprise that MGM began working on a film based on the second book by Thomas Harris featuring Lecter, "The Silence of the Lambs".<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" takes place directly where the movie "Red Dragon" left off.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) had just finished helping Will Graham, the FBI agent who imprisoned him, catch the killer known as 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Now, Lecter is being visited by an FBI agent-in-training, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who was sent by her superiors to interview Lecter, and hopefully gleam some insight from him about the motives of a new serial killer calling himself, 'Buffalo Bill'.  However, the only way Lecter will help Starling is if she will answer his questions in regards to her life.  But, the deeper Lecter probes , forcing Clarice to face demons long-since buried, the stronger the fascination Lecter has for Clarice grows.  Will Clarice and the FBI gain enough insight from Lecter to stop 'Buffalo Bill', or is Lecter merely using them to accomplish his own means?<br /><br />Terrific directing on behalf of Jonathan Demme, and outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, "The Silence of the Lambs" is by far one of the most shocking, suspenseful thrillers ever to be made.  Winning over both audiences and critics alike, "The Silence of the Lambs" earned every one of its 5 academy awards, including Best Picture.  If you are a fan of thrillers, or of the novels by Thomas Harris, or if you enjoyed "Red Dragon", then "The Silence of the Lambs" is definitely a must-see!<br /><br />"The Silence of the Lambs" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>When I was ten years old, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was released in theaters.  I heard a lot of &quot;buzz&quot; about it, therefore heightening my curiosity.  I begged my mom to let me watch it.  She always said &quot;no&quot;.  It took two years for her to finally say &quot;yes&quot;.  I rented it that day.  After I watched it, I realized it was worth the wait.<p>&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a work of genius.  Who knew that a thriller can contain such level of quality?  The writers have a very creative mind as expressed in this movie.  Few other movies can chain an unusual chain of events and an unusual personality and make it fit so perfectly.  It blends with the rest of the movie smoothly.  This movie was well-deserving of all five Oscar wins, including Best Picture.  However, it should have won more.<p>Anthony Hopkins was terrific in his Oscar winning role as the infamous imprisoned serial killer Hannibal Lector.  This is his best acting in his career.  Jodie Foster was the perfect casting choice for her Oscar winning role as the determined FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling.  Their chemistry is perfect, even with a glass wall between them.  The role of &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; by Ted Levine is wonderful.  <p>Every scene will keep one watching closely guessing what will happen next.  Therefore, one can watch it everyday for twelve years and still find new reasons to love it.  Though, those who are offended by graphic violence and images may be disturbed by certain scenes.  Those who are not will have no problem discovering why &quot; The Silence of the Lambs&quot; will be a classic.  Of the Hannibal Lector trilogy, this is the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>"The Silence of the Lambs" needs no introduction.  A masterfully told suspense/thriller with a diabolical twist ending, this is the movie that made cannibals cool and reinvented the careers of both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is, of course, Hannibal Lecter, the psychiatrist who ate his patients and is serving out a life sentance in a maximum security, clinical facility.  Foster is Clarise Starling, a fledgling FBI agent sent to pick apart Hannibal's mind (no pun intended) when copy cat crimes start surfacing.<br />MGM's remastering effort of this important movie is nothing short of a revelation.  Both Criterion and Image tried to give us an adequate print.  Neither were anamorphically enhanced and both suffered from insufficient contrast levels, shadow delineation and color separation.  This DVD fixes all of those problems.  The image quality throughout is superb.  Colors are well balance.  Film grain is kept to a minimum.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are nonexistant.  The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is incredibly stirring, especially in its music tracks.<br />Extras: a really great documentary that, unfortunately does not involve the participation of Jodie Foster (what's with her any way?), some deleted scenes and test footage round out the extras, including bios, theatrical trailers, television spots and an audio commentary track.  Three cheers.  Much better than Criterion's bare bones junket and far less expensive!<br />BOTTOM LINE: A DEFINITE MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES FAVA BEANS OR JUST BEING SCARED IN THE DARK!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>Well, I finally went out and got the special edition of "The Silence of the Lambs."  I wasn't really planning to, because I had already bought the movie two times before.  The first time was when it first came out on DVD, which was a pretty lousy copy.  Low quality video and sound, almost no extra features, and so on.  Then, I bought the Criterion Collection version, and it was indeed an improvement.  It didn't have a lot of special features, but it had a few.  And the picture and sound was much better.<p>So why did I finally break down and buy this version?  Well, after re-visiting "Hannibal" after seeing "Red Dragon," I realized how much I really loved this film.  And, I also learned that it was remastered in a high-definition 16x9 anamorphic transfer and 5.1 Surround Sound.  So, I finally broke down and purchased this copy.  Plus, I knew that I could still keep my Criterion version, because it had features such as commentary that is unavailable on this version.  Overall verdict: I ended up very happy that I bought this version, because it is far superior to the other two.<p>Before I get into the DVD aspect of the film, allow me to recap the story for those who are unfamiliar with the story.  I'm sure that number is very small, but I might as well just in case.  Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, an FBI agent in training.  One of her first assignments is to talk to a vicious serial killer, known as Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter, hoping to get into the mind of a killer to catch another who is on the loose.  But it isn't going to be easy, for Hannibal has an agenda of his own, and he loves to get into the minds of others.  This all adds up to a terrifying and nightmarish thriller that you will never forget.<p>The acting is outstanding.  Jodie Foster does her part justice in every way.  And Anthony Hopkins is amazing as Hannibal.  Who would've thought that he could play such a terrifying role?  You could tell that he was having fun with it.  The director did a great job of painting us a picture full of darkness, nightmares, and dread.  Ted Tally did a terrific job of writing a script that was very true to the novel (he also returned to write the screenplay for "Red Dragon").<p>And now, for the DVD.  This version of the film is quite an improvement on all different fronts.  The picture is crystal clear and you can swear that you're seeing things you never saw before.  The lightness and darkness is perfect.  The sound is also a big improvement; loud when it's supposed to be and quiet when it's supposed to be.  There are many special features, which include a brand new documentary that includes new interviews with the cast and crew, 20 minutes of deleted scenes, the original 1991 "Making of" featurette, an outtake reel, trailers, and many more where that came from.  I really enjoyed watching the documentary and interviews; especially the new ones made specifically for the DVD.  They are really interesting.  But I really enjoyed all of the special features.  (Just remember if you have the Criterion version, keep it, since this newer version does not include commentary from the cast and crew.)<p>So, I was very happy to finally break down and buy this new and improved version of an ultimate and frightening classic, "The Silence of the Lambs."  It still remains as one of my favorites (would have to be if I bought the movie three times!).  If this is one of your favorites as well, then I recommend getting it.  It is really a big improvement in many different ways.<p>Oh yeah, if you've never seen the movie, don't go in expecting a horror movie.  A lot of people have been saying it's a good movie but it's a bad horror film.  I really do not consider this a horror movie.  I think of it more as a dark thriller.  When I think of "horror," I think of all of the Freddy and Jason movies.  Then again, that's just me.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>I'm repeating some of what a previous reviewer said about this DVD because I completely agree.<p>&quot;First the commentary is very good. They mix five different people onto one track.&quot; Although I would have liked  them to be in the same room, which was probably difficult to schedule with  the number of busy people who give commentary. The deleted scenes are okay.  They were all scenes in the film only in shorter versions. They seemed to  be mostly cut for length. Some deleted scenes from other DVD's would have  changed the whole feeling, pace and tone of a film, these, for the most  part, do not. &quot;Finally, the Documentary material on the disk is  interesting but don't get too excited about it - it's nothing you couldn't  find on the internet with about 15 seconds worth of  effort.&quot;<p>&quot;Now about the two features the disk is lacking which  I think are serious short comings: No Subtitles and no Trailer.&quot;  <p>Overall, I think a poor value for what you get. Is it worth the money?  Not in my book, there are better Criterion Collection DVD's out there. If  you love the film though you will like the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Special Edition(Widescreen) 2001 MGM release of Silence of the Lambs.......<br />  Want to be scared out of your wits??This film will do that for you! Want to see it on an outstanding DVD.  This one is top quality!<br />  This film was probably the scariest ever to win the Best Picture(1991) Oscar. I don't think it was the most violent though, that honor most certainly goes to Braveheart. But Silence is just not a good scarey story.It's much more than that. It's an excellent film in all respects. Expert Direction by Jonathan Demme(recieving Best Director) and Cinematography by Tak Fujimoto really is what set this film apart from the others. The stars, Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster(also both oscar winners for their performances), Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, Brook Smith, and Anthony Heald, all were expert in their craft at making these characters either scare us or empathize with them.<br /><br />  For those who by chance have not seen it, here's a little taste of what were treated to. Clarice Starling is an agent in training with the F.B.I. She is bright,pretty and has a way of knowing how to handle people. She is sent out on an "errand" of sorts. To interview a serial killer, known as "Hannibal the Cannibal". He was an esteemed brillant psychiatrist and seems to be able to look into peoples souls. He may be able to help in supplying information to help catch another very demented serial killer nicknamed "Buffalo Bill" because of his desire to skin his victims.<br /><br />  Hannibal takes a shine to Agt. Starling and will help her, but he wants something from her. For his own demented reasons, he wants to hear the details of her life, and as they exchange information, she is then forced to deal with the memories that have plagued her throughout her life. He provides her with clues to who the killer on the loose might be and she goes after him , providing us with some very tense,hide your eyes, nail biting situations.Does she have the will to take on this psychopath as well as her own demons? And don't forget about Hannibal, the story wouldn't be complete, without showing us what atrocities he's capable of.<p>This dark psychological thriller will stay with you for a long time. It has an effect that really makes you think about it for quite a while. This film was released in Feb of 1991 and still was well remebered at Oscar Nomination time. That's not something you see to often.<p>  Altough not the more expensive editon,I was not only thrilled by this film, but also with this top quality transfer to the MGM DVD. The picture in the anamorphic widescreen presentation(There is another edition in full screen if you prefer) was beautiful. Colors and clarity excellent,even in the darker scenes. The 5.1 Surround sound is terrific. You can hear everything. I even heard what "Multilple Miggs" in the cell next to Hannibal's was saying, and I never heard that on my tape(that wore out). The Music by Howard Shore sounds great and is always there but unobtrusive to the intenseness of the story. There are some really great "extras". There are documentaries including one with lots of commentary by the stars and all the crew,lots of deleted scenes,photo gallery, trailers, and more. It can be watched in French or Spanish and there are also subtitles for those who may need them.<p>  This is a great addition to your DVD collection and for the price you can't go wrong.<p>So "have a friend for dinner" and enjoy this together....Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) is a star pupil at the FBI training academy when her mentor, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) pulls her out of training to help assist on a case. Jack is the head of the Behavioral Science Unit of the FBI and he wants Clarice to interview Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) regarding a case about a serial killer. Hannibal is known as Hannibal the Cannibal for his horrific murders in which he practiced cannibalism on his victims.<br /><br />Jack thinks that Hannibal, who is a psychiatrist, could help in solving a case involving a new serial killer called Buffalo Bill by using his insight into serial killers and psychiatry. Buffalo Bill kills women and skins parts of their bodies. Hannibal is angry that Jack sent a newbie young woman agent to try to entice him to talk. He won't help but when Clarice is leaving and is soiled by one of the other prisoners he agrees to help her. Hannibal's clues lead her to evidence of an old murder and to a possible link between Hannibal and Buffalo Bill. Hannibal's leads help the investigation but also turn into severe complications....<br /><br />This movie is about the evil that men can do and of a young agent becoming exposed to the world of the criminally insane. Many scenes are macabre and horrifying so if you don't like those types of movies then you should consider if this movie is for you. It is truly a crime and horror classic movie and the acting is superb. The story line is very tightly done and directed expertly and the movie was a box office hit as well as the winner of multiple academy awards.<br /><br />It is a very good movie and I recommend it to you, just remember it is deep and ghastly film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Very rarely does a horror film find it's way into mainstream Hollywood. Most thrillers are big money makers, but much of the movie-going public would never admit to loving a horror film, or being ardent fans of the genre. None of this was true, however, for "The Silence of the Lambs". People to this day admit to loving the film and expressing the fact that it is one of their favorite motion pictures. Horror movies got a new respect after the release of "Silence", but many producers continued producing the garbage that we became accustomed to. "The Silence of the Lambs" was an original, unlike anything we have ever seen before.<br /> The film stars Jodie Foster, who's working as a student for the FBI, and gets an assignment with the Buffalo Bill Murders in the northeast, where women are being brutally killed. It is up to her to try to drain information from Hannibal Lecter, played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins, who is in captivity for being a murderer himself.<br /> The film is graphic, horrifying, but amazingly perfect. The script, acting, and the superb direction would all lead the film to sweep the Oscars in 1991, winning the top four major awards that year. It won acting accolades for its two stars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Perkins, and the movie won for direction, and rare for a horror film, it won Best Picture.<br /> The film transfer is impeccable, and the sound excellent. There are a ton of DVD extras, including interviews with the stars, trailers, and the packaging is one of the best I have seen for a movie release. A wonderful edition to any film library.<br /> The film would also spawn sequels like "Hannibal" and "The Red Dragon", as well as a prequel called "Hannibal Rising", depicting how Hannibal became a killer. If your a fan of "The Silence of the Lambs" pick up all 3 DVD's: they are wonderful pieces of cinematic work.<br /> Pick up the novel in which the movie is based on by Thomas Harris, also called "Silence of the Lambs". Don't read it alone though!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>This review will discuss the merits of the now rare and out of print Criterion Collection version of the film. One of the questions a viewer needs to ask him or herself is whether or not the added expense of a rare edition can be justified.<br /><br />The Criterion dics presents the film in a letter boxed widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 which appears to be the correct shooting format used by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. The sound is standard 2.0 Dolby Surround. This is a fairly new film and the Criterion transfer appears to be reference quality. I have heard that there is an inexpensive collector's edition by MGM that presents the transfer as a widescreen anamorphic with a 5.1 surround mix. For pure picture quality either way you go is probably fine.<br /><br />There is really no reason to discuss the plotting of the film. It is well recognized that the acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins as the two leads is amazing. Both went on to win Academy Awards for their work. The Ted Talley screenplay was also give the Oscar for iis adaptation of the Thomas Harris source material.<br /><br />The biggest feature of the Criterion Edition is a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Talley and FBI agent John Douglas. As far as I can tell this is the only edition that offers a commentary track. The track is informative and is a good listen. The Criterion Disc features seven deleted scenes taken from a workprint (timecode is included). Most of these scenes are unnecessary but two reveal a dropped plotline that is rather interesting. The rest of the film extras include storyboard galleries and a storyboard to film comparison of the Memphis jail break.<br /><br />Two rather interesting features are pure textual. There is a lengthy series of excerpts from the FBI Field Classification Manual on Sexual Homicide prepared by John Douglas ans a feature called Voices of Death which is a series of quotes by convicted seriel killers prepared by Michael Newsom from his book. All in all these features  compose a great deal of material on the criminal mind and should not be skipped.<br /><br />The Criterion Disc is well suited to fans of the film or to those with an interest in the subject matter. It is also well worth seeking out for the Criterion completist.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Silence of the Lambs is still a top-notch horror film. The acting is superb, Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are dynamite together even though the don't have a lot of scenes together. Ted Levine is the creepiest serial killer of all-time as Buffalo Bill. Not for the faint-hearted, definitely one to watch! Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>In a movie reviewed a million times, I have only questions. Who are the idiots who are forever saying that this movie is historical fact? What institutions did they escape from? How and who captured Dr. Lechter in the first place? As good as the movie is, am I the only person in the world who thinks both actors have done better work in other films? If Lechter is right about Crawford's sexual attraction to Starling, wouldn't he have had her around him at every opportunity? For my buck, I"m much more uneasy about "Buffalo Bill" than Lechter. You? Does anyone doubt that Lechter has his arch enemy for dinner? I"m still fuzzy about a killer who prefers rotund women and the significance of Chinese butterfly eggs. Explanation of these two parts of the puzzle? Finally, any truth to the rumor that this film is in the top 10 of all time in box office receipts? I say "no way".</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>Great film,great 2-DVD set from MGM,(the out of print Criterion Collection is also great because of the audio commentary NOT included on this set,Criterion I guess,would'nt share)But this great 2-DVD set includes lotsa tasty (no pun intended) exclusive DVD extras to savor!!!

A+</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme's superb adaptation of Thomas Harris's petrifying page turner makes for an equally riveting, disturbing film. Foster is note-perfect as Starling, a driven but inexperienced operative struggling mightily not to appear both terrified and out of her depth. And Hopkins's seething, malevolent Lecter makes the knife-wielding Norman Bates in "Psycho" look like a boy scout. Ted Levine is also suitably deranged and bizarre as Buffalo Bill, adding further to the goose bump count. One of the more potent shockers out there, "Silence" is not for the squeamish, but those who can take it will love it. The film won a slew of major Oscars, including Picture, Actor, Actress- and earned them all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>one of my most favorite films of all time, The Silence Of The Lambs is a terrfying look into the mind of one of the most diabolical villians of all time, Hannible Lecter. Clarice Starling is a FBI trainee who is assigned by her boss Jack Crawford, to help in the case of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who skins his victoms. in order to do that, she must get the help of criminal mastermind Hannible Lector. it is then Clarice will enter the mind of the good docter and will experience something so horrifying, she will never be the same again. Jodie Foster is at her prime in this film, perfectly embodying the strong and fearless Clarice but the film definently belongs to Anthony Hopkins who's potrayl of Hannible Lector is spine chilling yet sophisticated, giving him that sense that he is always four steps ahead of you and that you are powerless against him. the rest of the cast also deliver great performances and the movie makes a flawless adaptation from book to big screen. sure, the Lector series has gone a bit stale in the past sixteen years since it was made but despite that, this film is the real deal and will leave you breathless by the end. so one of my favorite films, enjoy the delicacy known as the Silence of the Lambs.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims. Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around. You really don't know what either character is thinking. Very disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>I can't believe I never reviewed The Silence of the Lambs yet, simply because it is in my top 10 favorite movies ever made. Despite my father's best efforts to keep me from seeing it when it released, I still got my chance and I still love this movie like no other in my collection. I've always been fascinated with serial killers and this movie fueled my fascination even further.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can only assume you've either been living in a cave this whole time, or you were too young to watch it when it came out. Either way, if you're one of the few people on this planet who has not yet watched it, go now. With so many reviews covering the plot, I won't go there, but if you like thrillers and serial killers and you've never seen this, you won't regret it. It's one you should own, not rent. It's timeless and amazing and it's worth it just for Hopkins' performance alone. Red Dragon and Hannibal were interesting and fun as well, but they have nothing on Silence of the Lambs. It will always stay in my top 10 favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This is the only movie I've ever seen that has actually scared me.

She seeks advice on clues from a cannibalistic criminal genius named Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), it later turns into a relationship that turns twisted. Buffalo Bill's latest captive victim is a senator's daughter named Catherine (Brooke Smith) and now Clarice must find the sick freak before it's too late.<br /><br />A brilliant psychological thriller that probes into the minds of viewers ever since it's release. Based on the same book by Thomas Harris, this is a great movie that combines horror with some gory violence, fantastic performances and intelligence. Hannibal Lector became a household name thanks to this movie, but this wasn't the first movie with him in it but in fact it was 1986's "Manhunter" that introduced Hannibal Lector before Anthony Hopkins played the role. It's a cold, cruel and thrilling motion picture from Jonathan Demme that won the 1992 academy awards for best picture and it's score by Howard Shore is excellent as well, it's a class act masterpiece.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD offers excellent picture and sound. The extras are terrific such as "Inside The Labyrinth: Silence of the Lambs" Documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, deleted scenes, original 1991 making of featurette, Hannibal Lector phone message, Outtake reel, 2-part "From Page to Screen" documentary, photo gallery, trailer and TV Spots.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>FBI Trainee Clarice Starling (Oscar-Winner:Jodie Foster) is recruited by her Boss-Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to attempt to be Learn to the Brillant Sick Mind of Cannibal-Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).

It is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital but offers little punch in the rear sound mix. My disc required more of a volume push than most. The muted greens that saturate the film are adequately rendered and there are almost no signs of wear in the transfer. By far the better film of the two, it unfortunately comes with fewer extras and goodies than its sequel. Watching Anthony Hopkins' work in &quot;Lambs&quot; after viewing &quot;Hannibal&quot; only adds to appreciation of his decade-old performance. Hopkins was little known in the States when he took the role and, of course, it took him to stardom. Hopkins' original Lecter is a ghostly presence, lean and powerful, with cat-like movements that sell his sexuality and menace. Jodie Foster plays her Clarice as a young woman still exploring her world and the potential of her sexual powers. Tak Fujimoto's camera loves her, in shades of Hitchcock's female stars. In the DVD's accompanying new documentary, production designer Kristi Zea cites the art of Francis Bacon as an inspiration for much of the film's visuals. Other souces were photos of the Nuremberg trials and the fouled home of real-life serial killer Ed Gein. The &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; documentary tells of a surprising party atmosphere on the set, with none of the traditional supernatural intrusions that seem to befall most shoots of this type (according to their publicists). Most of the interviews are contemporary, although Foster's footage appears dated. Hopkins goes on at length about his thinking behind the Lecter character -- &quot;I knew that he was the shadowy figure inside all of us.&quot; Special features include some great clips of Hopkins trying out a series of masks for Hannibal, 20 minutes of (routine) deleted scenes, a making-of featurette from 1991 and an outtake reel. There is no director's commentary track. (I would recommend the widescreen version, BTW.)</p></br><a href="../users/A34W7QA4J5UTOR.html">A34W7QA4J5UTOR</a><br/><p>This is a heady thriller that was made way before its time.  Not a lot of action and no explosions, but the viewer sits riveted to the screen nonetheless.  A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>"Silence of the Lambs" is the only movie that truly scares the living daylights out of me. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lector is simply spine-tingling and compelling. I can't fathom anyone else playing the role of our favorite cannibal. I get goosebumps when mentions about eating fava beans with a glass of chianti. I still get creeped out when Hannibal escapes from that makeshift jail. That scene outgrosses any scene in any given modern day horror movie. In fact I can't really watch the moment Hannibal escapes without covering my eyes. Jodie Foster is awesome in her portray of Clarice Sterling. I like how her character handles herself while amidst a group of male cops at a funeral. You rarely see a female role in movies where she doesn't take any kind of (nonsense)from male authority. Clarice Sterling is one of those rare characters. In conclusion, there isn't a movie like "Silence of the Lambs" that can stand the test of time and remain one of the scariest and intense films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>I really think it would be a good idea to admit that one cannot judge director Jonathan Demme's THE SILENCE BY THE LAMBS by saying that it's a scary movie or not. This point of view is so personal and is so depending  on your peculiar history that it cannot be relevant here. I'm not able to  tell you that the movie will frighten you a little bit, a lot or not at  all. I really don't know, that's it. And after all, who cares ?<p>As  always, the quality of the movie depends on what the director or, less  often, the screenplay writer has hidden behind the images shown and the  words spoken. Of course, the effort required from you is easier if you are  watching a Woody Allen movie because the quality of the dialogs has  sharpened your mind and you're not distracted by multiple car crashes or  noisy explosions. In the case of an atmospheric thriller like THE SILENCE  OF THE LAMBS, the nervous tension of your body due to the suspense of the  movie is certainly going to prevent you to discover all the secrets of the  film.<p>OK ! I'm not your schoolteacher, so I'm only going to give you a  hint or a key which, at least I hope so, will arouse your envy to watch THE  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS a second time. In numerous works of writers or film  directors, the theme of - The House - is often treated as a metaphor for  the human mind so why not have the courage to visit once again the house of  the serial killer and especially its cellar with the enormous superficies  lying under the basement. Good luck !<p>A DVD for your library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>In perhaps one of the most mind-bending mystery thrillers ever made, Clarice Starling is about to take a trip down memory lane that she has avoided all her life. A strong-willed, determined FBI trainee, she is sent to probe the mind of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who has been imprisoned for quite some time due to his cannibalistic tendencies. But as Clarice digs for what she is looking for, it is Dr. Lecter who will be probing her mind. <p>&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is, for the most part, a low-key film made into something grander by its enticing serial mystery and the psychological connections between its two main characters. Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, and the second in a series of films, director Jonathan Demme proves that he needs no Hollywood glamour and dazzle to keep our hearts pounding in unbelievable suspense. <p>Demme's cinematic journey takes us into the life of FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who has been sent by her superior to investigate the mind of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whose gruesome crimes have landed him in an underground maximum security prison. Her hope is to find some connection between Lecter and a new serial killer, who has left a string of dead women for authorities to find and puzzle over. <p>Lecter already knows the answer to this puzzle, as well as the killer's identity, yet he hides this vital information from Starling, who becomes desperate for clues. He begins asking her questions from her past in exchange for pieces of the puzzle, and while she may be coming closer to unveiling the mystery, her own psychological torment has only just begun. <p>That psychological focus is the centrifuge for the most intriguing moments of the film, the ones in which Lecter digs into her world to uncover her past pain. Rather than use special effects or fancy camera work to convey this, Demme keeps the camera tight on the eyes of Hopkins, who, in his best role yet, keeps his voice low, articulate and chilling. Foster, in turn, shows realistic fear and sadness in her face as her character comes to face her life's experiences. <p>The remaining plotlines of the story center around the murders and clues, and are no less involving than anything else the film serves up. The killer's identity is revealed to us from the beginning, but his whereabouts are puzzled over until the final confrontation in his basement. That scene, in which Foster must maneuver around in complete darkness, is an acting tour de force; Foster again portrays immense fear and paranoia in her character, and the result is spine-tingling. <p>Demme's attention to dark aspects of filming are spectacular. The movie is, for the most part, cast in shadow and dark light, giving the atmosphere a moldy, dismal appearance. The film contains a minimal amount of bloodshed, though scenes involving such violence are very effective. <p>&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is more about making us tremble than making us jump, and the result is electrifying and full of energy. Just as the film swept the Oscars, it also sweeps us into a terrifying journey into the mind of a killer, and that of his recent psychological test study, who discovers just how fragile the mind can be.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>If you are a serious movie lover, you must see this movie.  The DVD  transfer is very good, and you'll see facial expression details that could  not be seen on VHS (even with the best equipment).  END</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>The same declaration I made in my review of David Fincher's &quot;Seven&quot; applies here: I am a sucker for serial killer movies.  And what we've got here is the alpha and omega of serial killer movies, for it features not one but two distinctly drawn killers.  Each is terrifying in his own way, and the film's fascinating narrative device calls for one to help the FBI track down the other.  Also, like &quot;Seven&quot;, most of the violence occurs off camera, allowing the audience to conceive of a far greater image of terror than any camera can capture.<p>We all know Hannibal Lecter, don't we?  Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of creating one of my all-time favourite movie characters.  He is a curious mixture of charisma, grace, style, fierce intelligence, and wickedness, brought together with a series of fascinating and terrifying mannerisms.  Given all the hoopla surrounding Hopkins' performance, you'd think Hannibal was in every scene.  He is actually in relatively few.  Still, he easily manages to dominate the film.<p>Jodie Foster, on the other hand, is in almost every scene.  At one time I thought her performance as FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling was much less successful.  Sure, she managed to hold her own in the scenes with Hopkins, but I always thought her stilted and inconsistent.  With each viewing, though, I realize that that is precisely the point.  Throw yourself into a similar situation and see how controlled and composed you are.  Foster suggests the right amount of macho bravura and timidness (a tough chore for sure).  And her wandering accent, I now realize, subtly conveys much information about the character's personal history.<p>These two actors shine most in their scenes together.  Lecter, training his laser-like psychiatrist's eye on Starling's every weakness from behind the glass in his maximum-security prison cell.  She does her best to defend against his probing, while trying to extract some information for herself.  When one interview ended, I couldn't wait for the next one to begin.  The supporting actors, who would normally blend into the background when confronted by two titanic leads, all acquit themselves well.  The standouts are Scott Glenn as Clarice's FBI superior, and Ted Levine as the aforementioned &quot;other&quot; serial killer. <p>The rest of the movie has a lot to live up to in those Lecter-Starling scenes.  Thankfully, it does.  Thomas Harris' novel and Ted Tally's script deliver a story full of suspense and interest.  'Buffalo Bill' has kidnapped the Governor's daughter, and the authorities realize they only have a few days to rescue her.  What should amount to a cliched premise is heightened by Bill's unique obsessive fetish.  It is revealed slowly, and thus manages the rare feat of rewarding subsequent viewings.  Jonathan Demme's controlled and stylish directing never lets things get out of hand or too over the top, as is the danger in movies of this genre.  And he allows himself to set up several spectacular set pieces; visual delights that at once thrill and frighten you (I'm thinking specifically of one aftermath tableaux that utilizes melodramatic lighting, music, and Christ-like imagery to great effect).  All these elements combine to create a magnum opus that all the participants will be hard-pressed to equal.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Now we are at my favorite & considered by many to be the best of the Hannibal series Silence Of The Lambs released in 1991 big hit I know it got a lot of awards. This is 1 of those movies that I can agree with the critics on. Directed by Jonathon Demme who directed The Manchurian Canidate remake a few other he's directed a lot of documenteries but hasn't directed a lot that I know of & that is a shame cause has the knack for directing. It stars Anthony Hopkins as Dr Hannibal Lecter, Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford, Ted Levine as Jame Gumb AKA "Bufflo Bill" & Brooke Smith as Catherine Martin. Based off the Thomas Harris book. Story is FBI trainee Clarice Starling has been chosen by Director Jack Crawford to send some kind of Questionaire to Dr Hannibal Lecter it relates to finding "Bufflo Bill" a serial killer that remains at large so they will use Lecter just as they did in Manhunter & it will be more difficult for her seeing that she is a trainee the guy in the last movie was a veteran agent. Catherine Martin a girl who is going home sees this guy trying to get a couch into his van & he uses it to trick his victim knock her out. Crawford & Starling piece more of the puzzle together during an autopsy when they find a Death Head Moth in a the throat. They figure out he keeps the victim alive for 3 days. So Clarice lies to Dr Lecter about a transfer if she can save Catherine Martin she is the daughter of TN Senator Ruth Martin also Dr Chilton listens to the conversation there will be a transfer but to TN. There is a scene where we find out about Clarice's childhood which I guess is why it's called Silence Of The Lambs. Lecter eventually escapes his cell cause the prison he was transferred to is minimum security 1 he beets2 guards to death which 1 is played by Charles Naiper bad guy from 1st Blood Part II I love some Charles Naiper pwnage. LOL! Clarice pieces together the clues Lecter gave her it all leads to a man named Jame Gumb & she finds out he's trying to make a woman's suit which is weird & odd. We also get the Good Bye Horses scene which was kind of disgusting. Clarice goes to the house where Jame Gumb lives under an assumed name & she realizes that she's got him but he runs off goes to the basement cuts the power Gumb has Clarice in his sights using night vision goggles just as he gets his gun out Clarice turns around & shoots him dead. Catherine is safe during her graduation party she gets a phone call from Dr Lecter he tells her I won't be on long so you can't track it he say "I'm having an old friend for dinner." He followed Dr Chilton to the Bahamas which means he was Hannibal's next meal. Ok if I spoiled it don't get mad cause this movies has been out for 20 years which today is the annaversery. I have the Blu Ray which it the transfer is great. It has commentary Breaking The Silence. It has a featurette. I have seen all the deleted scenes which a couple should've stayed in there is a version where they added all the deleted scenes back in. Dino DeLaurntiis passed on producing cause of the failure of Manhunter he gave the rights to Orion. Brooke Smith gained 25 pounds for the role of Catherine Martin. The evnets do occur a few years after Manhunter but it ignors it & it's a loose sequel more of it's own movie. The filmakers were going to shoot a flashback scene when Clarice was talking about her runaway attempt but Jonathon Demme thought mentoning it worked just as well. The film originally was suppose to be released in October of 90. Jonathon Demme originally wanted Michelle Phiffer for the role of Clarice but she thought the movie was too violent. Some of the early drafts had the names changed for legal reasons. Michale Keaton Mickey Rourke were considered for the role of Jack Crawford. Christopher Lloyd Patrick Stewart Louis Gosssette Jr Jack Nickolson John Hurt & Robert De Niro were all considered for the role of Hannibal. Jonathon Demme said that there were 300 applicants for the role of Clarice. This was the only horror film to win an Oscar. Jonathon Demme did a great job. Anthony Hopkins was awesome. Jodie Foster was good. Ted Levine really studied this character. Scott Glenn was good. Brooke Smith didn't annoy me I cared about her character. So if you see this purchase & it is on TV quite a lot you can get  it cheap.</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>Won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

I say recent years because it's a 90's child and usually a film has to be 20+ years old before people start throwing the word classic around.  `The Silence of the Lambs' is, though, a classic.  It's that rare breed of film that elicits fear and dread as well as admiration, for the audience knows exactly what they are meant to feel and they embrace it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />`The Silence of the Lambs' revolves around a relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling and serial killer Hannibal `the cannibal' Lecter.  The fact that Clarice is looking for another serial killer still at large is really beside the point.  This movie is about Clarice and Hannibal, about their growing trust and their deep-seated emotional response to one another.  Hannibal is a horrifying man, a man who eats other humans, but Clarice is drawn to him in a way she cannot explain.  You can see this in her eyes, in the way she communicates with mere glances in his direction.  Clarice is scared and vulnerable and trying her hardest to prove herself in a field she feels less that comfortable with, but Hannibal sees something in her that excites him.  He sees a way that he can help her help herself and so he attacks her self esteem and her confidence, not in a malicious manner but in an attempt to better her.<br /><br />The fact does remain though that Clarice is using Hannibal.  She needs to find the killer Buffalo Bill; a man who kidnaps women, keeping them locked away for days while they moisturize their skin until he kills and skins them and then dumps their bodies.  He has just kidnapped yet another victim and so the clock is ticking for Clarice to unlock Hannibal's secrets in order to save a life.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Jodie Foster.  I felt that she was effective in `The Accused' but aside from that she has never really bolstered in me a growing curiosity.  Same can be said for her performance here, which is just not as impressive to me as many make it out to be.  I don't think she should have won the Oscar, both Susan Sarandon and especially Geena Davis was better suited for Oscar gold.  Her performance though, is not bad, and so I can't downgrade it too much.  It sells what it needs to sell, but it just wasn't Oscar-worthy in my humble opinion.  Anthony Hopkins is another story all together.  His performance was iconic, practically flawless.  The ticks that he associated to Lecter are just mesmerizing, the way he sucks in his words when he speaks to emphasize the corruption surrounding his superior intellect is astounding in every way.<br /><br />Jonathan Demme brilliantly created a film that gets under your skin and stays in your head.  It's gritty and raw and takes your breath away scene after scene.  There isn't really a film in this genre that can compare.  As a horror film goes it succeeds in sending shivers down the spine.  As a psychological thriller is succeeds in molesting the demons in your head and as a drama is succeeds in creating an atmosphere of the purest form and delivering satisfaction all around the table.  There are few films that reach the emotional as well as physical depth of `The Silence of the Lambs', a film that truly deserves the unbridled commendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />I actually read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.  Today, after a half-dozen viewings, I still find it fascinating.<br /><br />This movie is not for the squeamish and there is some extreme crudeness in the story but I suspect everyone knows that by now. What I've always liked best was the by-play between "Dr. Lecter" and "Clarice." The looks on Hopkins' face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.<br /><br />"Silence Of The Lambs" has turned into a modern-day "classic." If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Silence of the Lambs of a detective using a serial killer to catch another serial killer.

However, I had begged my parents to let me watch it. So, I put it on my Christmas list, and low and behold, it was sitting under my Christmas tree on December 25th. However, I did not watch it until today.<br /><br />A serial killer known as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) is kidnapping women across the Midwest and murdering them by skinning them alive. Baffled by these disturbing turn of events, the FBI sends trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) to interview a prisoner who could give anwers to the killer's motivations. That prisoner is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cannibal who is also a brilliant pyschologist who knows everything about the criminal mind. He agrees to help Clarice, but only if she divulges to him the dark details of her own life. But when Bill kidnaps the daughter of a renowned Memphis senator, Clarice cannot play this game any longer, for time is running out. This leads to a startling climax that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />"The Silence Of The Lambs" truly deserves the praise that is heaped upon it. It is one of if not the best suspense thrillers ever made. This film is so disturbing that one wonders if all this really happened (indeed, Buffalo Bill was actually an amalgam of several different real life serial killers).<br /><br />The acting is superb. Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice. She portrays this tough, courageous and fearful women like no one else can and she truly deserved the Best Actres Oscar. Ted Levine is so creepy that it actually makes you sick. Why he was not awarded is something I've pondered. Scott Glenn adds ample support in the lesser role of Clarice's boss, Jack Crawford. However, throughout, the whole film, our focus remains on Hopkins. As Lecter, Hopkins creates one of the single greatest performances in film history. You wait in anticipation for what he's going to say or do next. You are drawn into the mind of this man. One could never imagine that a man who eats people could be so likeable.<br /><br />the extra features I haven't watched yet, but they look great. Still, you should definitely watch the film first. It's worth it, trust me.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>You will never get over this movie no matter how hard you try.  Something about it will haunt you forever and make you very afraid of the world.  It spawned a million copycat books and films which couldn't hold a candle to it.  It lead Anthony Hopkins to a profitable career which lead him to star in about 25 films per year in every genre possible.  It did everything short of having the enrollment at Quantaco jump 400% and inpire a haircut called "The Jodie".  But this was a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Jodie Foster plays Clarise, an FBI trainee who is assigned by the head of Behavioral Science to study an asylum patient by name of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  This odd errand has an ulterior motive, as the FBI is curious to know if he knows anything about a serial killer who has been looming around the Midwest known only as Buffalo Bill.  Once a senator's daughter, Catherine Martin, is kidnapped by Buffalo Bill, Clarise and the FBI descend on Dr. Lecter as their only possible resource, anxiously seeking information.  Lecter is a monster, a completely evil, horrible monster, who loves the attention he's getting and to keep Clarise coming back he talks in riddles at all times.  "All that you need to know is right here in these pages of the case file, Clarise."  And in perhaps the best editing and split scene in the history of film, the FBI goes to the wrong house and Clarise goes to the right one to find herself face to face with Buffalo Bill.  Here she slays the dragon, rescues the damsel in distress, and conquers evil.<br /><br />There are so many layers to this movie it's hard to know where to start.  It is the most terrifying movie ever, the horror of knowing that there are people like Buffalo Bill in the world as well as Dr. Lecter.  The fact that the lead is a woman gives it a twist, as we see Clarise living in a man's world, braving the elements, but at the same time she is more vulnerable to fear and harm.  Trying so hard, brave little Clarise goes into the monster's cave to meet the most terrible creatures that even the bravest of men can't face.  I admired that about her, that she is really scared to death but she is able to pull it all from within to overcome not just her fears but to triumph over evil.<br /><br />The relationship between her and Dr. Lecter is probably what scares but fascinates us the most.  He clearly likes her, and keeps her coming back because he wants the attention and to be with her more.  Clarise knows the only way to get to Buffalo Bill is to probe Dr. Lecter, so she is forced to not just return to him but appease his evil by sharing her nightmare from childhood about the lambs being slaughtered on the farm she was sent to after her father's death.  And Dr. Lecter loves it, getting into her haunted past to see what he can use, plus feeling that they have a bond or a trust when he has none with anyone.<br /><br />Some criticism?  The only criticism I can think to point out is the Buffalo Bill history.  We all want to know how and why someone is the way they are, especially someone like him.  It was hinted upon when Dr. Lecter said that he was not born a killer but made into one through years of systematic abuse.  We wanted to know what it was, but because of time constrains and story it was avoided.  Read the book and you'll get the full picture.<br /><br />Here it is 15 years later, and I think I still wake up at night hearing that aweful screaming of the lambs ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>The Silence of the Lambs<p>Score: 96/100<p>When it won the 5 most important Oscar's (Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay) in 1991, The Silence of the Lambs proved not only is it tear-jerking drama's that get so much attention, but the full-of-plot, intriguing thriller's are also an important part of film history.<p>Young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to help find a missing woman to save her from a psychopathic serial killer who skins his victims.

The performances are quite simply superb, the two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both pull off uniquely amazing performances, and they have a great screen chemistry, while Scott Glenn and Ted Levine back them up nicely. Director Jonathan Demme pieces everything together awesomely with Ted Tally's extraordinary script, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel. On the subject of books and novels, this is one of the few films that has surpassed the high standards of its book, and The Silence of the Lambs deserved to be praised for that alone!<p>The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant, immediate classic that everyone should've seen after 10 years of stunning the world.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>Havent seen it already, whats wrong with you? Classic film. Little disappointed that Jodie didnt do the sequel but who cares. This is terrific.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Every once in awhile, a film comes along that introduces a character so original that it is impossible to turn away.  "Silence of the Lambs" is exactly this type of experience.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Silence of the Lambs" sees young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) given her first assignment: interrogate Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lector (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychologist-turned-psychopath.  In trying to glean some information from Hannibal about the grizzly "Buffalo Bill" murders, Clarice catches the caged madman's sense of gamesmanship and enters into a battle of wits with the thought-provoking Lector.<br /><br />This film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character.  From out of nowhere, he becomes one of the most iconic villains in cinema history.  He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche.  His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.<br /><br />However, the film is also just an overall general masterpiece in pretty much all areas.  The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart-pounding ending), the music is also creepily in the background, and the visuals are scary while still managing to be realistic.<br /><br />Simply put, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever made.  It created an iconic character, launched the career of Jodi Foster, and carved itself a place in many "greatest of all-time" lists.  I've viewed it multiple times and it always seems to evoke the same creepy emotions every single time (the mark of a truly chilling viewing experience).</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims. Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around. You really don't know what either character is thinking. Very disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>I love this movie, one of the greatest... gore, suspense, thriller, horror, detective etc... I'm assuming most have seen it, if you haven't check it out. I won't review the movie at all, just the quality of the Blu-ray HD transfer... it's average at best. Honestly I don't know what goes into the transfer process, but this seems grainy, so maybe that's the source material they are working with? the original camera work and cinematographic style? etc. Certain movies simply look amazing on Blu-ray others are eh, nothing too eye popping and unfortunately this is just ok. Still worth getting? I guess, I haven't gone back to my dvd version and watched them back to back on my PS3 yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Thomas Harris wrote three novels on which four different films are based: Manhunter (1986) and Red Dragon (2002) based on the same novel as well as Hannibal (2001) and this film. After a decade, it retains its strengths in terms directing, acting, and production values. For obvious reasons, however, it has lost much of its emotional impact for those such as I who have seen it several times since its initial release in 1991. Nonetheless, I find it every bit as entertaining now as I did then but for different reasons.<p>For example, the compelling personality of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) had such an impact on me the first time around that I paid little attention to information revealed about Clarice Starling's childhood. Jody Foster received an Academy Award for her performance as did Hopkins and director Jonathan Demme. Well-deserved. I now have a much better appreciation of the evolving relationship between Lecter and Starling, and a much better understanding of childhood influences on her values and especially her vulnerabilities. Also, I now have a greater appreciation of the performances of others, notably Ted Levine (Jame "Buffalo Bill" Gumb). During the final confrontation, he more than holds his own with the highly talented Foster. Finally, I am now more aware of Jack Crawford's importance to Starling. Portraying her supervisor, Scott Glenn appears only briefly but makes a critically important contribution to Starling's development, both personally and professionally. Her judgment proves better than his as they pursue Buffalo Bill and he duly acknowledges that. <p>As I now think again about this film, I realize that the dominant image previously had been of Lecter in his cell, smiling serenely at the earnest young F.B.I. agent. Whenever I heard a reference to the film or to Lecter, that is what immediately came to mind. Now, the dominant image is of the "cage" in which Lecter is served a lamb chop dinner by two of the guards. I recall it so vividly...and shudder. <p>The DVD version of a film offers clearer image and sound (which I certainly appreciate) but also, more often than not, a "bonus" of supplementary materials. In this instance, they include 20 minutes of deleted scenes, interviews of Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, a "making-of" featurette, and a reel of out-takes.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Silence of the Lambs is a thriller that only others can aspire to.  Much darker and deeper than most, the stars carry their parts with exquisite, chilling moments from the beginning.  You are reeled in as the beautiful FBI Trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) meets the psychiatrist Hannibal Lechter - "Hannibal the Cannibal" (Anthony Hopkins).<br /><br />The plot winds tight as Lechter is interviewed by Starling at his cell in a Maryland mental Hospital.  The give and take between them grabs your attention and from that point on you are emersed in the mind games and intelligent sparing for information between the two.  The FBI is hopeful that Lechter can go into the mind of a serial killer on the loose, "Buffalo Bill."  Lechter does, but only if Starling will give information about herself in exchange for insight and clues on the killer at large.  Buffalo Bill's current captive is a daughter of a senator and finding her is a riveting and breathless ending.  Through it all, Lechter is respectful of Agent Starling, and understands her own fears and dark secrets.  Oddly, through him she struggles out of her own sad, hidden issues.<br /><br />Silence of the Lambs is both disturbing and yet transformational with the caterpillar turning into a beautiful moth or butterfly theme.  Clarice fights her fears and finds her own strength and courage through Lechter in a odd way.  The film is an unforgettable classic.<br /><br />Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were made for the parts they played, and they did it to perfection.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>An ambitious FBI agent enlists the aid of a criminally insane ex-psychiatrist to help track down a vicious serial killer. It has been a good long while since I have felt the presence of Evil so manifestly demonstrated as in the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs. The Silence of the Lambs slams you like a sudden blast of bone-chilling, pulse-pounding terror.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most widely known and lauded films in recent years.  I say recent years because it's a 90's child and usually a film has to be 20+ years old before people start throwing the word classic around.  `The Silence of the Lambs' is, though, a classic.  It's that rare breed of film that elicits fear and dread as well as admiration, for the audience knows exactly what they are meant to feel and they embrace it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />`The Silence of the Lambs' revolves around a relationship between FBI trainee Clarice Starling and serial killer Hannibal `the cannibal' Lecter.  The fact that Clarice is looking for another serial killer still at large is really beside the point.  This movie is about Clarice and Hannibal, about their growing trust and their deep-seated emotional response to one another.  Hannibal is a horrifying man, a man who eats other humans, but Clarice is drawn to him in a way she cannot explain.  You can see this in her eyes, in the way she communicates with mere glances in his direction.  Clarice is scared and vulnerable and trying her hardest to prove herself in a field she feels less that comfortable with, but Hannibal sees something in her that excites him.  He sees a way that he can help her help herself and so he attacks her self esteem and her confidence, not in a malicious manner but in an attempt to better her.<br /><br />The fact does remain though that Clarice is using Hannibal.  She needs to find the killer Buffalo Bill; a man who kidnaps women, keeping them locked away for days while they moisturize their skin until he kills and skins them and then dumps their bodies.  He has just kidnapped yet another victim and so the clock is ticking for Clarice to unlock Hannibal's secrets in order to save a life.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of Jodie Foster.  I felt that she was effective in `The Accused' but aside from that she has never really bolstered in me a growing curiosity.  Same can be said for her performance here, which is just not as impressive to me as many make it out to be.  I don't think she should have won the Oscar, both Susan Sarandon and especially Geena Davis was better suited for Oscar gold.  Her performance though, is not bad, and so I can't downgrade it too much.  It sells what it needs to sell, but it just wasn't Oscar-worthy in my humble opinion.  Anthony Hopkins is another story all together.  His performance was iconic, practically flawless.  The ticks that he associated to Lecter are just mesmerizing, the way he sucks in his words when he speaks to emphasize the corruption surrounding his superior intellect is astounding in every way.<br /><br />Jonathan Demme brilliantly created a film that gets under your skin and stays in your head.  It's gritty and raw and takes your breath away scene after scene.  There isn't really a film in this genre that can compare.  As a horror film goes it succeeds in sending shivers down the spine.  As a psychological thriller is succeeds in molesting the demons in your head and as a drama is succeeds in creating an atmosphere of the purest form and delivering satisfaction all around the table.  There are few films that reach the emotional as well as physical depth of `The Silence of the Lambs', a film that truly deserves the unbridled commendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme's psychological thriller remains one of the best, simply because of the excellent talent involved, with Anthony Hopkins in superbly creepy form as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Jodie Foster, along with Hopkins, deservedly won an Academy Award for her brilliant performance as FBI agent Clarice Starling. Based on Thomas Harris's novel, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is one of the few thrillers which relies heavily on psychological terror rather than splatter horror and "boo!" scares. But there are some extremely effective shocks and twists during the course of the film. And Howard Shore's dark, brooding score adds to the creepy tone. Although the film's plot centres around tracking down the crazed serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Hopkins is the standout performance. The clever back-and-forth between Clarice and Lecter is well-played and enthralling, and there are some moving moments with Lecter that add to the film's gravitas. Demme's hard-edged direction won him an Oscar, and the film picked up the Best Film Award also. What does this tell you? Well, that SILENCE is the most superbly-constucted thriller ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>Quite simply, this is one of the elite suspense films ever made - right up there with Hitchcock's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining movie. It keeps you interested all the way. The characters are unusually different and intriguing. There is certainly fascination and suspense; some good dialogue, some twists and turns, some red herrings, some curious psychology, some puzzles, some strange scenarios. But I have to agree with those critics who found a lot to complain about. It really doesn't hang together, although you don't fully realise it until after it's all over. The whole thing is pretty damned implausible --- although, again, this didn't seem to matter while you were watching. Where did Hannibal get his face mask from during the unbelievable escape sequence? (Now I get it: he skinned the dead cop's face and put it over his own. Credible?)  How did he manage to nick the warden's propelling pencil? I didn't think Buffalo Bill was too convincing --- rather hammy, imho. Jodie was good, Hopkins was good. Strange kind of patchwork; powerful scenes thrown randomly together. We might have been shown the charming Hannibal having dinner off his old friend the warden somewhere in some steamy Caribbean nightspot at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>OK, do movies get any more compelling than this one -- which features superlative performances from virtually every bit player -- not to mention two of the biggest names in the movies delivering what are probably their  best performances ever?  The story, with its gruesome underpinnings, is  essentially a subtle and growing relationship between two lost souls, one  good and one very, very bad.  I thought that Demme's direction of this film  was masterful, and gave you a exciting tour-de-force into the complexity  and intrigue of forensic detective work, while never letting go of the many  jumps, thrills and twists.  Anthony Hopkins, whose Hannibal Lecter has  become a mainstay of popular culture, is seductive and mesmerizing; the  close-up scenes between him and Jodie Foster are electrifyingly real and  yet still have that big-screen, knock-out quality you want in a big movie.  Jodie Foster shines in a role that she was born to play: a loner, a person  with intense psychological scars, a young woman who wants and desperately  needs respect and validation.  I just loved this movie, and have seen it  several times. By the way, Scott Glenn is wonderfully sparse in a role that  could have been showy.  Not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>That's the thing about whodunnits; once you find out who diddit, the film suffers the next time you watch it.  I do remember though when I first saw this film in the cinema that I was very much involved in it and watching it on the big screen in near total darkness made you feel like YOU were Clarisse and the final scene in the basement stayed with me for a long time after that day too.  It was certainly one of the finest films I had ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />Now that I'm viewing this once again but on DVD, I can't help but feel that a lot is lost in viewing this film this way.  It made me realise that perhaps a Demme Director's cut version should be released which incorporates the deleted scenes which I thought were pretty good and that would help aid the story along as well.  The sound quality of this Fullscreen version is advertised as 5.1 Surround and is pretty good sound quality wise although the picture quality does look as if it could be improved upon and here's hoping a proper Blu-ray or standard format 20th anniversary edition will be released in a couple of years time in a director's cut version so as to add some freshness and life to this great film.  An anamorphic widescreen version would also be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As it is though, this film is still very, very good but it doesn't reward repeated viewing for me in its current form.  Here's hoping and waiting for a 20th anniversary directors cut version!</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>I hoped for a better picture and sound but considering the source, I'm very happy with the A/V quality of an old friend. It looks and sounds very close to what showed in the theatre. Waiting for a better copy in 3-D may take a while; however a better transfer is possible which will probably happen for the lesser sequels which have a better print to show off. I will keep my early Criterion copy with commentaries featuring an FBI agent, the screenwriter, the director, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins (dropping items, like him choosing to mimic HAL for Lecter). I think that's a pretty good extra. In spite of it's limitations. the Criterion DVD A/V is close to the film. Ditto on the 2009 MGM BD plus a higher resolution. Many films from the early Orion days are high def challenged (like Robocop). There have been many periods where the flavor of the month was a soft focus picture!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter is on screen for less than half of The Silence of the Lambs, but in that short period he created one of the most disturbingly rememberible characters of all time.  The first scene between Lecter and Jody Foster's ambitious but green FBI agent Clarice Starling in which Clarice tries to get Lecter to help in the FBI's search for a serial killer dubbed Buffalo Bill is a movie classic.  Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster create a dramatic tension as the brilliant but deranged Lecter psychoanalyzes Clarice.  Ms. Foster's facial reactions to Lecter's analysis convey so much more than words.  The movie is a psychological thriller that provides chills, tension and scares you while avoiding tired cliches.  In addition to Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster, Ted Levine is scary as the twisted killer Buffalo Bill and Scott Glenn is icy as Clarice's commanding officer. Director Jonathan Demme strikes all right notes and the filming of the closing scene in Buffalo Bill's basement is superbly filmed.  The Silence of the Lambs became just the third movie in history to win Best Picture, Best Actor (Mr. Hopkins), Best Actress (Ms. Foster), Best Director and Best Screenplay in the same year.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This film based on Thomas Harris's masterpiece of a novel, is equally a masterpiece. Hopkins and Foster deliver Oscar winning performances and the adapted screenplay from the novel is great, leaving in all of the best moments.<br /><br />Hopkins stars as Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal, who is interviewed by Agent Clarice Starling, played by Foster. He is interviewed by her on information on a series of killings. She asks information on "Buffalo Bill", a killer who skins women. Hannibal aggrees, but in return asks for personal information on Starling. Starling doesn't know though whether Lecter is just playing with her or whether or not he is giving true information. When a senator's daughter gets kidnapped, the chase is on.<br /><br />I am about to give away an event which some people may not want to know before watching this film.<br /><br />The movie contains the best scene of all time, that beeing Hannibal's escape; while the conclusion is absolutely brilliant. This thriller is heart pounding and smart and fast, and is recommended to everyone. It is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend reading the book also as it gives away more interesting information.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>The Silence of the Lambs is the first Horror movie to win the Best Picture Academy Award.  While that distinction rightfully belonged to The Exorcist us Horror fans take what we can get.  Certainly the Horror genre didn't need (and still doesn't) an award to validate its importance to film, but an honor is an honor so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Even without all the accolades, The Silence of the Lambs would be revered and considered a classic example of filmmaking.  There is nothing more disconcerting, yet fascinating to the American public than the act of murder.  The fascination is compounded exponentially when murder is committed in quantity.  Add the seeming randomness of serial slayings, the understanding that anybody could be next, and the result is fanaticism.  That's right, Americans are fans of murder.  The bloodier the better, as long as it's far away and happening to someone else.<br /><br />Many serial killers have achieved celebrity status.  Some have become legend, both living and dead.  Hannibal Lecter, although a fictional construct, ranks among them.  Anthony Hopkins unsettling and convincing portrayal of the cannibal doctor is perhaps one of the most talked about film perfomances of all time.  The character of Lecter has since joined the American Lexicon of Boogeymen, usually a realm reserved for supernatural monsters.  The plausibility of Lecter makes him all the more frightening, his deviance coupled with his uncanny intelligence plays upon our fears of strangers, of being eaten, and the ultimate terror of being outsmarted.<br /><br />Somehow Hollywood recognized a superior monster story and awarded it accordingly.  The novel by Thomas Harris is so closely adhered to in script as to almost be one in the same.  In essence watching the film was like watching the book.  When so often the saying that the book is better than the movie unfortunately (but logically) rings true, finding a film that compliments and accentuates the source material is like stumbling upon cinematic gold.<br /><br />The Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have.  Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that most didn't realize they were watching a Horror film to begin with.  I'm sure Chianti sales skyrocketed, perhaps even sales of fava beans.  One thing is for certain, people began to ask what exactly was in the entree at dinner parties, praying the answer wasn't Bob or Lisa.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Very few films are better than the book, but director Jonathan Demme doesn't seem to have any problems doing just that with an international acclaimed bestseller. If you haven't seen this five Oscar winner, then it is about time that you did.<br /><br />A sexual serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, is kidnapping women across Midwest America, murdering them and dumping their mutilated bodies near a river. Behavioral science division of the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) on a mission to a prison/hospital for the criminally insane to interview the serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to see if he can help with the investigation by giving her clues for a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill. Hannibal the Cannibal is cryptic and illusive sending Starling around the country mostly searching for something unknown that Hannibal has directed her towards. Not only does he give her some details as to the psychological profile of the killer but he eludes to much more than she originally thought he knew. Hannibal starts to play games with Starling, ever eager to impress her boss, by giving her a psychological profile of herself in return for more information about the case. An uncanny and often dangerous relationship begins and things take a turn for the worse when a senator's daughter is kidnapped causing various government agencies to impede the case which sets up a gripping climax as the illusive Lecter plays people into his own hands.<br /><br />Essentially it is smart horror movie with lots of dialogue, plot and suspense. It is both mystical and disturbing. Demme often uses the camera directly with the actor looking at you to make the movie more "personal" in nature.<br /><br />Thoroughly engaging. This is the film that set new benchmarks in the modern horror/suspense/thriller genres. Often copied, never equaled. It is easy to fall under the spell of this piece of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Despite some truly wonderful performances and a solid plot, this film never quite takes off. I am truly angered at how overrated this actually is. Really. It is just a typical cop versus serial killer film. Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine as the psychopath give some truly chilling performances, and Roger Corman has a nice cameo as the FBI director, but this film is definitely not as special as people make it to be. The character of Hannibal Lecter is a great one, and he has some terrific one liners, and despite a few suspenseful moments, this film is very boring. It is exactly like many other serial killer films out there, so what's with all the special attention? It's average film making at best. I do realize that many people will disagree with me, but I really didn't see what all the fuss was about. This movie didn't even make me jump once. It did have it's high points, such as the particularly creepy killer and of course, the immortal Hannibal Lecter, but I was just so bored throughout the whole thing and couldn't understand what was behind all the hype as I sat watching. This is certainly not the greatest modern horror film. The ending didn't even deliver the punch I was so expecting and after sitting through this, I was very disappointed.

I did not find it to be a great movie. Indeed, I found much of it to be laughable. Now, perhaps this is because it has been parodied so much, I dunno. When the psycho killer said, "It puts the lotion on its skin", all I could think of was the parody scene from '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FP2OPO">Joe Dirt</a>'. Also, the part of the story about the vain, media-seeking doctor who 'treated' Lecter in the specially-constructed cell where he was kept was pretty far-fetched. Nor was Lecter's escape believable.<br /><br />All in all, a watchable movie, but one that, IMHO, is failing the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>This psychological thriller descends into the realm of madness as Dr. Hannibal Lecter (encased in an escape-proof cage - but is it REALLY escape-proof?) establishes an unusual connestion with FBI agent Clarice Starling.

One is the story of a serial killer who is kidnapping women and eluding authorities. One is the story of an FBI trainee who only wants to make it to FBI status. One, and perhaps the most chilling and complex of the three, is the story of a highly intellectual man with a taste for human flesh, kept hidden from the world until it becomes evident that he may have a way of helping the trainee discover the whereabouts of the killer. <p>Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, the film is a cauldron of mixed emotions that the audience will feel in every chilling moment. Jonathan Demme has created a masterpiece of the mind as well as a chilling thriller to jangle the nerves until the final, climactic ending. <p>When FBI trainee Clarice Starling is called upon to question Hannibal Lector, she readily accepts the mission in hopes of impressing her superiors. When she arrives at the asylum where he is held, the head of the facility heavily warns her about Lector's crimes: killing people and eating the flesh of his victims. When she comes face-to-face with Hannibal, she learns that he is more than a monster: he is an intellectual machine with a flair for large words and turning colorful phrases. He ultimately lends clues to Clarice in exchange for information about the case, and soon for information about her personal life, hoping to dive into the depths of her mind. Clarice hesitates, but gives him what he wants in order to get closer to solving the crime before the next victim is killed. <p>This film is such a masterpiece in terms of horror and suspense. This is not one of the average run-of-the-mill scare machines that comes along almost every year. This movie is so much more complex, so complex that it can be frightening. Among some of the factors that will have you feeling chills are the way in Clarice regails the experiences of her childhood to Hannibal, which is so depressing and emotional that you feel for her. She appears so broken that it looks as if she is reliving the entire experience, while at the same time keeping the one goal in mind to find the serial killer at large. <p>The most frightening of all is the way in which Hannibal is portrayed. Perhaps one of the most unique villians in all of Hollywood, the best part of his character is that the movie and novel do not play him out as a lunatic, but instead as a highly intelligent psychologist whose only crime is that of cannibalism. In the end, it's not so much the actions of his past that are frightening as much as the ability he has to get into Clarice's mind and dredge up horrifying memories from her past, all the while focusing his eyes only on her eyes, seemingly peering inside her very soul. <p>The outside story is filled with mounting suspense as the FBI closes in on the killer named Buffalo Bill, who skins his victims of their flesh in order to achieve something more chilling. Hannibal is able to offer information to the authorities as to the background of the man who they suspect is the killer, and the way in which he offers his information is quite suspenseful. It becomes evident that Clarice is going to be the one who finds the killer because of her relationship and communication with Lector. We find that he has a deep emotional attachment to her because of what she tells him about her past, and you'll find that to be one of the most intense realizations of the movie. <p>The two leads both won Academy Awards for their performances in this picture, and it's quite easy to see why. Jodie Foster is remarkable and stunning as Clarice Starling, who is innocent in the beginning and becomes swept up in emotional trauma and stress as she allows Lector to question her about her past. Her performance here is intense and true. Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal Lector, and his performance here is the entire centerpiece for the suspense of the film. Hopkins plays every aspect of Lector's persona to perfection, a great achievement in his acting career. <p>Winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is a complex and stunning tale that dives deep into the minds of its characters and goes straight to the mind of its audiences. Expectations are sure to be met, for the movie has everything you could want: intelligence, thrills, chills, scares, action, emotion, and complexity. You'll find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, seeing the eyes of Hannibal Lector looking straight at you.</p></br><a href="../users/A81P47EIXM8HA.html">A81P47EIXM8HA</a><br/><p>Don't bother with this Blu-ray...<br />I just watched the 2 disc collectors edition a couple days back and loved it so when I spotted this in the store today I snapped it up.  Trouble is....without a serious A/B  test....it didn't really look ANY better than the standard disc and is twice the price. Frankly ...I wish I had NOT purchased this on BLU-RAY and its one  of my favorite movies. Much of this will no doubt be due to the available light photography for the film which doesn't upgrade well..but be warned.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>This is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims. Jodie Foster must traverse into a world of dark sickening debauchery to capture the killer. The story takes several turns heightening the intensity and unspeakable terror of her assignment. The story is unsettling in its own right but the film seen from Foster's perspective has a pervasive feel of paranoia as if she has not been given all the information she needs or even further to suggest she is actually being set up as bait. One scene in particular comes to mind when sitting in the back seat of the car her boss (Scott Glenn) speaks cryptically to her and she just gazes at the back of his head once he turns around. You really don't know what either character is thinking. Very disturbing.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Based on Thomas Harris's bestselling novel of the same title, "The Silence of the Lambs" is a riveting psychological descent into the mad realm of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) that works best as a psychological horror movie. Indeed, there are very few scenes of graphic horror in the film itself, and their occurrences only reinforce the mental battle of wills between FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and the imprisoned cannibalistic psychopath Hannibal Lecter. Without question, one of Jonathan Demme's best films and a genuine cinematic classic, "The Silence of the Lambs" is truly gripping, replete with excellent performances from both Foster and Hopkins, who offer filmgoers two of their finest performances (Foster's heroic portrayal of young Starling certainly deserved its Academy Award for best actress.).<br /><br />FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling is given the odious task of interviewing Hannibal Lecter - who is held in a maximum security prison cell - seeking his advice on the modus operandi of another serial killer Buffalo Bill. Lecter does give his advice, but it comes at a painful personal cost to Starling, who is forced by Lecter's psychological terror to reveal some of her own dark secrets from her youth. Demme focuses the intense drama between both characters by aiming the camera directly into their faces, with most of the scenes between Starling and Lecter filmed as though we are witnessing the interrogation from Starling's eyes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>The Silence of the Lambs works very effectively as a pshycological thriller that toys with your mind. Granted, its not for all tastes to enjoy, but even if you didn't like this film like I did, its hard not to appreciate the surreal feel that the cast and crew have added to the similar movie Manhunter.<br /><br /> FBI in training officer Clarice Sterling[Jodie Foster] has been assigned by her boss Jack Crawford[Scott Glenn] to interview homicidal cannibal psycho Dr. Hannibal Lecter[Anthony Hopkins]. The leads all give outstanding and realistic performances in an interesting way, so its no wonder why Hopkins and Foster took home Best Actor and Best Actress respectively at the 1992 Oscars.<br /><br /> Lecter you see is a 'former' serial killer, who ate his victims as he graphically states in one now infamous scene. He'll still stop at nothing to get a sick gratification from killing the innocent. He may know more than he's letting on about a dangerous, homoerotic character named Buffalo Bill[Ted Levine] who kills and brutally tortures his victims. Both of the killers in this film give very gritty yet frightenly realistic performances as the film's villians. Its up to Clarice to gain enough of Lecter's trust to help track down the other psycho killer who has now kidnapped a senator's daughter.<br /><br /> This film really does play with your mind, enough so to scare you even. Its not exactly a pleasant movie, dealing with the laws of cannibalism and psychology, but its believeable enough to make you say 'wow!' upon finishing it. Therefore, it should be no wonder as to why it was named best picture 13 years ago. Some may call this another slasher film, but the murders we do see are not the main point. To me this is an effective horror/thriller that still packs a pounding punch today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Jonathan Demme would have been the last person you would expect to direct a thriller, particularly one with such seamy undertones.  Essentially, he made his name with off-beat comedies prior to this("Handle With Care", "Melvin and Howard", "Something Wild", "Married to the Mob").  It was probably a blessing that someone like him directed this film because despite the darkness of the material, he handles it in a non-exploitative manner.  The story concerns a manhunt for a serial kidnapper-killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who preys on girls of a certain body-weight, most recently the daughter of a U.S. Senator.  One of the FBI investigators is a young female trainee, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), who utilizes an imprisoned cannibal psychiatrist, Hannibal Lector(Anthony<br /><br /> Hopkins) in her search for Buffalo Bill.  Despite the fact that Lecter repells her, Starling continues to utilize him because of his invaluable insight into the inner workings of the criminal mindset.  Foster is excellent in her Oscar-winning role as Starling.  Hopkins is creepily seductive as Lecter.  It's unfortunate that he made a parody of this character in two repellant sequels, "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon".  Solid work is also delivered here by Levine, Scott Glenn as Jack Crawford, Starling's superior, and Anthony Heald as the disagreeable head of the mental hospital housing Lecter, Dr. Chilton.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This film is probably the greatest thriller movie of all time.  Personally it outshines Psycho.  The movie is chilling, disturbing, deep, and dramatic.  Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest pairings since Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh, they truely have wonderful chemistry.  Hannibal Lector is one of the greatest screen characters of all time and definately the greatest villain.  No other movie has made you dive into the mind of a psychotic maniac.  Jonathon Demme is truely a talented director.  He hasn't made a better film since.  This is one of my favorite films of all time.  I highly reccomend this movie to anyone, and everyone to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Silence of the Lambs has a reputation for horrific violence, but the movie version is one that even the squeamish should be able to watch with only a few eye-coverings. Foster is a FBI trainee who is trying to help track down a serial killer. Hopkins is a captured killer who knows how these people think. Over time Foster is drawn to Hopkins, Hopkins subtly manipulates Foster, and the killer keeps doing his thing. Will Foster track the loose bad guy down in time?<br /><br />I normally tend to shy away from gruesome movies - but I've seen Silence of the Lambs multiple times and adored it each time. It absolutely deserves its #65 ranking on the AFI top 100. The plot is fantastic and draws you in right from the very beginning. The actors are all fantastic. From Foster to Hopkins, from Levine to Glenn, you see their twist of motivations, their pulls and concerns, and how the relationships build.<br /><br />Interwoven with the main plot are a variety of sub-themes. I love the scenes that examine the role of men and women in the police / FBI forces. They are handled very deftly. When Foster is presented, she's shown as a strong, athletically talented, intellectually gifted woman. And even so, the men around her look at her and see her beauty. The criminal she passes is crude in how he deals with her. Glenn is both a mentor and interested in her as a woman. The fellow male trainees all turn to watch her as she jogs past. When she and Glenn go to a crime scene, he "protects" her and draws the Sheriff to the side in order to discuss a sensitive topic. Foster is calm, deliberate, and points out the issue to Glenn. He acknowledges that she is right.<br /><br />Out of all the movies in the AFI top 100, this is amazingly probably the best one in terms of female characters! With all the great movies on this list - Gone with the Wind, Annie Hall, Doctor Zhivago, that feature strong women, it's Silence of the Lambs that features some of the best women-to-women discussions in the entire list. In the vast majority of movies on the AFI list the women are solely there to play against men. They only ever talk with men. But here Foster has a sharp, wise African-American female friend who shares her insight into situations.<br /><br />There are so many ways in which this movie shines. The plot is engaging and insightful. The actors are masters of their crafts. The tension in the scenes is masterfully handled.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br></body></html>

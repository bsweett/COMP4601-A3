A lot of fun, a lot of in-jokes, but completely insane. (People who know me understand that I mean that as a compliment.)<br /><br />A lion, a zebra, a hippo and a giraffe are all friends who live in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The zebra dreams of living in the wild, which somehow he gets mixed up with Connecticut. So he breaks out and finds his way to Grand Central Station to try to get a train to Connecticut. His friends have to go and find him and bring him back before he gets in serious trouble.<br /><br />Of course, this lands them all in serious trouble. They are to be shipped to Kenya. They are in crates on board a ship, stacked on the deck. But their crates fall overboard and they find themselves washed up on an island which turns out to be Madagascar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a troupe of penguins who were equally dissatisfied with the Central Park Zoo have hijacked the ship and . . . well, I did tell you it was insane, didn't I? Now do you believe me? It's a lot of fun, and the grownups will laugh their heads off at the subtle jokes while the kids have a great time on the broad and obvious ones. Just don't look for anything more profound than friends have to stick together. That and for a carnivore who hasn't had anything to eat for awhile, even his friends will start looking like thick, juicy steaks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>From the creators of Shrek, Madagascar is a fun movie for all ages to enjoy. You will laugh out loud as you follow four animals who escaped from their comfortable digs at the New York Central Zoo. Led by their friends, aided by a wacky group of penguins, they set forth to return to their roots in Africa. After their ship wrecks, the animals find themselves on Madagascar and are befriended by a fun-filled group of lemurs. The movie has laughs, incredible animation, and is a nice story of friendship.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This movie on spoiled zoo animals was made in 2005.  It is a film by Dreamworks and beautifully computer-animated.<br /><br />The story starts at New York's Central Park Zoo.  Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty a zebra (Chris Rock), a hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer, and a lady hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) are best firends and stars of the show.  The Zebra has wanderlust as he turns 10 and wants freedom to return to the wild. He escapes and the other three break free to look for him and all reunite at Central Station in New York.  The public and police are terrified and the animals find themselves on a ship headed for Africa.  When the penquins turn pirate and hijack the ship, they are washed ashore in Madagascar.  The foursome soon find out that freedom is not all it is cracked up to be.<br /><br />I laughed at the jokes and personalities of the zany, good hearted animals.  This was just fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OYW08VVPMP3Q.html">A1OYW08VVPMP3Q</a><br/><p>The animation is great and the characterizations wonderful.

Great entertainment about city bred animals, and one particular zebra who wants to escape to the Wild, which might be just south of Connecticut!<br /><br />It's collision of friendship and predator instincts makes for an unusually gripping conflict.<br /><br />The most fun for me was the allusions to TV shows and old movies.  If you watched Twilight Zone and Planet of the Apes, even Chariots of Fire and Wild Kingdom, you'll know what I mean.  How many can you spot!<br /><br />It would be a fun Lunch game to see how many allusions you can spot.<br /><br />The story is  cute, kids will like it.  And adults will recognize a lot of music and movie allusions.  Great way to waste a couple of hours.

This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids. I can't say that for sure, since I watched it by myself....but I sure got my share of laughs<br /><br />The main thing is that all the characters, including supporting ones, are likable and funny in their own way. Every character is quite different. The story movies exceptionally fast so the hour-and-a-half is easy to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie. The previews were just not that appealing. The storyline didn't seem to make any sense (from the previews.) I had no clue. (In more ways than one!)<br /><br />The fact is the movie was very smartly written. The animation was creative and very bright. It was realistic but abstract enough to be slightly amusing. The storyline is simple, but with a wide array of gags and "physical comedy" that entertains young and old alike. Of course, having said all that I must admit that the simple story is balanced by characters that are very complex in nature.<br /><br />Alex is the king of the jungle... only his jungle is the city zoo. Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, along with lovely hippo, Gloria and Marty the laughable zebra make for an interesting zoo dynamic.<br /><br />Throw in a bunch of oddball penquins with military delusions and a gaggle of lemurs that like to "move it" and you have the screwball hit of the year!<br /><br />A perfect story for the kid in all of us.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Since Shrek, DreamWorks pictures has annually put out cartoons aimed at audiences of all ages.  Most of these end up behind Pixar's creations as best cartoon of the year.  2005 was one of the few exceptions; first, Pixar did not release any movie that year.  Second, this movie is actually very good.  It tells the story of four overly domesticated zoo animals who inadvertantly end up in Madagascar, where they have to learn to survive against the odds and in spite of themselves.  The movie is written as a comedy with no romance or terror, and some action sequences.  As a comedy, it includes elements of sarcasm, singing, slapstick and a lot of outright stupidity.  Most of the jokes are original and appropriate for all ages, and the animation is quite believable and looks like a cross between the CGI wonders of Pixar and traditional cartoon drawings from the 1960's.  The voiceovers are great, and all the characters are excellent.  Most notable is Sacha Baron Cohen's first big role in a major Hollywood release.  Here, he is the king of a band of lemurs, and his experience from the Da Ali G Show shines through as he sings away in a South Asian accent.<br /><br />Overall, a great movie.  The plot is simple but very original, along with the comedy.  Fun for everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>The movie was cute and made me laugh in several places.  As with most kids movies these days, it has some entertainment for the adults.  As mentioned before the "I like to move it, move it" song part was fun and entertaining.  The one part that I found to be disturbing was the spitting out of water and worry that my little one will mimic that.  Overall I would watch this movie and if you like it, buy it, I think there will be those that will want to keep it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>While probably a kids movie, the fun factor can be enjoyed from both kids and parents alike.  Each of the animated animals in the film had a distinct feel, and NONE of them were annoying, which is a big plus in animation because it seems like everybody wants to throw in at least one annoying character these days.  Not so in Madagascar.<br /><br />The penguins were absolutely hysterical.  The quality of the storyline is pretty good too, and the humor never fails.  Of course, as an adult, you have to kind of force yourself to pay attention to animated films for the entire length, but I was able to keep myself entertained, and I hope you are too.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>It's rare a movie comes along that is good for both kids and adults.

The music is awesome, the plot is great with amazing charchters like the vain lion, the sickly giraffe, the adventerous zebra and many other animals. I love the penguins especially with their crazy antics. There is a lesson to be learned both for young and old. This lesson being that the grass is not greener on the other side. Then they make fun of such shows like survivor and movies like cast away. Even though I like this movie alot and find that it is grand fun it is still not even close to being on the same level as movies such as Finding Nemo or Lion King and I give it 4 out of stars which is not bad at all. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This is delightful family entertainment. There were more than a few chuckles, as well as a subtle lesson for children (and a reminder for adults), that the grass is not always greener on the other side. Our family especially enjoyed the antics of the penguins. The music is also well suited to the movie and compliments the energy of the animal characters. You'll be tempted to get up and dance. If you no longer have young children, buy and save this one for the grandkids...<br /><br />Chrissy K.

But my kids were anxious to see it so I dragged myself into the theater on Saturday ready to see another kiddie movie along the lines of "Shark Tale" or "Home on the Range". I did not expect to enjoy the movie as much as my seven year old....if not more. "Madagascar" is not only a great animated film and packs as many laughs into it's hour and half as either "Shrek" movie did, "Madagascar" is just a great comedy. There were several times in the movie that were just laugh out loud funny, the scene with the Penguins in Antarctica was worth the price of admission for me! There are plenty of jokes aimed at an older audience, like the reference to "The Twilight Zone" episode "How to Serve Man". The story is great and the characters are really fun. The visuals are stunning and the animation is top-notch. Add all that together with a great soundtrack, and I think "Madagascar" is a great way to kick off the summer movie season. This one ranks right up there with "The Incredibles" and "Shrek".</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>Madagascar is a cute and funny movie.  Parents and kids were laughing through most of the movie. (there was an little while where the story gets boring.)  But, I love the penguins and the fact that they are always so sneaky; they really steal the show from the main characters.  If you have kids this is a definite must see, we had kids laughing the whole time and most loved the bright colors, music and especially dancing.  You saw a lot of little kids dancing in their chairs.  People without kids or older kids will also enjoy the movie as it has a lot of jokes for adults to keep us entertained and laughing; the bright colors are also great for us as well as the dancing and music.  I felt this cartoon lived up to its previews and the way it was perceived.  My only hope is if they do a 2nd one that they include more of those sneaky penguins.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Recent animated efforts have tried to create 3-D characters and environments, but the filmmakers have wisely chosen another course for "Madagascar". Adopting a stylized form of animation, the film looks like a living picture book. Everything is cartoonier than we are used to. Alex, Marty and Melman are still rendered in 3-D, but they are not lifelike and appear to be adapted from a children's book, actually adding to the humor. These characters look like stuffed animals and its funny to watch little kids carrying a small toy of Alex home after their visit to the zoo. They seem more believable as zoo animals and they are certainly cute as the dickens.<br /><br />In all animated films today, a certain level of irreverence, of zaniness is expected. "Madagascar" doesn't reach the heights of the "Shrek" films, but it comes darn close. Everything from Tom Wolfe to "The Twilight Zone", "American Beauty" to "The Planet of the Apes" is parodied in the film. Most of the kids won't get these jokes and the filmmakers know that. They are included for the adults, to keep them interested in the story. The mark of a great animated film is if both adults and children enjoy the experience. For instance, "The Incredibles" was a fantastic blend of story, action, character and humor which will continue to delight people of all ages. "Madagascar" has a very funny story, great characters, and a lot of humor. On a couple of occasions, the story was a little slow, but I think all of the other areas more than compensate for any shortcomings. And adults will laugh at many of the jokes, probably more so than the kids in the audience.<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Chris Rock are very good. David Schwimmer seems to be injecting a lot of Ross from "Friends" into the role of Melman, not very original but it works. The real standouts are Tom McGrath and Sacha Baron Cohen.<br /><br />There are a couple of brilliant additions to the film, which help it rise above. Marty's ideas of visiting the wild are originally fed by Skipper the Penguin (Tom McGrath). Skipper and his sidekicks, two other penguins, are determined to break out of the zoo and return to Antarctica. They skulk around corners like CIA operatives, act in clandestine ways, and manage to accomplish most of their goals. The penguins are a brilliant addition to the story and really liven up the proceedings. I laughed out loud during most of their appearances. For a while, their story takes them in a different direction from the rest of the gang and we lose track of them. Because they are so funny, you long for their return.<br /><br />When the animals land in Madagascar, they meet King Julian the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen, TV's "Ali G") and Maurice, his right hand lemur (Cedric the Entertainer) and their entire kingdom of lemurs. Cohen seemed to be channeling the spirit of Peter Sellers, because his voice was an uncanny reproduction of some of Seller's characters. He is very funny as the King, always working on an angle as he tries to figure things out. The Lemurs add a level of frenetic activity and zaniness to the film, ratcheting the humor up a few notches.<br /><br />The least interesting voice actor is Jada Pinkett Smith. She simply doesn't add anything to the character. IMDb.com lists a handful of other people who were considered for the role and I have to say that I don't think any of them would have made a significant contribution either. A comedian would have been a nice touch. Instead, Gloria seems to be the lone voice of reason among the group, dragging everything down.<br /><br />"Madagascar" is a really good, very funny film suitable for the entire family. But it is also a great choice if you are with a date or simply alone and want to watch a funny film. You'll enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Madagascar" must be a very maddening movie for young kids who go with their parents, because at moments when they are not laughing their parents very well could be and the kiddies will have no clue why.  After all, how many pre-teens have seen the end of the original version of "The Planet of the Apes," the beginnings of "Saturday Night Fever" and "Chariot of Fire," or have even heard the theme song from "Born Free"?  I expect they may have seen "Castaway" and might well recognize a homage to the dancing hippos from "Fantasia," but is it reasonable to think they saw "The Twilight Zone" episode "To Serve Man"?  I realize that when kids are laughing they probably are not aware of what their parents or guardians are doing, but since they will not be laughing at most of these pop culture references to other films, they may well be awrae that the older people are watching a different movie.<br /><br />Ultimately the problem is that the different "Madagascar" that the grownups are watching is clearly funnier than the one that is trying to keep the wee folk entertained.  The story is about four animals who are best buds at the Central Park Zoo.  Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is the star of the show and a devotee of raw steak, while Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is tired of looking at the fake jungle painted on the wall and longs to be free in the wild, not really knowing what that means.  Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) is a hypochondriac, worried about the brown spots on his skin, while Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinikett Smith), is a rather contented soul.  But when the quartet of penguins decide to make a break for Antarctica, Marty gets out on the streets of New York City, which forces Alex and the others to rescue him.  Their trip to Grand Central Station is seen by the humans as a quest for freedom and against the will of three of the four friends, they are crated up and put on a ship bound for Africa so they can be happy (the humans who come up with this saw the movie "Free Willy," but never read the news stories about what happened when the star of those films was released into the ocean).<br /><br />To say that they end up in Madagascar rather than Africa might seem like a minor distinction since the island is off the coast of the continent and therefore part of the same land mass, but it is important that the place is NOT Africa.  Africa is a place where there are prides of lions, herds of zebras, and so forth.  Madagascar is a place where there is a division between the lemurs and their small friends, ruled by the wacky Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is advised by the more sedate Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer), and the hyenas, who do not talk, following the tradition of really bad animals in movies populated by talking animals (e.g., the rats in "Lady and the Tramp").  This matters because it makes the newcomers the biggest animals around (the "New York giants" to the locals), and Alex a true king of the jungle (he terrifies the hyenas when he is not trying to and Julian wants Alex to try really hard to terrify the hyenas).<br /><br />"Madagascar" is an anti-"Call of the Wild" in that the biggest conflict becomes not the ability of the zoo animals to survive in the wild or to save the lemurs from the hyenas, but rather keeping Alex from converting to his natural state in which case Marty and the others are literally the walking steaks he misses so much.  Few friendships can survive one friend sinking their teeth into the butt of another, and the tightrope this 2005 animated film must walk is that we have to fear that Alex is going to eat the rest of the cast.  But then we remember, to adapt the wise words of Chandler Bing, that this would just mean they stop drawing the zebra.  However, it is hard to complain about the rhetorical aspects of a film whose chief message is that you should not eat your friends (I bet small kids would get the idea that film is the anti-"Silence of the Lambs").  Not a classic by any means, but I know how often I laughed out loud, so I have to round up.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Madagascar is the story of 4 zoo animals in Central Park (a lion, a giraffe, a hippo, and a zebra) that find themselves, through various twists of fate, on an island in the middle of the ocean. No more cages, no more zoo. But also no more free food or people to take care of them. (Neither of those ideas is really examined all that much in the film, just briefly mentioned).<br /><br />The animation is a bit blocky and the plot is a bit thin, but I'm sure it will entertain kids. The problem is that in this day and age we expect our animated films to do more than mindlessly entertain our children, we expect to be entertained as well. Unfortunately, Madagascar does not meet those expectations.<br /><br />Despite the big names this animated film boasts (Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Cedric the Entertainer, Sacha Baron Cohen) the film feels a bit lackluster. That's partly due to the fact that none of these actors (Baron Cohen aside) know how to create a feasible character voice. These are name actors paid to sound like themselves. But a zebra with Chris Rock's voice is not entertaining, it's actually kind of annoying. The same goes for a giraffe with David Schwimmer's voice and a hippo with Smith's voice. Ben Stiller doesn't put forth much effort, but his lion, Alex, at least has a bit of character mixed in there. Sacha Baron Cohen definitely steals the film with his lemur-king Julien, but unfortunately he doesn't show up until halfway through the film.<br /><br />The roll of the credits featuring Baron Cohen's Julien chanting "I like to move it move it!" is probably the most exciting and inspired part of the entire film. Although it's not a bad film, with all the other animation being made today, it's not particularly special.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>At New York's Central Park Zoo, a lion (Stiller), a zebra (Rock), a giraffe (Schwimmer), and a hippo (Smith) are best friends and stars of the show.

Alex, the lion, is the star attraction and gets the best steak in the zoo as a reward for drawing in the school trips. Alex's best friend Marty, a zebra dreaming of the wild, isn't so content with the easy life and runs away to experience freedom from captivity. When Marty's friends escape to bring him back all hell breaks loose and ends in a confrontation with animal control at Grand Central Station. Before they know it, the four friends are shipped off to a wildlife reserve in Africa at the urging of animal rights activists. Then the fun really begins as the street smart New Yorkers must forge their own way in the wild without the help of people.

There are some funny moments (loved those military Penguins & the lemur king), but I found myself dozing off a couple of times. This is a pretty good one for the kids and would make a good rental instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>I have found, over the week since we saw Madagascar, that it's doing something pretty much unheard of in the world of kids' movies: sparking debate. Madagascar is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, it would seem, and the two sides have been debating it at a white-hot pace I haven't seen since a whole bunch of people missed the point of The Blair Witch Project. (Not to start THAT endless debate again.)<br /><br />One of the best things about watching cartoons from the sixties and before was that they weren't just made for kids. I'm not just talking about the odd joke stuck in every once in a while that adults would get and kids wouldn't-- cartoons were not made for kids back in the day. There were more jokes that the adults would get than the kids would. In every cartoon. (And the farther back you go, the more that's true; the kid's grandmother picked up some VHS tapes of cartoon reels from the twenties and thirties at a garage sale a few years back. I think they're hysterical, even when I'm missing about half the jokes because I'm too young and being vaguely offended at the inherent racism in some of them. The kid doesn't get them at all.) Needless to say, if you were to try and make a cartoon like that today, a whole lot of people would think it sucks because, well, it's got too much stuff in it that the kiddies won't get.<br /><br />Enter Madagascar. It is that cartoon. And that has been the point that has, predictably, brought so much fire. I have my suspicions it has drawn such harsh criticism on this topic because there were some jokes that most of the adults didn't get, either (the guy frantically waving the To Serve Lemur book, which I found one of the funniest moments of the movie, occasioned laughs from maybe five people in the packed house where I saw it, and none of the other adults with me go the reference). No one likes to look dumb when his kid asks "what did that mean?"<br /><br />One of the other complaints about the movie is that it is, essentially, plotless. This is a valid point, but I'm not sure that makes it a valid criticism, especially in an animated feature. Lord knows there have been some recent American animations where the plot and its underlying theme have been so ham-handed that a plotless film is a breath of fresh air (Brother Bear immediately comes to mind). And yes, Madagascar does come off rather like a slightly-less-than-ninety-minute episode of a sitcom. But it's been a long, long time since America came up with a sitcom even remotely as funny as Madagascar-- probably because, again, the jokes in Madagascar are actually aimed at adults a good deal of the time. What was the last American sitcom where that was true? (The Brits, on the other hand, are quite good at this sort of thing. But that's another endless debate.)<br /><br />Basically, go into expecting a cartoon, not a kids' film, and you'll get a lot more out of the experience. And there's a lot to be gotten, though obviously some folks need a pop culture concordance to get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>This movie is great.

Marginal recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I moderately enjoyed this but am starting to be bothered by the tendency of animators to be content with creating films that 1) have no real story and 2) are built around whatever animal characters haven't previously been used in other films.  Though other films have had lions, few or none have featured zebras, hippos, and giraffes.  I can imagine the early concept planning sessions:  "How about a gerbil?  Has anyone used them before?"  I can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure that they create the characters for these things first and then construct a story around them.  And that is the problem with this film:  they don't start by creating a great and compelling story.  Contrast this animated film with either of the SHREK films or THE INCREDIBLES.  The latter films have great stories.  Or going farther afield, contrast MADAGASCAR with any of the film by Hayao Miyazaki's masterpieces.  Miyazaki's films are not merely brilliantly animated; they feature magnificent stories.<br /><br />Despite not really having a story, the film is otherwise executed with the kind of panache and sheen that has become standard in the CGI-film.  The characters all look fascinating and are wonderful to look at.  Alex's mane, to cite only one example, with its hundreds of individually articulated strands of fur is stunning.  There isn't a frame in the film that isn't wonderful to gaze at.  And the voice over work and the individual jokes are marvelous to behold.  There just isn't a whole lot of story and what story there is arises from Alex's need to eat.<br /><br />My worry with the contemporary Hollywood animated film, whether CGI or hand drawn (though virtually none seem to be hand drawn these days) is that increasingly story is being neglected for the design of the look of the characters, a long string of in jokes, and the background art.  SHREK had all of these elements as well, but also featured a strong story.  So, a truly intelligent animated film clearly is still possible.  MADAGASCAR features some good characters, lots of good jokes, and looks spectacular, but it just doesn't have much of a story.  I would gladly have given up a few of the jokes for even a halfway decent story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>The best DVD thing about MADAGASCAR besides the hip and funny zoo guys going  wild, the witty story, great character design, ultra-sharp wonderfully hued transfer and the cool commentary by the scene-stealing penguins is the absolutely brilliant voice work by Sacha Baron Cohen. Too bad he's not featured on the extras.<br /><br />If you missed this one and are looking for a riotous family film, all ages will laugh out loud and won't mind seeing it more than once.  The bar is raised very high.

It is an interesting idea to contemplate that what a zoo animal would think, if they existed outside of the fences of the zoo.  However, several studies have shown that animals that have grown up in captivity run a great chance of extinction once released into the wild.  Nevertheless, animated comedy tries to apply the notion of setting free tame animals into the wilderness, which offers an amusing rollercoaster that throws pies and pulls the chair from underneath the audience with a myriad of silly slapstick moments.<br /><br />Several computer-animated films that have received a blockbuster release such as Toy Story (1995), Shrek (2001), and The Incredibles (2004), and sequels have also driven in a large chunk of money.  Most CGI animations have been exceptional in their narratives, thus why not make another animated film with the help of computers.  However, Madagascar lacks some of the brilliant storytelling that has gone hand-in-hand with CGI films.  Unfortunately, most of the film tends to build on previously applied humor, and an exaggerated amount of slapstick humor.  After awhile the silly tripping and slams in the face become an uninspiring event of repetitive thinking and mere time fillers in the featured film.<br /><br />Despite the negative aspects, there is still some greatness within the film, as the four animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) begin their journey into the unknown.  The caricature of the quartet is terrific, as the Alex superego emerges in the gifts he gives his friends and the overwhelmingly hysterical hypochondriac Melman.  The best part in the film is the four scheming penguins that are on a mission to return to the snowy widths of Antarctica, and the meeting with Sacha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Ali G's lemur persona King Julien XIII.<br /><br />The story opens with an amusing dream sequence where Marty dreams of his personal paradise in the wilderness, as he is racing towards a small lake.  Alex, who also chased him in the dream, shatters this dream.  It is an amusing comparison between the dream and reality, as Marty's reality consists of having a lion as a friend while in the dream Alex was chasing him.  Furthermore, it suggests the idea of a twisted sense of reality that Marty and the other zoo animals possess.  To broaden the concept of twisted reality, it might serve as an analogical perspective of humanity's la-la land vision of life's permanence and the idea of existential safety.  However, this is to stretch the artistic process of the computer-animated zoological journey into an intellectual domain, which illustrates a number of interesting concepts in the light of Darwin where the strongest survive.<br /><br />Marty decides to make his dream reality, as he escapes to explore the world.  Actually he intends to explore New York and maybe a little of what lays beyond the city borders.  However, his three friends intend to find him and return him to the safety of the zoo while they all are unaware of humans true feelings of wild animals, in particular lions.  To their dismay, they learn that they are returning to Africa, as society deems that they belong in their natural habitat.  However, after an accident relating four penguins involved in a large ship hijacking, the quartet lands on the beaches of Madagascar.  Several different emotions flush through them such as anger, fear, panic, happiness, and hope, as they try to get their bearings on the life in the wild.  It is amusing to see how they handle the new situation, as they mostly appear like people visiting a foreign culture.  The quartet's narrow-minded comments to King Julien and his entourage is compared to Californians having a P. Diddy party, which is understandable as it is all they know.<br /><br />Ultimately, Madagascar delivers comic relief to both young and old, even though this film will most likely be more entertaining to the younger viewers with its high level of slapstick humor.  Compared to other recent films with CGI animation Madagascar does not succeed in delivering an equally impressive storyline, yet it clearly finishes above an average cinematic experience.  There are both hits and misses within the story.  It is obvious that it will entertain an audience, but it misses a story with thorough substance from beginning to the end and it hurts the overall cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) is having a midlife crisis.  He's tired of life in the Central Park Zoo and wants to see what life is like in the wild.  When he escapes, his three friends try to chase him down and bring him back.  And while Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) do catch up with him, it doesn't turn out quite as planned.  Instead, all four of them find themselves headed to Africa.  Will they survive when they get there?<br /><br />I normally steer clear of Dreamworks Animation movies because I find them pale imitations of the Disney Pixar films they are attempting to rip off.  But the previews for the sequel looked so entertaining, I had to give this one a try.  I should have stayed away.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few amusing moments.  I laughed at several of the movie spoofs.  But that was about it.  The story was boring.  The characters had so much potential.  Instead, they went with the easy joke (read bathroom humor) and didn't play out the jokes the premise could have set up.  As many have said, the group of commando penguins are the funniest things in the film, but they don't have nearly enough screen time to make much difference.<br /><br />Then there's the issue of voice casting.  Yes, most of the cast did fine.  But I couldn't get Ross from Friends out of my head whenever Melman had a line.  Trust me, that was very distracting.<br /><br />Many have dismissed Disney's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G75AZC">The Wild</a> as a rip off of this film.  That's a shame because, for my money, it is the far superior film.  Stay away from this one and get a copy of that film.  Instead of staring at the TV screen, you'll be laughing from start to finish.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Not as fast moving or funny as "Madagascar 2:  Escape to Africa."  Still, it was enjoyable and entertaining, with excellent animation and the same goofy characters as "Madagascar 2."  I could watch "Madagascar 2" over and over - but one time is enough for the first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>I didn't think much of "Madagascar". It sees a bunch of animals escape from Central Park Zoo, New York, only to be captured, deported, shipwrecked, and caught up in Lemur/Foosa politics on Madagascar and the instincts of the wild. It felt more like a TV special than a movie, and didn't really have much of an ending. I found the style of jokes kind of tired, just let me down a bit. Special features include some new footage of the penguins, among other things.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A WONDERFUL animated comedy, Madagascar, brings to the screen the story of four animals who escape from the zoo in NYC and the "sheltered life" they had been living there only to end up in the wilderness on the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa, with all the ups and downs that that entails!<br /><br />Madagascar is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!<br /><br />In short, Madagascar is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek movies, Antz, and Monsters Inc.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>The work in this film, DVD and the extras really shows; and it's  all high quality.<br /><br />The Film is a simple enough concept, covered well in other reviews. But the packaging of the DVD is a masterpiece. The Menu is entertaining. The Main Commentary is technically enlightening, but not entertaining. The so-called Penguin commentary is actually labelled  Penguin  chat, and should have been feature length; and I REALLY  hope that the Penguins return somehow, since they are the standout gems, and are clearly aimed at an adult viewership.<br /><br />The remaining extras are all  great kids fun. Nothing is really non-family  friendly; in fact this is another film that transcends boundaries in that respect.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>This is the only movie so far this year that I took in a movie theatre, so I don't know how many more movies I will see in a movie theatre before 2005 comes to an end. I still saw this film, even if it got bad reviews from the movie critics, but you can bet that you might be laughing at lot, in a movie theatre, but if you see this again, at home, you might find yourself wondering why you were laguhing in the movie theatre. On his 10th birthday, zebra Marty (voice of Chris Rock) spends the day peforming for the crowds at the Central Park Zoo, but that evening he is visited by pengins that are seeking, to get out of New York. Which gives him an idea to leave the zoo, but then best friend Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), discovers that he is missing, and he, Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer from TV's Friends), escape from the zoo, to track down their missing friend, they track him down, and even up on a ship be shipped to Africa. But then, they are thrown off the boat, and are reunited on a desert island, that looks deserted, but it lead by King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen, TV's notorious Ali G). If you love Dreamworks animated movies, then catch up with Madagascar, but parents be warned that this has a PG rating, which is the usual rating that Dreamworks gets for thier animated movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I really wanted to see this because of all the hype surrounding it.  I thought the characters were cute and there were a few funny parts in it, but that's where it ends for me.  It wasn't all that entertaining of a film.  I think children would like this (I'm in my 20's), but it wasn't my cup of tea, I was rather disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>MADAGASCAR is a delightful animated film from the makers of SHREK.  Although the leading roles are entertaining and effective, the movie is stolen by the quartet of penguins and the gallery of lemurs.  These guys are what really makes the movie so enjoyable.  The animation is brilliant, and there is some clever in jokes parodying CHARIOTS OF FIRE, PLANET OF THE APES and other movies.  There are some delightful tunes as well.  The main voices are supplied by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith and David Schwimmer, but its those hilarious penguins and lemurs that make the most lasting impression.  The four penguins are like undercover covert operators and the lemurs are just whacky and whimsical.  Little Mort (voiced by Andy Richter) is as Gloria the hippo says, "Cute enough to dunk in my coffee."  The movie has a slow start in the zoo setting but once the guys get to Madagascar, its a real hoot.  Children should enjoy the movie; its innuendos and off color humor will more than likely fly fight over their heads, but adults will enjoy this gem as much as the kiddies..I did!!  A marvelous extra is the short film PENGUINS CHRISTMAS CAPER which is a real gas too!</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>With their stunning visuals and apparent innocence, it's easy to forget that animated films are among the most tightly constructed and painstakingly written movies ever made: the writers have 80 pages to tell a universally appealing character-based tale which not only has a suitable "moral" for a child audience, but is also edge-of-the-seat engaging, includes at least one tear-jerking moment, and is laugh-out-loud funny to the extent of more than three jokes per page.  When it works, it really works: "Toy Story" (1 and 2), "Ice Age", "Finding Nemo" and "The Lion King".  When it doesn't work, as is the case here, it's all too obvious.  "Madagascar" takes far too long to get to where we all know it's going, and when it gets there very little happens.  The "friendship vs. instinct" theme is superficially explored in the character of Alex the Lion, but it isn't sufficiently connected to the rest of the story.  What's missing is a strong villain, and a point: sure our four friends want to get home, but there isn't much they can - or do - actually do about it, is there?  Fortunately, "Madagascar" is almost saved by the strength of the vocal performances - Sacha Baron Cohen, as King Julien in particular - and the antics of the minor characters.  The lemurs and the penguins save the day, in more ways than one.  There are some neat parodies of other movies - referencing everything from "American Beauty" to "The Mission" - but overall this lacks that elusive mix of wit, heart and good old-fashioned storytelling that distinguishes the best in the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Tom McGrath, the producer of this movie does the voice on Skipper the Penguin.  He should do cartoons, because he was a perfect match.  The penguins MAKE this movie, along with Melman (David Schwimmer) and Julius the Lemur King (Sacha Baron Cohan)!  First off I just want to say that critics are not always right, and this is proof of that.  You begin to realize that critics get stuck in a mold.  They don't like more than a handful of elements for a movie and feel that anything that breaks that mold is just not good.  Thats why I hardly ever listen to them, and for one, I am glad I went to see this.  There was actually a scene where I laughed so hard I was crying.  Just wait until our four legged friends meet the Lemurs.  THE BEST SCENE EVER!  So the movie starts with Marty the Zebra (Rock) turning 10 years old and he's wishing he was in the wild.  Alex the Lion (Stiller) is his best friend (a little self centered, which I fould hilarious because I took my eight year old nephew to this movie and his name is Alex and he is EXTREMLY self centered!) and Alex is trying to convince Marty the wild is bad...I mean come on, what can be better than the NY zoo (which by the way looks really small in this movie)  In the meantime Marty meets the penguins (McGrath) who are planning to escape and make their way to Antarctica.  So Marty breaks out that night and tries to make it to CT, since that's where Melman tells him the wild is (it's funny trust me) and that's where his friends Gloria (Pinket-Smith), Melman and of course Alex try and find him.  In an effort to do so they all (penguins included) end up on a ship to Kenya.  The penguins aren't having that so they kidnap the captain and turn the ship around towards Antarctica.  In the process Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria are tossed overboard and washed up on Madagascar.  The rest of the movie is pretty much Marty trying to make the best of things and Alex trying to get rescued, the other two are pretty much just along for the ride...But the greatest part of the plot here revolves around the Lemurs.  See there is some weird kind of cat called the Foosca that are feeding on the Lemurs and the King of the Lemurs Julius decides that they must befriend Alex the Lion so he can protect them from the Foosca, all of this against the will of his advisor played by Cedric the Entertainer.  The rest of this movie is priceless and one of the best scenes involves the Penguins making it to Antarctica.  "This sucks"...it's great...just wait, you'll love it.  So my recomendation is watch this movie.  It's better than Shark Tale, more livly than The Incredibles and just as, if not funnier than Shrek...You'll love it!</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I enjoyed certain parts of this Movie,but there were parts where it didn't have alot of substance whatsoever.the voices were alright,but this film doesn't even come close to other films in the same vein.the directing was nice&I liked the story,but something was just missing for me to fully get into it.not bad,but it should have been way better.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was really entertaining. It was really good. I think people of all ages should see the movie. It is truley a good Family film. It stars some very known Actors in it like, ben Stiller, Chris Rock, david Schwimmer & jada Pinkette Smith. This movie is about four spoiled animals, A Zebra, Lion, Hippo & A Gariffe, who have know idea what it is like in the wild. When Marty(The Zebra, Rock) wants to go to the wild because he is bored with the zoo life runs away the other three animals go looking for him. When they find him they end up getting Tranqulized and end up on a ship to africa. When Four penguins hijack the boat they are on they end up on an Island called Madagascar. can these Four Friends survive without thier papering. I hope so. The dvd also has a mini movie that stars the madagascar penguins. It's a little cute cartoon. this is a really Good movie. I also thought the animals they picked were fun. This is a really enjoyable movie.<br /><br />If you liked This Movie Check out The Madagascar Soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>This is the story of four friends, best friends who just happen to be animals. Alex the Lion who's spoiled with grooming and precut steaks; Marty the Zebra who loves his life but yearns for some more, Melman the hypochondriac Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo who acts as a surrogate mother to the other three. From the beginning we see how spoiled these friends are with their every whim filled by their caretakers.<br /><br />They end up packed in crates bound for a African preserve after Marty decides he wants to see "the wild" and goes out wandering in the streets of New York. This probably wouldn't have been so bad were it not for his friends deciding to go save him. Lions roaming the streets are a little more serious than Zebras. I didn't appreciate the humour of the NY cop asking his boss if he could shoot the Zebra. Because of unforeseen circumstances they end up severed from the ship, floating in the ocean and finally landing on a tropical paradise.<br /><br />Like any movie there are scene stealers. In this case, it's the four military trained penguins that also have their own Christmas short in the features area. Another scene stealer is an itty bitty lemur named Mort who has Puss-in-boot eyes and a nervous giggle.<br /><br />Obviously not true to life;  the gates are low so the animals can get to one another or at the crowds but then it's not every day you can hear a Zebra, Lion, Giraffe and Hippo talk, dance and sing. Great fun for kids but if the adults are looking for fun they'll only be mildly amused. As always the graphics are great, the music is toe tapping and there is humour. There are a few minute frightening scenes when the animals realize they are not in a Zoo anymore and cute cuddly little beings are being eaten by bigger not so cute ones but this is really short. There are a few other sad/dark points but overall it is a fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>I was not that interested in seeing this latest animated DreamWorks concoction until I saw an 11-minute short, "A Christmas Caper" just before the wondrous Wallace and Gromit feature, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit". In expertly rendered computer animation, it starred four physically adroit penguins who not coincidentally steal the feature-length film from which they originate. At 86 minutes, "Madagascar" has several entertaining scenes, brightly colored images and a kinetic pace that doesn't flag, but somehow the film falls short of the Pixar features to which the creators seem to aspire. A lot of it has to do with co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath trying too hard and co-screenwriters Mark Burton and Billy Frolick cramming a lot of story within its comparatively brief running time. They provide some sharp lines and winking references to other movies, but the movie lacks an ironic punch that would have made it truly memorable.<br /><br />The plot focuses on two animals, best friends in spite of their different species - a curiously dissatisfied zebra named Marty, who dreams of what life must be like outside his admittedly comfortable digs at the Central Park Zoo in New York, and an egocentric lion named Alex, who enjoys the limelight at the zoo but comes to terms with his natural tendencies amid the wilds of the jungle. It is both a blessing and a curse to have Chris Rock and Ben Stiller provide the voices for Marty and Alex respectively.  While they provide some expectedly funny moments, their motor-mouthed presence makes the film pretty exhausting to sit through without fidgeting, especially as Rock seems to be imitating Eddie Murphy's Donkey in the "Shrek" series. Neither seems to be directed to develop characters but rather magnify their personalities. Faring marginally better on the sidelines are Jada Pinkett-Smith as Gloria, the no-nonsense hippopotamus, and David Schwimmer in Ross Geller overdrive as Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe.<br /><br />Once the setting moves to the Rousseau-like tableaux of Madagascar, the movie improves considerably with the addition of comical lemurs in thrall of the crate-wrecked visitors -  Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G, plays the hilariously despotic King Julien XIII with a heavy dollop of Indian curry, Cedric the Entertainer is the put-upon Maurice and Andy Richter makes the saucer-eyed Mort sound like the first cousin of a Spielberg gremlin. There is even a nod to the actual "Born Free" movie not only in the use of the theme song in the opening but in a relatively somber sequence that has Alex coming back to his natural tendencies among the feared fossas to the increasing fear of his lifelong friends. But the movie's brightest spots are provided by the four penguins (voiced by members of the crew) and two erudite monkeys who are used mostly as transitional cues in the story.<br /><br />The DVD has a fairly standard set of extras, though I liked the alternate audio commentary track provided by the penguins. The deleted scenes, "Mad Mishaps", are fairly incompressible for their deletion other than the fact that they aren't in finished form, and "The Tech of Madagascar" is quite dry as is usual for seeing the mechanics behind computer animation. For the kids, there is the video for the inescapable "I Like to Move It, Move It" song by the lemurs and video games galore, as well as "Enchanted Island", a genuine educational featurette on the real Madagascar.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>My kids were very excited once this came out on DVD. This film is as good as Shrek, with humor for little kids and us big kids as well. The penguins are awesome and the lemurs are hilarious! This is a funny and charming movie. Based on the story of Marty played by Chris Rock who longs for life outside of the zoo. However Alex and the rest of Marty's friends enjoy the life of luxury at the zoo. Marty decides to venture outside the zoo. And his friends go after him. Subsequently get caught and is sent away. After that it's gets really interesting.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Lemurs. But, I love the penguins and the fact that they are always so sneaky; they really steal the show from the main characters.<br /><br />This is also a mark of great animated film for both adults and children to enjoy.<br /><br />"The Incredibles", for instance, was a fantastic blend of story, action, character and humor which will continue to delight people of all ages. "Madagascar" has a very funny story, great characters, and a lot of humor. On a couple of occasions, the story was a little slow, but I think all of the other areas more than compensate for any shortcomings. And adults will laugh at many of the jokes, probably more so than the kids in the audience. "Madagascar" again is a really good, very funny film suitable for the entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This is a funny and charming movie.

I guess better an be safe then sorry!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>As a big fan of special effects and animation in general, I must say that we're hitting a "dry Patch".  We went through this in the middle 90's when everyone was making feature length 2d animated features.  The thinking of the day was; "Disney's making bushels of cash with them, so should we!"  Not bad thinking, but un-original.  We simpley O.D.ed on Disney-style animation.  A great art form, but too much.<br /><br />Of course, there was this little thing called "Toy Story" that came along and really changed everything.  And we got many great CG animated films such as all the Pixar films, Shrek, Ice Age (shrek Jr.), Antz and even Jimmy Neutron.  Unfortunately, now all the participating studios have forgotten past lessons.  But there is a difference this time.  This time, corporate greed has exceeded it's quota.  These CG films are so filled with trendy music, product placements, and so-so actors that they are losing the one element that makes great film;  STORY.  And though the films still make money, they nolonger feel "special".  Soon enough, they will nolonger make money either.<br /><br />Here's some things that make "Madagascar" no better than 3 stars in my mind:<br /><br />-All of the voice actors are very trending and(to me)extremely annoying.  Ironically, the no-name voices are the entertaining ones.<br /><br />-I consider The yellow bar on the DVD case that says "#1 family film of the year" as a warning that when translated reads; "Bare-bones DVD inside.  Forced promotional spots included".  (See Shrek2).<br /><br />-"The Incredibles" (the last really good CG film) has everything "Madagascar" does not; Great stroy, great characters, great imagery and not the least bit trendy.<br /><br />-Madagascar is so heavy with trendy, sales oriented gimicks that it will become dated very quickly.  Not as bad as "Shark tale" but trendy none-the-less.<br /><br />-Caracter development is thin.  Each character has their gimmicky "thing" but it does not help you like or care about them.<br /><br />-The penguin side story (voiced by animators)is actually more funny and entertaining than the "lead" characters' story line.  Their arival "home" is a classic "cartoon" moment.<br /><br />-Chris Rock, David Schwimmmer, Ben Stiller...  ... I can't think of three, more annoying actors.  Stiller, as a voice, is non-descript.<br /><br />-Kids do enjoy this movie, but they like "Shark Boy and Lava Girl" too.<br /><br />-Lemers epitomise this whole story; Self-serving, annoying, loud, obnoxiuos, gimmick-laden and cheeky.  The little song they sing is kind of ammusing though.<br /><br />-The style of the characters was actually pretty cool.  A very cartoony, exagurated look.<br /><br />-My wife and I left the theater basically unaffected.  Can you think of a worse thing to say about any film?<br /><br />-I Think I would have enjoyed the film much more if the animals never talked.  There were enough "cute" moments to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />After all this, I ask myself (you may have wondered too) "how on earth did I give it 3 start instead of 1?".  I guess it is because I really do enjoy animation on all levels.  A lot of artists put a lot of themselves into this production.  I guess I'm dissapointed in the overall feal of the film.  CG is nolonger a guarantee that a film will be entertaining (let alone good).  If more productions like "Madagascar" get made, people will stop flocking to the theater just because a film is produced in 3d CG. As Syndrome said in "The Incredibles"; "When everyone's super, Then no one will be".</p></br><a href="../users/A2FS38D943KX12.html">A2FS38D943KX12</a><br/><p>Really, we've seen all of this before, and done better.  CGI in an of itself is no longer enough to intice the families into the theatre.  The huge success of "The Incredibles" was not in the excellent CGI work, but in the fact that the story could have worked just as well with live actors.  Good script, good dialogue, and good acting really do make a difference.<br /><br />However, the studios that churn out these CGI vehicles on a regular basis don't seem to have noticed this.  They think that if you get some big-name talent for your voices, throw in a little slapstick, some toilet humor (for the under-10 crowd) and some hip pop culture references (for the parents slowly dying in their seats), then you have the makings of another blockbuster.  Certainly this movie ultimately will show a modest profit for the investors, but if I recall correctly, the box office results can be charitably described as tepid.<br /><br />When we watched it, the kids were, at best moderately engaged by the movie.  They've seen enough CGI so that it is no longer a novelty.  There just wasn't enough in the movie itself to hold their interest...the characters were either uninteresting or annoying, and the storyline meandered too much to hold their interest.  Suffice it say that the adults would have rather been doing anything else than enduring this.  Echoing other reviewers, everyone liked the penguins, but that is hardly a recommendation for the movie as a whole.<br /><br />I would not consider buying this movie, as I doubt the kids would watch it more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I have lost almost all respect for animated films these days, and this movie is the likely cause for this epidemic of bad animated movies. Seriously, this movie is pretty piss-poor by what I expect from an animated movies. This movie is hardly funny by any means and is just flatout stupid as hell. The animal characters are very annoying and why was R&B music included ? The story is a disaster, the plot just pisses me off, and the dialogue is a travesty. If you truly like movies avoid this pile of poisonous suckage.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Ben Stiller (Zoolander, Envy), Chris Rock (Dogma, Longest Yard),<br /><br />David Schwimmer (Duane Hopwood, Friends), Jada Pinkett Smith (Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions), Sascha Baren Cohen (The Ali G Show), Andy Richter (Big Trouble, Dr. T and The Women) and Cedric The Entertainer (Be Cool, Man of the House) lend their voices to this funny comedy which kids will eat it up like hot cakes, which also has adult themes in it as well. A Zebra (Rock) wants to go out into the wild when he finds out the psychotic Penguins are gonna try to escape from the zoo to go to Antartica, so he busts loose and his animal friends, A Lion (Stiller), A Hippo (Smith) and A Giraffe (Schwimmer) go after him but they get caught, along with the Penguins and Monkeys and are shipped off back to their mainland. But then, the Penguins take over the ship making The Lion, The Zebra, The Hippo and The Giraffe go over board and wind up on the sandy beach of Madagascar where they meet Lemur friends. Some pretty funny dialouge from the actors....the greatest thing is watching the Penguins...and their even funny in the small little movie A Christmas Caper. Not the best animated movie but it sure was funny watching The Penguins.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>My kids saw this movie like three times at the theater.  They swore up and down that it was hysterically funny.  Kewel...  I never got the chance to see it, so when the DVD came out yesterday I snatched it up, of course.  Well, my children and I watched it first thing when I got home from work and I gotta say... it was not hysterically funny.  In fact, it seemed really pushed and formulaic.  I like Ben Stiller most of the time and Chris Rock and David Scwimmer was perfet for the hypochodriac giraffe, but it seemed forced.  The penguins were funny...as were the lemurs.  It just felt middle-of-the-road for me.  I usually enjoy animated movies with my kids (we own every Disney DVD) and I did enjoy this one, just not that much.  Kind of a disappointment.  See for yourself.  Maybe I was just tired, but I doubt that.  I know funny and it did garner a few chuckles from me, but this is not knock-down-drag-out funny.  (See Monty Python's Holy Grail for that or Spinal Tap or The Emperor's New Groove for that matter....)  Overall...bland.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Madagascar is a mediocre movie. Not the best when it comes to family entertainment.<br /><br />The CGI is great (especially with the details in it) The casting is ok. A lot of good names. The problem is the plot. It's boring and has no bunch. The jokes are lame (maybe because I'm not 10) While other movies have jokes for parents and kids, this movie doesnt seem to have them. Madagascar needs to be a funnier movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>Well this is no Shrek, Findidn Nemo oh wait it's not like most animated films oh wait it is better then Shark's Tale. I found this film to focus more to the younger ages and focuses to much on the naimation and the voces and not on the story. The movie is about Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer). David Schwimmer is the only thing good about the film, Jada Pinkett Smith seems lost and the rest are ok. Overall not that much jokes make the film slow and not intersesting.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There is something so adorably manic about this movie that I can't help but totally love it.  It just continues to bring a smile to my face no matter how many times I see it (which is a lot considering my daughter's fascination with it).  The crude-like animation (it's pretty, but it's also clunky in an odd way) and the dead-pan humor add to the enjoyment factor because this feels like a perfect balance of adult and child entertainment.<br /><br />Nothing will go over their heads, and nothing will fly under yours.<br /><br />The film follows an oddly mismatched group of animals who form a bond while living out their lives in the New York Zoo (depicted as like the smallest zoo in the history of forever).  One of those `friends' is Marty, a zebra who loathes the confines of his `area' and dreams of running free in his homeland.  His best friend is Alex, the conceited and self-centered lion who is the prime attraction of the zoo, and he takes that rather seriously.  Gloria, the hippo, is soft hearted yet opinionated and Melman is a germaphobic and paranoid giraffe.  Together, they make a fun group who wind up being shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar after a botched escape plan lands them on a boat headed for Kenya that is hijacked by penguins and rerouted.<br /><br />Yes, it's that kind of movie.<br /><br />Once on the island, Alex becomes devastated and irritated while Marty soaks it all in like he's hit the jackpot.  Then, they meet the lemurs and the lunacy begins as their leader tries to use the island's new inhabitants as cyphers for the island's dreaded carnivores.<br /><br />The music is fun, the voice acting is genius (especially on the part of Sacha Baron Cohen, David Schwimmer and Chris Miller) and the overall enjoyment factor is really, really high here.  This is a film the whole family can and will enjoy, from start to finish.<br /><br />We like to move it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>Why is it, whenever another major studio tries to do an animated film it usually sucks?<br />Shrek is the only exception.<br />Madagascar is still a fun movie with great animation.<br />The script and story line is pleasant and fun to watch.<br />It's not too scary or too serious for the youngins.<br />All in all, it's not The Lion King but it's still good for kids.<br />Adults may be a bit bored by it.

This is another great animated film from Dreamworks! The animation is first rate with lots of funny characters and a simple story. The DVD edition boast a great transfer and plenty of interesting extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>This is what happens when you choose top talents all around to make an animated film:  you get a tight story, likeable and distinct characters, great dialog and a quirky but state of-the-art look.  What's more, the adults as well as the kids are entertained.  All this and more went into the making of Madagascar.<br /><br />Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) are fast friends in a New York zoo.  We presume they have lived there all their lives because it's obvious that none of them are aware of the natural order of predators and prey.  They are also every bit the pampered New Yorkers that any celebrity humans of the city are; they live on schedules, customized diet plans and adoration.  For the most part the animals are quite content with their urban lifestyle, except that is for Marty.  He dreams of what it would be like to run free in the wild - or at least his fantasy version of the wild that he gets from zoo murals and publicity ads.  So one day, he orchestrates his own escape just for the heck of it, and his friends must follow in order to, uh, save him.  It was a disaster all around, but it got the attention of animal rights nuts, which ended in all of the animals heading on a ship for a wildlife preserve in Africa.<br /><br />To make a long story shorter, the penguins had plans of their own and they hijacked the ship for Antarctica.  The four animal friends were jettisoned overboard accidentally and then drifted off course to the island of Madagascar (which they mistake for the San Diego Zoo).  This is the setup for some of the funniest misunderstandings and comedic moments of the movie.  Was the wild everything that Marty was hoping for?  Can Alex get over the loss of his star status now that he has competition from a lemur king - and more importantly, where is he going to find a steak in this freaky new place?  And, will Melman and Gloria be able to keep them all out of trouble?<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, Madagascar is the best family film since Toy Story 2 (which my kids watched nearly every day for a few months, once upon a time.  I know, it's just horrible of me!:).  Everything was superbly done, from the big name stars' voices on down to the minor characters', the design of the animals, landscapes, etc and the little details that went into the animation. The humor worked through dialog jokes on the adult level (but never inappropriately) and visually for the kids.  The whole experience had LOL moments and a sense of fun and delight.  And of course it was impossible to resist the adorable but not syrupy lemurs and penguins.  I can honestly not find one thing to fault or criticize about this movie - splendid job!<br /><br />Dvd extras include interviews with the cast and creators, which I found fun and interesting.  Madagascar is without a doubt one for your permanent home collection.  Enjoy.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I had just read and reviewed a book on Madagascar so I was really interested when my granddaughter and I watched this movie. I'm telling you it was great. I won't go into the story as you can read about it yourself in these reviews, but I will tell you there were so many fun things about watching it that I'm still smiling.<br /><br />The storyline is great, the soundtract oustanding, visuals bring every activity to life, animation supurb and the characters are a chuckle a minute.  My top favorite, "GLORIA, the hippo." Why is it that I believe I know some humans that remind me of Gloria.<br /><br />You have to see this one, with or without a child. It truly is entertainment at its best.  Sit back, relax, giggle and enjoy. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>The animals of New York Zoo have a good life. They get food on demand and the public adore them, but Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) still pines for the wild. After a botched escape attempt lands him and his friends on a remote beach, the animals have to learn to fend for themselves. Striking a perfect balance between wit, slapstick and self-awareness, Madagascar is as fluffy as a meringue and twice as tasty.<br /><br />From the moment that Marty bounds delightedly across the screen to the ironic strains of Born Free, it's clear that we're dealing with DreamWorks the minds that brought us Shrek. While the brilliant boffins of Pixar concern themselves with timeless stories, Spielberg's gang has always been about the jokes. The noisy, zeitgeisty attitude of DreamWorks' toons can be disastrous - witness the bloated bling of Shark Tale - but Madagascar hits the mark with all four hooves.<br /><br />"PLEASURABLY DEVOID OF SENTIMENT"<br /><br />Ben Stiller is on typically neurotic form as Alex, a friendly lion whose taste for steak sets him apart from his herbivorous pals, and there's good work from David Schwimmer as a hypochondriac giraffe. But it's the background detail that makes Madagascar roar, from the party-mad lemur tribe led by Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G), to a quartet of psychotic penguins. It's also a pleasure to see a cartoon so determinedly devoid of sentiment, a stance confirmed by the hilarious demise of an angelic little duckling. Highly recommended for kids and adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Madagascar is your typical children's movie.  In fact, this computer-animated feature had the least amount of adult humor of any other one I've seen.  The only character that is really funny on their own is Mehlman the Giraffe, voiced by David Schwimmer.  And the only reason he's funny is because his character has a gimmick.  There are a few funny moments throughout, and the pack of lemurs are fairyl entertaining, but there really was no story at all, and the animation wasn't all that great compared to recent features.<br /><br />I'm sure children love this film, but for me it was the same old schtick, different title.</p></br></body></html>

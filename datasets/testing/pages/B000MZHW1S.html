He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed. Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film. He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc... though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate. That's his face, and close-ups are numerous. Yet his body language does not remain that coherent and he still keeps some of his adolescent even pubescent lascivity in some attitudes and movements. He will learn, they say, provided they do not lock him up in roles of villains just the way they had locked him up in roles of smooth-skinned and practically hairless desirable adolescents, in spite of Basketball Diaries where he had quite another potential. So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression. Yet the film was expected for a completely different reason. The mythic scandal of our modern world: the wars both for and fed by diamonds in Africa but waged by children soldiers who enrich some weapon dealers and diamond speculators with not only their blood, but also the blood of their parents shed by and with their own hands. The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves. This film is ruthless, systematic, unavoidable in the obvious conclusion that the rich of this world need these wars to become richer. This commitment of an actor like Leonardo Di Caprio to this necessary struggle to make our world more humane, can only help millions of people to understand those wars have to stop, not be stopped by tyrannical foreign military interventions, but by negotiations, economic sanctions and sentences against those who are responsible for these unacceptable feudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of. It is good Hollywood gets aboard the train to humanistic globalization.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I can see there are over three hundred reviews for this movie.<br />What can I add to the discussion?<br />Probably not much lol.<br />I'll make it short.<br />The good.<br />Everything.<br />Excellent story, excellent acting, perfect direction, pacing, score, you name it, it was done well.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Some people have said this movie is a tad preachy and yeah, it is but it wasn't enough to make me deduct any stars.<br /><br />After seeing Leo in Shutter Island I finally decided to revisit his older work and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />An excellent film and a must see.<br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In 1999, in Sierra Leone, the fisherman Solomon Vandy dreams on the day that his young son Dia Vandy will become a doctor. His dreams are shattered when the rebels invade his village and kidnap him to work in the diamond mines. Solomon finds a huge pink diamond and while hiding it, the commandant of the rebels sees, but the rebels are attacked and Salomon is arrested by the government army. While in jail, the wounded commandant tell the prisoners that Salomon found the stone, and the mercenary smuggler Danny Archer from Zimbabwe releases Salomon and proposes to exchange the diamond by his missing family. Using the idealistic American journalist Maddy Bowen, Danny locates the wife and daughters of Salomon in a refugee camp, but is informed that his son has been recruited by the rebels. Salomon and Danny consolidate a partnership, with Salomon looking for and finding his son, and Danny looking for the diamond and finding redemption. This movie is a work of amazingly orchestrated chaos. A visually sumptuous, bullet-train-paced thriller with a really provocative theme. A must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>There are quite of lot of people out there who are not sold on Leonardo Dicaprio's acting abilites--I am not one of them.  He delivers a strong performance in this topical drama and deserved an nomination for Best Actor as well. The picture and sound in HD DVD is superb and I whole-heartedly recommend you buy this one to show off your system!! Dijmon Hounsou is also superb in this and I believe he was also nominated.  The only flaw I can see in this is the beautiful Jennifer Connelly--she has no chemistry with DiCaprio and the film could have been better without her character. Not to put down her acting ability (remember she did win for "A Beautiful Mind") but her character just wasn't really needed in this fine film at all!!  Ed Zwick's direction is on target and he captures the plight of the Africains as they are being exploited by the mercenaries and Europeans for profit.  A visual and aural feast for all you HD DVD enthusiasts!!</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond was not a movie high on my list.  I originally thought it was an action movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Although it is much more than that.  The story takes us to war strewn country of Sierra Leone where the government is trying to fend off the rebels.  Watching the movie made me realize there is really no good side.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the late 90's when people in the United States were more concerned about the Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky scandal.  There were very real problems going on in the world and that is apparent in this story.  The movie makes no excuses for the excessive violence since it was and is such a real issue in the world.  Diamond smuggling is a multi billion dollar business fed on the Western desire for the precious jewels.<br /><br />The story develops quickly with an average family living in a small village.  Their life was generally peaceful in an exploding world.  The rebels then attack the village taking no prisoners.  The battle becomes very real when you see small children with machine guns shooting at everyone.  When the dust settles the Solomon's family has escaped and he has been trapped.  Solomon is then quickly shuttled off to a diamond field to begin work searching for diamonds.  During this work Solomon comes across a diamond as large as an egg.  Surprised by this find he realizes the only thing he can do is take the diamond and hide it.<br /><br />What happens then is an amazing story filled with action and suspense.  A journey that never stops and can only takes one breath away when they realize this is something that really happened.  It is a sad story but it is also a happy story.<br /><br />I watched the Blu-ray version which was filled with a beautiful picture and wonderful sound.  It also had many extra features including a wonderful documentary about the smuggling business.  For anyone with a Blu-ray player I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best movies of the year.  With the lack of great movies this year it's great to have a diamond in the rough.  A story that is incredibly amazing and true.  Sometimes almost hard to believe this could be real.  This is a journey of how greed can lead to terrible things.  I hope if you take the time to watch this you learn something about wrongs that have occurred because of greed.  A definite must watch for anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>... said of the diamond-industry. And, true enough.<br /><br />While Zwick's film "suffers" from a similar "problem" as Terry George's "Hotel Rwanda" (a critical "story" told primarily through thoroughly Westernized characters), much like George's work this tactic helps garner the attention of the Western world (and, thus, the "problem" is entirely forgivable).<br /><br />While conflict-diamonds have been the subject of countless journalistic-accounts and documentaries, too few Americans seemed to have noticed (BBC News and The History Channel do not seem to be priority-television for many). (And, like many of you, I was incredulous at the posts here which registered surprise that the film has a "message" ... one is forced to wonder, did these people even know of atrocities in Sierra Leone?! Or were they just buying a DiCaprio film?!) Zwick has done an immense service to the world by creating this work ... and DiCaprio and Hounsou for lending their names and talent.<br /><br />Kudos to script-writer Leaviitt for fearlessly tackling the "dirty" side of the diamond-industry. He painted them for the ghouls they really are (The De Beers corporation will happily tell you that they do not buy conflict-diamonds ... what they don't tell you is they have NO real way of knowing ... not even with the Kimberly Process in effect). And though the film concludes with a message to the viewer about demanding conflict-free diamonds, numerous investigations have determined that this process is NOT failsafe and that NO ONE should ever feel confident buying a diamond).<br /><br />In Zwick's work, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) declares that if the Western world understood the horror behind these diamonds, they wouldn't purchase them. I had to pause ... really? Since when do we Westerners (especially Americans) care about the cost of privilege? We continue to support some the most repugnant corporations on this planet. We still buy Nike (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Champion (guilty of child-labor). We still buy Coca-Cola (guilty of directly sponsoring Columbian death-squads). We still buy Nestle (guilty of the deaths of countless African children as a result of the formula scandal). And we still support Citibank (notorious for its environmental destruction). Can this film change minds? Maybe (Hopefully!) Will it just be consumed, discussed over beers at Bennigans, and forgotten? Probably.<br /><br />So what was the ultimate result of Zwick's courageous endeavor? Those in the Western world who have seen this work cannot possibly purchase a diamond without a pang of guilt ... and, for that alone, this film is an epic success. (Even though, I know, Westerners have an uncanny talent for selective-amnesia). Will they still buy diamond rings (and other equally indulgent rubbish)? Probably. But, now when they gaze at those glittering baubles on their hands, maybe ... just maybe ... they will consider those who do not have hands as a result. (Or maybe that's just wishful thinking?)<br /><br />Suggested viewing: The History Channel's "Blood Diamonds." (An in-depth account of the politics and atrocities of the diamond-industry). (Just do a "TV Guide" search for its next airing!)</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Frankly, Im not the biggest DiCaprio fan, but i really liked him in this, he was very believable as a white Rhodisian, though his accent goes in and out, sometimes it is spot on and other times it is...well..not..The movie has a brisk pace and it very violent, but it always felt real and you really want the characters to succeed.  The film has an authentic feel, I suppose from the fact it was accually filmed in Africa.  If this movie does not have you rethinking your diamond purchase, you need to check your ekg, you may be missing your heart.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>An African fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou in a powerful performance) wants a better life for his son so he makes sure he gets to school every day, hopefully one day he will be a lawyer. But this is Africa and nothing is that easy especially in a country torn apart by civil war. Danny Archer (Leonard DiCaprio stunningly good) is an ex-soldier of fortune now a diamond smuggler with some pretty high connections in the diamond industry. Director Edward Zwick pulls these two lives together in a powerful, sobering and riveting story. Maddy Bowen (an awesome Jennifer Connelly) an American journalist gets involved with Archer as she tries to get to the bottom of the muck in the diamonds business. But emotional core of the movie is Vandy's attempt to find his son who whe believes has been captured by the African rebels and his unblinding love for his family and attempts to find them and keep them together. This movie might make you think twice before you put on that diamond necklace, it pulls no punches and will leave you stunned at times. But great acting, a powerful story and superb directing make this a powerhouse of an action thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Even though Leonardo DiCaprio proves here he yet again that, like Brad Pitt, he is much more than a pretty boy. He can actually act!<br /><br />Insofar as playing and pulling off a mercenary, my choice would have been someone like Hugh Jackman, but Leo utilizes other aspects other than physical presense to pull this off. Our hats off to him!<br /><br />Blood Diamond's director Edward Zwick did another fantastic job here. We loved his The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise. Yet another fantastic thinking man's action flick.<br /><br />Blood Diamond also has the unusual unsappy love story, which is a much more realistic way to approach such things. Beautiful cinemetography, savage tribes and warlords abound here, showing the mostly unknowledgeable viewing audience of such real-life happenings in the world today. Brilliantly done.<br /><br />I was not expecting something so fresh and exciting in this film. Even my wife was spellbound, expecting a typical action movie. It is anything but!<br /><br />Africa is shown here in all its beauty and savagery, both in its locales and people, whether white or black. With its superlative storytelling, strong performances, excellent action sequences, and differing locales of harsh living and lush beauty, Blood Diamond delivers on many levels.<br /><br />This movie alone has changed the diamond trade, moving alot of people from purchasing diamonds from just anywhere and from just anyone. It teaches people to ask the right questions, regarding just from how and where any said diamond is from.<br /><br />That's just powerful movie making.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>despite itself.  This film as well as the press coverage surrounding its pre-theatrical release did bring attention to this monstrous situation in Africa. I confess, I didn't know anything about conflict diamonds prior to this.  I'm not a jewlry person.  I don't own a single diamond-or cubic zirconia.  Back to the movie.  Despite a compelling situation a couple of good acting performances, (Djimon Hounsou particularly.), great cinmetography and even score, the movie fails at making a grand slam with me.  There are way too many coinsidences and all three of our main characters are apparently shielded by a jedi's force given how they are able to dodge a billion bullets. Dicaprio's accent is strong in the begining and dies down considerably before we hit the mid marker.  It's never completely gone (circa Kevin Costner's Robin Hood) but it is noticable.  The romance (if you want to call it that) was sort of forced and seem to come out of nowhere.  Before you hit the final act, you can pretty much guess the Hollywood ending you're heading toward.  BUT it's still a good film and worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"Blood diamond" is a multidimensional movie, because it must be seen and scrutinized from different levels.<br /><br />First at all, it's a courageous film, that, following similar traces in  the same pattern of "The constant gardener" has decided to deal with this delicate and compromising issue about which everybody talks in silent voice. And the smart script involves the lives of four people, united randomly; a mercenary, an inquisitive journalist, a native and finally the big boss who is beyond stage in this dark affair , best known as conflictive diamonds.<br /><br />There's a lot of action, but also many moments to make us to reflect around this theme.<br /><br />Towering acting of all the cast and fluid direction of this talented director.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>I do not pretend to know anything about the diamond trade. I don't know much about those who mine the stones from the ground or what hardships are suffered by those who transport the gems between the yielding earth and the finger of one's beloved. Perhaps that is the point of "Blood Diamond," which tells the story of one Sierra Leonese family whose lives and fortunes are woven into the greed, violence and intrigue born of the diamond trade.<br /><br />The story of "Blood Diamond" is simple. In the 1980s, factions within Sierra Leone, in Western Africa, used the wealth gained from the diamond trade to buy the arms that fueled a brutal civil war in that nation. More guns made for more diamonds that made for more guns in an endless cycle of death. The interest of various groups and individuals collide in this mix of adventure, greed and brutality. Journalists seek the next big story; industrial mining behemoths seek their business interests; guerrillas seek power; mercenaries seek glory and cash; foreign soldiers seek to impose peace. Caught in the middle are ordinary families trying to live an ordinary, peaceful life.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a fisherman whose family life is torn apart by the violence surrounding the diamond trade. Finding himself literally enslaved by it, he one day finds an enormous, rare pink diamond. He attempts to hide it but is spotted by one of his captors. He escapes, and the chase becomes the plot of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a South African mercenary seeking his fortune in the diamond fields. Jennifer Connelly is Maddy Bowen, a journalist looking to make her own fortune in the publishing trade. Along the way, these three help each other toward a deeper awareness of the price of the trade, the hypocrisies of those who profit by denouncing it, and the need to succor those destroyed by it.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is incredibly violent, though not especially gory. The battle scenes are rendered with anarchic and gut-clenching verisimilitude. The film does oversimplify the diamond trade by showing it in its worst light. Though it sometimes veers toward clich&eacute; (as with the Wary Renegade who trusts no one but whose actions on behalf of others redeem himself) it succeeds in humanizing a heretofore faceless trade. The diamond that graces your loved one's hand or earlobe may not have caused a family to die in violence. But does it allow the one who mined to live in a shantytown while the executive who runs the company lives in obscene wealth? "Blood Diamond" suggests that the answer to that question should matter.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond tells the story of the turmoil that erupted during the late 1990s in Africa surrounding the trafficking of illegal diamonds. The story is told from three different points of view. Djimon Honsou, as an African man whose family is torn apart because of the turmoil. He is forced to work in a diamond mine while his wife and children are spread across Africa by the corrupt rebels. Leonardo DiCaprio, as the jewel smuggler who figures why not make a quick buck even at the expense of the continent he grew up in, since everyone else seeems inclined to do so. And Jennifer Connelly, as an American journalist who is eager to spread the word of the conflict so that it gets more widespread attention and the flow of these "blood diamonds" will stop. As Connelly's character says, "People back home wouldn't buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone else their hand." Or maybe they would. Blood Diamond is a story about good and evil, right and wrong, black and white. It's a story of opposites and how different people react to crisis situations. It was entertaining, to say the least, and action-packed and exciting the whole way through. It also had a strong message, solid direction, and a great cast. As other reviewers have noted, the African continent endured war long before the trade of conflict diamonds became worldwide news, but the fact remains that there are many people in the world who probably didn't, and still don't, know much about it. Blood Diamond attempts to shed light on an important issue, and it did so with elegance and precision. I would definitely recommend it, but would add that warning that it is in no way a light film that you will watch and forget. It's message resonates, and will stay with you for days later. BUt I think that was the point.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Though the film is raw and violent, Edward Zwick assures us in the Special Features dialogue that the actual barbarity of the RUF was far beyond anything depicted in the movie. There is a very emotional story between a father and his family and the quest to bring his son home after the boy is kidnapped by the RUF rebels and turned into a killer. This backstory behind the history brings a dose of realism to the characters that we can sink an attachment into. We really care about the story and what happens to the people in it; something that is often missing from many action packed films. Leo DiCaprio does a masterful job with the dialect and acting, along with Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly. This is a splendid screenplay that's well balanced, entertaining and at the same time complex in its description of just one of the many long struggles in Africa. Exceptional movie, brilliant acting! If I'd been a judge it would've won several Oscars.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This is definitely a movie that the critics have rated correctly. Briliant film about truth of the Diamond trade in Africa.  I am always leary about watching this kind of film, thinking it may just be some hollywood producer with a politcal chip on their shoulders, but this movie is really well done and the performances are great. Leonardo Decaprio does well and deserves his Oscar Nomination, but his performance is Honestly dwarfed by Djimon Hounsou, who in my book steal the show and of the two of them will be the one holding the statue at the end of the day.  The movie is very graphic and violent, so be forwarned.  Definite movie to see. unfortunately, I don't know if even a penny from seeing it will go to remedy the situation it was written about, thats the only drawback I see, but it will make most think more than twice before looking at a Diamond and its credentials.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Set in 1999 in the war-torn African country of Sierra Leone, Blood Diamond delivers an adventurous, action-packed, and tragic tale of what people will do for the most expensive rock on the planet, the diamond.<br /><br />Directed by Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), and starring Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Dijimon Hounsou (Amistad), and Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Blood Diamond is a satisfying but flawed thought-provoking film.<br /><br />The story revolves around three characters, the Souith African ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer, played with flair by Dicaprio, the African fisherman turned diamond miner Solomon Vandy, played brilliantly by Hounsou, and the TV reporter who is looking for a killer story about blood diamonds Maddy Bowen, played by Connelly. While mining for diamonds under force of the Armed Forces, Vandu finds a 10-carat diamond, buries it, and is captured and thrown in prison. In the meantime, rebels attack the village where his family live kidnapping his son Dia in the process and turning him into a child soldier. Archer knows he found the diamond he's been looking for and makes a deal with Vandy that if he helps him find it, he will get his family back and split the amount between the both of them. He also makes a deal with Maddy that if she helps the two men get to their destination, she can write the story she's been longing for.<br /><br />Blood Diamond isn't the best film of the year, but it has good performances of the cast, especially Dicaprio and Hounsou who could end up with Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and an insight into a world of sadistic violence and treachery with an ending result of diamonds on people's fingers, which could turn people away from the traditional marriage proposals!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />B-</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is an impressive and captivating movie experience.  It is a bit overly long, but it is entralling entertainment.  DiCaprio is totally believable in his role as jaded South African diamond smuggler Danny Archer who discovers that his heart still has some moral compass in it afterall as he assists both a journalist named Maddy, convincingly played by Jennifer Connelly of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVQLQQ">A Beautiful Mind</a>, who is trying to cover the corrupt diamond industries use of "conflict diamonds" which cause civil wars, poverty, unimaginable brutality, and slave labor within the countries where they are mined, and a simple fisherman named Soloman, wonderfully portrayed by the ever reliable Djimon Hounsou (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231202">Amistad</a>), who only wants to reunite with his family who have been reduced to either living in a refugee camp in a neighboring country or as slave labor/child warrior by various factions in the country's civil war.<br /><br />The themes of greed, family loyalty, love for country, poverty and war are handled well-enough if not a bit over-the-top at times.  However, the theme of redemption is handled with great care.  It's not heavy-handed and/or sentimental.  In fact, DiCaprio's character struggles with this consistently in the film as either pretends he doesn't need any kind of redemption or once he does he often takes the wrong path to redemption by using the diamond for his own means while acting as if he's doing it for others' sake.  He often looks at his actions as hitting three birds with one stone in that he gets his money from the diamond, Soloman gets his family, and Maddy gets her story; however, he later learns that that is not so simple and someone is going to lose out in this deal and lose big time.  Danny Archer is the kind of role I think would have attracted Bogart or Kirk Douglass during their acting days as they often played roles whose morals were rather ambiguous at times.<br /><br />Although a bit overly long and heavy handed in some thematic areas, this film is very engrossing, well-paced with action sequences, and extraordinarily well-acted.  Oscar nominations were abound for this small masterpiece of a film.  DiCaprio has rarely been better and although this came out the same year as his much praised performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>, I think he was far better in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond has some of the finest performances I have seen.  It is a telling comment when an actor makes you forget that you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou and convinces you that you are watching an unscrupulous smuggler and a fisherman.  Probably the overwhelming number of films that I have seen will have a scene that stretches the truth, something less than credible that makes the story exciting but is beyond the realm of certainty.  Blood Diamond, on the other hand, comes over like a piece of good journalism and you feel as if you are watching events as they unfolded.<br /><br />The story of the film has been nicely summarized by other reviewers.  It is, indeed, a story that has several layers one of them being the misery of modern Africa with its unstable governments and extreme poverty.  We see the immense piles of garbage that are the playgrounds for children and the enslavement of children by militias that turn them into child soldiers who are devoid of the simple delights of being children.  Greed is the overriding motive for Danny Archer, Solomon Vandy and Colonel Coetzee and Captain Poison.  Archer sees the diamond as his ticket out of Africa and Arnold Vosloo (and Captain Poison as well) for its fabulous wealth.  The sympathetic choice is Solomon because he not only found the stone (made a slave by the rebels and forced to pan for diamonds) but he would make a better life for his impoverished family.  On the other side of the diamond trade is journalist Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the misery that Africans are forced to endure searching for diamonds and the cartel turns a blind eye toward.  She begins a relationship with Archer and appears to slowly change his feelings toward the diamond corporation he smuggles for from one of complicity to a willingness to let her expose them.<br /><br />Director Edward Zwick (who also directed Glory and The Last Samurai) has produced another masterpiece of story telling.  The final scene is unforgettable as Solomon (the best performance I have seen Djimon Hounsou give), now reunited with his family in London, is about to tell his story before a commission investigating the diamond trade.  The film also makes a plea to us, the people who buy diamonds, to become responsible for discovering where the stone came from and if it could be a smuggled diamond.  This film will probably make you see diamonds in a new light and remind us that we can play a part to end the misery of how these gems are mined.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>This is the best movie of its kind that I've seen since "The Constant Gardener."

Conflict diamonds are basically those that are mined in Sierra Leone, but then smuggled into neighboring countries like Liberia (which was lead at the time by Charles Taylor) and then sold on the black market for much more than what the government Sierra Leone would be willing to pay and then sell them for.<br /><br />This lead to a group of rebels (the RUF - Revolutionary United Front) to spring up to oppose the government.  However these rebels were brutal in their diamond mining process.  They'd shoot anybody that didn't provide their share of slave work to mine the diamonds, basically.  This got to the point of slaughtering entire villages and then even the capital city, Freetown.  It wasn't until 2003 when a Treaty was signed by all diamond-producing African countries to keep "conflict diamonds" out of Western retailers.  However, this treaty isn't perfect and even to this day, many diamonds make it through this somewhat loose treaty and make it to stores near you.<br /><br />I may sound like a bleeding heart liberal on this issue, but this is pretty much the only issue I feel this way about.  I'm pretty much a hard conservative when it comes to everything else, but mining diamonds is pretty much legalized slavery and people die for the slighest infringement on their so-called duties.  Women really need to think twice before they request a huge rock from their fiances.  How many people have to die for you to wear a piece of ice?</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>I always thought of Leonardo DiCaprio as a bit of a 'twit', as the English say. But I must admit, I believed every second of his portrayal of Danny Archer, the un-PC Rhodesian mercenary. More than I believed any of the other characters, except maybe Arnold Vosloo. In fact, DiCaprio was the character that turned this super-PC movie into something that went beyond that and thereby, and despite its "I'm Important!"-shouting ending, made it into a 'good' movie.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou were burdened with lines so loaded with 'message' that it was almost cringe-factor-10 material. That they managed it to deliver most of them without me wanting to duck every time one of those lines was coming, is a testament to their skill. But in the end it was DiCaprio's sustained characterization--and accent!--that kept it all going.<br /><br />Blood Diamond, whose best and most enduring lines were those relating to the acronym 'TIA' (This Is Africa), wears the 'important' label like a General wears his decorations. Still, its impact is lost in overkill. The same movie without the message-bits would have been simply superb. And without that hokey ending, of course. Does anybody really believe that this trade is ever going to stop? Does anybody really believe that the true evildoers are the traders, middle-men, corrupt government officials, local potentates--and not the ultimate buyers themselves: the people of small minds and/or stupid vanities? For the majority of these diamonds do not go to the rich and powerful, but to those who flood into the local cheap-special-offer jewelry store when the occasions for buying arise or are fabricated by the peddlers of the goods. Without customers there are no middle-men and peddlers turn their attention to something people will buy instead.<br /><br />Apart from all that, let's look at another message of this movie: the one  about the child-soldiers in Africa, and everywhere else, for that matter. The Hitlerjugend happened in the middle of Europe, remember--and there's nothing new about this anyway. When you need some killers and are running out of grown-ups, the young are the most impressionable and easiest to mold. Even volunteer armies consist mostly of those qualifying as 'young'--and for good reasons, one of which is that in their brains one is more likely to find 'impressionability' and a lack of big-picture judgment. I believe the age of cerebral maturity is somewhere around the age of 25. Most soldiers are significantly younger than that.<br /><br />So, nothing new about child-soldiers, and if anybody thinks that's going to change, think again. The point was that as a 'point' to be made in a movie, Blood Diamond practiced overkill. The same point was made with much more impact and much more to the gut in Tears of The Sun, when one of the team of SEALs, while interfering in some ethnic cleansing in the middle of the jungle, killed one of those in the process of some serious rape and violence--only to find, to his horror that "He's just a kid. Just a f--g kid!" The look on the soldier's face as he stared close-up at the face of the dying child-soldier he's just stabbed: that will stay with me forever. Related scenes in Blood Diamond I already have a problem recalling. But what I do remember about it are all scenes involving 'Danny Archer'--which tells me something about the caliber of the actor who represented him.<br /><br />Here we have the difference between bad and good story-telling. But, of course, Tears of the Sun was a flick about US soldiers having a conscience and one with Bruce Willis at that. So it can't possibly have been as 'important' and was probably pure US Navy propaganda. Right? Never mind that it asked more questions per average minute of film than Blood Diamond asked in an hour. It's just that they weren't shoved into your face with a "Look here! Important stuff coming up!"<br /><br />Still, ignoring the gratuitous proselytizing, this was a damn good movie--and thanks to DiCaprio for making it that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Very compelling and well acted film showing all the corruption and suffering that go into producing the world's diamond supply.  Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as a corrupt adventurer who seeks out diamonds for some shady London businessmen.  He comes across a man in prison who claims to have found a huge diamond.  DiCaprio strikes a deal with him to help him locate his family if he will lead DiCaprio to the diamond.<br /><br />Loaded with action and some "disturbing" violence.  The only negative for me was DiCaprio's fake sounding South African accent which seemed to grate on ones nerves if you listened long enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Initial reviews for "Blood Diamond" were luke-warm, and I avoided watching it until now, despite its 5 Oscar noms... Well, critics are wrong; they don't comment on the elements in the film that make it audience-worthy. It has action, and plenty of it. It has historical merit. And it boasts excellent performances from di Caprio, Hounsou & Jennifer Connelly, who should have been nominated, too (along with the strength of her performance in "Little Children"). I was riveted from the beginning, and am so glad I finally saw this film. Indeed, the brutality of man toward fellow man is unsettling, not unlike Edward Zwick's other films ("Glory" etc.). It also emphasizes how helpless we all are to do anything about it. Kudos to all involved.  An added note: I recall that Mr. Hounsou's performance was regarded as one-note and hysterical all the time; I  profoundly disagree. I thought he was centered and totally in touch with his character. And, was he really "supporting"...?He was quite fine.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In recent years, Hollywood has been on this kick of trying to make these so-called `important' films.  These are movies that attempt to call attention to something in this world, to make a statement of some sort, whatever that may be.  Generally speaking these movies are more like independent films, not widely received by the average movie audience, because in most cases the movies prove to be boring and too self-important.  Hollywood tends to get so wrapped up in trying to be so important and to rise above being pure entertainment, that it begins to talk down to the very people that keeps them in business.  Occasionally though, a movie comes along that is important for people to see, and succeeds in avoiding the pitfalls of being too self-important and hyped up to be something that it's not, and actually manages to appeal to your average moviegoer, therefore allowing the message to be heard, and maybe make a difference in the process.  One such success for Hollywood would be Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond".<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" tells the story of the civil war that was overtaking Sierra Leone in 1999.  In the midst of the war, Daniel Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, befriends a Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to recover a rare diamond of immense value.  During their search the fisherman's son is taken by rebel forces and coerced into joining their militia to survive.  Now the fisherman must stay focused enough to assist in recovering the diamond which holds the key to saving his son's life and that of the rest of his family as well.  Assisting in trying to save the fisherman's son is a reporter (Jennifer Connelly) who is trying to shed light on the war that is ravaging this part of Africa, in hopes that it will force the U.N. to intervene before it's too late.<br /><br />As I stated earlier most Hollywood movies that are deemed as being `important' films, tend to not do well with most moviegoers; however, this film stood out from the rest.  Why you may ask, well because director Edward Zwick (director of "Glory" and "The Last Samurai") was smart enough to make his story be interesting and entertaining, while including some star power that would enhance his chances of getting people to come to the movie.  Sometimes putting A-list actors in a movie like this could reduce the seriousness of the picture or overshadow the message, but here the actors chosen are known for more dramatic roles and lend more weight to the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio, who has had a recent string of highly successful dramatic roles with "The Aviator" and "The Departed", really sinks his teeth into playing the former mercenary turned smuggler.  A different role for Leo to be sure, the character is far from likeable, yet I still found myself rooting for him, but part of me believes that had more to do with Djimon's character than Leo's.  Djimon Hounsou ("The Island" and "Amistad") as the Mende fisherman, Solomon Vendy, delivers another terrific performance and continues to show his range as an actor.  Jennifer Connelly ("Hulk" and "A Beautiful Mind") did a fine job of conveying the conflicted nature of her character as she is torn by wanting to help Solomon, yet in the process is wanting to help herself and her career by basically exploiting his plight and that of his country's.<br /><br />The story for the movie was solid and fast-paced for the most part, there were times it dragged along, but they were generally few and far between.  The action scenes were very intense, and spaced out nicely throughout the movie, although there were a couple of times that it felt as if the writers had realized it had been awhile since someone had been shot or something blown up, so they threw in a random conflict to spice things up, but other than that I couldn't complain about the amount of action.  I think as far as being an important movie for Hollywood to make, this film could serve as a semi-template for other films to follow, not in terms of what to base the subject matter on, but just the way the story was laid out and presented.  The key is not to talk down to the audience or beat them over the head with the message, but to present it to them in a way that makes them think for themselves, and still be entertained.<br /><br />When it was all said and done, I would have to say that this was a very good movie, but not one that I would want to see too many times, but it definitely will open eyes to what goes on within parts of the diamond industry.  And who knows maybe it will even make somewhat of a difference.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>This is an ambitious project that tries to deal with issues such as child soldiers, diamond smuggling, civil wars, helplessness of foreign aids in Africa. As said by characters in the movie, it's T.I.A.  It's all about survival & generally, people need to be ruthless to get through yet another day. Once again, Edward Zwick, the Director who has brought us Glory, Legends of the Fall, the Last Samurai brings us a very emotive movie that strikes all the right chords without becoming cliche oversentimental.  He's helped a great deal by depths of actors & actress such as DiCaprio, Hounsou, & Connelly. Everyone has their own agendas and as we gradually dig beneath the surface, we find humanity that lurks within.  There is vulnerable time where DiCaprio's character, Archer cracks & he divulges to audience what makes him the person that he is.  And so does Connelly's character of why she risks it all when she can lead an ordinary life.  Hounsou's character is more straight-forward, where he would do anything to get his family back.  Overall, the movie is very powerful & well-done.  Despite different movies that Edward makes, one can't help but seeing similarity in themes that he's exploring.  In Glory, there's Denzel Washington who's all proud & full of honour. In Samurai, there's Tom Cruise's character who can't face himself for catastrophe that he wrecks upon innocent Indians, & in Legends of the Fall, there's Brad Pitt who runs away because he feels he has failed his brother who perishes in the World War.  In this instance, there's DiCaprio who feels the shoes.  In the end, the main characters redeem themselves by doing deeds that put everything right.  James Newton Howard who provides soundtrack for King Kong does a marvellous here too.  Overall, this is a tour-de-force that keeps audience like myself thinking & something to be seen on the big screen.  Highly recommended and a movie that makes you think twice next time before you commit yourself buying a diamond for your dearly beloved.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, "This is Africa."<br /><br />The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.<br /><br />I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or `blood diamonds' until seeing "Blood Diamond," so the film is successful just by being educational.<br /><br />Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.<br /><br />Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.<br /><br />The film runs 143 minutes.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain rack DVD for late night viewing was "Blood Diamond." I'd never heard of the movie but I bought it because it had a banner on the front that said it had five academy award nominations. I figured that it must be a good movie. Well, I can understand the nominations as it was very well done in a variety of ways.<br /><br />I didn't care for "Blood Diamond" and I'd advise people against watching it unless they have a high tolerance for extreme violence. Actually, I have nothing particularly against violence in films and I see a lot of it in action movies and the like which are more like cartoons than the real thing. But the violence in this film was from beginning to end and involved everyone including hapless women and children. This wasn't a fantasy cartoon. This was the real thing and my heart went out to the people of Sierra Leone and other places like it. Extreme brutality was everywhere. I have no idea what the body count of the dead and wounded might have been but I'd guess it was in the thousands, Did I mention the torture, personal degradation and the destruction of property? Death, destruction and mayhem were just an ongoing and integral part of the entire movie, and it had a point in that the control of diamond mining in a country undergoing civil strife was involved. Greed seemed to be the dominant emotion everywhere.<br /><br />The acting was quite good. The people, even the minor bit players, seemed real, unfortunately. The cinema was excellent and it was very interesting to see this part of Africa, except for the extreme ongoing violence. The movie was nicely paced and flowed along without any dull spots. I thought the story was contrived to make a bold statement against diamond mining, diamond smuggling and the diamond industry, in general. Well, I've never been a friend of the highly controlled diamond industry so it was good to see them take a little heat. They earned it. But to me, the total effect of the movie was negative. I ended up feeling as if I had watched a very well done and sophisticated piece of propaganda. When I see a good movie, I sometimes mull over it for the next few days. In this case, I find myself trying to get it out of my mind.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>Movie is awesome. Bluray is awesome.

All the actors play their roles well and the locations make for some stunning scenery. The storyline is pretty shocking at times and it feels like it is half action movie and half political commentary. The issues around blood diamonds are explained pretty well and it'll make you think twice about those innocuous sparkly stones that we see everywhere. As other reviewers have noted, the film is excellent, but the sanitised, saccharine Hollywood ending spoils what is a powerful film, with an important message. Overall though, I'd say this film is well worth watching, it will keep you engaged the whole way through and is well shot and acted. A directors cut without the last five minutes would be great!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>This film shows a world of unbelievable violence and greed. Africa's beauty and wildlife are usually romanticized, but this film shows a much different picture.<br />If I hadn't already seen documentaries on this subject, I might not have believed it could be this bad. Not one for conventional jewelry myself, still I certainly look at precious stones much differently.<br /><br />It is riddled with violent warring factions, street shootings, espionage, betrayals and the helplessness of the innocents caught up in it. At the center of it all, a large pink diamond in-the-rough; the cost for it to adorn someone's neck being far too high. Actors DiCaprio and Hounson do a superb job with their roles.<br /><br />Hounson's character says he had heard his people being told they were better off when the white's ruled. I think they were better off before whites ever came, having brought capitalism in the extreme. Africa by right, belongs to Africans.<br /><br />The speech made by a politician at the end summed it up well. I wish more movies like this were also made about the fur, animal souvenir and live-animal trades as well (such as 'Gorillas in the Mist').<br /><br />A must-see, but for Adults Only.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Edward Zwick's films always strike a good chord with me because of their incredible emotional impact. The Last Samurai left such a grand impact on me that I was in tears at its incredible and emotional climax. The Blood Diamond does the same thing by establishing strong central characters with a clear objective that makes the film gripping and tense. The story revolves around Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a local fisherman whose village is raided by local militia who are at civil war over the control over the diamond fields. These events took place in the late 90's and it serves as the backdrop of the film. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a Rhodesian smuggler who works for a corporate diamond company in London he also works as a mercenary. He smuggles diamonds to the corporations so that they can remove them off of the market thus keeping supply low and demand high, that way they spike the prices. After Vendi is removed from his village and his family separated, he is put to work in the diamond fields where he comes across a pink diamond so rare that it could change the fate of not only his life but a nation's. Vandy is able to escape his imprisonment by the rebels but is put in prison by the police, and in prison he meets Danny Archer who now wants to set his sights on the hidden diamond. When Archer meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), an American journalist, she believes that his story holds the key to revealing the truth behind the diamond corporations.  When Vandy's son is recruited by the rebels he sets out on a quest to find his son while Archer wants the diamond so that he can leave Africa and start his troubled life over. Arnold Vosloo plays a general who is also after the diamond. So we have four people after one small stone for four different reasons.<br /><br />The film has many sides to it. At times it's a dark look into the social and economical conflicts of Africa, sometimes it becomes a burning commentary on the nature of man, but overall this film is an intimate story of three characters placed within the setting. The main objective of the film is to tell the story of the characters where as in films like Tears Of The Sun or Black Hawk Down it's more about sending a central message. I'm not saying the latter films are bad, I enjoyed Tears Of The Suns and Black Hawk Down immensely. I'm also not saying that Blood Diamond is not trying to send a central message either. It's just that Blood Diamond really tries to tell a story, just like Zwick did with The Last Samurai. While the film portrayed a civil struggle in Japan it was more focused on Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters so that when tragedy struck it had a strong emotional impact on the audience. Blood Diamond is not only emotional but it's incredibly tense and thrilling. There is lots of action in the film and the final air raid was executed perfectly. The story is solid and the film is an immense accomplishment. The reason why I knocked off half a star from my final rating was that I had two minor problems with the movie. There were places where a few tweaks could have heightened the emotional impact of the film and have kept the pace of the film more consistent. However, it is whithout a doubt that the film was superbly edited. The pace and structure were very consistant and strong. I was pleased by the script, Charles Leavitt did a fine job with the screenplay even though he has taken a long break from writing since his last effort with K-Pax. The second thing that bothered me was that once the movie ends and the credits start to roll we are hit with this hardcore rap song. I was absolutely shocked and disapointed with the decision to use rap in the end credits, it ruined the lasting effect of the film within a split second.<br /><br />The film also displays some incredible artistic efforts. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. There is a very good chance that Eduardo Serra should be one of the directors of photography nominated this year at the Oscars. Some of the shots were truly breathtaking and of course you have to give credit to beautiful landscapes of Africa. The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard who relied heavily on African vocals for the amazing score. I have to mention here that Hans Zimmer is the pioneer of incorporating native sounds into a film's score based on location. Zimmer made African vocals his speciality with films like A World Apart, The Power Of One, The Lion King, and Tears Of The Sun. You have to acknowledge the Zimmer style in the score, but James Newton Howard makes it completely his own and delivers an amazing score. There were scenes where I wished the score was more prominent, but overall I was very happy with the musical efforts. All of the artistic efforts put together with the story make Blood Diamond what it is.<br /><br />ACTING: Does Leonardo DiCaprio give his best performance yet? In my opinion I really think so. He was amazing in the film and created a perfectly accessible character that we cared for. Many people are criticizing his accent when in fact he is using an extremely authentic Rhodesian accent. People assume that since he is white and an African he must be South African. That's not the case here, people. DiCaprio does an amazing job with the role. Djimon Hounsou is also equally amazing in the film. There are a few intimate scenes with his son that will bring you to tears. He plays an uneducated fisherman with his only interests in his family, but it is his character that shows the good of mankind in the middle of this mess. Jennifer Connelly is a great actress and she portrays a journalist just as a journalist would act. She uses her wits and looks to get the story, but her priorities are not to make headlines but rather to help change the world for the better. Arnold Vosloo has a small role in the film, but I like him and think he's an underrated actor. People will recognize him from The Mummy films and his guest role on the show 24. The acting in this film is superb, the characters all carry the film and make it something to remember.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Blood Diamond is gripping, thrilling and emotional. I shed some tears when I saw The Last Samurai and I indeed shed some tears when I saw Blood Diamond. It's an action film with so much substance, it really pulls you in as an audience member. The few structural problems and the rap song at the end credits are not enough for me not to highly recomend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>As we reach the end of any calendar year, the major studios roll out their big guns--the films they think have the best chance of grabbing Oscar gold.  These tend to be big budget affairs, with big stars, and often with serious or important themes.  Well, "Blood Diamond" arrives with just such expectations.  A well meaning and "important" film about exploitation and atrocities in Sierra Leone's diamond trade, "Blood Diamond" casts Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly, and Djimon Hounsou as the central characters in an exciting, and sometimes heartbreaking, look at the cost of commercialism in international trading.<br /><br />Edward Zwick (who has courted Oscar before with "Glory" and "The Last Samurai") sets a very serious tone from the beginning--it seems clear that this film wants to parlay a message, to expose the injustices done in the name of Western greed.  The setup covers extremely familiar territory and the message is blunt and obvious.  No one, at this point, will deny that what is depicted here is harrowing--the problem is that it isn't particularly surprising or edifying.  He's preaching to the choir.  A lot of films have broken this ground before to astonishing affect, "Blood Diamond" as a message movie lacks a certain amount of originality and subtlety.  That doesn't make it a bad movie, by any stretch, but I wasn't enlightened by the subject matter.<br /><br />But the curious thing about "Blood Diamond," though, is just as I was tempted to dismiss it as a heavy-handed drama--I got wrapped up in it.  Why?  Well, it's a heck of an action picture and it boasts terrific performances.  DiCaprio plays a rogue, ethically challenged, illegal diamond trader who is looking to make a big score.  Hounsou, who has lost his son to the rebels, has hidden an invaluable diamond which he hopes to leverage to bring his family back together.  And Connelly is an American journalist who wants to expose the corruption inherent in the trafficking of diamonds.  All three are at the top of their game.  Hounsou is absolutely riveting in an emotional powerhouse of a performance.  DiCaprio acquits himself well with a Rhodesian accent and displays many layers to the morally questionable anti-hero.<br /><br />The film is technically impressive--the cinematography and score earn high marks.  But it's the brutal and compelling action sequences that will stick with you.  There is much violence to be had in "Blood Diamond," much death and bloodshed.  Our trio constantly find themselves on the wrong side of a gun fight or even worse--trapped between rebels warring with soldiers.  Theses scenes are done with such precision, such excitement, and such realism--you almost forget that the film wants to teach you a lesson too.  I almost wish that Zwick would have just trusted a simpler story and let us draw our own moral conclusions.<br /><br />Ultimately, I really admired "Blood Diamond"--it has the power to excite you and move you.  Far from a perfect film, it is eminently watchable.  The tidy ending was a bit over-the-top for my taste, as well, but by then I'd really enjoyed the journey.  A solid 3 1/2 star rating, I'm rounding up for the action set pieces.  KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>I am going to keep this review relevant to the movie and the reasons why you should buy this on DVD:<br /><br />1. Leonardo DiCaprio's Performance: This film in my opinion features the best ever performance extracted from Leonardo DiCaprio on film. He is flawless here as a South Africa white who needs to discover whether material wealth means more to him than human emotion and sentiment. I have never been a huge fan of Leo (though yes, he was wonderful in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" and "The Beach") but this film alongwith "The Departed" really opened my eyes. Granted he is a physically splendid creation, but his use of language, intonation and emotion were at the forefront of this movie, and the only downside to his performance is that it totally overshadowed the other actors.<br /><br />2. Djimon Hounsou's performance : This was an actor I first noticed in "Amistad" and he just keeps getting better and better. He is one actor who looks about 25 even though hes well past 40, and has an incredible range. His role as a traumatized father looking for his son in the middle of riot torn Africa will be remembered years to come, however, he is not as radiant as Leonardo here, and for that reason alone I think he is thought of as a "supporting actor" here. If you pay attention, you will actually see that he gets MORE screen time than Leo.<br /><br />3. Jennifer Connelly : I think she is one of the most ill-utilized actresses we have today, and the director doesn't do much with her here either, which is a pity. However, her role is quite effective for what it is - the downside being that she has zero chemistry with Leo in every regard.<br /><br />4. Cinematography : The effect here was to present Africa as a beautiful nation though ridden with political problems and woes. To see these violent images portrayed against a backdrop of the most gorgeous sunsets and tropical rainforests was a bit bizarre - which I suppose was the effect. The visuals are lush and evocative, and captures the mood of the era and environment perfectly.<br /><br />5. Direction & Story : The director knew a good thing when he saw it. This is a very character driven story and you have to FEEL for the characters' emotions if you want to get anywhere. On the surface, its a simple tale thats been told a million different ways, but the political statements this movie makes is way ahead of its' time, I thought (much like the Angelina Jolie starrer "Beyond Borders" which was a masterpiece in its' own right).<br /><br />It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio carries this film on his capable shoulders and takes you through almost three gripping hours of it without making you look at your watch. This is what real acting and filmmaking is all about. If you do decide to buy this, let Leo be your number one reason.<br /><br />To wrap it up, this is a must have 2-DVD Edition of the film - and I can state that this is one movie you will be watching over and over. I saw this just after "The Departed", which is the only other movie this year I could possibly watch again. These two films finally signal the true emergence of America's greatest living actor - Leonardo DiCaprio.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>The Blood Diamond has double meaning.  An extremely bloody war is being funded by diamonds, and the stars of the movie are after a huge stone that has a red tint to it.  Leonardo Dicaprio is after the diamond and Djimon Hounsou (named Solomon in the movie) agrees to show him where it is, but only goes along with Dicaprio so that he can find his son.  Solomon's son has been been taken and made into a 10 year old rebel soldier.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist and does a great job of using her charm to help forget about the war that is going on, even if it is just for a moment.  The best parts are the action scenes.  Solomon will do whatever he has to to get his son back, and likewise for Dicaprio with the diamond.  It all leads to a very exciting ending.<br /><br />There is great drama, a great story, and marvelous acting from everybody, but the action sequences stood out the most to me.  The rebels seem to enjoy killing everyone and anyone.  When they show up, expect to see some intense shoutouts.  The 2 fight scenes are also good, mainly because Djimon Hounsou is such a superb actor.  I wouldn't have minded seeing more of his rage.  Dicaprio also gives an extraordinary performance.  He may be better in this than he was in 'The Aviator'.<br /><br />This is the best movie I have seen in at least a couple months, and I am a hardcore movie junkie.  I don't like giving away too much in my reviews, in fact I always try to give away as little as possible.  My rating sums up how I feel the best.  This movie gets a perfect 5/5 from me.

Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few tears.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Blood Diamond is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  4 1/2 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />"In America it's bling bling, but out here it's bling bang," says Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) in this action-packed flick about Africa's corrupt diamond trade." kevin O'Donnell<br /><br />This movie took awhile to become enmeshed in the story. Much could be edited but then, maybe that is what you need in order to survive the  violence of the film.  'Blood Diamond' takes place in 1999 Sierra Leone, when the country is involved in a civil war. It is difficult at times to decide which side is the most evil; the government or the rebels. It is the innocent farmers caught in between the fighting who pay the price. Diamonds, one of the country's largest moneymakers, are being smuggled out and purchased on the open market, There is a ban on purchasing these 'blood diamonds', but merchants prevail.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy, Djimon Hounsan, is a farmer. He educates his son for a better life. And then one day the rebels capture his son. Solomon is sent to sift for diamonds, and he  finds a 100-karat pink diamond. He meets a soldier of fortune, Danny Archer, Leonardo DiCaprio, who makes a deal for the diamond. Archer will help him find his wife and children for the diamond. They meet an American journalist, Maddy Brown, Jennifer Connelly, who agrees to help them if she can write about their experiences.  The violence and the bloodshed are so real and caused me to close my eyes. The boy solders who are taught to kill are so real and evil. Blood Diamond is as effective in depicting the corruption of innocent people as it is in showing the hell of war. It also highlights greed and manipulation.<br /><br />"Archer. Leonardo DiCaprio, has the most complete role. Thankfully, he never loses his "me first" attitude, but we come to understand how it has developed and we see a gradual softening of some of his morals. It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of "gritty" role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed. This is not the same actor who set young female hearts aflutter ten years ago. He has discovered a measure of gravitas. Solomon's passion drives the movie forward; when Blood Diamond has urgency, it's because of him. Djimon Hounsou is volcanic in this role." James Berardinelli<br /><br />This could have been the movie of the year were it not for the length and the tediousness of the first 45 minutes. The movie grabbed me for the last hour. It was rivieting and the story one that needs to be told. The message, other than the sory of civil war and the diamond trade, is that Leonardo Di Caprio has found his measure.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 6-03-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou, Blood Diamond is set in Sierra Leone in 1999 amid the chaos of Africa in armed conflict. It is an action drama played against the backdrop of political turmoil. The movie is about the illegal trafficking of diamonds in Africa. Although it is tricky to make a movie on a controversial issue that is neither do-gooder nor exploitative, in this case the effort is surprisingly successful.<br /><br />Blood diamonds were so named in the 1990s to call attention to the fact that African diamonds were being smuggled out of countries at war specifically to buy more arms and kill more people.<br /><br />Weaker moments in the story are overshadowed by the film's willingness to risk disturbing an audience's sense of the world and how it is run. Blood Diamond is very much aware that these are problems beyond an easy resolution, and making a film that understands that is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />It really is a good movie, well acted, with Africa playing a wonderful supporting role!</p></br><a href="../users/AB0W9GTNGHSI3.html">AB0W9GTNGHSI3</a><br/><p>THIS IS A POWERFUL AND GREAT MOVIE LEO IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAV ACTORS,,, WITH PERFORMANCES LIKE THIS AND IN THE DEPARTED HOW COULD HE NOT BE,, BLOOD DIAMOND IS A MOVIE THAT WAS U DEEP IN THE SEAT VOTEING FOR THE STORY TO KEEP GOING,, IT WAS A GRIPPING MOVIE AND IS WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU SPEND ON IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond (Edward Zwick, 2006)<br /><br />There are good actors and there are bad actors, but rarely has one person embodied both as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. And oddly, there's a sharp dividing line between the good and the bad, and that, of course, is Titanic. Before 1997, it seemed DiCaprio was incapable of making a bad movie. They weren't all brilliant by any stretch of the imagination (The Basketball Diaries, really), but he was always brilliant in them. Then came Titanic, as awful a blockbuster as has come down the pike in ages, and DiCaprio's career sank faster than that stupid boat. I spent nine years after that wondering what in the world had happened to the actor I'd once thought was the best thing since Johnny Depp. And then, my god, 2006. Leo, you are forgiven for every overblown and undertalented performance from Titanic to The Aviator for giving us The Departed and Blood Diamond in the same year. While, once again, neither was a great film, DiCaprio has once again shown the acting chops that made my jaw drop in such films as What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, Total Eclipse, and, yes, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.<br /><br />For all that DiCaprio's presence was touted in this flick, however, he's not the main character. That would be Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou, recently of Push, nominated for an Oscar for his role here), a fisherman in Sierra Leone, by the Revolutionary United Front, rebels who are supporting their war against the government by the sale of blood diamonds (which these days go under the more euphemistic name of "conflict diamonds"; of course, this removes us from the idea that people shed blood for them) and set to work in the diamond mines. While Solomon is working in the mines, two very big things happen: first, his son is also abducted by the RUF, and second, he finds a large, rare pink diamond and hides it from the RUF. Through various machinations, he is rescued from the mines and taken to prison in Freetown. Enter Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a Rhodesian mercenary involved in the arms-for-diamonds trade. He had a cache of diamonds taken from him when he was thrown into prison, and he's sure that his contact on the arms side of the deal, Colonel Coetzee (Fire & Ice's Arnold Vosloo), will be looking for reparation. He hears a guard from the mine taunting Vandy about the diamond, and comes up with a plan. This involves getting Vandy sprung from prison and offering to help him find his family again in exchange for the diamond. That requires the services of someone who knows how to find people, and in this case, that's reporter Maddy Bowen (Requiem for a Dream's Jennifer Connelly). Once the three of them get together, things start going wrong, not only among their little group, but with outside forces as well. Nothing can ever be easy--and let's not forget that while he doesn't know it, we know that Solomon's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers in his first feature role) has also been taken by the RUF...<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting thing about this cast is that every major player is known for inconsistency in acting prowess. It's already been addressed in DiCaprio's case. Hounsou has been nominated for Academy Awards both for this and for In America, but, really. Constantine? Or even worse, Aragon? And for every Dark City and Requiem for a Dream, Connelly's resume, there's a Hulk. My hypothesis is that all three of them are more tractable for certain directors (though obviously I don't know this for sure). Zwick, of course, is a director well-known for pulling the last ounce of greatness out of an actor; after all, it was Zwick's Glory who took an affable TV and character actor named Denzel Washington and made him into an A-list superstar. His Leaving Normal was one of the highlights of Meg Tilly's acting career; Legends of the Fall, while not well-received upon release, has become an enduring favorite of Brad Pitt fans. This is a guy who knows what he's doing in the director's chair. Charles Leavitt's screenplay is both well-researched and snappy (though it's been said by some Sierra Leoneans who have seen the film that while it's generally accurate, it should be remembered that this sort of thing is only a small part of the greater story of the Sierra Leonean civil war), never degenerating into It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Sierra Leonean style, as it so easily could. And Eduardo Serra's cinematography... oh, my. (I'll put it this way: it was good enough to get him tabbed as the cinematographer on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Both parts.) James Newton Howard's score was nominated for a Grammy, for pete's sake. There are all kinds of reasons to appreciate this movie, and few to complain about it (the ending, coincidentally, puts one in mind of Double Indemnity, reviewed above, and has that same artificially-noble feel to it); even if you've always hated Leonardo DiCaprio's acting (and I have always found that those who do were unaware that he made movies before Titanic, which is kind of like not knowing about Keanu Reeves' pre-Bill and Ted output), this is one to check out. Maybe it'll change your mind, and let you see what the rest of us have known all along. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly never seems quite necessary and the movie rambles at times, but the two male leads are very good and the anarchic setting is milked for everything it's worth; Blood Diamond is not a perfect film but it'll stay with you.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>"Blood Diamond" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...'<br /><br />The film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fields...According to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil war...<br /><br />Danny Archer--crazy for diamonds like everybody else--believes this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent...

But out here, it's bling bang."<br /><br />So says diamond hound Danny Archer, summing up in two sentences the vastly differing attitudes between American capitalism and third-world uprising in director Edward Zwick's (The Last Samurai) five-time Academy Award-nominated composition on greed, anarchy and its resulting desolation.  "Blood Diamond" is a violently epic film, one that takes a cold hard look at the diamond trade and unveils the heinous business that is behind the acquisition of these dazzling coveted stones.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is a humble fisherman of the Mende tribe in Sierra Leone who has high hopes for his son Dia to become a doctor.  When his home village of Shenge is pillaged by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), he is taken prisoner and forced to work in the diamond fields to fund the radical group's arsenal.  While panning in a riverbed, Solomon unearths a rare pink diamond of grand proportion and rather than surrender it to the despicable Captain Poison (Harewood), he conceals it and later buries it in an unmarked location.<br /><br />Danny Archer (DiCaprio), another in a long line of profiteers, is a covert agent for Van de Kaap Diamond Company who acquires and smuggles diamonds past Liberian officials.  When a smuggling attempt fails and Archer is subsequently arrested, Van de Kaap's bigwigs wash their hands of him.  Not wanting to blow their cover for the sake of the continual lining of their pockets, they leave Danny to fend for himself in a country ravaged by war.  While detained in a prison in Freetown, he overhears Captain Poison in another cell hiss at Solomon about the location of the stone.  Knowing that this diamond will save his hide with Col. Coetzee (Vosloo) - a mercenary responsible for the war that rages on - and provide a one-way ticket out of the country, Danny arranges for Solomon to be released and offers to find his family in exchange for information regarding the location of the stone.<br /><br />Enter Maddy Bowen (Connelly), a tenacious and attractive journalist who at first utilizes her physical charisma to charm the facts out of Danny, coming off as just another correspondent hungry for a big story.  Despite being in ruthless pursuit of the facts, Maddy is a realist - she knows all too well that her presence does little to change things, her candid and emotionally harrowing articles ineffectual in the face of turmoil.  Her burning desire to expose the dirt beneath the diamond trade's pristine fingernails becomes all too clear when she reprimands Danny for capitalizing on Solomon's desperation, in turn deciding to assist Solomon in the search for his now vagrant family.<br /><br />The film's screenplay from Charles Leavitt (K-PAX) is smart, cynical and emotionally earnest and bases much of its scripted chaos on factual events that Leavitt heavily researched.  Wanting to portray the conflict diamond industry as truthfully as possible, Leavitt was well aware that some of what he shared would greatly offend companies in that industry and possibly instigate nasty lawsuits, namely from De Beers (who does a majority of their mining in South Africa as well as Botswana, Namibia and Canada).<br /><br />Hounsou (nominated for Best Supporting Actor) is exceptional as Solomon Vandy, a man who wants nothing more than to provide well for his family.  The desperation to find them and the burning rage against those who ravaged their once happy life are translated beautifully through Hounsou's emphatic eyes and tremulous mouth.<br /><br />Connelly proves once again that she is a formidable actress as Maddy, her immense green eyes emoting much of the conviction in her dialogue.<br /><br />DiCaprio (nominated for Best Actor) deftly executes a South African accent as well as some indisputably supreme acting skills.  As Danny, he portrays a man who has known nothing but violence since his childhood and as a result loosely carries his conscience in his pocket.  His self-imposed teaming with Solomon proves to be the morality check he needs, the ruthless pursuit of the diamond forcing him to look directly into the face of a nation ravaged by disorder and demoralization, something which he has turned the other cheek to so many times in the past.<br /><br />In the film's closing scenes, Leavitt's screenplay states that despite the signing of the Kimberley Process (a process introduced by United Nations resolution 55/56 that is designed to certify the origin of rough diamonds from sources which are free of conflict) in 2003 that "illegal diamonds are still finding their way to market" and that "it is up to the consumer to insist that a diamond is conflict-free".  For any women that may view the film and that read this particular caption, it will have them eyeing some of their more prized pieces of jewelry with a newfound - albeit morbid - curiosity.<br /><br />Bottom line: "Blood Diamond" is an eye-opening examination of a dirty business of which few are aware and it is clear from the outcome that it will take more than a simple governmental resolution to stop the murder and sabotage that a small, flashy piece of carbon has managed to create.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region Free<br />VC-1 BD-50<br />Running time: 2:23:21<br />Movie size: 22,44 GB<br />Disc size: 30,56 GB<br />Average Video Bit Rate: 12.71 Mbps<br />LPCM 5.1 4608Kbps 16-bit English<br />DD AC3 5.1 640Kbps English / French-Quebec / Spanish<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / English / French / Spanish<br /><br />* Audio Commentary<br />* Documentary<br />* Featurettes<br />* Music Video<br />* Theatrical Trailer<br />* Video Diary Vignettes</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G.html">A2Z5WEA0KOMN9G</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie alot but it seems that they picked a nice safe topic to rant about.

This latest work by Edward Zwick tackles a serious social issue in the guise of popular entertainment, which turns out to be both the greatest weakness and the greatest strength of the film.<br /><br />"Blood" diamonds, also known as "conflict" diamonds, are those that are mined in war zones, then sold to finance those wars.  Set in 1999, the movie features Leonardo DiCaprio as a largely amoral diamond smuggler who is plying his trade in war-torn Sierra Leone on the west coast of the African continent.  Through a series of complicated events, Danny Archer meets up with a native named Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who knows the whereabouts of a rare, priceless diamond that Archer, along with virtually everybody else in the film, would love to get his hands on.  Solomon, however, needs its as a bargaining chip to ransom his wife and children who have been turned into refugees as a result of the internecine war occurring between the government and rebel forces out to enslave people like Solomon in the local mines.  Jennifer Connelly plays a compassionate American reporter determined to expose the evil and corruption involved in the blood diamond business to a largely apathetic and hitherto unresponsive world at large.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Charles Leavitt, based on a story by him and C. Gaby Mitchell, Zwick has fashioned a generally powerful film whose occasional dramatic contrivances can be easily forgiven in light of the salutary goal of the film.  One could object to the fact that, yet again, a story set in the Third World seemingly needs to be told through the eyes of white people from the West.  The movie tries to overcome this handicap by making it clear that Archer is actually from Zimbabwe - and DiCaprio has the South African accent to prove it - but the air of First World condescension is faintly evident nonetheless.  Still, given the sad fact that such an approach was probably necessary even to get the film green-lighted let alone funded, one cannot really hold that against the filmmakers.  The movie also indulges in a few too many action movie cliches - hairbreadth escapes, in-the-nick-of-time rescues, the near-miraculous dodging of bullets etc. - but, again, the moviemakers clearly know they must first get the attention of their target audience before they can enlighten them about the situation at hand.  Moreover, the film is a bit too long at 138 minutes and suffers from attenuation and repetition in its final half hour.<br /><br />Those negatives aside, "Blood Diamond" is, for the most part, an effective piece of serious commercial moviemaking, thanks, primarily, to Zwick's skill as a director and to the fine performances by DiCaprio, Connelly and, especially, Hounsou, whose quiet dignity and fierce determination do much to personalize the plight of the innocents caught in a hellhole of wanton slaughter and crass de-humanization.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is that it doesn't stint in showing us the brutality and widespread individual suffering brought about by this mad rush towards profit and greed.  In addition, Archer's slow awakening to the depths of the human tragedy occurring around him and his own shameful participation in it may be predictable from a narrative standpoint, but it gives the film the moral weight and thematic depth it needs to elevate it above the level of a mere exploitative action picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>this movie deserves 5 stars, even the ending sucks big time. the whole story is very intense and thrilling, it kept the audience sitting tight in their seats, not too many people left for the restrooms in the middle. decaprio did a great performance from a soldier of fortune to a born-again humanist who sacrificed himself for nothing. i am very glad that he finally looked pretty mature and indeed with genuine star quality. he should do more like this character instead of playing the image of a playboy. great performance of the other supporting actors too. the stunt, the fighting and massacre scenes were done great. only the editing needs to be more generous in cutting, not much but definitely needed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>A gritty action flick set in Africa, BLOOD DIAMOND features Leonardo DiCaprio as a smuggler who learns that Djimon Houson has found a large diamond and partners with him to recover the hidden stone and rescue his (Hounson's) family. Obstacles to these goals include a brutal civil war and greedy mercenaries. Both DiCaprio and Hounson give strong performances with DiCaprio nicely managing a couple of different dialects. Jennifer Connelly is passable as the magazine writer/journalist with good intentions and the nose for a good story who befriends DiCaprio and provides minimal romantic interest. Unfortunately, the film is laced with a strong preachness that contaminates any pure, honest story-telling and descends BLOOD DIAMOND into a vehicle for political propaganda. Apparently, the movie would claim, consumers who buy diamonds are supporting all kinds of awful things, from murderous civil war to corruption to terrorism. This is a conjecture not supported by sustainable arguement in the film. However, if you don't mind paying to be preached to or if you can ignore the shrill, emotional flim-flam of the latest leftist cause celebre, then BLOOD DIAMOND offers entertainment value as a rollickingly good action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>For a number of years filmmakers have tried to translate the troubles in the "developing nations" to lukewarm public reaction.  There was "Cry Freedom" and "A Dry White Season" that essentially treated the blacks as peripheral characters.  About the most honest was the gripping "Hotel Rwanda" with a superb Don Cheadle as a protagonist.  Director Edward Zwick here has managed what other filmmakers couldn't do.  He has fashioned a thrilling action film without compromising the polemics of the dire situation of some Africans.  It helps that this film sports a cast that includes the most dynamic actors of this generation, Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly.  There is an urgency to this film where the makers demand that attention be paid to the people who have suffered for so long but it is done in a subtle way.  To paraphrase another film, everybody should bear witness to the inconvenient truth on display here.</p></br><a href="../users/A106016KSI0YQ.html">A106016KSI0YQ</a><br/><p>Edward Zwick's 2006 film is an attempt to take on the 1999 violent upheaval in Sierra Leone in light of the international diamond industry's culpability in that uprising. To find a focus for the film, he documents the fictional story of a poor fisherman (Djimon Hounsou) who is separated from his family and forced by rebels to become a slave panning for diamonds and discovers a pink hundred-carat rough stone he manages to bury near the panning river just before he and his captors are arrested; the rest of the film inviolves a Zimbabwean smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio) who tries to persuade Hounsou to bring him to the diamond in exchange for the restoration of his family, and a crusading foreign correspondent (Jennifer Connolly, in a wondrously thankless role) who somehow becomes mixed up with them.<br /><br />It's not exactly a boring film, because Dicaprio and Hounsou seem to attract every single arms fire exchange in that particularly violent year; in many ways its almost as white-knuckled a watch as a James Bond film. Unfortunately, like the Bond films, it also relies far too much on coincidence (particularly in the heroes' escapes of impossible situations). Indeed, the film seems to be a kind of melange of all the great Western stories of imperialism and adventure: Zwick seems particularly obsessed with hellish scenes of young Africans writhing in triumph over flaming carnage, which evokes HEART OF DARKNESS (and its film versions), while the search for a mythical diamond evokes KING SOLOMON'S MINES and THE MOONSTONE. But it's all done, somewhat bizarrely, from a very progressive Hollywood liberal point of view, that while laudable in and of itself makes the whole film seem very slickly engineered and at times even condescending: the film ends with a great howler of a sequence where Hounsou is introduced to a group of white journalists by an American diplomat (played by Stephen Collins!) as "the face of the Third World,' and they then proceed to give Hounsou a standing ovation. Hounsou does the best among the leads with his underwritten character; DiCaprio tries hard, and for once doesn't seem quite so much like an ephebe, but his wobbly attempt at a Zimbabwean accent really trips him up. No matter how nightmarish the exchange of gunfire, mortar fire, or even grenades, nothing whatsoever in the whole film seems capable of mussing his and Connolly's expertly cut hairdos.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>From the director of Glory and The Last Samurai, Ed Zwick creates an eye opening tale that displays the violence and strife that ripped apart the City of Freetown, Sierra Leone Africa.<br /><br />In 1999 Civil War between the RUFs (self proclaimed Freedom Fighters) and the government Army claimed the lives of over 200,000 Africans in Sierra Leone.  Funding for the RUFs came from diamonds, mined by the enslaved people of the region and then exported to the western world.  The education you get on this film will really make you think, if you know don't know anything about it.  Personally, I was already aware of the internal problems of Africa.  It is a country in chaos.  At this time though, the city of Freetown on the west coast was particulary hit hard.<br /><br />The guilt trip the movie puts you through is unwarranted, as they state in the movie, the diamonds are mixed with stones from all over the world and then sold.  So there is no way the retailer would know, much less the consumer whether or not the stones they were buying are conflict diamonds.<br /><br />The movie follows the characters as they start on different paths but eventually come together to find the Fisherman's son.  Djimon Hounsou gives a strong performance as Solomon, a father desperate to find his family after he is taken by the Rebels to pan for diamonds.  When he finds one bigger then his thumb he hides it amid a raid on the Rebels.  After being taken to jail, Danny Archer (DiCaprio) catches wind of his find and eventually convinces him to split the diamond profits.  Along the way, Archer meets Maggie (Connelly) a journalist tired of writing about the atrocities and no one noticing.  She's looking for hard evidence to write the story of her career and Danny has that evidence since he's been dealing with the illegal aspect of the trade for years.<br /><br />The movie is a morality check amidst an action set piece.  The violence and gunfire add adrenaline to what could have been a boring political statement.  DiCaprio is excellent as usual and plays his part with world weary and pecimistic venom.  This is the first movie I've seen him in where he comes across as a man, and not a YOUNG man.  He seems mature, almost too mature for his age, implying he's seen too much for someone of his age.  And his military skills are very convincing.  Connelly plays the other side of the coin, pecimistic as well but hopeful that word will get out and things will change in Africa.<br /><br />Eventually, things get wrapped up but not before there is a lot of sacrifice.  Some other reviews state it is a neat and tidy ending, but I disagree.  It doesn't come without death and lives changed forever.  The movie is thrilling and thought provoking even if not perfect.  I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Nice to see a movie that is entertaining but at the same time lets us see<br /><br />the horror of certain situations that are active in different parts of the world.

The meld is extremely potent - the seriousness of the issues presented is never minimilized or brushed off, but the fact that the movie is a fictionalized account of a real situation provides for the welcome possibility of a somewhat happier ending for the innocents than usually happens in 'true story' movies like this, and the tantalizing lure that the heinous villains may not escape justice as they so often do in real life.  (On the other hand, "Blood Diamond" is grim enough that neither of those possibilities seems guaranteed, generating tremendous suspense).  On the action movie front, the fact that these bad guys are right out of the papers and evening news makes it impossible not to root against them with a particular vengeance.  The stakes seem much higher than in many action movies and have a profound effect on the heart.<br /><br />  Taking place in the '90s civil war of Sierra Leone, the "Blood Diamond" of the title refers to diamonds which, like many other valuable substances, have been mined in Africa by slave labor repeatedly in recent years to pay for war efforts on behalf of both ruthless rebel factions and brutal governments.  The diamond end of this appaling tragedy has to a large degree been cleaned up by the establishment of the Kimberly Process (designed to keep 'blood diamonds' off the open market) but the practice was in full swing at the time the story here takes place.  Djimon Hounsou plays the father of a family in a village where rebels come to abduct the population - to turn the young into brainwashed 'child soldiers' and to press many of the adults into slave labor in the diamond rivers.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a smuggler/mercenary who has dealings with the rebel group, and who comes to a stage in his life where he has to decide if it's too late to try and turn away from the brutal way he's lived his life.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist in Africa trying to gather evidence to expose the blood diamond trade and its links to rich Western corporations.  Her character, Maddy, has piled up a track record of uncovering similiar abuses all over the world.  In an ordinary movie, any one of these three stars would steal the show, but in "Blood Diamond" all three lead players deliver astonishing performances.  So, in fact, does the entire supporting cast.  The discovery in the slave rivers of one of the largest diamonds in the world (worth millions) and, moreover, the quest of Hounsou's character Solomon Vandy to escape and rescue his family (including the son that's been taken by the rebels) and the various characters who risk their lives to help him, provide main points for the movie.<br /><br />  In terms of production, everything's perfect - the action sequences, the cinematography, the musical score, everything.  The lush natural beauty of Sierra Leone is captured amazingly well, and having such breat-taking natural imagery as the backdrop for such a brutal series of events is poignant, to say the least.<br /><br />  Excellent in every respect, one of the very best picks from a year that was loaded with great movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again. First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.<br /><br />For some reason, this film stands out above The Departed for me. Where the Departed had an ensemble cast, Blood Diamond can make no such claim (although there is a sprinkling of well-knowns). Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed. Most notably among them is the buffed Djimon Hounsou (AMISTAD), a quiet man living in a quiet village that is torn apart by rebel fighters trying for a piece of the region's diamond trade. Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son. After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it. Having been seen with the diamond, the rebel leader tries to hunt him down.<br /><br />In the meantime, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, THE DEPARTED), a young opportunist from South Africa, is completely immersed in the illegal diamond trade. He runs into Maddy (Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), an attractive journalist from The States who infuses Danny with a sense of morality. Uncomfortable around Maddy, yet still attracted to her physically and emotionally, Danny sets out to find if the rumor he's been hearing about the large, pink diamond are true. He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond; Danny wants the diamond so that he can escape Africa and thus his past, while Solomon sees it as a way to possibly save his missing son who's been captured and brainwashed by the rebels.<br /><br />As Maddy's views of right and wrong spin Danny on his head, and Solomon's race to find his son sparks memories of his father, Danny's not only in for a physical battle, but one that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history.<br /><br />Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost. The movie spares nothing to get its message across; there are children being dismembered, children carrying guns and spraying bullets onto innocent villagers, torture, explosive governmental flaws, and it's all surrounded by one terrible little stone: the diamond.<br /><br />A very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so). His South African accent was spot-on and his internal battles of right and wrong are pulled off effortlessly.<br /><br />This one's a must.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Hollywood's attempts at social conscience films in the past several years have been self-indulgent, fractured narratives tailored for self-congratulatory Academy Awards shows. They're barely watchable, much less entertaining. "Blood Diamond" is a welcome exception. An action film with attractive, involving characters and memorable -though unoriginal- dialogue, "Blood Diamond" is set in Sierra Leone in 1999, during the country's bloody civil war in which the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) murdered, maimed, and displaced millions in its attempt to control and profit from the nation's diamond fields.<br /><br />Mercenary soldier Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) smuggles diamonds from Sierra Leone into Liberia, where they eventually make their way into the vaults of the world's largest diamond conglomerate Van de Kaap. Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman forced to work in the diamond fields when his village was ravaged by the RUF. When both men are briefly held in the same jail in Freetown, Danny learns that Solomon has hidden a large pink diamond. Danny needs to reimburse his commander for a lost shipment, so he promises Solomon help in finding his family in exchange for the location of the stone. At the same time, he implores American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) for assistance in exchange for damning information on the diamond trade.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou is a powerful, empathetic presence throughout "Blood Diamond", and Jennifer Connelly makes Maddy's sense of adventure, bravery, and commitment to her beliefs infectious. But it is Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of sharp, wounded, resourceful Danny Archer that pulls the audience into this film. Danny's unyielding determination to survive, his relentless motion in the direction of necessity is "Blood Diamond"'s driving force. DiCaprio deserved the praise he received for this performance. The extended sequence of the RUF's assault on Freetown is one of the most memorable depictions of war that I've seen on film. My hat is off to director Edward Zwick, cinematographer Eduardo Serra, and production designer Dan Weil for this surreal spectacle.<br /><br />The civil war in Sierra Leone ended in 2002, and there are now considerably fewer conflict diamonds than in the 1990s. So in some ways this film is old news. But conflict diamonds, which are used to finance violent revolutionary movements and general mayhem, are still very much an issue among human rights activists and critics of the diamond industry. It may be inevitable that the politics of "Blood Diamond" are murky, since the events it depicts are impenetrable. The filmmakers are obviously trying to raise awareness about what one may be subsidizing in purchasing diamonds. But Van de Kaap is an unveiled stand-in for De Beers, and it isn't clear to me what the film wants to say about them. Van de Kaap buys conflict diamonds in order to control the price of diamonds on the world market. But Van de Kaap also supports the mercenary army hired to rout out the RUF. In spite of their representative being a rich, smarmy white man, I'm not sure that this makes Van de Kaap a villain. But then De Beers' relationship to conflict diamonds has never been clear.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Bros. 2007 single disc): Bonus features on the single disc edition of the DVD are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Edward Zwick. Zwick discusses Sierra Leone's history and politics, but not as much as I would have liked and not enough to clear up the nebulous points in the plot. He does talk about the cultural connections between Sierra Leone and the Western world, the plight of the child soldiers, and how he approached depicting real events. Zwick also addresses the challenges of filming, cinematography, how he got the necessary exposition into the film, and filming on location in Mozambique and South Africa. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>BLOOD DIAMOND wants to illustrate the tangled, multi-national, disgraceful state of "Conflict Diamonds"...diamonds that are mined in war-torn countries, where countrymen are randomly killed or thrown in slavery, all over the desire by one warring faction or another to control the diamond trade.  They are supposed to be illegal in most of the world, but the movie reminds us that it's a pretty simple matter of paying a few bribes to the right folks after smuggling the diamonds to a "legal" country.  This is where the movie stumbles the most.  It's political messages are presented in little speeches peppered throughout the film, in a manner that stops the pace of the film.  One need only remember how well THE CONSTANST GARDNER wove similar subject matter into the very fabric of its being.  Take politics out of GARDNER and there'd have been no film left.  Take them out of BLOOD DIAMOND, and you'd have a rip-roaring action movie (and a MUCH smaller role for Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an amoral diamond smuggler, pretty much willing to kill anyone who stands in his way (he was a mercenary, so knows his way around guns).  Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vendy, a poor fisherman whose path crosses with DiCaprio when Solomon finds a rare, huge "blood diamond" and DiCaprio gets wind of it.  Solomon's son has been kidnapped by brutal rebels, and his only interest is to get his son back.  DiCaprio convinces Solomon he can help, but only agrees to do so if Solomon will lead him to the diamond.<br /><br />Accompanying them on their journey is journalist Jennifer Connelly, who gets to spout much of the political rhetoric of the movie, especially early on.  The three travel through a brutal and violent landscape.  In many ways, the movie is like a Saturday-morning movie serial, moving from one close call to another...but it's all extremely violent.  Lots and lots of women and children callously cut down in the film.  We see children killing and being killed.<br /><br />As I said, I found the political "message" to be less than compelling as drama.  But the drama of the movie...the action, if you will, is well staged and makes up for much of the rest.  Edward Zwick, who did such a great job with GLORY and a pretty good job, I thought, with THE LAST SAMURAI, is clearly aiming for an "important" film here...but in the end it's a violent, gory, terrifying, exciting action film.  I don't mean to dismiss the plight of the people in Africa.  It IS very disturbing to be aware of what's going on...and that's good.  However, as filmmaking, the filmmakers didn't quite work out how to dramatize the message.<br /><br />I would say the script probably failed them.  The editing, cinematography, landscapes and especially the actors and the ACTION are all first-rate.  But the words the actors have to spout are often wince-inducingly non-human.<br /><br />DiCaprio is all the way back now as one of our great actors.  After TITANIC, he briefly fell into the role of hard-partying idiot and somewhat fell out of favor.  He returned to serious filmwork in GANGS OF NEW YORK, but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN was more successful for him, but his acting chops were somewhat dismissed due to the frivolous nature of the film.  THE AVIATOR got him an Oscar nod, but somehow the public didn't really embrace it.  But this year, with THE DEPARTED and BLOOD DIAMOND, there is no doubting anymore that he is an actor of considerable skill.  His spotty South African accent aside (it's one of the toughest accents to replicate...seriously), he is first rate.  He's really a bad guy with charm, and the fact that we feel mostly on his side through the film, even though he's killing people left and right, is a testament to his charm.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, in a poorly written role, always looks great, and staring with roughly the middle of the film, her character begins to connect with the audience, and we start to like her.  Her final "scene" with DiCaprio would have been cloying in the hands of other performers, but they both pull it off.<br /><br />And Djimon Hounsou is always a mighty presence.  He was great in AMISTAD, Oscar nominated for IN AMERICA, and truly in his element in BLOOD DIAMOND.  He's an African born actor, and in this film he's truly in his element.  He has a real sense of the pace and lifestyle of the region, and it comes across very well.  His role is written to make him a very saintly character, and again, in less able hands, might have been truly one-dimensional.  I wish more people were seeing this film, if only to see him.<br /><br />So, overall I recommend the film.  It's never boring, though occasionally frustrating.  It is NOT for the kids, though. The violence is graphic, constant and inflicted on truly innocent people.  But if you want adult entertainment with lots of action and don't mind a sheen of "message," you'll be pleased.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>I am very proud of Mr. DiCaprio. He is amassing quite and impressive body of work both artistically and politically. He appears to be picking his movies and parts carefully. There have been a whole genre of political movies made within the last 4-5 yrs or so that have been doing a very good job of getting out global information to the public -- which is what the American media should be doing but somehow cannot or will not. "Blood Diamond" is one of those movies that hopefully will make you think and reconsider your purchasing habits and how something so simple can affect other people (especially children) half way around the world.<br /><br />This movie is serious and worth seeing. It put me in a really bad mood, but also made me determined to monitor my purchasing habits so that I do not contribute to that vicious cycle which is war, greed and poverty.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>The critics are touting "Blood Diamond," directed by Edward Zwick, as one of the best films of 2006 as well as lavishing praise on Leonardo DiCaprio for his performance as Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. The movie is certainly worth seeing. DiCaprio gives his best performance to date-- at least that I have seen-- as he usually suffers from what I call the Hugh Grant Syndrome, never able to be totally successful at playing a grownup. The outrageously beautiful African countryside is in sharp contrast to the unending bloody slaughter that takes place in Sierra Leone as families are either destroyed or left in abject poverty.<br /><br />Although the plot is predictable, the film is ultimately saved by the fine acting. In addition to the performance of DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the journalist who makes a difference in Archer's life, is outstanding. Nevertheless, no one comes close to Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, the poor African who finds the pink diamond in the first place. His performance almost justifies paying the outrageous price these days of a first-run movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>This is Africa.<br /><br />Every time something of value has been discovered in Africa, the people have suffered.  That includes ivory, rubber, gold--and now, diamonds.<br /><br />This is Africa.<br /><br />Press gangs of rebels conscripting men at gunpoint, taking them away from their families and forcing them to work mining for diamonds.<br /><br />Rebels handing guns to young children and turning them into soldiers.<br /><br />Young women selling their bodies on the street assuring the customer they are free of HIV.<br /><br />Diamonds being sold by rebels to finance wars to overturn the government.<br /><br />The governments only staying in power long enough to rob the treasuries and then going into exile elsewhere.<br /><br />Mercenaries playing both sides of the fence.<br /><br />Diamond companies tacitly financing the war by buying 'blood diamonds' from rebels, then storing the diamonds to limit their supply so their profits are still high.<br /><br />This is not just the story of one mercenary and Sierra Leone native's quest to retrieve and sell a large carat pink diamond.  It's the history of a country.<br /><br />The story's hard to watch, but very real and worthwhile.  James Newton Howard does an amazing job with the soundtrack, which touches the scene in just the right way to emphasize the director's point.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Africa is the issue du jour in Hollywood these days, and director Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" is the latest attempt to shed light on the continent's genocidal civil wars.<br /><br />Along with the brutal, borderline-racist "Black Hawk Down," the film is the goriest on a list that includes "Hotel Rwanda," "Sometimes In April," "Lord of War," "The Interpreter," "The Constant Gardener" and "Catch A Fire." Zwick's production certainly is the longest; it's hard to get tired of Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, two fierce actors in excellent performances, but "Blood Diamond" drives you right to the brink of tedium.<br /><br />Charles Leavitt's plot-heavy screenplay zeroes in on Sierra Leone's 1999 civil war with little political detail. What we're shown is an overwhelmed puppet government against the rebels of R.U.F sadists who listen to Ice-T and Tupac as they shoot villagers from flatbed Toyotas and kidnap boys to become part of their war machine.<br /><br />Fisherman Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is one such villager separated from his family and sent to a diamond pit to panhandle for gems, which are used by the rebels to pay gunrunners for weapons. He finds a 100-carat pink doozy and hides it in the red dirt.<br /><br />Diamond smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio, with a semi-consistent accent) hears of Solomon's diamond and makes a play to become his partner in relocating and selling the diamond to legitimate outfits in London, which launder the dirty diamonds, have them cut in India, then sell them, just like any other diamond, in the open market.<br /><br />Archer, a self-described "soldier of fortune," is weary of this arrangement and willing to sell his story to an American political journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) after he snatches the gem.<br /><br />At its core, "Blood Diamond" is really an "Adventure In The Bush!" as Danny, Maddy and Solomon run, hide, con, bribe and kill their way back to the location of the diamond. There are three significant action sequences, all well done, all convincingly played by the actors. Archer in particular is no saint - he can crack a joke one breath, crack a skull the next - and DiCaprio gives the role the right kind of suave menace. He's a rough dude, ruthless to the last. We just happen to be rooting for him.<br /><br />Solomon, of course, is a near-saint as the poor, humble African looking for his family - the written character is a walking cliche - but Hounsou doesn't let the performance wander into self-pity. Screenwriter Leavitt at least addresses Solomon's servitude posture to Archer in a fight sequence that, again, is a clich&#65533; but at least dissolves the gnawing sense that Hounsou is sidekick to DiCaprio's Lone Smuggler.<br /><br />Zwick may not be a household name, but since he directed "Glory" in 1989, he's made a pile of cash - he produced "Shakespeare In Love" and the television show "thirtysomething" - and used it for costly, epic shoots. He took two years and $140 million to make Tom Cruise's bloated "The Last Samurai."<br /><br />Unlike the Cruise vehicle, which at least worked as a documentary-style look at the Japanese samurai culture, "Blood Diamond" is late to the topical party. Conflict diamonds may be the focus, but the exploitation and genocide of Africa is still the subject, and Zwick is more intrigued by African sunrises, rocket explosions and how many cigarettes DiCaprio can smoke. It entrenches itself in the ground level of the conflict, useful for sympathetic purposes but not so much for edification.<br /><br />Are the conflicts of Africa about capitalist greed and men looking for their families? Yes. But it has to be about more than that.<br /><br />I have yet to see "The Last King of Scotland," but that story, about the rise and fall of Ugandan leader Idi Amin, and the exhaustive, powerful retelling of the Rwandan civil war found in "Sometimes In April," seem the more essential stories now. Seek them out. Save "Blood Diamond" for a DiCaprio Saturday swoon-a-thon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROZK0G84RGMZ.html">A3ROZK0G84RGMZ</a><br/><p>Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou give outstanding performances in this very emotionally charged movie.  This movie brings light to the taboo subject of modern day slavery.  And the slavery keeps happening because greedy pigs all over the world feel the need to be draped in diamonds.  Hopefully many who watch this film will learn what happens in other parts of the world and start to care more.  The movie is a real eye opener.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond is one of those "Public Awareness" films that accomplishes its goal without relying on much preaching. In a way you could easily classify Blood Diamond as being a Hotel Rwanda film for audience members who aren't in the mood for pure drama.  So instead the issues are mixed into a classy, well thought out action thriller.  More recently we saw this concept used well in District 9, which addressed the issue of racism, slums, and xenophobia in South Africa.  This contemporary method of informing the public often turns in good films when done right and Blood Diamond does it right.<br /><br />Though not the greatest film dealing with conflict in Africa it draws enormous amounts of strength from  Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housou (both earned Academy Award nominations for their roles) who play a mismatched pair that has to work together.  DiCaprio is Danny Archer, a white mercenary (who specializes in smuggling conflict diamonds to fund private wars) from Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) who feels that by getting his hands on a rare "blood diamond" he will have enough money to leave Africa and retire.  This diamond has been found, but the only one who knows of its location is the man who found it: Solomon Vandy (Housou).  Vandy's son has been abducted by the guerrilla forces and after escaping slavery at the hands of the rebel group he meets Archer and makes an agreement that he will help him find the diamond, but only if he assists in rescuing his son.<br /><br />A wonderful film with the expert direction of Edward Zwick, Blood Diamond is a good film. I suppose my only gripe with the film would be its lack of concentration in regards to the conditions of Sierra Leone. Some things are just simply skimmed over, such as the issue of child soldiers, which I thought was one of the main issues the film was supposed to address. I don't know if this has to do with regulations on what you show children do on screen or what, but it definitely felt as if it was cut short.<br /><br />Regardless, this is a tight film that gets its message across while remaining an engaging, entertaining thriller. DiCaprio and Hounsou were at their very best in each scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>It is hard not to have some sympathy with the current trend of making political issues palatable by grafting a star and a story on to a real-life cause for concern. Give us a thrilling story, good acting, pretty people to look at, and we can get the message out to millions. In recent years, Nicolas Cage has tackled gun-running ( Lord of War) and George Clooney the Middle East ( Syriana). Now it's the turn of DiCaprio and the illegal diamond trade, which has funded civil wars in Africa.<br />Very good movie......</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>This movie is intense, cinematically beautiful, and exceptionally well acted. Strong supporting performances from Jennifer Connolly House of Sand and Fog, Requiem for a Dream) and Djimon Hounsou (Alias Season 3, Amistad) highlight a sublime performance from Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Basketball Diaries). DiCaprio has been churning out really good performances since his Oscar-nominated role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? It's a shame that he was thought of as just another pretty boy and that most people consider his mediocre performance in Titanic the highlight of his career. His performance in Blood Diamond should solidify his status as one of the greatest actors of his generations (and those muscles should make even more women swoon).<br /><br />The subject matter of the movie is captivating and heart wrenching. This is a story that needs to be told; that must be told. And Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Glory) does it justice in this film.<br /><br />After watching this film, I am justified in what I've been saying for years - I never want a diamond as the stone in my wedding ring or any other sort of diamond.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>This is a movie that will stay with you for a while...the horrors of African civil war, the exploitation and abuse of young preteen boys[turning them into murderers, in the guise of so-called soldiers], the exploitation of the Africans by the Western world [in order to procure valuable diamonds], its all here. What makes this movie so compelling is the wonderful cinematography & excellent acting. We are treated to beautiful scenes of the African coast and countryside, which is then juxtaposed with the violence & bloodshed due to civil strife. Leo Caprio gives one of his [if not THE] best performance of his career...he plays the ruthless White ex-soldier turned diamond smuggler to the hilt, and totally absorbs his role[with a pretty authentic Rhodesian accent to boot]. Djimon Hounsou elicits our sympathy as the fisherman Salomon Vandy who after escaping slavery in the diamond mines, makes it his life mission to find his scattered family. His son falls prey to the militia, and is trained to become a ruthless child soldier...the weakest role in my opinion was that played by Jennifer Connelly...her performance as the journalist Mandy Bowen just didn't elicit much emotion. The storyline though moves along at a frenetic pace, and though the movie is quite long at abt 2.5 hrs, it is nevertheless compelling and keeps one glued to the screen. Definitely worth a watch!</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>Who knew something so beautiful comes with such an ugly history behind it. The simple diamond has become director Ed Zwick's latest interest, and here he explores this rock in such depth and detail, it is both amazing and scary. One thing is for sure, I will never look at diamonds the same way.<br /><br />Danny Archer is a diamond smuggler, a Rhodesian who has ties to some large corporations, like Van De Kaap. Soloman Vandy is a fisherman from a local village that is pillaged by rebels R.U.F. who are at civil war vying for diamond fields. Danny gets caught by the local government trying to smuggle diamonds out of Africa and is put in jail. Soloman is separated from his family during the destruction of his village, and the rebels take him in to help them harvest diamonds. He comes upon a pink diamond, a large rock, one of the rarest in the world. Soon after, while struggling with Captain Poison, a rebel leader who finds out about the diamond, the rebel camp is attacked by the government's military unit and he is forced to bury the diamond. With a twist of fate, he ends up in the same prison where Danny is. Danny finds out about the diamond, and in a bid to repay what he lost when he was caught, and also to get out of Africa, he arranges to get Soloman out of prison and engage his help to find the diamond. In return, he promises Soloman to help locate his family. At around the same time, Danny also meets Maddy, a journalist who aspires to uncover the truth about conflict diamonds, that these diamonds reach the shores of countries like the U.S or England, and that large corporations are hiding that fact. Danny agrees to help her, if she would use her influence as a journalist to find Soloman's family. "Yes, I am using him and you are using me, and that's how it goes," Danny says. The story ensues...<br /><br />The story, while totally riveting in it's delivery, never clouds the backbone of this movie, the illegal mining of these conflict diamonds, and its effects on the country and the people. Back when this story was set, I was still a teenager and oblivious to these issues. I'm guessing many adults were, too. I read many reviews criticizing Blood Diamond, saying that it felt like a documentary. Isn't that a compliment? To be able to provoke some sort of emotion upon viewing the horrifying acts of man for money and power. To watch young children recruited by the rebels to kill, trained to have no conscience whatsoever. It is really sad to think that all these was happening just a few years ago, and probably still is, although not as much. Your heart goes out to these people who have been enslaved and tortured. One character says "Thank God they did not find oil."<br /><br />The acting is top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a consistently great performance in every movie he's in and it's no exception here. He is unflinching as the ruthless Danny Archer. Definitely not playing to the usual hero mold, he is never really the good guy throughout the movie, even in the end his moral obligation is somewhat questionable. He always has an ulterior motive. The only times we see his vulnerabilities is when he is talking with Maddy. One of my favorite lines from the movie is uttered here. "Sometimes I wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we've done to each other...then I look around and I realize, God left this place a long time ago." Delivered with such emotion that it simply grabs you. A well deserved Oscar nomination for his role here. Another great actor is Djimon Honsou, playing Soloman Vandy. Soloman is a simple man, a family-oriented guy who cares about nothing else but his family. He is naive in a sense and when his family is taken, you can feel the grief in him. He is overwhelmed with what is happening around him. Where Danny blends perfectly with this environment, Soloman seems struggling to apprehend it. And Jennifer Connelly plays the journalist, Maddy Bowen. Maddy has a great intensity to know the real story behind this industry, but we, the audience are always left questioning, will that knowledge change anything? She certainly feels it will and is unwavering in her mission to find out. Danny and Maddy had some great chemistry, and ultimately that connection between them plays a vital role in the end of the movie.<br /><br />Other than this, many other factors contribute to the success of this movie. The cinematography is brilliant. It depicts the civil war to an amazing level of realism. The music was also fantastic, infusing native sounds with orchestral elements to create a sweeping score of epic proportions. I am also eagerly anticipating this 2-disc DVD set, particularly because I am very interested to see how Ed Zwick delved into this industry, how he researched blood diamonds, the smuggling of this rocks, the people behind it, the wars and how the actors themselves prepared for the roles.<br /><br />In the end, the true power of this movie transcends what can be seen on the screen. It really is more about what is felt upon watching this movie. Sure, finally everything is tied up with a nice little bow, but the movie claims that civil unrest still exists in the nation of Africa. Parts of the problem are resolved, but for every solution, there is a new problem creeping up. Ultimately, I'm guessing that this movie was not made with the idea of finding a resolution to the wars, but I think for it to even make us think about the consequences of buying conflict diamonds, to give us a "pang" of realization what occurs behind the scenes of how these magnificent jewels are obtained is a huge success in itself. And it certainly did do exactly that for me. Powerful, compelling and real would be some of the words I would choose to describe this awe-inspiring movie. A superb effort and one the best pictures I have seen. Wholeheartedly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I think that this movie is the perfect blend of a documentary and an action-drama. Clearly the intent was to bring to the forefront the issue of conflict diamonds in Africa. But instead of going for a factual film, the creators decided to throw together a group of great actors and a set of interesting sidelines to the story, polishing it into a magnificent jewel. The issue at hand is the brutal slaughtering in several parts of Africa, especially Sierra Leone, related to the control of diamonds. The situation in the movie is best described as TIA (This is Africa), a political mess, where those that govern only want to steal for their own benefit, and where there is no way to help, not even for the peace corps.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman that dreams of his son, Dia, becoming a doctor and moving on to better things. This dream is stopped in its track when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) comes to his village and brutally slaughters most of the inhabitants. Luckily, Solomon's family escapes, but the RUF captures him and takes him to work on the diamond fields as a slave. Meanwhile, politicians in the industrialized world are aware of the problem resulting from diamonds from conflict zones and there is an agreement not to buy them anymore. The big diamond houses in Europe and the US agree, but you probably know by now that they will go around it in one way or another.<br /><br />Then there is Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is a local from Zimbabwe that gives arms to different guerrilla groups in exchange for diamonds and then smuggles them to Liberia, from where they can be imported into the consumer countries as conflict free rocks. When he is captured during one of his diamond operations, he is thrown in jail, where he meets Solomon. Solomon was in jail as a result of a raid of the RUF camp, but not before finding a big pink diamond that he hid underground. When the greedy Danny finds out about this, he makes sure that his future path is linked to Solomon's.<br /><br />Besides the greedy and unscrupulous Danny, and the moral Solomon, who just wants his family back, we have Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist that is frustrated by the situations she witnesses all around the globe and that wants her work to be effective in stopping the destruction. The three characters go through a journey of self-discovery while everyone around them is out to kill each other for the control of the diamonds. The situation is so bad that the different revolutionary groups kidnap and train children to join them. Seeing the transformation these young minds go through in a short time breaks your heart.<br /><br />The film definitely achieves its purpose of making people aware of the issues, and even though the story is gut-wrenching and some portions are extremely violent, I think that it was needed to convey the message clearly. What I did not expect before watching this movie was the outstanding performances I was going to witness. This is definitely DiCaprio's best. He even altered his accent to make it sound like a local and he does this very well. But he also has to play a character with multiple facets and that goes through somewhat of a transformation, and his performance really helps to make this believable. I have never heard of Hounsou before, but was impressed by the emotion he put into his role, and I am sure there will be many starring roles for him in the future. Jennifer Connely is the one I expected the best from, and she did not disappoint, since she delivers a performance on par to the one she gave us on excellent "The House of Sand and Fog". This is definitely one of the best releases of 2006, and if you can stomach the violence I believe you will agree.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.

When he finds one the size of the end of his thumb he tries to smuggle it out.  The movie is about his trials and tribulations trying to reunite his family and get the diamond out.  Leonardo plays a smuggler who is helping him for a share of the proceeds.<br /><br />Somewhat recommended for action adventure fans, but be warned it is bloody and gruesome in parts.<br /><br />Gunner  October,2007</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a very powerful movie that wears its political views on its sleeve.  However, the performances are so good and the story so well done that I didn't really mind being manipulated even as I knew what the writers and director were trying to do to me.  They simply did it and it worked.  Of course, the movie wants us to become aware of the issue of "blood diamonds" or "conflict diamonds" and the hell on earth they finance.  When the movie ends we are all supposed to be committed to being sure that any diamonds we buy are not had at the cost of enslaving, maiming, or killing other human beings.  However, the story communicates this on the sides of the main story which centers on a single large and very rare stone worth many millions of dollars that almost no one can afford.<br /><br />The country of Sierra Leone has a tortured history.  It was among the first countries through which slaves bound for North America were purchased in the seventeenth century.  After 1787, Britain founded Freetown much as America founded Liberia, as a place of return for freed slaves. And while it served as the seat for the British rule in the area, its ethnic diversity (at least 18 different groups) has led to nearly constant struggles and fighting.  Its English speaking university, Fourah Bay College, has attracted English speaking Africans from all over the West Coast of Africa.<br /><br />The politics of the period of the movie in the early 1990s are hard to understand because of its sheer complexity.  The movie basically digests it into the Government forces and the RUF (Revolutionary United Front), however, in real life there were additional factions.  The point is that the Solomon Vandy character just wanted to live his life as a fisherman with his family and didn't want to get caught up in any of this gangsterism masquerading as government.<br /><br />The movie centers on a Rhodesian named Danny Archer (superbly done by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose homelessness (because Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and because he lost his parents when very young) is an important theme in the movie.  Is he of Africa or is he a foreigner who doesn't belong?  He has lived by his wits and his ability to fight.  When the movie begins he is a diamond smuggler with all the hazards of that trade.<br /><br />The other important story is about the aforementioned Solomon Vandy (powerfully portrayed by Djimon Hounsou) who is a simple fisherman with a wonderful family that has largely avoided the troubles.  His boy, Dia, is going to school and the family has dreams of him becoming a doctor.  Then the RUF gangs come to his village and their life will never be the same.  In the confusion, the family is fragmented into three groups with none of them knowing the whereabouts of the others or even if they live.  Solomon is actually fortunate to become enslaved working at finding diamonds for the RUF gang.  Solomon finds a huge pink stone that becomes the focus of the movie once he tries to secret it out.  Everyone wants that stone.  Everyone.  And it is that stone that brings all the elements of the rest of the story together.<br /><br />The love interest, such as it is, is supplied by the danger seeking and passionate Maddy Bowen (played just right by Jennifer Connelly).  She is there to find out the story and helps us understand the whole blood diamond trade as well as tease out the background story of Danny Archer.<br />I cannot share any more of the story because you should see it on your own. The hellishness of Sierra Leone during this time is powerfully portrayed on the screen.  If Pittsburgh in the nineteenth century was rightly called "Hell With the Lid Off", Sierra Leone in the 1990s would have made Hell look like a vacation resort.<br /><br />See it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>A rare and sizable diamond is found by a worker in a warlord's diamond mine. This adds even more turbulence to an already volatile situation as different forces attempt to seize the 'blood diamond.'<br /><br />In a certain sense I found this film to comparable to 'Babel' - it tells s story that reveals an uncomfortable truth about our world, but remains grounded and personal with its perspective. Focusing of a few principle characters - with each actor/actress giving a solid performance - the film gives a really up-close look at a world fueled by greed and filled with violence. There is something rotten in the states of Africa and the 'blood diamond' of the title is practically a classic McGuffin - totally incidental to what is going on. But if people can get so worked up over just one diamond it gives you an idea about why the situation there is what it is - and just how expensive diamonds really are.<br /><br />Leonrado DiCaprio done an excellent job in his role-no exaggeration. He excels as the aggressive and also at times sensitive smuggler.  2006 has been exceptional year for him with two powerhouse roles - the other being "The Departed" - and his career should be highly respected for that. Djimon Honsou is one of my favorite actors, so, naturally, I liked his work in this. But it isn't that I simply "liked" his work in this--he gave THE best performance in the movie. He handles the role of Solomon Vandy as if he IS Solomon- a truly moving character. I think this is Jennifer Connelly's second best performance in her career (the first being Requiem For A Dream). She plays Matty Bowen, journalist for Vital Affairs magazine. She shows how great an actress she can actually be, but it will never top her Requiem acting.<br /><br />As Richard Roeper stated: "Edward Zwick is the master of politically correct thrillers". Well, I wholeheartedly agree with him. "Glory," "The Last Samaurai," and "The Siege" were spectacular and suspenseful pictures with great acting, and I'm going to chalk this up onto that list as well. There are some great action set pieces that had me on the edge of my seat. But Zwick and cinematographer Eduardo Serra make it look easy. "Blood Diamond" is violent, gritty, suspenseful, poignant, and long which is why it is worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this was a pretty good movie but I also think it was limited and pretty sappy. Leonardo DiCaprio was very good as the young mercenary. Djimon Hounsou has a good look but I don't think he is a very good actor beyond that. Jennifer Connelly is the same. She is not a very good actress. This movie does expose or bring to the mainstream public the story of the blood diamond trade. That is commendable. But I think it got to be a bit sappy and a bit of a 'feel good' movie. I enjoyed it for the most part but think it was kind of unrealistic in its hollywood feel good 'happy ending'.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Blood Diamond" highlights an important issue - diamonds being used to fund civil wars in this case the civil war in Sierra Leone in the late 1990's.<br /><br />The viewer is introduced to these issues via three characters - a South African diamond smuggler played by Leonardo di Caprio, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, and a local whose family is torn apart.<br /><br />Sadly Leonardo is miscast in the "he-man" role - he's just too nice - although his attempt at a South African accent is pretty good. Connelly is also somewhat lightweight as the journalist although she it not helped by dialogue that largely leaves her spouting polemics. The villians are merely cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />The plot is all-too-contrived and cliched and builds to a predictable conclusion.<br /><br />The film-makers are to be commended for bringing an important issue to a mainstream film, however, they are all-too-obvious in making their point leaving the viewer feeling preached to rather than moved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>If you like action well this film should be good. What we have here is an attempt to make a movie based on real social issues of child soldiers and the profits of diamonds used to fund dubious political movements.<br /><br />The story I found in many parts over the top. So they made a movie full of stock characters. Good moral reporters trying to help the locals for humanity sake, world officials' who are trying to do some good and not so bad mercenaries who look like they are modern cowboys finishing off with a Hollywood happy ending.<br /><br />Having said that some of the scenes for example when the rebels took the town, killed, cut peoples hands off and took many into slavery, I thought were good.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />The acting was nothing special. The casting was not good. DiCaprio should never have put in that role. It did not suit him.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond was a film that I didn't really want to see but I wanted to see. I didn't want to see it because the things I was told about it didn't really make me too happy. Blood diamonds or conflict diamonds are diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance the conflicts. I remember as a child my mom would tell me that there're places in Africa where you could walk down the roads and find diamonds and jewels in the ground. Of course I didn't totally believe her then cause I was like 6 but after seeing this you come to see how valuable and beautiful Africa really is.<br /><br />The film is set in 1999 in the Sierra Leone civil war the country is at a constant struggle with fights between government soldiers and rebel forces. The rebels named RUF are pretty much past crazy, invading villages, cutting off innocent peoples hands so they're unable to vote and taking strong men to mine and young children to mold into little soldiers. Everything starts with Solomon Vandy, a good man with a good family and his son is a good student. One day while walking home with his son after catching some fish a few trucks playing music come speeding behind them. There are armed men in the truck and Vandy immediately knows trouble is coming. He runs to his village in a great panic to get the rest of his family out but the men get there first and are already just killing whoever. Vandy gets his family out but he gets caught and is sent to work the mines in search of diamonds.<br /><br />While working the mines Vandy finds one of the largest and rarest diamonds ever. Somehow he sneaks off to hide the diamond and lucky for him government troops attack just as a RUF soldier sees what he's doing. Unfortunately Vandy gets caught and is arrested along with the injured soldier. While in prison the soldier shouts what he saw Vandy do and says he will give money to anyone who gets the truth out of him. Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) trades weapons for diamonds and overhears the talk between Solomon and the soldier. Archer is quick to help Solomon get out and then starts harassing him to get the diamond. A number of events occur that just making everything worse, the absolute worse being Solomon's son getting kidnapped but RUF and made a little soldier. Now Vandy must get his child back and goes on a hard journey to get the diamond and his child.<br /><br />First of all things I can't believe Djimon Hounsou didn't win Best Supporting Actor for this film. Seeing him in the previews going crazy to find his son was even getting to me. I don't think I could explain how powerful his performance was in this film. It was so realistic and perfected that you had to feel his pain. The scene at the end with when he tries to bring his brainwashed sons mind back was amazing. I saw Little Miss Sunshine and not to take anything from Alan Arkin but that was nothing compared to Hounsou in this film, Hounsou should've been the one that walked out. I too have never really been a Leo fan but you can't deny that he has a great talent. He plays Danny Archer on point and never lets the character go. This film would not be what it is without the great acting and the settings of Africa were beautiful. I'm not exactly sure how accurate this movie is with the history but overall it's a great film and is a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>I liked a lot about the movie: the acting, scenery, subject matter.

Five nominations for the Academy awards. A mercenary helps a refugee to meet up with his family in exchange for a very rare pink diamond. Edward Zwick's filmography alternates the best like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WG2F">Legends of the Fall (Special Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005221J">Courage Under Fire</a> and the worst like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V0K">The Siege (Martial Law Edition)</a> or this BLOOD DIAMOND. Besides Leonardo DiCaprio's superb performance, the film is a total disaster. You can't explain Africa's drama in 120 minutes by using Hollywood clich&eacute;s. Either you decide to film an adventure movie in Africa either you shoot a committed film about the exploitation of African soil by western or eastern countries. Too bad Edward Zwick forgot this elemental axiom.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Irrespective of what other critics/users say about this movie, I feel it lacked something. A lot of people have praised Di Caprio on his performance and some have has gone as far as saying this is his best performance, if not best film. I don't think Blood Diamond stacks up pretty well when you compare it to the last three films that Di Caprio has done. Namely - The Departed, Aviator and Catch Me If You Can. Now, let's talk about why I think this film fails.<br /><br />1. The story never really convinces one of it's message. My friend loved this movie but I just didn't feel it. The acting in the film was solid but the direction was rather tawdry. There were many action scenes that involved thrill in chase, capture, imprisonment, punishment, labor and death. However, nothing quite seemed to cement itself.<br /><br />2. Blood Diamond is a good film but it's just that. I don't think I will be recommending it to anyone. There are too many better films to watch. The subject is rather rewinded or should I just placidly state that I don't care. Or the script really doesn't make me care enough.<br /><br />3. I liked the end of the film. I'm used to absolutely loving the ends of film involving Di Caprio. Jennifer Connelly didn't act very well. Her character was sometimes incongruent to the script. The fact that I even question her performance is enough to highlight the lukewarm performance she gave.<br /><br />My favourite scene in the film involved Solomon winning an applause. But then, tell me, how many times have I seen scenes like that particular one in hollywood? Cynical as I am, I thought Djimon Hounsou acted very well. Di Caprio's character was predictable, at times funny and overall unimpressionable.<br /><br />Do Watch this film. But be open to the fact that some of you might not quite like it all that much. Of course I eagerly await Caprio's next film, Blink.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>BLOOD DIAMOND is an extremely important film from the informational standpoint.Going as far back as the early 1800's white Europeans and native blacks from various tribes have been complicit in the raping and pillaging of the  land and it's people in Sierra Leone.Not only has there been the Belgian Colonial Rule in the past,but also there has been a savage Civil War that has existed among the numerous indigenous people.Innocent people have been caught in the crossfire over the years.(NOTE: this is the land from which the AMISTAD slaves were sold!)Flash forward and it is 1999, and Sierra Leone is still in the midst of chaos,but this time it is for the mining of illegal diamonds that are smuggled into Liberia and make their way to an important diamond merchant,Van de Kamp.Danny Archer( the always "give-it-your-all Di Caprio) is the mercenary diamond smuggler;Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is the journalist who wants to blow the smuggling  story wide open!;and Solomon Vendy (always amazing Djimon Hounsou)who is the innocent native who is captured by warring rebels.It is Vendy who has found the illusive 100-karat "pink diamond".All of these characters converge in a superb action-filled,swiftly paced race to "exploit" each other in some way;Archer wants the diamond;Bowen wants the story and Vendy wants his family back.The Thomas Newton Howard soundtrack is absolutely riveting as well as the excellent cinematography and smart editing.<br /><br />Where this film fails is in the inane dialogue.This is particularly true of the drek that is given to DiCaprio and Connelly.Two actors of such calibre deseved better than this.They do their best with it,but bad dialogue is bad dialogue! The story is terribly formulaic and a bit trite,and when everyone in Sierra Leone is getting killed,these characters always escape harm (of course they have to or the movie would have ended at the opening credits!).The film is just shy of three hours and much could have hit the cutting room floor.(I couldn't help noting that people in the audience began to fidget at the two-hour mark-I and my friends included!!!)<br /><br />Where this film succeeds is in the information that the viewer gains about the continuing exploitation of the Africas and the civil unrest that exists among it's own people.<br /><br />There is an excellent warning at the conclusion of the film for anyone who might be considering purchasing diamonds.<br /><br />All-in-all,not a bad flick,but not a great one either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Typical Hollywood shoot-em-up.

Throw in some S. Africa and Western guilt over what Westerners imagine must be going on in Africa and you have the usual formula. This has to be DiCaprio's worst movie, five Academy Award nominations or not. Still, it can hold up to a viewing if you get it out of the library for free, as I did.

Pretty political though, i mean c'mon, Africa was in turmoil and war long before any of us were even around, let alone the United States.  Suddenly out of nowhere the United States is the only place in the world that buys diamonds, ya ok sure whateva.  Set in a true time period but severely marred otherwise.  I mean, c'mon people, you really think the whole airship diversion would happen?  and the whole thing with posing as journalists was absurd.  America also dumps millions into this country and year and, well like they said, nothing changes.  the kids get recruited, the people starve and then the blame gets pinpointed in all the wrong places.  When will the zombies wake up and realize that the only person africa has to blame for its problems, is africa?  Blood Diamond has great actors but a pathetic storyline that has nothing more than the intention of laying blame in all the wrong places.  I know, I lived there for three years and I worked for Unicef and IAD Homes.  Drop 10,000 marines in there with orders to sweep and salvage and I can assure ya that the rebels will not kill another woman or child.  instead we get movies from hollywood that, like babel and syriana try to paint some tunnel vision for the zombies to get fixated on.  Diamonds and greed are not the problem, the problem is this country has not progressed one inch in the last thousand years.  Go ahead, give my review a negative hit, see if I care.

I am a fan of DiCaprio and I actually like Connelly despite her lack of range, and both actors had impressed me already this very year (`The Departed' and `Little Children' also being released in 2006) and so I was at least hoping they would elevate this film for me (although the spotty and awkward accent donned by DiCaprio was even distracting in the trailer).  I have lost the faith I once had in Hounsou, the one I have now knighted Sir Screamsalot.<br /><br />So, it's safe to say I expected this to be underwhelming.<br /><br />I didn't expect to see ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN though!<br /><br />I don't know if there is enough time in the world for me to express all that I find distasteful about this wretched film, and I don't know if I would want to subject any self-respecting reader to my tirade (nor do I think you would have the patience to bare with me on this one) so I'm going to try and be as brief as I can be.<br /><br />The film attempts to shed light on a very dark and troubling epidemic of sorts in Africa.  The harrowing truth behind conflict diamonds is heartbreaking and cruel and completely devastating.  That is lost in this mess of a film.  It gets lost in pointless violence (don't even try and justify this) and awkward speeches.  It gets lost in aimless direction and clich&eacute;d performances.  In fact, there is nothing to commend about this film.  The only thing that is worthy of mention is the message the film is trying to relay; the problem being that it just doesn't relay it well.<br /><br />Danny Archer is a selfish diamond smuggler who wants a giant raw diamond found by fisherman Solomon Vandy who has recently escaped enslavement by a ruthless rebel leader.  Maddy Bowen is a journalist who wants Archer to give her the inside scoop on the diamond smuggling operations.<br /><br />Vandy uses Archer to get his family (war torn) while Archer uses Vandy to get the stone while Dowen uses Archer to get her story.<br /><br />The film isn't quite certain where it wants to be.  I remember similar issues with `Beyond Borders' and I see a similarity here (although that film is far from this horrible).  The film is essentially a mindless action film that decides to (awkwardly) insert messages of enlightenment to the viewer.  In between countless scenes of bloodshed and screaming there is a fact driven monologue of how these stones are transported, and then there is more screaming and bullets.  The film opens with violence and it ends with it.  I remember looking at my wife and rolling my eyes about halfway through the film because it seemed as though no one could get through a single conversation without dodging a bullet.  It was relentless and it took away HEAVILY from the films core.<br /><br />I also felt that the interactions between characters felt forced and unnatural.  This is a result of poor scripting (the definition of POOR!), but it is also a direct result of lazy acting.  The standout here is Hounsou, and not in a good way.  His idea of acting is a simplistic approach.  When he is sad is cries.  When he is angry he screams.  When he is happy he smiles.  That is all.  Apparently he is mad a lot because all he does here is SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM.  It is so over-the-top and irritatingly ridiculous.  DiCaprio suffers from an awkward accent and insufferable dialog (I mean "bling bang"?  Really?) but he actually portrays the emotions correctly (and I was happy that he remained selfish throughout most of the film).  Connelly is a boring stereotype here, enough said.<br /><br />The script was just a hodgepodge of unrealistic encounters and scattered bullet fire.  The way Archer approaches Vandy, the way Vandy jeopardizes his life and the life of his son MORE THAN ONCE, the way Bowen chokes up on the phone...it ALL READS FALSE and ridiculously manipulative.<br /><br />The only (small) redeeming factor (no redemption really, just a well played part) is anything involving Kagiso Kuypers, who plays Dia, Vandy's missing son.  His scenes are a powerful testament to the darkness that engulfs this epidemic.  Sadly, his scenes are few and his presence is masked heavily by the horrific direction taken by Edward Zwick, whose haphazard vision single handedly botched what could have been a somewhat intelligent feature film.<br /><br />So, yes, this is a mess...a horrible mess that I would never wish upon anyone, even my worst enemies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Yes, there is action.

I am a big fan of DiCaprio, pegging him as the best actor of his generation since his breakout performance in "Gilbert Grape,"  and I rather like the work of Zwick, whose "Glory" was great and his "Samurai," worth seeing, but this film is pure silliness as far as I am concerned, a sentimental piece of nonsense, made memorable by a stand out performance by DiCaprio who continues to grow, although I think it is sad to see him wasted on this sort of action film more suited to Danny Devito and or Mr. Stallone, ha, ha. The set-up is reminiscent of the recent Bond flick, with the so-called hard-as-nails chick who talks Vassar-tough, but melts the minute "her man" starts shooting Africans. After that, there is no holding her back. In one gripping scene, she gives him her phone number.  She doesn't approve of diamond sales, but she loves the smell of napalm in the morning.

AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!<br /><br />Another funny stuffs are the gore that is kind of fake, DiCaprios's dialoge sometime is cheesy, Connelly wasn't acting! she was modeling and the captions that even describes the music that will play on the movie!!<br /><br />The movie has a lot of action scenes but this is more like drama, and the action is choreographied as war! so don't think that the action is this movie is the same as Last Samurai by the same director.<br />I gave it 3 stars because all of that, but the movie is still entertaining and easy to understand.<br /><br />adios and have fun with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Leo is only in his early thirties and has the potential to be the best actor of his generation.

Djimon Hounsou is great as well and deserved the Oscar nomination he got for his role here. The movie itself is more than just an action film, providing some food for thought.

No doubt many African nations have been torn asunder by civil war.  No doubt there have been horrendous atrocities.  And no doubt preteen boys have been literally snatched from the arms of their parents and turned into ruthless killers.  But when a movie, BLOOD DIAMOND, depicts all of the above in such a brutal, graphic nature, the question is begged:  Is it really that bad over there. . .or, perhaps, has there been a little embellishment?<br /><br />But I digress.  Whether the quest for a 'Mother Lode' diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone is slightly exaggerated in terms of its gratuitous, mind-numbing violence, the fact remains this movie is pause-everything-else-in-your-life riveting.  When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer--makes the viewer forget about everything else other than what he/she is watching on the screen--then cinema magic has been captured in a can.  So kudos to the always-innovative Edward Zwick:  His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.  By the time the credits were rolling I felt mentally and physically drained--and grandly entertained.<br /><br />As the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.  For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow; now he's morphing into an accomplished thespian right before our eyes.  I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).  And has Djimon Hounsou ever been lousy in a movie?  Absolutely not, and his portrayal of a fisherman trying to find and salvage his family is certainly no exception.  Jennifer Connelly looks good--even after a couple of nights in the jungle.  The on-screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.  In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.  And if not fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>This movie was on my watch list for quite a while.  Just think of the cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou and beautiful Jennifer Connelly.  It is a story about diamonds collected in Sierra Leone - scenery of Africa we have not seen since "Out of Africa movie" with all the cruelty it comes with: children oldiers, killings, white mercenaries from Rhodesia, South Afrika and other former colonies.  It is a story of greed, fatherly love and love in all the wrong places.  It is political satire (one minor character says at one moment  "We are lucky they did not find oil here - imagine what mess we would be in?") and also morality tale to about conflict that comes with beauty of the diamonds.  This is multi-dimensional movie and it does deserve the praise that it got at the Academy awards.  It is also fantasic to see two characters played by Leonardo and Djimon bond althought they could not be more different from any point of view.  Although difficult to watch at some moments, it is definitely a gem of a movie I have seen lately.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>Leo, Leo, Leo!  Beside being the sign of my Month, this a name of a brilliant actor in this movie.  He did one of the best job in his career. (Whats eating Gilbert)  I couldn't believe the acting of Leo and Djimon Hounsou.  Outstanding!  How Leo wanted that Diamond and how Djimon wanted his diamond (kid).  Both at all cost were doing everything they could within themselve to get what they wanted.  At times, both needed each other in some way to help them achieve what goal they had.  That was finding Djimon's kid and Leo's diamond.  I will say I was naive and didn't know the great extent to what goes through searching for diamonds.  After seeing this film, I can't believe how many blood was spill for small rocks that are worth to many.  It was a sad movie, but it had a great message of the "truth" coming out of this whole entire business that many lives were lost at the cost of what?  Humans that really couldn't defend themselve. Recommend everyone to watch this!  Love this Movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Blood Diamond' is an excellent adventure.  Skillfully intersecting the lives of three key figures, we get more than a soap box lecture from the liberal left.  Hardly preachy, the movie has natural developments and dialogue that are organic to the story and its delivery.  Some of the heart-stopping violence and the tender timeouts are testaments to fine timing and storytelling.  Meaningful throughout, we witness how greed and violence scar the lives and landscape of developing Africa.  However, the film would be a worthy experience even if it didn't have a message.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays a jaundiced diamond bounty hunter, Danny Archer, mentored by the military prowess of a commanding colonel since his late teens.  Despite the fact that his longevity should earn him fringe benefits, he gets an assignment meant to patch up a recently botched effort.  To get what he wants, he crosses the path of refugee, Solomon Venge (Djimon Hounsou), who is trying to reunite his family after sectarian violence has split them apart.  Solomon has found and hidden a huge rough diamond in the middle of his forced labor at a rebel camp, which Archer could use as the payback acquisition.  In the middle is liberal reporter, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly), who wants to make a difference in the region more than win a Pulizer Prize.  Archer meets her and finds she can assist him with reuniting Solomon's family.  For her part, she needs the inside scoop of the black market diamond trade.  She knows about greedy agents, like Archer, are trading arms for diamonds to fund the rebels' side of the civil war, but she needs proof.  It's a complex, yet captivating trade.  In between these developments, we see Solomon's own son being indoctrinated and taught (among many) to fight with submachine guns for the rebel forces.<br /><br />`Blood Diamond' may not always surprise, but it is filled with riveting adventure and harrowing battle scenes.  Urgent situations, anguishing details, and a connected plot construct a solid movie experience.  Pointedly, the film is meaningful.  The movie makes expert connections from the battles to the diamond trade to the jewelry store.  It also aligns the characters well.  In one emotional scene Archer and Bowen talk about his past, and we discover that he was made an orphan at an early age after civil war atrocities killed his parents.  Sometimes a few coincidences play too neatly into the hand of circumstance, but the exploitation and compelling chase scenes are presented genuinely enough.  DiCaprio's worthy Oscar nomination and fine supporting performances add to the cohesive story.  Even some of the cinematography is breathtaking enough to keep from taking the Third World for granted.  More than `Rambo' for liberals, `Blood Diamond' is a thoughtful and well-crafted movie experience with an important story to tell.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>Disclaimer first: if you are cheching this review for summary of script, you've come to the wrong place. I deal in impressions, not story-revealing.<br /><br />I saw it at opening evening, and it was a premiere sponsored by UNICEF. So the movie began with a long advertisement for UNICEF and UNHCR. Which is ridiculous, cuz if you have ever been to any of the conflict zones you KNOW that:<br /><br />1) UN staff mainly just take care of their safety and collection of danger pay<br /><br />2) UN staff (mission personnel and military involved in "peace keeping missions") are known for all sorts of misbehavior, from smuggling to raping children.<br /><br />Now that we have put that aside, let's go to the movie:<br /><br />First think that stroke me was the realism of the movie. Thanks to the multifaceted story, brilliant acting and excellent camera/ editing.<br /><br />The movie sucks you right in. I was jumping in the seat moaning "run run!!", I cried several times in the movie, I was shocked to see what happens in this "civilized" world we live in, I was embarassed to be complaining about "a bad day at work" or "dissatisfaction with life in general" I sometimes feel, I was happy to be born NOT in Africa (thou some might think Croatia is not THAT much better), I made a decision NEVER to buy another diamond, I was appaled at world business and all value being lost and forgotten apart from $$$.<br /><br />And that was one of the aims of this film, to make us reflect and adjust our behavior, and do our little thing to make world a better place.<br /><br />To this point, Connely says to DiCaprio "good things are done every day. just not by you". In the end, they both do good things. So can all of us.<br /><br />Kudos to casting director in this film. Thou I don't really like DiCaprio, he IS an excellent actor and he proves it from one movie to the next. In this one, his "Rhodesian" accent, the whole role of white boy in Africa /traumatized mercenary was compelling.<br /><br />Connelly in one of her better performances.<br /><br />Last but not least, Hounsou and Vosloo (oh he ages so good!).<br /><br />Cannot praise this film enough.<br /><br />Sorry about the long anti-UN rambling. Croatia has had its experience with them, so I kindda know what I am talking about..</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>"Blood Diamond" is a film that exposes harsh truths, in effect forcing the audience to get a taste of someone else's unpleasant reality. Specifically, it focuses on the buying and selling of blood diamonds, which are mined in war zones and secretly sold in order to finance an insurgent's war efforts. A majority of the story takes place in Sierra Leone, a small African country that actually directed the world's attention to blood diamonds in the late 1990s. The country was immersed in an intense civil war at that time, fueled by a militant band of rebels called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF for short) and their attempts to overthrow the government. Funding their efforts was an illegal diamond trade, one that forced many innocent people into becoming workers.<br /><br />This movie doesn't attempt to hide the brutality of that civil war; likewise, it doesn't spend long periods of time focusing on bloodshed. What it does is effectively tell a compelling human story that's just as touching as it is ugly. Taking place in 1999, the main character of the story is Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Sierra Leone native put to work in a diamond mine after the RUF destroys his village and forcefully separates him from his family. While digging up part of the riverbed, he finds a sizeable diamond chunk that has a slight pink tinge to it, something so rare and valuable that its sale could prolong the chaos. Solomon quickly decides to hide the diamond, burying it in a patch of land near the river.<br /><br />When the government's legitimate military force raids the area, Solomon is arrested on suspicion of being part of the RUF. In jail, he crosses paths with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a slick diamond smuggler with no regard for anyone's well being other than his own. He witnesses a shouting match between Solomon and an RUF soldier nicknamed Captain Poison (David Harwood), one that directly addresses the missing pink diamond. This peaks Archer's interest; he's looking for a way to finally leave Africa, a continent full of hatred, corruption, and despair, more so than even he can stand. He arranges for Solomon to be freed so that they may join forces, find the diamond, and save Solomon's family. Unfortunately, it's a dishonest union; Archer is merely using Solomon as a way to obtain the diamond. He has no feelings whatsoever for a refugee family.<br /><br />At least, he initially doesn't. As the film progresses, some of Archer's layers peel away, gradually revealing a moral compass that isn't as off course as one might think. We come to see him as someone who's been hurt a few too many times, preventing him from pursuing an honest life. American journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is trying to reach that side of Archer in order to expose the atrocities occurring within Sierra Leone. In her own way, she's just as manipulative as Archer; she can't write about the corrupt diamond industry unless she has proof, and she can't get any proof without Archer's help. She needs him in order to write a good story. This is somewhat hypocritical when considering her disapproval over Solomon's treatment: "I'm using him, and you're using me," says Archer, "and that is the way it works."<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's truth to that statement, one of the many aforementioned harsh truths that are brought to light. It's refreshing for a film like "Blood Diamond" to present them, especially since it can offer a way to learn about something consumers take for granted. The three characters also have learning experiences, in one form or another. Archer probably has the greatest one; Solomon briefly reunites with his family at the fence of a refugee camp, only to learn that his young son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) has been taken by the RUF. While seeing this does little to diminish Archer's desire to possess the hidden diamond, that one moment of love and anguish still leaves an impression, one that enables a better understanding of Solomon's determination.<br /><br />His desperate feelings are easy to understand from the audience's point of view, and they're completely validated in scenes involving Dia and Captain Poison. They're effectively uncomfortable to watch; the young boy is slowly being brainwashed into believing as the RUF do. Captain Poison immediately takes Dia under his wing in order to make him easier to manipulate. He and other children undergo rigorous training, most of which include the use of firearms. I distinctly remember one moment when Dia is blindfolded and handed a machine gun. He's then obeys the order to pull the trigger. When he removes the blindfold, he realizes that he killed a refugee purposely put in the line of fire.<br /><br />There are many such moments in this film, all of which are unpleasant but nonetheless relevant. The violence and inhumanity is quick, raw, and ugly: many are shot dead; an RUF soldier severs the right hand of a young boy; Captain Poison injects Dia with some kind of drug, presumably heroine. They act as counterpoints to the belief that humans are inherently good at heart; Solomon believes that his son is still the good soul he was before he was captured. "You'll be a doctor someday," he often said to young Dia, who would go to school everyday, even when he didn't quite feel up to it. There's a perfect balance at work here, informing the audience with a mixture of disturbing imagery and enlightening moments of compassion and understanding.<br /><br />As Archer, Solomon, and Maddy continue their journey, this understanding grows deeper. The uncertainty grows, as well: Solomon may never reunite with his family; Archer may never find that precious diamond; Maddy's scoop on Sierra Leone's diamond trade may forever be unprinted; the RUF may continue to rule with an iron fist. How ironic that their motto was: "No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People." It makes one wonder whether or not they understood the power of their words, especially since they used them to encourage both acts of violence and undeserved loyalty. "Blood Diamond" does a wonderful job of examining this complex belief system, something that for many years was the reality for the people of Sierra Leone. I'm thankful for having seen this film; it's an eye-opening depiction of a real life crisis, one that a lot people have yet to learn about.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The screenplay of "Blood Diamond" may not be the best of the year, but it is certain that the strong performances from the leading stars are one of the greatest in the year 2006. Like many of the recent films shot in Africa such as "Hotel Rwanda" or "Tsotsi," Edward Zwick's film, which is set against the background of the civil war in Sierra Leone back in 1999, has a strong message or two about the present condition of Africa.<br /><br />The film's story doesn't need a lengthy summery; it is after all about two characters: South African-born mercenary-turned diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a father and fisherman living in Sierra Leone abducted by a rebel army RUF (Revolutionary United Front). You will see these two people connected by one big, pink rock, a precious diamond hidden somewhere in the land of civil war-torn Sierra Leona.<br /><br />The strongest part of the film is, as I said, the acting from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, both truly in character. Jennifer Connelly also appears as journalist Maddy Bowen and Arnold Vosloo as "Colonel," but the film belongs to the two, DiCaprio and Hounsou. The locations of Africa are also spectacular and realistic with the photography of Eduardo Serra ("Girl with a Pearl Earring"), something you can see nowhere but in this land.<br /><br />Still I must say "Blood Diamond" is not perfect, like any other films. One weakness is its script with too many coincidences and familiar plot devices. Actions are powerful with guns and explosions, but these actions may be a little too powerful for the film to stress more effectively the immediate and complex issues in Africa. In fact, in "Blood Diamond" you find more than one serious issues - one about diamonds and other natural resources, or about the child soldiers, for instance - but they are overshadowed by the often melodramatic storytelling, which in itself is strong, but could have been better with a more restrained approach.<br /><br />Still "Blood Diamond" shines with two excellent performances. It is flawed, but worth buying now.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>There are some persons who may be naive enough to think that Africa really isn't like how it is depicted in this movie.  It is.  All these African countries are in constant states of war, civil war, military coups & general unrest.  Darfur gets a lot of publicity, but it is hardly the only place in Africa that is in crisis.  Genocide is pretty much the norm for most countries, and a perpetual state of chaos is commonplace.  Only place in Africa I'd like to visit someday would be Egypt to see the Pyramids.  However, that won't be anytime soon w/all this terrorist nonsense.<br /><br />  The cast of BD was excellent.  I've always had a crush on Jennifer Connelly.  She has gone from being a young pretty face to being a very accomplished actress (and she's still a pretty face!).  Djimon Hounsou has a very powerful screen presence (and not just because he is buffed up!).  As was the case in GLADIATOR and AMISTAD, he is able to convey a lot of emotion through very few words.<br /><br />Thankfully, for myself, I've never been into diamonds.  Never have bought one, and very much doubt I ever will.  For people who have indulged in diamonds, this film might be a shocking (and not so pleasant) eye-opener of where your diamonds actually come from.  In any case, it is truly a poignant film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I've gotten more comfortable admitting that DiCaprio is a good actor.  I must say that with this film more than others his heart seemed to be into it, not just his talent.  Hounsou is brilliant, and I hope to see him in many more productions.  Connelly was not stellar in this film.  I realize her character was supposed to come across a bit detached, but it translated more as a lack of chemistry between her DiCaprio, and even Hounsou.  I tend to think that when you are dealing with such charged subject matter that the acting doesn't have to compensate on any level, but this character/role is an example of how that is not true.  I failed to see her character's humanity, while in the other two characters, Archer and Vandy, I got very emotionally and psychologically caught up in them.  The premise of the story is volatile from the beginning, and the plot supports that momentum all the way through.  The film raises many questions about the world's involvement with and repulsion of Africa, no stone unturned.  For that reason alone I am glad to see such provocative probing of the western subconscious cast onto the silver screen.  That we see this mirror held up in a huge budget Hollywood production is great contradiction, one that I thought of often throughout the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Blood Diamond is one of the finest films of the year.

Strictly for the selfish reason of finding the stone, Archer helps the man, Solomon Vandy, to escape, and together, they seek Vandy's scattered family and the diamond even while being hunted by all three sides in Sierra Leone's hideous civil war, the Sierra Leone government, the rebels, and troops of white mercenaries who veer between roles as protectors, liberators and pirates with evil ease.<br /><br />Archer and Vandy's odyssey is marked by all the nightmares of the conflict: rape squads, child soldiers, slavery, random pointless slaughter and destruction, and mayhem mutilation as punishment. The unfortunate victims had hands, feet, limbs, their tongues or their eyes removed for any reason at all or no reason at the whim of whatever group was choosing to victimize them.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly plays an American journalist reporting on the stories of this largely unknown killing field. The beautiful Connelly plays her role convincingly, but she's an insufficient distraction against a backdrop in which almost no one seems to have a higher motive than their own greed, their own survival, or their own aggrandizement.<br /><br />BLOOD DIAMOND is masterfully made and presented, but it suffers from an overly formulaic approach, constantly reminding the viewer that the conflict diamond genocide is an important issue. This is a "message" movie, and while it IS an important message, the viewer is left both ultimately troubled and impotent. Yes, this is a horror . . . but it seems there's nothing we can do.<br /><br />As Connelly says at one moment: "Why would I risk my story just to help a single person . . . ?

He is a man with no wife, no children and since the murder of his parents, no country. Now in search of a fabulous diamond that rumor says was buried in the jungle by enforced laborer Solomon Vandy (Djimon Housou), Danny promises that he will help Solomon find his missing family if he shows him where the diamond is located. Solomon agrees and the dangerous journey begins.<br /><br />`Blood Diamond' released in '06 is a taut, well executed action/adventure, drama starring two of the best actors in the business today, Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Housnsou. Add to the mix the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly as journalist Maddy Bowen and you have an enjoyable evening of viewing ahead.<br /><br />My rating: 4 ? Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>What was happening in Sierra Leone circa 1999 was maddeningly ignored by the world at large, as warring factions fought for control of the country's lucrative diamond mines and the worldwide diamond monopoly exploitated and manipulated the situation to keep their grip on the market secure, at the cost of the country's stability and the lives of thousands of Africans.  Just ask Danny Archer (Leonardo Dicaprio).  Even though Archer is a fictional fortune hunter dashing arcoss Sierra Leone to cash in on the chaotic diamond trade, his revelations to crusading journalist Manny bowen (Jennifer Connelly) of greed and capitolism run amok are startling and they help lend moral resonance to a film that is otherwise a thrilling two and a half hour chase through the African bush.<br /><br />Archer, an experienced oppurtunist, is desparate to escape Africa and he finds his shot when, imprisoned for diamond smuggling, he overhears fellow prisoner Solomon Vandy (Djimon Houson) being grilled by a wounded rebel general about the whereabouts of a large and rare pink diamond.  Archer breaks Vandy out of prison and the two (along with Connelly's Bowen) sprint around the countryside to find where Vandy stashed the diamond, a mutual argreement since Archer wants out of Africa and Vandy wants to reconnect with his vanished family.  Vandy, who is played with immense passion by Houson, is a fisherman who lost track of his family when his village was raided by rebel soldiers, including child soldiers brandishing AK-47's bought from the illicit diamond trade.  Vandy's wife and daughters escape to a refugee camp but his son is captured by rebel soldiers and indoctrinated into the army.  The brutal abuse and brainwashing of child soldiers and the violence inflicted on civilians by all warring factions is portrayed with unflinching and devastating realism by director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai), whose vision of total war in Africa is augmented greatly by cinematographer Eduardo Serra (Girl with a Pearl Earring) and editor Steven Rosenblum, a Zwick favorite.  The images of Vandy's son killing rebel prisoners blindfolded, shooting heroin and giving in to the serpentine manipulation of his demented commander is heartbreaking, all a consequence of the continuing war that large Diamond corporations and monopolies have a stake in continuing and Archer has a stake in exploiting.<br /><br />The film's themes and imagery haunt because of the superb acting from the trio of leads (Dicaprio, Connelly and Houson) that carry the entire film.  Dicaprio has the trickiest role of a rougish and amorous soldier of fortune willing to sell out anyone and anything to acheive his goals, and he tears into the role with a confidence and maturity that is worlds away from "Titanic" and even his early work with Martin Scorcese.  He's charismatic, cunning and lethal, and perhaps this constitutes the finest work he has ever done.  Connelly takes what would have been a throw-away part as a moralistic journalist and energizes it with undiluted moral anger and indignation, harboring no illusions to how hard exposing the story of blood diamonds and the beneficiaries will be.  Houson is pure power and passion as a father pushed to edge, who will trek through the hellish countryside of Sierra Leone to find his family.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is not an easy film to watch.  The violence is unrelenting and shattering and the amoral greed disheartening.  Even the most uplifting aspects of the film are haunted by the chance that something like Sierra Leone may very well happen again.  It is true that "Blood Diamond" is a dynamite chase film, and it is entertaining on that front, but it is the theme of global greed coldly manipulating nations and lives for profit and the imagery of savage total war and child soldiers that is impossible to shake.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>You should know that, first and foremost, Blood Diamond is an action/adventure movie, complete with astounding escapes, chases, implausible coincidence, violence, and the like.  It is also very well done on that level, with Edward Zwick ably handling the pure adrenaline rush of the action.<br /><br />But Zwick's film is also set in the context of the tragedy of conflict diamonds amidst civil war, and the horror seemingly endlessly perpetrated upon poor civilian populations by "men with guns", or in this instance, often "children with guns".<br /><br />What can one say about the misery of so much of Africa?  So much of the world, really.  When confronted by the seeming contradictions of life in war torn Sierra Leone, discos and rap music and hand amputations and 10 year olds with AK-47's, one character's answer is "TIA" i.e. "This is Africa".<br /><br />The diamond trade is not happy with this film, and I can see why.  The fact that the  monopoly controls the market so effectively to keep the price up, and the fact that such an easily tranportable wealth means keeping "conflict diamonds", the blood diamonds of the title, from supplying the arms for more violence over their control near impossible. When the journalist, played by Jennifer Connelly, says "if people knew the cost of a diamond is an arm, they wouldn't buy them" I wondered if that were so.<br /><br />I think the sorrow of the film is heightened by the natural beauty of the place, filmed wonderfully.  The cast is fine.  Leonardo DeCaprio is very good here.  Djimon Housou brings an inherent dignity to his role, one that seems to be present in all his work.  Jennifer Connelly always embodies intelligence along with her beauty (and I don't know how she manages to get even better looking as time goes on, but she does).<br /><br />A very fast and furious action film with a lot of other things on its mind, I found the film well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I have never been a `huge' fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. Something about every one of his performances seems so calculated and unnatural. Yes, I realize every actor is `acting', but DiCaprio always seems like he is acting and is unable to take it that extra step and make it more believable.<br /><br />Watching first "The Departed" and now "Blood Diamond" has changed my conception of DiCaprio.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) works hard as a fisherman in his small village, trying to provide for his family and ensure his son, Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) goes to school. He wants his son to grow up and be a doctor. Walking his son home, Solomon notices a caravan of three vehicles overloaded with gun toting revolutionaries headed into his village. They immediately begin shooting and Solomon runs to his family, to protect them and get them to safety. But then he is caught. Instead of cutting his hands off, the leader of the revolutionary forces decides he would be better off working in the diamond mines. There, Solomon witnesses acts of brutality meant to keep any of the workers from stealing from the revolution. But Solomon finds a large pink diamond and realizes it will be worth a lot of money. He manages to hide it just before government forces invade and takes them all to jail. In jail, the commander starts yelling about Solomon's pink diamond and Danny Archer (DiCaprio), a diamond smuggler, believes the story. He soon makes Solomon his number one project and gets him released, trying to persuade him to give him the pink diamond. The more people who find out about it, the more their lives are in danger. In town, Danny meets Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist investigating conflict diamonds. She knows who Danny is and realizes he could be the break she needs for the story. He also recognizes how Maddy could help them. And Solomon realizes he can use the diamond to get his family back, provided they are still alive.<br /><br />I have only grazed the surface of the story in Edward Zwick's ("Glory", "The Last Samurai") new film "Blood Diamond"; that rare thing in Hollywood, and exciting message film that actually teaches us about the events behind the story.<br /><br />Zwick is a very good director. His films deal with complicated subjects in an exciting way, making them accessible to the masses of people who frequent multiplexes, but also illuminate these subjects, making them interesting to the same people who are taking a break from shopping at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch. Because he is able to deal with complicated subjects, and still make the characters interesting and the story accessible, his films are much better for it. People are more likely to retain information and knowledge if they are enjoying themselves or their interest is held. I can't say watching "Blood Diamond" is `fun', but it is well-made, exciting and holds your interest. One woman in the audience gasped audibly many times during the more shocking and graphic moments.<br /><br />DiCaprio has had a very strong year. First, he portrayed undercover agent Billy Costigan in Marin Scorcese's "The Departed" and now he plays Rhodesian diamond smuggler Danny Archer. Danny is a complex character. He is out for himself, always, because he is number one. Everything he does in his life is designed to somehow help him. Every relationship, every word he speaks, every move he makes is calculated to somehow get him money or advance his career. He has a network of people who assist him, but he can't trust them and realizes the only reason they are involved in his life is because of money. Gradually, throughout the film, we learn a little bit about his life and his upbringing. Danny hasn't had an easy life and this information makes the character all the more interesting and intriguing.<br /><br />The two people he meets over the course of the film are both pawns in his game to get more money. To a diamond smuggler, the very thought of a large pink diamond, the type Solomon has found, is too much. He simply can't pass up the chance to try and find it and make it his. He starts to manipulate Solomon into revealing the whereabouts of the hidden diamond.<br /><br />But Solomon isn't stupid and recognizes Danny for what he is. As strong as DiCaprio is, Hounsou is better. From the first moments with his son, Hounsou shows us Solomon's dedication to his family. He loves them and every waking moment is spent providing for them and helping to make his children's life better. As soon as he sees the revolutionaries speeding towards his village, he knows he has to do something. Their presence will not be good news for the people. After he goes to work at the diamond mine, he witnesses how brutal these people are, yet, as soon as he finds the pink diamond, he has an opportunity and he takes it, realizing this rare stone could help him.<br /><br />As soon as Danny enters his life, Solomon knows what he wants, despite what the man tells him. Initially reluctant, Solomon comes to realize he can use Danny to help him. Danny is so set upon his goal, that Solomon can use this determination to help him get closer and closer to the diamond.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou has been in some impressive films, but this performance is heads and shoulders above the rest. Every moment he just exudes the determination we feel in Solomon; his number one goal is to get his family back and will do anything to make that happen.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is less interesting as Maddy Bowen. As a journalist, she makes it a practice to travel to conflict situations in foreign countries, and get to the root of the story. Other journalists make comments about her ability to get in and out of these dangerous places with nary a scratch. So it is not surprising that Danny finds her in this part of Africa, as a civil war rages. Because of this ability, she writes for some high profile magazines and newspapers, her voice is heard. The most interesting thing about her is that she is certainly no angel either.<br /><br />As soon as she meets Danny, Maddy realizes he is the key to her new expose and needs the information he has to break the story wide open. She is willing to get that information at any cost. She helps Danny and Solomon, seduces Danny, uses her connections to get Solomon some help and more. Because she is willing to go to these lengths, her character is much more interesting. But in the end, Connelly has difficulty making this character anything more than a third wheel. So much of the story is about Danny and Solomon that Maddy is little more than a supporting character whenever she shows up.<br /><br />"Diamond" is filled with some terrific, exciting action scenes. Danny and Solomon are never allowed to rest for long and are frequently on the move, from Danny's former military commander, Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo, "The Mummy") and many other people, all of whom want that diamond to support their cause. Some of these scenes are so realistic looking it is amazing people weren't harmed during their filming.<br /><br />But "Diamond" also wants to get its message across and Zwick manages this with ease. Through brief exchanges and short montages, we learn the path these diamonds take to retail shops, the efforts people take to get them from the mines and why they are so important to these various groups, what they end up funding and more. These moments are fully integrated into the story and are usually quite brief, it seems like every time two characters start talking they are interrupted by bullet fire or an ambush or some type of action. Because the story keeps moving, and we are kept on our toes, we are entertained by every aspect of the film. This is a much different approach than some other filmmakers use (Spike Lee and Oliver Stone, I'm looking at you...). Other filmmakers are more likely to compose a series of monologues for their characters, in an effort to get the message across, but in the end, their messages just sound preachy and we don't really learn anything from the film. In the end, it is much more effective to provide an entertaining message, which will help the audience retain what you are getting across. Believe me, many of the images and events of "Blood Diamond" are seared on my mind.<br /><br />"Blood Diamond" is a very good film, featuring great performances from DiCaprio and Hounsou (if he isn't nominated for an Oscar, the awards are meaningless) and presents an entertaining story with memorable facts about one of the less known problems in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Edward Zwick delivers the goods with BLOOD DIAMOND, a tense and very compelling film about the greed and bloodshed that surround the diamond industry of Sierra Leone.  Though a bit too long at two and a half hours the story is not only a dramatically viable one for a film, but it also has much to say about human interaction and the sanctity of friendship.<br /><br />Solomon Bo (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman who becomes indentured to the evil men who search for diamonds after being separated form his family and in the course of working for the vile men who are in the illegal diamond industry he discovers a huge pink diamond and hides it form the overseers. He is caught, jailed, and while imprisoned he is observed by a Rhodesian white man Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who discovers Solomon's secret and arranges for him to be released from prison with money to salvage his life.  However, we discover that Danny is in the black market end of the diamond trade and Danny promises Solomon he will get his family back for him if Solomon shares the hidden pink diamond. A journalist Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) finds Danny and recognizes a good resource for a revealing article about the diamond trade.  Danny and Maddy form an alliance: the rest of the film consists of the chases to recover the diamond with Danny and Solomon bonding and attempting to avoid every manner of interloper.<br /><br />The performances by DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly are superb but there are also fine performances in the smaller roles filled with such actors as Michael Sheen, Kagiso Kuypers, Benu Mabhena, Jimi Mistry, and Stephen Collins.  The cinematography by Eduardo Serra manages to capture the beauty of the country as well as the horror of the battles.  But in the end it is Zwick (The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, etc) who transforms the screenplay by Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell into an intelligent and engrossing film.  Recommended.  Grady Harp, March 07</p></br></body></html>

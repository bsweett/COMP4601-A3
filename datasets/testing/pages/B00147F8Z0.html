The resulting distress call from the Predator's craft brings a Predator to clean up the mess, and the scene is set for death and destruction all round.  It's not a bad set up, with the situation rife with opportunities for suspense and horror - all of them wasted thanks to insipid casting and a script that a standard teen-slasher movie sequel would be happy to have.  What happened to the subtlety of characterization of Alien and Aliens, and even Alien 3?<br />We have the young girl in need of rescue by mother like figure (remember Aliens?), the scene when the escaping humans flee in an army vehicle (remember Aliens?), humans woefully unequipped against their foe but fighting back nonetheless (remember Alien 3?)... in fact, all through the movie you will look at the scenes and say `Oh yeah, I remember how well that was done in the original..', and while the effort at referencing is appreciated for fans, the effect is to make sure you are never invested in this movie, merely reminiscing on the previous ones.<br />There are a precious few moments of originality which speak to what the movie might have been - the titular stand off is pretty well done, though by its nature it is devoid of human drama, and the best scene is seeing the shadow of an alien as it enters a gaggle of baby's in a maternity ward.  Also, the score is effective, bringing back a mixture of both music and sound effects from previous movies.  The gore element is back, avoiding the shallow feeling we got from the first AVP.  Shockingly however, whatever meager entertainment value the movie has are reduced substantially by the very dark low contrast lighting, which renders most action scenes fairly incomprehensible.  Even the daytime shots setting the scene, appear dark.<br />Above all, the film is mercifully fairly brief at only 96 minutes...<br />I'd love to review the extras here - all I can say is they are wonderfully plentiful and appear exhaustive from the lost - but truth be told I was too exhausted from the movie to touch them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>I should have learned my lesson the first time around. After the dismal first pairing of these two modern-day Horror/Sci-Fi icons failed to deliver, I should have realized that an unexpected sequel would do any better. However, this second time around does do better than it's first, but not enough to stop wishing for either an Alien 5 or Predator 3.<br /><br />Like a page from Casting 101, you have the typical parade of careless characters:The bad boy with brother, the sympathic cop, the solider coming home, and various family members searching for the rest of their clan. There's no time, or need, to care about them, but you figure you'd care about what's going to get them, being the A's and the P's. But honestly after a total of seven movies showing what these monsters do, you can't really be surprised like the first couple of times. Now granted, the Unrated version, of which I'm reviewing here, has a ton of graphic scenes, just how many times can a chest-burster or acid blood be impressive? And for a gore-hound like me to be actually bored with this should tell you something. And if that wasn't the worst of it, the Alien/Predator attacks happen mostly at night, and it looks like in the complete dark as well. 80% of all the scenes are so dark, it's hard to tell what you're looking at. And finally, it's ending is supposed to be some sort of prequel to either the original Alien or Predator films (according to the directors' commentary), but honestly I couldn't place how that could be.<br /><br />In my opinion, only to be viewed by die-hard fans of either franchise, or the seven people who found the first film entertaining. Oh, I almost forgot: remember the underwhelming "more human than Alien" Alien at the end of Alien:Resurrection? Well, if you can turn your brightness control high enough on your set, you'll see this film's equivalent, the PredAlien!!!<br /><br />Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:5.5/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>In all films I have seen, including horror, there is an unwritten rule: men and maybe some women can be killed, but kids and dogs survive.  AVP Requiem ends that rule.  The aliens who invade a rural Colorado town act like aliens, and there are some mighty disturbing scenes.  DO NOT let anyone with an infant, or if they are pregnant, SEE THIS MOVIE.  This rule-breaking made the movie more gripping and realistic.  The alien beasts are great, but the human acting left much to be desired.<br /><br />The film is so dark, that even with only one light on, I could not see what was going on.  You need to turn off all your lights, and even then, you squint at parts.<br /><br />The blood really flows in this one, and the Predator is fantastic.  I sincerely hope that this "Requiem" will not be the last.  The way the movie ended leaves it wide open for a third one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>In 1986 Director James Cameron made the first sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien</a>...and Cameron's sequel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE">Aliens</a> was even better than the original (and appears on my Amazon Listmania list of Flicks Guaranteed to Leave a Permanent Impression). In all there were <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">4 Alien movies</a>.<br /><br />Then in 1987 Jon McTiernan made one of the best movies ever with Arnold Schwarzenegger called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator</a>. In 1990 a fair at best <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BGWR8">Predator sequel</a> followed, but gave us our first teaser glimpse of a possible Alien versus Predator movie in the form of an Alien's skull in a Predator's trophy case.<br /><br />In 1989 Dark Horse originally merged the two franchises into a comic book, and in the 90s the video game industry took a bunch of stabs at Alien versus Predator action games.<br /><br />We finally got the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04P6">Alien Vs. Predator</a> feature film in 2004 from Paul Anderson, a video game to movie specialist. And it wasn't *that* bad. It's major flaw came at the end when a mutated Alien hatched from a Predator. Why flawed you say? Because the parasitic Alien race was unique by planting its eggs within a host, but it didn't mean that the Aliens took on the attributes of the host, right?<br /><br />Strangely, it is this flawed concept that visual effects masters turned directors The Strause Brothers latched onto and built a movie around with AVP: Requiem. But the flaws don't end there with AVP: Requiem. There are flaws o'plenty, technical and theatrical. The acting is horrible and the film uses recycled line after line from the Alien and Predator films that preceded it.<br /><br />AVP: Requiem's story starts out pretty good, but quickly falls apart. There are story continuity issues (like the miraculously short time between human "infection" and swarms of Aliens appearing), and a there's a cast that seems like the rejects from some failed WB TV show that just can't pull off any semblance of believability in their performances.<br /><br />AVP: Requiem's worst fault is that it is dark and you can hardly see the action. What James Cameron did in Aliens was awesome; he gave you an in your face, up close look at the creatures that in the 1979 original were mostly hidden in the shadows. The Strause Brothers once again latched on to the wrong concept; instead of taking Cameron's lead and showing us the creatures, they took the 1979 idea of darkness and put us in *advanced* darkness. What's the point of a Blu Ray disc if you can't see anything???<br /><br />AVP: Requiem fails miserably where Cameron excelled...Cameron gave you a movie that you could *watch*...The Strause Brothers gave us one we can't...for more reasons than just the darkness.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Alien vs Predator (AVP)-Requiem was a two star film which had five star special effects.  I agree with the previous comment that the action scenes were a bit dark and hard to see, although this was true of the first Alien and did not ruin that film.<br /><br />A few firsts were scored which I think crossed the line for explicit gore and screen violence. The AVP series targets die-hard fans of the Alien vs Predator magazine.  It is hard to say AVPR "crossed the line" when the original Alien was so explicit, but seldom do we see violence done to children, and as a parent it really bothered me.<br /><br />I will not be ruining the film for anybody by writing that the setting of the story was a small town in Colorado where what happened was exactly what Ripley feared the most.  The Alien manages to land on Earth and very quickly multiples. You can imagine what happens next.<br /><br />I really never expected to see Ripley's nightmare on film, and suppose I should appreciate someone trying to bring it to the screen. In this film the Alien was (sort of) under the supervision of the Predator who attempted to eliminate it while having some good clean Predator fun.<br /><br />The second AVP film tried to recapture the successful elements of Aliens, right down to stealing some of the lines outright, screeching sound effects of Aliens under fire, the presence of soldiers with massive firepower and plenty of face huggers to go around.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie but have to admit that after 25 years of the Alien legacy it is starting to grow thin. I would really like to see someone produce a serious film of the Ripley scenario and portray what happens in a sequel to Alien-Resurrection, in which only the Alien is permitted to contaminate the Earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>We had mixed feelings for this latest movie. If you could mix and match both films, you could probably find a true Blockbuster hit film somewhere.<br /><br />But, as is, both films failed in certain ways when it comes to acting and directing and screenplays. Hollywood just can't seem to find directors nowadays to take this franchise into the stratosphere monetarily as it could. What, is there no Ridley Scott's or James Cameron's out there?<br /><br />But after reading the last two books of both franchise's - this movie started to look better. It actually has a bloody solid look to it, especially in terms of the twin alien creatures battling. It was the human cast of actors and horrible dialogue that truly threw this off the A-scale film it should have been.<br /><br />At least it was R-rated as it should be. And it did show scenes of pretty coolness, along with something different in terms of mixed creature feature - an alien mixed with a Predator! And he was pretty damn cool!<br /><br />Hopefully, someone in Hollywoodland, either a blooded director, or a young and intelligent director that knows what needs to be done, both in stronger screenplays and better actors, will come along and take this franchise where it truly belongs.<br /><br />Brothers Strauss did a good job, but not greatness like the first two feature films. Are all the great directors gone...?</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>*This does contain spoilers*<br /><br />Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem. I was crazy excited about seeing this. The trailer made the movie look amazing. It looked like somebody finally got it right. AVP was finally going to have a film in the versus franchise that lived up to the Alien and Predator films. So did it wind up being able to deliver? More importantly...was it better than the first(and might I add, awful) AVP film? The short answer...is not really.<br /><br />The film pretty much begins right where the original AVP left off with the alien bursting out of the chest of the main predator(you know, the one who teamed up...with a human) from the last film. That alien winds up being a crossbreed. A predalien(or alienator), if you will. This new breed of alien is let loose on this predator ship and winds up killing every predator on board. The ship winds up crashing on earth(somewhere in Colorado, if I remember right) thanks to all the mayhem. The facehuggers that the predators had been keeping on the ship(for research, I would assume) escape and well...do what they do best. The last surviving predator from the ship that crashed manages to send out a distress signal right before he's killed off. This signal gets sent to the predator homeworld where it manages to reach one of the most skilled and impressive predators ever. That predator winds up coming to earth to even the odds and teach those aliens a lesson. Since it takes place on earth, you know some humans are bound to get in the crossfire.<br /><br />So...where do I begin? I think one of the biggest drawbacks in this film is that it focuses way too much on the humans. I mean, does anybody really care about some teenager whose brother is an ex-con and is back in town while he works at a pizza place and has the hots for some girl? It's an ALIEN versus PREDATOR movie. Just show me them beating each other to a pulp and I'll be happy. You can dump the humans for all I care because if they're in the picture it looks like we have the option of them teaming up with the predator(s) or having to deal with some side story of teenagers swimming at the school pool. Psh. Lame. Somebody mentioned that AVP isn't going to be done right unless it all takes place in space and at this point, I tend to agree.<br /><br />The film was way too dark during the fight scenes. The random close-ups didn't really help either. Half the time, you didn't really know what was going on. Some of the CG scenes bugged me, too. It bugged me in Alien 3 and it bugs me now. I'm really picky with my CG effects though. I tend to like it to look as real as possible and when it's noticeably fake, it just seems cheesy to me. At least when they use animatronics or puppets, it looks a bit more realistic.<br /><br />The film left me with way too many questions. Too many to remember, actually. Here are a few: Why did the predator skin Ray and not use that blue goo on him to make him disintegrate? I was thinking he might have ran out...but then in the next scene, he used more of it. Was he just showing off his kill? Maybe he was making a statement?  Speaking of Ray, wasn't he skinned after the predator killed him? So that thing the sheriff said about Ray being, "skinned alive," was false then...<br /><br />Not only that, but some of the scenes seemed to be a blatant opening for the audience to make fun of them. Remember that scene where that pregnant woman was in the hospital? The dialogue went a little something like this:<br /><br />Pregnant woman: "Oh! I think my water just broke!"<br />Nurse: "Alright, I'll go and get you a doctor."<br /><br />Then the nurse walks out of the room...and gets killed by the predalien. Then you see the predalien walk up to the curtain and brush it aside. I just kept waiting for somebody to say, "The doctor will see you now," and the predalien saying something like, "What seems to be the problem?" Watch that scene again. You'll see what I'm talking about. Another one was at the end after the helicopter crash, when the little girl says to her mom, "Are the monsters gone, mommy?" And Kelly says, "They're all gone, baby," or something to that affect. I could just hear someone in a theater yelling, "Kind of like your dad! BURN!" And lastly...the "GET TO THE CHOPPER!" scene. Come on. Total throwback to Arnold yelling that in the original Predator. Wound up being more humorous than a homage to it though.<br /><br />My last gripe about the film are the noises the aliens and predator made. The predator howl/scream/yell/cry/whatever you want to call it sounded off. It sounded like a lion roar this time around. It sounded more raw, more...primal in the previous films. Continuity would be nice here, you know? The aliens sounded kinda weird, too. During the scene where they attack the national guard and they're screaming, their sound just sounded like an elephant only in a higher pitch. I didn't notice anything like that in the previous films. So that's saying something.<br /><br />Now with all the bad, there is a little bit of good in this film. The aliens and the predators have never looked so awesome. The costumes and make-up effects are pretty astounding. Also, what you can make out during the fight scenes is pretty sweet. That predator with the whip is quite impressive. That's really all I can say about him. The last forty five minutes or so of the film is where it finally picks up and is decent. If the rest of the film was like that, I would have been much more pleased.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, it was a disappointment overall. I had pretty high hopes though. I had told myself after the last AVP that I wouldn't get my hopes up again, but...I did. What can I say? I'm a sucker for this franchise. If it's any better than the original AVP, then it's only by a very small margin. It'd just be nice to see an AVP film that fans of the Alien and Predator films could be happy with and unfortunate that we can throw another crummy AVP movie to the pile.<br /><br />Rating: 5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I had reiewed AVP:R not too long ago after I watched it in the theatre, and I have never reviewed a film on Blu-Ray before, but I felt AVP:R on Blu-Ray would make a positive review for this movie that has never-ending bashing by probably 7/10 people.  True this film is a real disspointment to the overall Alien and Predator genre, but that isn't due to the Aliens and Predator in this film, in fact, they are what save it.  They look better than ever, provide some excellent action and decent scares, and the Pred-Alien is a great addition to keep things fresh.  It's the humans that ruined it (can't we at least get one decent actor here?) and their forgettable plots.  Oh yes, and the fact that those good scenes featuring the Aliens and Predator are always so darned dark.  Oh wait, that's where Blu-Ray can help.  Yes, those scenes are always going to be annoyingly dark at times, but Blu can make the most of it.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray disc is actully an excellent transfer of video quality.  The films look pristine for the most part, and is a much less fuzzy picture than the fist AVP film on Blu-Ray.  Ironically, the dark scenes in that film just got too fuzzy, but the dark scenes in AVP:R (which are more abundant) remain pretty clear.  Yes they are still dark, but I found myself seeing things at home I missed in the theatre.  Of course it helps is you have a nice television set that displays HD and you watch this at night in the dark, but hey, if you don't mind the effort, you can actually make out what is going on in the film.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray disc also features the unrated edition, which isn't anything to get overworked for.  It contains a few more minutes of gore, but nothing any more exciting than what is available in the theatrical release.<br /><br />Ok, so AVP:R still has it problem spots, but at least if you can afford to watch it on Blu-Ray go ahead, cause one of those problem spots can be remedied.  And that Predator is still one bad dude.<br /><br />Action: 4<br />Acting: 1.5<br />Blu Ray Audio: 4<br />Blu-Ray Video: 4.5<br />Characters: 1<br />Gore: 4<br />Horror: 3<br />Story: 1</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>The second AVP feature film fared little better than the first film from a critical standpoint  Part of the problem with the AVP films is living up to the success and acclaim of the solo films.  Fox seems almost in a no-win situation with the series in trying to produce a film that is faithful to both franchises.  AVP Requiem picks up where the first film left off although seeing the first isn't a prerequisite.  Aboard a Predator ship, a Chestburster alien explodes out of the body of a fallen Predator.  This mutant grows into an Alien/Predator hybrid--A Predalien!  It has the mandibles, dreadlocks, and coloring of a Predator but the rest of the body is Xenomorph.<br /><br />It attacks the lone Predator onboard, causing him to misfire his shoulder laser, blowing a hole in the ship's hull, and forcing a crash landing in a remote part of the Colorado wilderness, near a small town called Gunnison.  Before he dies, the Predator sends out a distress signal and soon a lone Hunter returns to Earth to find the destroyed ship.  Putting on the dead Predator's mask he is able to see a replay of the last several minutes of his life.  The Predalien has escaped into the wilderness and a couple of Facehuggers have impregnated an unfortunate hunter and his son.  The Predalien shows many different traits than other Aliens.  It is able to use its mandibles to force its embryos down its victim's throats, resulting in not one, but several Chestbursters being born.  This ability is on visceral display as the Predalien turns the local hospital into its hive, and several female patients as its hosts.<br /><br />As the Predator hunts down the quickly spawning Aliens throughout the town, the humans are virtually caught in the middle.  Dallas (Pasquale) is an ex-con who has just been released from prison.  His best friend is Sheriff Morales (Ortiz).  They along with Iraq War veteran, Kelly (Aylesworth) help to try and lead several other townspeople to safety.  Everything collides in an all out battle between the Predator and the Predalien.<br /><br />This unrated edition is without a doubt the bloodiest and goriest Aliens/Predator movie yet.  Even women and small children are not spared from the carnage the Chestbursters leave behind.  Add to that the Predator is blowing the heads off any human who gets in its way.  The human characters are just fodder in AVP Requiem.  While it's a veteran cast their credits mostly come from the small screen and it's obvious that they are a bit of an afterthought to the creature mayhem throughout the film.  They're not awful but they are fairly forgettable.<br /><br />There are a few logic problems such as how the Predalien grows to adult form almost instantaneously and why only ONE Predator answered the distress call.  It's a movie where you don't want to think too much.  The Predalien design was quite cool and it's stunning that the original draft of the script had the creature being killed at the beginning of the film.  Thankfully, wiser heads prevailed.  This isn't Alien and isn't meant to have the sheer terror and suspense of that film.  AVP Requiem is all about action and on that level it is successful.<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />My grade for AVP Requiem is boosted by a strong lineup of extras found on the two-disc edition.  The DVD comes with two audio commentaries: one by the directors and producers and one with Visual Effects Supervisor, Tom Woodruff, and Special Effects Supervisor Alec Gillis.<br /><br />The DVD comes with five behind-the-scenes featurettes:<br /><br />Preparing for War (15:45) covers the initial, top secret design of the new Predalien creature (codenamed "Chet"), the development of the script, and the casting of the film<br /><br />Fight to the Finish (12:13) Looks at the film's edition process and what scenes were put back in the film for this unrated, extended edition.  Also examines the various post-production visual effects.<br /><br />The Nightmare Returns (7:32) examines the design of the various Aliens and Predators and their evolution over the years since the original 1979 movie.<br /><br />Crossbreed (8:21) is all about the development of the Predalien's look which is described as 85% Alien and 15% Predator.<br /><br />Building the Predator Homeworld (6:58) While brief, we do get a look at the Predator home world and how the look and styling of their world influenced human design as shown in the first Aliens Vs. Predator film.<br /><br />In addition, there is a footprint feature which, when turned on, will alert the viewer that the particular scene is one of the added/expanded scenes not seen in the theatrical release.<br /><br />There is also the digital copy feature which allows you to download a digital copy of the film to a PC or handheld device.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with this movie was that it didn't seem to take the previous films from both franchises very seriously at all, nor show the art of it any respect.<br /><br />I can understand how a person, during the filmmaking process, can think that the canon of the franchise can act as sort of set pieces to elevate the storyline, but in this case dealing with something that goes goes back almost thirty years, treating The Predator and The Alien as set pieces, and something to push one's career, is probably a very bad idea.<br /><br />The film comes off as a teen slasher flick, an ensemble piece from the ranks of High School Musical, trying to showcase certain actors. Unfortunately, there's just too many actors and story lines to follow. This doesn't confuse the plot as much as it waters it down. Many moments in this come off as 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', just substitute the Aliens for the Slasher guy in the raincoat.<br /><br />The previous film in this series was actually much better. It was gripping, fast paced, original and cool. But 'The Brothers Strause' (whatever appeal that moniker seems to have is lost on me) seem to have dropped the ball here showing their real ability to write and direct good Science Fiction. Lets remember that 'Alien' actually won the prestigious Hugo award in 1981. This is nothing more than schlock dressed up in familiar costume.<br /><br />... ...</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>Man, good thing I don't read all the reviews for a movie before seeing it, because I may have skipped over this film altogether. What is all the complaining about? How is this film anything but good? Sure it does get a little cheesy at points, hence why I docked it a star, but for the most part I enjoyed this movie immensely. After the disaster that was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMZK">AVP - Alien Vs. Predator (Widescreen Edition)</a> I was really looking forward to seeing this film take a bad franchise that had promise and fulfill its great potential, and IMO they did just that.<br /><br />The predators from the fist AVP are on their way home after a good hunting trip when suddenly they come under attack in their own ship by a alien/predator mix. The ship crashes in the remote forests of Colorado (why does it seem like every horror movie takes place in Colorado these days anyway?) where it is discovered by a father and son who are hunting. Unfortunately for them there are face huggers in the ship who make a meal of them (well not really a meal, but you know what I mean). The aliens start reproducing in the woods, slowly at first, but as time goes by there are more and more of them, and they have their sights on a nearby town. Meanwhile back at the Predator home world a Predator has received a distress call from the downed ship and immediately flies off to subdue the aliens who've been released on earth.<br /><br />The characters in the film aren't really that interesting; there's the troubled teen that just got out of jail, the younger brother of the troubled teen who likes getting into fights, the girlfriend of the younger brother of the troubled teen, and the cop who's friends with the troubled teen. Not too confusing. Also there's a soldier who's just arrived home after serving in Iraq. She's been away a long time and her daughter barley knows her. The characters aren't really that important to the story overall though, just as with most horror films the action is what's important not the people involved. I can handle that.<br /><br />So let's talk about the action real quick. We have the old favorites, people being skinned alive by Predators, Aliens killing people with their mouth inside the mouth tong thing, and even a swimming pool death that was pretty cool. The difference is that the killings in this film are a bit more personal. Not only do the small kid and his father get it, that was bad enough, but the aliens reach a hospital and infect (for lack of a better word) a room full of newborn babies and a pregnant woman. Really freaky stuff. There are characters who you'd rather see live that get it in a very honorific way that will have you yelling "oh come on, just let her/him live for goodness sake. You can't kill him/her." The street fighting between the aliens and the town's survivors is pretty neat and thank goodness there is no alliance between the people and the Predator, in fact the Predator seems just as inclined to kill people as to kill aliens.<br /><br />Its not a perfect film to be sure, the teenage romance thing always gets under my skin (no pun intended) and he whole military cover up was a bit much, but I enjoyed the film for what it is, flaws and all.<br /><br />Word of the Day.<br /><br />Acidate; a-si-date, in past tense it sounds likes 'acid ate it'. When a character, be they Predator or human, gets alien blood all over them and then slowly melts we say they are being acidated. A really useful word to have while watching any Alien movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>This will be a biased review.  I am a fan of the franchise and found the completely dumb ALIEN VS. PREDATOR somehow entertaining.  That said, ALIENS VS. PREDATOR REQUIEM is a vast improvement.  The atmosphere this time around is a lot more akin to the earlier movies in both series.  Dark and bloody.  The human characters are actually likable and those who meet their demise are the ones that early in the film you are saying, "I can't wait 'till that one gets impaled to a wall."  The battles are well staged with a decent amount of creative gore (this review is before I check out the unrated ed., so there may be even more carnage).  The coolest thing about this one is the Predator.  He's no wuss.  Instead of a couple of rookies, this is one blood-thirsty E.T. who we see towards the start of the flick chillin' on the Predator home-world watching the Predator/Alien hybrid taking out some of his boys.  Before you can say, "get to the choppa," the ugly M.F. heavily arms himself, kick-starts his Predator hoopdie and high tails it to earth to kill him some aliens.  And does repeatedly.  I went in to this not expecting much, but with enough action and horror to please genre and franchise fans alike, AVPR was a most pleasant surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things:<br />-Definately more action, special effects, and gore.<br />-Predator has more goodies.<br />-Alien/Predator hybrid monster gets to wreak all sorts of havoc.<br />-For that matter, all of the creatures get to wreak all sorts of havoc.<br />-Even the military gets to blow some things up.<br />-This is the first time you get to see the predator homeworld.<br />-This is also the first time you get to see average people encountering aliens or predators (main characters are not military, spacemen, androids, commandos, explorers, or anything else fancy).<br />-At the very end, there is a reference to the Yutani group (which later merges with Wayland), thus continuing to correspond to the Alien saga.  Also leaves the movie open for a sequel.<br />-The rest of the film stays true to the original concepts of the Alien/Predator sagas.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Camera moves were shaky at some points, and lighting is very dark.  As a friend of mine pointed out, it makes it harder to actually see any of the aliens.<br />-Characters started off good, but seemed dull at the end, and many wound up dying.<br />-There is also no hero character as there is in all other Alien/Predator films (such as Ripley or Schwartzenegger's character).  You can only root for the Predator (or maybe the Alien...).<br />-Lots of senseless deaths.<br />-A few brutal parts (the aliens kill children, babies, and a pregnant woman).<br />-Some parts seemed ripped off (the ending reminded me of "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse", the story reminded me of "Dawn of the Dead," one part reminded me of "The Faculty," and other parts resembled the other Alien/Predator movies).<br /><br />This feels a lot less like Alien or Predator and more like "Dawn of the Dead." The focus for half of the movie is on a bunch of people who wind up as alien fodder.  The other half is the cool half, where the aliens are fighting (and there is plenty of fighting!).  It is good in a way, because it is more unique than the others (we finally get to see aliens trashing Earth).  It is also bad, because the film is dehumanized.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a brainless action/horror flick.  I would reccomend it if you are looking for such a movie.  I reccomend it more to Alien/Predator fans (and perhaps fans of other brainless horror movies).</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>This is part 2. You would've thought that 20th century FOX would've learned don't hire music video directors & they give the Strause Brothers full reign but were strict on Fincher WTF. Fincher has made some movies I actually liked Strause Brothers gave us R Kelly & 50 cent music videos WTF. I like Alien, Aliens & Alien 3 they were excellent Alien Resurrection was an ok action movie. Predator 1 classic survival horror Predator 2 comes pretty close. These movies shouldn't be that hard to make You have a planet overran by Aliens a space crew like the 1st movie gets a distress signal & they respond another ship with Predators responds to it too or do the same thing just have Predators result 1st then some marines go in 2nd. FOX you should've adapted Peter Briggs's script. Stay the f**K away from AvP & AVPR  they have B list written all over it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Now here was a sequel that no-one was waiting for. After the horrendous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMZK">AVP - Alien Vs. Predator</a>, someone, somewhere, decided there needed to be a follow-up. And yes, I decided to rent it. And yes, I kind of wish I hadn't.<br /><br />But just to note, AvP-R is a better movie that its originator, if only because there's no convuluted maze for the Aliens, Predators and Humans to go running around in. This time, a small town in BFE, Colorado gets infested when a Predator Drone filled with nasty little critters inexplicably gets sent back to Earth. The Predator that had an Alien baby inside at the end of AvP-1 also escapes and becomes a pretty cool Pralien. A fresh predator from the mothership comes to Earth to wipe out the new brood (and kill a few humans along the way). But soon the town is populated with a whole bunch of central casting hopefuls, like the teenaged bully, the good girl, the troubled kid with a good heart, the worried cop, kooky homelss guy, a man who had to look in the dark corner, etc. Before you can say "I Know What You Did Last Space Camp," the small Colorado town is crawling with Aliens and dead bodies and AvP-R becomes an Intergalactic Slasher Flick.<br /><br />This works for about 3/4's of the movie, with some memorable scenes thrown in for good mesaure. The Maternity Ward act is pure genius and won't be soon forgotten, however, the ending is pure tack-on. It takes what might have been a decent film and drops it to a special FX bit of hack-work. Only the twist adds any satisfaction, just barely. Fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>First and foremost, I hope this franchise continues. I saw the theatrical cut and I enjoyed it, and this unrated version again proves that the unrated version continues to be the gold standard in movies.REQUIEM has a very good story, and the unrated places more of the theatrical version in context, and whats more fun is we get to see more of the predator's tool kit and his/her/its pack of goodies. Whilst the directors clearly have a favorite version of the predator and Aliens ( more relevant in the case of the Alien with 4 if not more directors putting there thoughts in the canon of the Aliens Quadrilogy). Viewers of the Theatrical version will not appreciate just how much has been put back in, or redone until they see the film, and hear the directors and producer commentary.This is truly a film for the fans, but I think if you love a bit of Horror and Sci-fi mixed, you should still enjoy it.<br />And if you can't see this film, either get glasses, or fumble for the contrast controls on the TV... the Unrated version is well shot and is in tone with what the Directors wanted. The lights are light and the darks are dark... thats the way this movie was done. I suspect that part of the reason that the creature sequences are allegedly darker is that they are attempting to stop revealing too much, since the creatures are in full frame.<br />THE DVD:<br />The Commentaries are the best element. The Directors and  the producer give the best information, however, if you want something entertaining and informative, Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff satisfy.<br /><br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I was a tender lad of 8 when I saw the original "Alien" at the theater (it was the first R-rated film I was ever allowed to see). What I saw affected me (in terms of movie-going experiences) for the rest of my life. Science fiction was being treated as an "adult" genre instead of the light-hearted fanatasy treatment geared toward kids and teens that it's usually given (no offense, Lucas. I loved the Star Wars films).<br /><br />Instead of bright colors, flashy laser guns and lovable robots, we were given a stark vision of a functional, dirty, backstabbing and morally bankrupt future; and what's worse, there is a creature out there that is darker than any nightmare you could ever envision. This creature was a cold, cunning, ruthless killer without conscience or remorse. It forever changed the way we viewed science fiction (many films have tried to copy it, but NONE have ever even come close).<br /><br />Seven years later, James Cameron came along and created the PERFECT sequel with "Aliens". "Aliens" was more of a sci-fi/action film rather that a sci-fi/horror film like "Alien", but Cameron still held the alien mythology in high regards and integrated it into his story.<br /><br />The original "Predator" was more of an action vehicle for the then red-hot "Ah-nold" Schwarzennegger. The film was pretty good and had some very cool scenes, but not nearly as good as the first 2 "Alien" films. "Predator 2" was OK, but really fell short of the potential that this franchise could have had.<br /><br />"Alien 3" and "Alien Ressurection" were two progressively worse films in the series that pretty much ruined the whole franchise for me. Things couldn't get any worse after "Ressurection".<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />2004 brought us "Aliens vs. Predator" which I thought was just a slight step above "Ressurection". It was sort of enjoyable, but it added very little to the Alien mythology.<br /><br />Well, "Requiem" brings absolutely NOTHING to the Alien or Predator franchises at all. These two iconic screen creatures have been reduced to nothing more than "slasher" villains like Jason, Michael Meyers, or Freddy.<br /><br />How sad.<br /><br />The plot of this film is mindless and pointless. The creatures are no longer scary and have been reduced to "tools" used to get a box-office draw (and even THAT didn't save this movie - it was a financial bomb).<br /><br />Thank God I only rented this.<br /><br />I think I'll pop in the original "Alien" and "Predator" in the DVD player and remember what it was like when movies were fresh, original, scary, exciting, and fun.<br /><br />Hollywood.....you suck.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I can understand all the negative reviews surrounding Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem.  There are some ridiculous leaps in logic and non-sensical developments to be found, but as a whole, AvP:R is a nasty, bloody, and unabashedly R-rated treat that pays homage to the Alien and Predator franchises, and is much, much more entertaining than the AvP film that came before it (in fact, AvP:R more than makes up for the first mish-mash in the first ten minutes of the film).  Picking up where AvP left off, AvP:R finds the Predator ship crashing in a small Colorado town, where the hybrid Predalien and some facehuggers escape, and soon enough cause some bloody and gorey mayhem.  There's little in the way of character development, but the cast (including Rescue Me's Steven Pasquale, 24's Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz, and genre stalwart Robert Joy) is decent enough, and there are enough inventive ideas that don't show disrespect to either franchise, unlike what was seen in the first AvP.  Despite the flaws in the story, the Brothers Strause manage to conceive an entertaining and surprisingly good flick that works for what it is.  All in all, Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem isn't perfect, but it manages to provide most of the goods that fans looked for the first time around and didn't get.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Aliens vs Predator:Requiem is the 2007 sequel to Alien vs Predator. Directed by The Brothers Strause, it stars Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, and John Ortiz. Picking up after the events of the first movie, the predator known as "Scar" erupts with a chestburster on board his Predator ship. While the chestburster's form has taken some characteristics of the Predator, it grows into a new hybrid of alien known as a Predalien. The Predalien sneaks onto a scout ship and kills a Predator on board. In an attempt to kill the Predalien another Predator fires his shoulder cannon which punctures the hull of the ship and brings it down on Earth in none other than Gunnison, Colorado. The Predator then sends out a distress signal to other Predators before he dies, which ultimately brings another. When he arrives, all (ahem) heck breaks loose and people as well as Aliens start to die. I would've loved to see them continue the story set in the first one, though, but you can't have it all. Can you?<br /><br />I totally understand why many people dislike this movie so. First of all, the lighting in the movie is awful. I know they were trying to set a tone for the movie in which to scare everyone by but why make it so dark that noone can barely see what's going on on-screen. Second, the storyline wasn't as well developed as the first movie and it truly shows. Because of that fact alone, it makes the movie come across as more of a cheesy horror flick than a serious AvP movie. It's clear The Brothers Strause know very little about making an AvP movie...a good one anyways. Shame on 20th Century Fox for putting out this. It looks to me like they want to cash in on the AvP thing while they can..or else why would they release a movie like this?<br /><br />The Unrated version includes five behind the scenes featurettes as well as commentary and multiple still galleries.<br /><br />On a side note, a third film in the series has been planned by Fox so we can look forward to seeing the series continue as well as seeing the storyline finish up(when that will be is anyone's guess). If Fox knows what's good for them, they'll make up for their mistake by getting Paul W.S. Anderson back to make the next one. Us fans, definitely, deserve better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>I didn't even like the first AVP, so I hadn't expected this one to be very good either. And boy, it wasn't. The characters weren't developed hardly at all, and it was way too dark to see anything that was going on. I mean seriously, every time an alien attacked I kept moving around, trying to find any angle where I could actually see what was happening. Alas, I found no angle. So yeah, bad characters, awful lighting, and the story wasn't even halfway decent. I wouldn't look into this... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>I compared the original "Alien Vs. Predator" with the later films in the Universal "Golden Age" horror cycle. Once long-standing franchises like Frankenstein, Dracula and the Wolf Man began to fade in their appeal at the box-office, producers decided to drum up business by combining those classic monsters in silly, entertaining B-grade brawlers like "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man," "House of Dracula" and "House of Frankenstein." Those films weren't made with the same production attributes as their more esteemed predecessors, yet were quite endearing in their own right for the action and no-brain fun that they offered.<br /><br />While one can argue that the "Alien" and "Predator" franchises had not been exhausted to the degree that the Universal Monsters had (the two-film "Predator" series in particular), Fox nevertheless decided to make their own modern-day "monsterfest" with the first "Alien Vs. Predator." The 2004 film carried a more kid-friendly PG-13 rating and raked in big bucks, totaling $80 million domestically and even more overseas as it mixed the Dan O'Bannon-Ronald Shusett created "Alien" franchise with Jim and John Thomas' lizard-like intergalactic hunter.<br /><br />It made sense that a sequel would follow, but the big surprise was how ALIENS VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM would make its predecessor look like a cinematic masterpiece by comparison.<br /><br />Bloodier and more graphic with its "R" rating (which many believe lead to the film failing to come close to its predecessor's box-office in-take), yet amateurishly written, flatly acted and even tasteless in sections, this nightmarish mess feels like a bad Sci-Fi Channel original movie masquerading as a major-studio theatrical release.<br /><br />Shane Salerno's script picks up literally right where the original left off, with an alien/predator hybrid popping out of the entrails of the slain Predator who finished off the Alien Queen at the end of its predecessor. No sooner does the ship crash back on Earth -- this time near a Colorado mountain town -- than the "PredAlien" runs amok, laying alien eggs and causing trouble for its human populace, including a pizza delivery man (Johnny Lewis) beaten up by his would-be girlfriend's beau, his older brother (Steven Pasquale), and a military vet (Reiko Aylesworth) recently welcomed home by her husband and young daughter. Meanwhile, another Predator is dispatched to take down the PredAlien and anything else that stands in its way.<br /><br />The "Brothers Strause" made their feature debut with "AVP2," playing up the gore and special effects which the first "AVP" admittedly took its time unveiling. Seeing that there's no longer any surprise to the appearance of these creatures, that's perfectly understandable, but as a result there's no tension, shocks or scares of any real kind here either. What's arguably even worse is Salerno's screenplay, a pedestrian assembly of scenes ("aliens in the swimming pool," "aliens in the diner," "predator in the graveyard," and on and on) linked by some of the least appealing and poorly developed characters you'll ever see in a film of this kind. The no-name cast lacks charm, charisma and any kind of empathy, with former "24" star Aylesworth (the only recognizable face) completely wasted in what could have been a Ripley-like female lead.<br /><br />Indeed, the picture is only successful in cultivating the occasional, unintentional laugh, most of which involve the Predator who's trying to clean up the mess. It figures that, of all the Predators in the galaxy, they send the one who couldn't even use a Wii remote effectively, with a particularly hilarious moment ensuing when the Predator can't even hit one little alien with his rocket launcher -- causing instead an explosion at the power facility that leads to a community-wide blackout. While it might have been even funnier if a studio audience laugh track had been applied to the sequence, it's still amusing as played.<br /><br />"Requiem," then, rarely delivers the goods that one would've anticipated from the first-ever arrival of Aliens in a suburban Earth setting, and what's more, manages to be tasteless and gross when the creatures hit a maternity ward late in the film. By that point it's clear how desperate the filmmakers had become, and how understandable it might be for viewers to hit the eject button on their remotes.<br /><br />Fox's 2-disc DVD and Blu-Ray disc offer the movie's 94-minute R-rated theatrical cut as well as a 102-minute Unrated version. As is usual with these "Unrated" cuts, almost none of the added footage is gore-related, instead adding some development to the characters, though some of the maternity ward sequence is even more graphic and thus to be avoided in the extended version.<br /><br />Both sets are packed with mostly-promotional flavored extras, including a pair of commentaries (one by creature experts Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., plus the Brothers Strause and producer John Davis on an alternate track), a whole group of featurettes, trailers, and a bonus second disc sporting an official "downloadable" digital copy for portable media players.<br /><br />Visually, the Blu-Ray disc offers a splendid AVC-encoded transfer with a typically active DTS Master Audio digital track, while Fox's standard DVD includes a superb 16:9 (2.35) transfer with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This is one of the worst films I have ever seen (try to see) and a shameful abuse of one of the greatest movie monsters of all time. The Alien is no longer scary. Gone is the elegance. Gone is the menace and chilling patience. Made by people who know how to make FX but have no real idea about how to make a movie. I sometimes wondered if they were making fun of what had gone before, like a Zucker/Abrams flick as it seemed to veer into what could be construed as parody. Sadly, no.<br /><br />I knew going in it would be bad, and that it would probably be yet another nail in the coffin of my favorite sci-fi sequels ("Alien" in my case, though I do enjoy the "Predator" films). I had seen the "redband" trailer, and stared in horror at its frenetic menagerie of 80s teen slasher clich&eacute;s; I even watched the "exclusive" online clip of the film's first five minutes, and hoped that they had been edited down from a better-paced original (as it turned out, they had not). But even so, I gave the movie a shot. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps because if a beloved artifice that one has admired for years is to be systematically dismantled and thrown on the trash heap, one should be there to watch it burn. At least, I thought, with my expectations this low, this movie's directors would have to try very hard to undercut them.<br /><br />They did. I mean really, they must have tried hard. It takes some kind of effort to take two of the most durable mythologies in modern scifi and make them a backdrop to a pizza guy's coming of age. Seriously. That is the only discernible story-arc in this entire film. Truth be told I could forgive even that if the characters hadn't came pre-assembled right out of the teen movie stock barrel. Instead this film spends 40 minutes trying to make us care whether Smarmy Teen gets it off with Hot Blonde before Blond Bully Ex-Boyfriend finds out. Thank God he has Troubled Ex-Con Brother (who trumps in along with his buddy, Nice Cop) to help him out once the aliens (who arrive courtesy of "disturbing" evisceration of Happy Hunting Dad and his son, Curious Preteen) start to take out the population (such as Mumbling Bum Who No One Will Ever Believe and Dense Cop Who Keeps Looking In The Dark After Everyone Else Has Left). They soon meet up with Screaming Bereft Mother and Military Chick, who saves her daughter Cute Little Girl after her husband Wussy New Man is vivisected in line with tradition.<br /><br />Honestly, with this zoo of automated plot-bots to manage, how do the aliens and the predators (actually a Predator) get a look in? Well in truth, they don't. Very little time is spent developing either character (and let's face it, since neither character actually talks, that isn't surprising) and any tension built up between them is quickly dissipated as the film returns to the interminable "I Know What You Did Last Summer" slasher plot. I'm not sure what sort of budget this had but you can see that money spent on each subsequent Alien or Predator film is getting less & less, with average special effects, no name actors, bland locations & surprisingly cheap looking production values. Please stop embarrassing yourselves even further.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>When AVP went into production fans of both the Alien and Predator movies were very excited, but a little hope was lost when it was announced Paul WS Anderson was the writer/director; but what really got fans going crazy was when the rating was PG-13. While one cannot deny there were flaws with AVP it had more to do with the writing than anything else. Anderson's scripts often feel like an early draft rather than final shooting script. All the Alien and Predator movies were R-rated and no doubt AVP should have as well, but when all was said and done the PG-13 rating isn't what hurt AVP. Yes it could have used more gore and action, but the problems again were with the writing.<br /><br />With AVP-R announced without Paul Anderson being involved and the movie being made with an R-Rating fans were once again excited. And to be totally honest after watching AVP-R I think I'd much rather have Paul Anderson involved. AVP-R was a rather poor movie, while there was potential without Anderson I really think we would have been better off with him.<br /><br />The biggest problem with AVP-R is the lighting. Daniel Pearl was the DP and from what I have seen from him I have liked. He did the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre so right there he gets my respect, but the lighting here was terrible. There was more gore than AVP, but we can't see it! I don't know if Daniel Pearl was to blame or if it was Colin & Greg Strause who are the directors are too blame. Since Pearl is the DP I have to blame him. Watching this movie at times is sort of like watching a movie with your eyes closed. That was the biggest problem here, but not the only problem.<br /><br />The screenplay by Shane Salerno was terrible. There were far too many characters to keep track of and all were so poorly written and lack any depth at all. AVP-R is the type of movie that when all is said and done you'll be hard pressed to remember the names of any of the characters. The script was really poor. It's like Shane Salerno didn't even bother to try. We have the fan base for the Alien and Predator movies and well they'll see anything we spit out. Once again Hollywood treats us like idiots.<br /><br />Directors Colin & Greg Strause fail at brining any suspense and tension and with the terrible lighting not much of a surprise their scenes lack any of that. The action scenes are decent, but again since we can barley see them they fail at brining any excitement. There were a couple of solid scenes, but not nearly enough to salvage this movie. Had I actually been able to see what was happening maybe AVP-R wouldn't have failed as much as it did; by no means would this be a great movie, but slightly better. The final act is the worst offender; the scenes in the hospital for the climax are so dark that if you have any interest left in the movie by this point you'll probably lose it.<br /><br />AVP-R proved that the rating of AVP had nothing to do with its failure. Would an R-rating have made AVP better? Odds are yes very slightly better, but no way would it have been great. Like I said earlier the PG-13 rating didn't hurt AVP as much as the writing and this movie proved that. AVP-R was R-rated and wasn't as good as AVP, which was average at best. A lot has changed over the years, back in the 70s and 80s many movies were butchered by the MPAA and if released now most of these titles would clear and R-rating with ease and some would feature minor cuts and not be totally butchered. If AVP was released back in the 80s or mid 90s it would possibly get an R-rating.<br /><br />Times have changed though and AVP pulled off the PG-13, but it is slightly more extreme than most PG-13 flicks. Paul Anderson is hated by legions of Horror/Sci-Fi fans and while I can't say I like the guys work I don't hate it. I can tolerate him, but barley. And honestly I never thought I would say to myself I wish Paul Anderson did this and while watching AVP-R I found myself wishing Anderson would have done it.<br /><br />These cross over movies almost always seem to fail. Back in the 40s Universal did it with their monster movies and while some were fun none of them were as good as the monsters on their own. So when it came to AVP I wasn't expecting anything like the movies from either series. Besides being a Vs movie it's also a sequel to both Alien and Predator and honestly with some exceptions as a series goes on they don't get better they might stay enjoyable if lucky. With AVP-R I was simply expecting some mindless fun, and while it was very mindless the makers forgot about the fun part.<br /><br />For the hardcore fans of the Alien and Predator movies are the only ones who should watch this, but I doubt this movie will live up to your expectations. This one doesn't correct the problems found in AVP it just creates its own and far worse problems. With better lighting AVP-R would have been better, but still not very good either.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There's bad cinema, and there's really bad cinema. And then there's AvP Requiem. I do sympathize with the cast and crew, however, having a budget of only $40 million. With today's high-tech blue screens, CGI and special effects computers, $40 million ain't much. But it should still be possible to make a fair film from that meager amount.<br /><br />Regardless of budgetary constraints (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001O3YC6">Pitch Black</a> cost only $23 million to make), one would hope for at least some cool camera shots, great action sequences, and good gadgets. Not so. The filming is dark. Too dark. In fact, it was so dark I couldn't tell who was doing what to whom. "Are they having sex? Or is that blood spurting from someone's eye?"<br /><br />Next problem: main character. Who was it?! I have no idea. If someone out there in FilmLand knows, please advise. At first I thought it might be Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale), a down-on-his-luck excon trying to find his way after his release from jail. But no, we quickly move away from him and on to ...a mother named Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301971345">Mr. Brooks</a>) who's just returned from military service and is trying to reconnect with her young daughter Molly (Ariel Gade, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AWYOGE">Dark Water</a>). But no, we then move on to Dallas' brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis, a pizza delivery boy whose crush on a local hottie has him in hotter water with some local bullies. But no, then we move on (fleetingly) to Colonel Stevens (Robert Joy) who somehow, someway, knows that there's a serious threat to national security in this small town and is prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate it. Perhaps the main character was the Predator/Alien hybrid? Or the Predator that comes from Predatoria (my made up name for their homeworld) to kick some serious hybrid booty? Or maybe ...I don't know!<br /><br />When you have two such major weaknesses in a film (poor lighting and no main character to follow), you've pretty much set yourself up for disaster. Fans of the graphic novels might have fun sitting through it, but for regular ol' scifi buffs, this one's a no-go.<br /><br />(P.S. There's the possibility of a sequel thanks to the impregnating of a pregnant woman with ...OH WHO CARES! Grrr!)</p></br><a href="../users/AIY4H4KWR2KWZ.html">AIY4H4KWR2KWZ</a><br/><p>Not bad at all, surprisingly so. The flick's problems were numerous, but unlike the nasty Geiger-inspired creatures, fairly inocuous.<br /><br />The largest issue: The screenplay wasn't particularly well developed. We're given too many 'lead' characters, and as an audience we're forced to parcel out our interests, making our emotional investments superficial at best. The characters end up as a laundry list of who lives/dies -versus- people that we want to see make it to the end. A stronger focus utilizing fewer players would have helped this flick enormously. Additionally, the dialogue and character interplay was paper-thin, lending itself to clich&eacute;.<br /><br />From a technical aspect, scenes showcasing the Aliens were under-lit and visually muddy. Darkness for the creepy factor is understandable, but we're suppose to be able to make out what we're watching. It was extremely difficult to decipher several of the battle sequences, so it missed the foremost goal of this franchise = enjoying these two creatures kick the crap out of each other.<br /><br />Plus, I found it tacky that the Strause Brothers decided on heavy rain to illicit drama. It's such a tired ploy; I wished they would've sacked up and did the special effects in a dry (more revealing) setting. Again, this goes to the battle sequences where it became frustratingly difficult to follow events. It makes me wonder if the F/X crew realized their mechanics were visible during the test shots, forcing the directors to shoot the film that way? In fact, I honestly had no idea until nearly the end of the film (again - too dark) that the primary freak was an Alien/Predator hybrid. And just how did that happen?!<br /><br />Finally, I wish they had explained why the alert sent out to the Predator homeworld was received and responded to and by one lone hunter. Was it a partner? Was it a family member? Was the dying Predator part of a specific hunting group - so that only members of that group would've received the call? It wasn't clear and the question lingers when it seemed the lone hunter was clearly overmatched. More so given its desire to hide evidence of the aliens and their victims. If his job was "clean-up", why not have more of them? I've always chalked up the basic premise of the Predator canon that each hunter is glorified by the amount of kills in his trophy case, so by taking on the mission alone, he didn't have to share the spoils. But he wasn't taking any trophies, instead choosing to wipe away evidence of their existence. So why him alone? Character contradiction or plot error - your choice.<br /><br />Still, I fully appreciated the sheer horror. That alone makes this stand out above some of the predecessors and successors to the franchise. Some of the images were truly horrific - more so in the Unrated Version. If the 'yikes' factor plays into your enjoyment, then you'll find a lot of pleasure in several gross out scenes. Personally, I had to look away at the more crazy intense imagery - can't say I enjoy watching pregnant women about to give birth to their human babies being used as instant incubators and a first meal for alien offspring. Bleeping sick stuff.<br /><br />On balance worth a rental for the average (non-fanboy) action/horror category.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Like its 2004 predecessor, 2007's "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem" aims to determine which of the iconic sci-fi creatures would come out on top in a mano-a-mano, winner-take-all battle - as if anybody cared.<br /><br />Before getting to the creatures themselves, it should be noted that a number of familiar faces from TV headline the cast.  In a role much different from the endearingly clueless fireman he plays in "Rescue Me," Steven Pasquale stars as a tough-guy law enforcement official whose small Colorado town is being overrun by a bunch of pesky, bloodthirsty critters from outer space, the townsfolk being pretty much just collateral damage in what is, clearly, a much more epic battle being waged around them.  And Sam Tremmell from "True Blood" and Reiko Aylesworth from "24" also get some big-screen time to add to their resumes.<br /><br />Not that the human characters in this kind of story matter much anyway.  And after decades of overexposure (remember how truly terrifying the first two "Alien" films were?), the bloom is clearly off the rose when it comes to both these creatures - and since neither ever speaks, it's not exactly a duel of wits that's going on between them.  And, besides, the movie is shot so dark, it's virtually impossible to see what's taking place onscreen anyway.  That doesn't do much for the coherence of the storytelling, but what does it really matter when it's all just about guts, gore, gadgets and goop, after all?</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>Question: how do you take two of the most popular aliens in the history of sci-fi, put them together in a movie to fight each other, get an R rating, a fairly healthy production budget, and still end up making a terrible movie? Answer: AVP Requiem.<br /><br />Acting ranges from mediocre to atrocious. There is not a single character you care about because none of them are developed, and most of them are incredibly annoying 20 somethings who I wouldn't care to see developed anyway. The script is ridiculously bad, with such howlers as "the government doesn't lie." There is nothing special about the special effects either. The predator/alien hybrid is cool, but it's really hard to see it most of the time. And folks, therein lies the biggest problem with this movie, it's unbelievably dark; comically so. It is difficult to impossible to tell what is happening on screen for 90% of the movie. I'm okay with using darkness to provide atmosphere, but this movie takes darkness to a whole new level. It's by far the darkest shot movie I have ever seen (and I've seen lots, and lots of movies), and is a major annoyance and deterrence to any enjoyment one might gleam from this flick. How did this movie make it to post production without anyone involved in its creation not complaining about how dark it is? Or maybe they did and no one listened? I watched the Blu-ray version on a Panasonic DMP-BDT220 player and a perfectly calibrated Vizio E371VL TV, and I know it's not my equipment that is at fault. It's just one big, dark mess of a movie that frustrates endlessly.<br /><br />The plot such as it is really isn't too bad on paper, but the other flaws render the movie unwatchable in this reviewer's opinion. I'm really still waiting for a good AVP movie, as this one and the previous one both stunk (although you could actually see what was happening in the first AVP). I would love to see a director of the caliber of a James Cameron, Ridley Scott, or Peter Jackson make a stab at a 3rd AVP, but sadly it's doubtful that will ever happen. The end of AVP Requiem leaves the movie open to a sequel, but it's been five years since this stinker of a movie hit theaters, and due to it's poor showing and poor reviews, it's highly unlikely the movie studios will take a chance on a third.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>Short review of the extended combat edition. I don't know where to start. Movie is boring all the way. There were not a single good actor. Acting wasn't good.  I hated that they put love of teenagers in this already stupid film. Even children didn't act well. People, show me some fear! This is not what you call fear! A teenager got tailed by a predalien near the heart. Let's do math, and the result is he should've been dead. EVEN if not dead, he didn't act like he had pain and that should've been very painful. No, please no heroes. Oh no. slap on the face. We are dealing with aliens and predator. Nobody seems to be scared of that encounter. It's all just action here and there with a very boring set of actors that make story be unbearably bad! Do I have to repeat myself from the review of the first Avp movie that the host does not die right after waking up. It takes time. And no, it does not mean that 2 hosts have to die from aliens within their chests with only 2 or 3 seconds interval. Their deaths could've been acted better. Predator seem to have a lot of blue liquid that vaporizes corpses. Plasma.. does it ever need a recharge? National guards died within 5 minutes, when main heroes survived. Not 1, not 2, not 3 of them. Seriously? Aliens are the deadliest species in the universe..so was told in the previous movies... One of the vision modes in the predator mask could have been improved to look a little less human.<br />Acid actually burns through the floor and other surfaces. They forgot about it in the middle of the movie and right until the end. That's when acid became green alien juice. Miss Yutani... NO! She seems like a cheap actor and if I see her in another avp movie, forget about me buying it. General was a sucky actor too. There are more things to say, but this movie doesn't deserve me wasting time on it. It also does not deserve to be in Alien-Predator movie history.<br /><br />Good thing: New gadgets for predator that maybe will make it into the games.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>I know lots of people thought the first movie in this series (Alien vs. Predator) had a lot lacking, but I still ended up enjoying it.  Sure, it couldn't compare to the first Alien or Aliens by any means, but it held some merit nonetheless.  But this film is a complete horror to a decent predecessor.  The story line lacks direction and it appears that the director just chose to include as much horror as possible to shock value.  So while it may have some moments, this is one movie you can avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>After listening to the commentary [to understand the movie] I can see how this "legend" got skrewed up.<br /><br />on the whole:<br />5 stars for color of the out of doors.<br />1 star for the dark images<br />4 stars for the characters.<br />5 stars for what I could see of the Aliens and "Chet" the Predalian and "Wolf" the preditor.<br />Chet and Wolf were nothing but dark blobs on the screen.

With all the success that these two franchises have enjoyed over the years since their introductions, it's a shame that such an ill-conceived sequel like the lackluster "Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" (or AVP: R as it is often abbreviated), could possibly prove to be the final blow that puts both monsters down for the count.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" picks up directly after the events of the original film, as we find a hybrid of a Predator and an Alien crash landing on Earth. Upon arrival the PredAlien quickly begins producing Alien offspring and once they are full grown, they begin to eliminate any humans they come into contact with. When the Predator ship that spawned the PredAlien fails to return to the Predator homeworld, one lone Predator comes to Earth to "clean up" the Alien infestation and destroy the hybrid at all costs.<br /><br />I have enjoyed all of the `Alien' and `Predator' movies (some more than others), and I thought that the initial pairing of the two monsters, "AVP: Alien Vs Predator", was a great way of linking the two franchises together, much the same way that the comic books had done many years before. So, when it was announced that another `Versus' movie was coming to theaters in 2007, I was instantly excited by the prospect to get to see these two beings fight it out once again. The first film was action packed and featured a decent amount of Alien and Predator fighting, but it seemed to focus more on the two species' attacking the humans caught in the crossfire. So, I was hoping that with this sequel there would be much more creature fighting creature instead of fighting humans, and I can honestly say that is the one thing this film got right. With "AVP: R" anyone that watched the first movie and was somewhat disappointed by the lack of creature fighting will definitely get their fill and then some. The fights are very fast and brutal; taking full advantage of the `R' rating it was given, so kudos for that aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Even though "AVP: R" included more creature versus creature fighting into the story, which was a major concern for the directors of this movie, The Brothers Strause (as they prefer to be called). Apparently, the thought never occurred to the directors or their writer, Shane Salerno (2000's "Shaft"), to include any semblance of an actual story that would hold any interest with the audience. The story for the first movie was solid, featured plenty of interesting characters, and provided numerous references to the two franchises, along with a nice beginning of a bridge between the two series'. With "AVP: R" the story that was started in the previous movie gets a very slight nudge forward near the end of the film, but for the most part the story pretty much just stands still. A decision which led me to believe that the creative minds behind this movie didn't really have any intention of extending the bridge that was started in "AVP", but merely wanted to cram as much fighting, gore, and incredibly lame characters and dialogue as they possibly could into a movie, leaving me incredibly disappointed in the process.<br /><br />The actors in "Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" were adequate given what little they had to work with from such a paper-thin story. The main star of this ensemble cast comprised of B or even C-List actors was Steven Pasquale (TV's "Rescue Me"), who gave a fairly by-the-book portrayal as the token reformed tough guy with a good heart but always finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Next we have Reiko Aylesworth (TV's "24") as a mother just returning home from a tour of duty, and appears to be filling the role of an Ellen Ripley type of character. She does an adequate job of filling the role, and would have most likely been a much more intriguing character had the movie featured a more substantial story; instead, she's just another run-of-the-mill character that you can find in any bargain bin action movie. Rounding out the primary cast for "AVP:R" is John Ortiz ("Miami Vice") as the local sheriff who is in way over his head and is having to prove to himself and those around him that he deserves the job and the respect that comes with it. The rest of the supporting cast are a bunch of unknown, primarily teenage to early twenties, up-and-coming actors who are as forgettable as the rest of this dreadful movie.<br /><br />My last complaint for this movie is in regards to how it was filmed. I don't know who had the not-so bright idea to shroud the majority of this film in such extreme darkness, but someone should have spoken up to point out how stupid of an idea it was. The majority of this movie, and especially the numerous action sequences, are so incredibly dark or dimly lit that you can't see what's going on for the most part, and for this type of movie where the word "versus" is in the title, I think the action sequences are quite crucial and it should have been easier to see what was happening. However, you really can't see any details of the two creatures fighting to speak of, which caused me to begin losing interest in the movie's numerous fight scenes, and since "AVP: R" featured an abundance of fights I therefore quickly lost interest in the movie in general because the flimsy plot that was being used as the story sure wasn't going to keep my attention from waning. The biggest disappointment with how dark the film was is the fact that you hardly get to see the PredAlien hybrid, except for through the Predator's various vision settings, which only gave partial details of the creature's appearance. There were a couple of scenes that you could see more of the hybrid, and it looked cool from what I could tell, but when this new creature was essentially the driving force behind the movie, I just expected to see more of it, which was not the case at all and added even more to my frustration with the inferior nature of this sequel.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" is an extremely weak attempt at a follow-up to the very entertaining "AVP: Alien Vs Predator" that first joined these two monstrous icons of Hollywood. For those that haven't noticed, the creative "geniuses" behind this movie were so lazy that aside from adding the subtitle "Requiem" to the title the only other change was adding the letter `s' to the end of `Alien'. At least by adding the subtitle the title became somewhat more interesting, prior to that addition the film was originally going to be called "Aliens Vs Predator", using only the `s' to note that it was a sequel and not a re-release of the original movie, how creative these directors', The Brothers Strause, have proven themselves to be. The story is surprisingly thin given that it was written by a decent writer with solid credentials, featuring stock characters that come off as fodder for the two creatures and not anyone to really care about; however, it does provide fans plenty of fighting between the two creatures although you'll be hard-pressed to really see any details in the scenes given how dark the color palette is for this movie. As a fan of both franchises separately, and of their initial versus match, I for one am hoping that this horrible excuse for a sequel will not be the end of what looked to have been a promising link between the two series'.<br /><br />"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem" is available in rated R and unrated editions both contain violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>In 2004, Fox Studios took two hot properties and blended them into a single motion picture. Granted, it had already been done by Dark Horse comics, but this was the first time it made it to film. AVP: ALIENS VERSUS PREDATOR was a hit at the box office but not so among fans and critics alike. When word leaked out that another film with the two extra terrestrial combatants came out, it was met with hope that it wouldn't be the same. In some ways it was and others it wasn't.<br /><br />The film opens with a spaceship commanded by one of the Predators, a race that lives to hunt, careening through space filled with jars containing infant aliens, those shiny black shelled creatures with extending dentures. The spaceship crashes on Earth, letting lose the aliens to breed and the Predator to pursue them.<br /><br />The aliens quickly attack a hunter and his youngster son, mutating into the normal ugly acid blooded creatures we've known to love. But the Predator, with his gadgets and weapons, is hot on their trail. Unfortunately, there are more of them than him.<br /><br />We are offered several other characters that will eventually become fodder for the creatures that are far faster and more adaptable. A returning war hero and her daughter, a troubled man returning home after a prison stint, his brother and the girl he has the hots for, a police chief, etc. Don't worry if you don't get the background stories on each. For the most part, it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />What does matter, or at least should have, are the skirmishes between the two main creatures in the title. There are a few fights between them that rock and roll, but the biggest problem seen is the unseen. Most of the fights take place at night and in near total darkness. I could be wrong but I felt like I saw more of the aliens in the first two movies than I did in total here.<br /><br />And the Predator? It fluctuates between being a good guy protecting people and a hunter that cares little about anything that gets in his way. The fact that he is shot at by humans that have no clue what he is other than a big ole ugly alien don't help him in deciding that the only side to stand on is his own.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are several scenes in the film that are a fan boy's dream. Face to face creatures, one spewing acid like blood, projecting its metal like fangs as it tries to penetrate the defenses of the other warrior bred predator, were what fans were waiting for all along. But again, little light is shed to get a decent glimpse of either one.<br /><br />The long lost love stories, the instantaneous interests between characters, the decisions made on how to survive are supplemental at best. The acting among these characters is well done but none stands out above the rest. And the final solution to the film, a military one that sounds feasible, leaves a tiny opening for another sequel.<br /><br />My guess is that this won't be happening though. The movie did well at the box office, but word has already leaked that Sigourney Weaver was in talks to do another film in the ALIEN series which was squashed with the results from this one. Who knows, perhaps someday one of those fan boys who loves both movies will find a way to make the film that the whole world has been waiting for. We can only hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Edit on 6/9/08:<br /><br />After my harsh review below, I had to bump this movie up one star after seeing it a second time on Blu-ray. It is actually good mindless fun with some pretty neat SFX. Just leave your brain on the seat beside you and have a good time.<br /><br />Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is only a little better than the first Alien vs. Predator film. The teenager drama straight out of the WB was terrible as were all the actors. The creatures look good, but you could hardly see them (especially in the badly shot fight scenes). The Predators do have some really cool weapons and there is one hot chick, but that isn't enough to call this thing anything but what it is. A complete MESS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>OK. They need to stop now. There's enough of these movies out there that it's becoming less and less terrifying, scary or whatever. What's happening is they are trying to recreate what the originals had. But you cannot do that and it will just ruin the legacy if it hasn't already.<br />The first AVP movie was pure schlock and not worth the film it was printed on. This one comes back closer to home base in a way that is much closer to the originals.<br />First, what I didn't like. It was too dark! Dark to the point where it was hard to make out what was going on at times. If you cannot see the action.... there is no thrill! Secondly, they are making the Predator out to be the good guy here. Even though he does some killing, his goal is to save Earth from the Alien and it's quite obvious. It doesn't fit with the story. The Predator came to earth in the first and second films to 'collect' human parts, specifically spinal columns and brains, as trophies. Let's not change him now to have a heart for that which he will ruthlessly kill.<br />What I did like was that the story on the Alien part made a lot of sense and kept to the original characters.<br />One thing I hope isn't going to happen.... this new hybrid they presented here... I hope it's the end of him in this movie... it just doesn't follow logically.<br />All in all, if you liked either of these characters this is worth watching. Not owning... but watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>What in the world is going on? Aliens crash burn in an isolated Colorado town--this isolation is so serendipitous as the viewer later learns. A hunky Predator comes after them. What saves this movie by a hair is P's dreads. He's a mighty machismo other-worldly being! Uh-uh-uuh! A charmer to be sure what with all the special weapons he continues to pull from his body-armored suit!<br /><br />Pity the poor pitiful people who happenstance come face to face with the Aliens or the Predator. I was hoping Predator alone would try to make the acquaintance of at least one human as his ally. Didn't happen. He "disappeared" all who crossed his path.<br /><br />As for those skittery Aliens, what gives there? Their birth cycle has racheted up several revolutions as Mom first "impregnates" a human, then Babies, make that plural, erupt--ka-powie! from their stomachs. Yoush! Sickening before with John Hurt, still sickening with little boys and women! They still do all that drippy stuff EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />The sheriff tries, heaven knows he tries, but he is just one mewling human against the ferocity of Aliens and a Predator. Then there are those teenagers who are so tough until they actually face the real bullies! Bye bye bravado, hello yellow!<br /><br />How all this ends is a shocker, but the only way. Maybe there will never ever EVER be another battle between Aliens and one Predator on this planet. If there is, maybe they will film with a little more light. It was too dark to tell who was losing or winning! Frankly, I favored the dude with the dreads.

I was cool that it started where the first one ended, but it's just that ending that really gets me.

However, AVP: Requiem is bad altogether. There are just some scenes that should never even be included in a film of its nature.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a ship belonging to the Predator aliens crashes in Colorado because a legion of aliens kills all the crew members, the aliens get out and start killing people. So a lone Predator comes to Earth to destroy the aliens and prevent them from spreading. The story also revolves around a group of survivors who are determined to escape from the city.<br />MUSIC: This one part of the movie that is good. One of the main highlights in an overall bad experience.<br />STORY: The plot is paper-thin and riddled with holes. You won't even know who most of the characters names. Most of the time you'll be going, "Wait, who the hell are you?," because of how poorly assembled the plot is. I was only able to memorize the name of the waitress who got killed within forty minutes of the movie.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: At first it seems the movie is going to be awesome... until the teen drama steps in and ruins it. When this began to happen I was left going, "Oh God no." Also, the dialogue is bad which makes the story go to waste even more. This is one of those Ha Ha Stupid movies. Also, you may have trouble trying to see this movie because some parts are just too dark to see. I didn't have this problem most of the time, but a lot of people sure did. This movie has some cool action moments, but they all face-plant because of too many poorly implemented character progressions and storyline.<br />GORE: Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad which is disappointing.<br />OVERALL: Bad. This movie wasted nearly all of its potential with bad storytelling, absurd dialogue, and overall stupid characters (Surely bullet-proof vests will save us!).<br />THE GOOD: Some cool action moments, some nasty gore, and plenty of Ha Ha Stupid moments.<br />THE BAD: Too dark to see sometimes, bad storytelling, lame characters, and too many Ha Ha Stupid moments.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I was really disappointed in the direction this sequel went.  There was absolutely no scare factor that Aliens is known for.  Nothing new that you didn't already know about Predators.<br /><br />If you remember from the last movie, at the end, an alien spawn burst out of a deceased Predator.  Thus, an alien/Predator hybrid and made its way to Earth and attacking on humanity.  Another Predator investigates and learns of a hybrid and takes off to hunt it down.<br /><br />That pretty much it.  Humans are just in the way of the hybrid and the Predator is doing its best to track it down and kill it.<br /><br />Like I said, no scare factor.  No build-up of suspense.  The whole thing just felt rushed.  Just plain disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>I have only one gripe with this film. It was MUCH too dark!

I did see the occasional color change, and when the image got brighter, things began to get better. The action was good, pretty much non-stop. It's a good addition to the franchise, but better care has to be taken with it's production. This film could have made a better rating, except for the darkness.

If I'd seen it in the movies I wouldn't have been able to help myself: I would have mocked it ruthlessly in a loud voice in public. At least this way I managed to do all my mocking in the privacy of my own home. It was cheaper than going to the movies, too: add up tickets and popcorn and drinks for both my husband and I versus the price of the DVD, and it ended up being a much better idea to have the DVD.<br /><br />Frankly, this movie stank. I wasn't expecting anything original but they just went complete gore-fest: let's see how many icky concepts we can cram in as short a period of time as possible! Now, one icky concept per movie is cool: it has impact, it has horror, it's the focus of all your attention and the suspense is a line that runs up your spine. If you just dump as many as you can in a short period of time, it loses it's grotesque appeal and becomes... laughable. Like the movie. Plus, I have a huge TV with really good resolution, and I couldn't tell who was getting killed half the time. Which was no loss, since I didn't really care who was getting killed.<br /><br />Also?

Too much to suspend our disbelief for. The security space of the US is entirely open and a first extraterrestrial vessel can crash in some forest without raising any concern.

"Ms. Yutani: The world isn't ready for this technology. Col. Stevens: But this isn't for our world, is it, Ms. Yutani?" Is this predator-weapon the technology that could pacify the world by killing the aliens that menace it, or is a good old nuclear bomb more effective? Some human leaders will prefer destroying their own kind provided they themselves can survive and keep the power they have even if it becomes a power over graves and tombstones, as long as they themselves are not the collateral victims. I think it could have been more effective with this punch line: "But this isn't FROM our world, is it, Ms Yutani?" I even think a Ms Hu, or a Ms Hussein would have been a lot more pungent. When you start thinking how a film could be improved, it sure means it is not very good. Maybe we should go back to John Wayne.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I actually liked the first Alien Vs Predator movie so I thought this one would be just as good boy was I terribly mistaken.  The first thing that threw me off about this movie was when the predator comes to earth to take care of the aliens he is so careful to destroy any evidence of his involvement or he destroys any proof of the aliens or any parts of the ship that crashed on earth.  Now after painstakingly doing that for twenty minutes in the movie the predator kills a deputy(Who is in the forest looking for a lost father and son)and than skins him hoists him in the tree (Like in the first Predator movie)and leaves him to be found by all the other deputies later on.  Another plot hole in the movie was about a female marine who comes back home to her husband and daughter and near the end of the movie she is the only one who can fly the helicopter<br />for the other survivors.  That part made no sense to me was we just assume that since she is a marine she obviously knows how to fly a helicopter straight of the bat never knowing what true skills or training she has as a marine.  Another part is the plot line with the female marine and her daughter it just seemed that the directors and producers were falling back on the scenario of the movie Aliens when the character Ripley finds the young survivor Newt.  The movie just seems to borrow so many similarities and story plots from the previous Alien and predator movies that this just seemed to be pointless there was no true original<br />thought in this movie at all and I mean none at all.  The video and audio are great for this dvd though I give it that and the special affects were<br />very well done as well but for me that was all that the movie truly had to offer.  So I say to sci-fi fans if you want a truly good movie pass this one over if you're just looking for spectacular effects and gory death scenes this would be one to choose but don't expect anything else...</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>Let's get down to the point; The overall ambience of the movie is way too dark, some detail is lost even when adjusting the picture's brightness and contrast settings. The movie plots between the predator and the humans is somewhat disjointed and never quite reaches a synergetic staus. The storyline struggles to maintain the viewer interested at times, but it fortunately never quite crosses the boreness threshold. Dialogue is standard and the movie feels somewhat campy sometimes, but again barely so. Besides all the shortcomings mentioned above, I must say that I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. It is entertaining and it kept me at the edge of my seat. Aliens are still as nasty and frightening as I remember them from all the previous movies and their appeal is still high at least in my book (same goes for the predator!). Overall: VERY GOOD!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>ALIEN VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM is your typical monsters-on-the-loose movie. Back a million years ago, everyone wanted to see Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman, etc. Also, remember all of those Godzilla vs. Anyone-in-a-rubber-monster-suit movies on TV? Well, AVP is just the modern version of these silly match-ups. In such films, plot is secondary at best, as the whole reason for making / watching them is to see a monster smack-down. Remember Freddy vs. Jason? Was the storyline all that important, or was it just an excuse to get these two horror icons together? Hmmm. AVP: R wasn't completely awful, although it was way too dark (and I don't mean sinister). I had a hard time following it during much of the action, due to the lack of decent lighting. I turned the brightness way up and watched it in a room w/ no lights on -AT NIGHT! I still had trouble descerning what was going on at times! This was pretty frustrating! Now, as far as what I could see, I did not like the idea of the babies getting eaten, but at least it was only implied! As for the pregnant lady, it was gross, though it did fit the idea of making the "predalien" utterly reprehensible and worthy of extermination. The human "heroes" were generic, monster-fodder. What else could they be? Let's face it, in a movie like this, it's all about the critters killing each other anyway! In that respect, AVP: R isn't bad. I just wish I could have seen more of it!...</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Lighting is a key ingredient of any movie but it should not fail a movie by itself. In this movie, more than anything it detracts from what may have been at least a fair movie. Next, this should have been in the future with an off world colony, but once again present day humans are just meat on the slab for Aliens and Predators. My silly hope is that one of these will approach the game premise of the same name taking place in the future(Marines, Corporates, Predators, and Aliens fight in various future arena backdrops) or at least be more like Aliens 2 where at least the Marines got some payback on an off world colony. Here not a single human including the soldiers makes you respect them enough to think they could actually fight off a Predator or Alien. They spend most their time running from them. At least in Alien they trapped the humans on a ship and you truly felt fear. Here everyone is just impersonal so you don't feel any loss when the Aliens chow down or the Predator uses them for target practice. Perhaps in AVP 3 since at the end of this one they finally capture a Predator weapon. This movie is about a small town where a Predator that has been infested with an Alien crashes. Almost immediately we see a father and young son out hunting game become attacked and the Readers Digest version of infested. And so it goes for most of the town they are little more than casual considerations even if you find them slightly interesting. Add in that most of the scenes are so dark you can barely make anything out and you have a pretty forgettable movie.<br /><br />I of course bought this as I did all the Alien and Predator movies and the first AVP. Seriously not once did I feel the rush of fear or adrenalline I felt in the first Alien or first Predator. Even the sequels to those had alot more acting and action than this sad sequel to the first AVP. I have to say the first one was better where at least one woman and a Predator survived that was halfway likeable and all the scenes weren't so dark you couldn't see. I was rooting for the Predator "Scar". I really didn't care for the handful of human survivors in AVP 2, and the storyline was pretty weak. The military isn't called in till late, only to be part of the Alien Smorgasbord, and by then the hidden people in power are ready to nuke the town. I can't recommend this movie at all as anything but a rental if you have the slightest interest. Otherwise blow it off. If I had paid to see this in the theater I would have been ready to hurt someone for making me pay to see it. Poor quality DVD only because the director thought it was scary to shoot everything in the dark, no replayability. If you liked this then you probably will like another piece of trash movie that I can't even think of at the moment as this was so bad. In fact I doubt you have in fact seen all the other Alien and Predator movies. And don't try to tell me I don't know what I am talking about as I not only own all Alien and Predator movies, but I have been watching SciFi movies since the 1960s and have seen most that were made since "Melies the Magician".<br /><br />In fact I should have given this one star not two. At the very least you will notice the scenes  in the other movies are not so dark that you can't clearly make out the action. I highly recommend you go back and look at "Alien", "Aliens", "Predator", and "Predator 2" rather than wasting time on this one. If they had at least one truly visible fight between the Predalien and the Predator it would have redeemed itself but even that was so dark you couldn't see what weapon was used or who hit who. Seriously I don't want that battle in the rain on top a roof in the middle of the night without at least moonlight or some kind of light. Dark but visible is scary, but when you can't even make the figures out there is no scared, there is just wondering what was the director, camera person, and/or editor thinking. Add to this they kill each other, then are nuked along with all but a handful of townspeople that escape in a chopper and you have to ask why did I watch this exactly? I mention a good visible fight scene would have redeemed it but actually even some good acting might have. I guess with Sigourney Weaver, Lance Henriksen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Danny Glover are a hard act to follow, but I would have been happy with any acting ability at all. As one reviewer astutely observed this is more brainless horror than Alien and Predator sequel. Please assure me none of the people involved with this movie will have anything to do with another sequel if there is one. So let me recap, extremely poor lighting, acting, story, directing, sound, music, and sets. If you felt this was good please once again see "Aliens" and "Predator" and pay attention to the lighting, acting, directing, story, sound, music, and sets and you will see how excellent they are when done right. People claiming this is scary can not imagine sitting in the theater watching a creature pop out of John Hurt's chest the first time. "Aliens" had an incredible effect on movies and movie goers and scared the bajeebers out of me. This has the feel of a B movie, and I have seen better. I wish John Carpenter had directed it, it would have rocked.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>The idea of transporting Alien and Predator to an unsuspecting town somewhere in the U.S. and having them battle it out, seemingly destroying the whole down in the process, was a great idea, but unfortunately the execution here is only fair. I didn't hate the movie like many of the Alien and Predator fans here who gave it 1-star reviews; I thought the action and overall concept were good, but I do agree the movie had more than its share of problems.<br /><br />For one thing, I agree with many of the reviews here that the lighting was way too dark and it was difficult to see many if not most of the scenes. Add to that that many of the scenes take place at night, in dense forest, in darkened buildings after a power failure (how convenient), or even underground in the city's sewer system, there are plenty of opportunities to avoid wasting any photons. They even show people using night goggles in several scenes; well, they probably needed them just to get around the sets.<br /><br />There are too many characters to be developed in any meaningful way, but no doubt that was just to increase the body count, since all but a handful of them get killed off. And the action scenes were shot in that choppy way that often makes it hard to even follow the action, which I don't mind usually, but this movie had more of it than the original AVP.<br /><br />Still, there's plenty of action and gore if that's what you want, but as one disappointed reviewer here commented, you can't see the gore because it's too dark. But  be advised that this is the most violent Alien and Predator movie yet so it's not for everyone. There are scenes of aliens killing young children, teenage girls, and helpless pregnant mothers. They have to keep escalating the violence with each movie, so if it's interplanetary or intergalactic gore you want, you'll find plenty of it here. It's just not easy to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>What can you say about a film that takes two of movie history's greatest monsters, not to mention greatest creature designs and puts them in an all out brawl of a movie? Yeah! Grab some popcorn and get ready for the Saturday night fights! This film wastes no time getting to the action and there is plenty of it. I'm a fan of both movie series and I must admit this is a guilty pleasure for me. The film is actually pretty good although it can be frustrating at times because a lot of the film is in very dark places, making it a chore to figure out what monster did what to whom! I understand that most Alien Predator films have this style, but this one is particularly dark. It's still a fun movie and worth seeing for fans. I watched the Unrated version which wasn't too hard core, but plenty of impalements to keep gore hounds happy. The single disc version doesn't have all that much in the way of extras. Some commentaries etc. No making of creature design...which would have been nice since you don't get any really good looks at these awesome monsters. I would have given this film a little better rating, if the film wasn't so dark and the extras were better. Too bad. :-(</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>DO NOT PURCHASE IT. THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IS EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE DVD IS DEFECTIVE.

When a Predator scout ship crash-lands in the hills outside the town, Alien facehuggers are released in the crash, and an even more evil creature - a hybrid Alien/Predator - is also released. A man & his son hunting in the forests near the crash site soon become the first victims of the facehuggers, and when a Predator receives data about the crash on his home planet, he comes to Earth. To be honest, this movie was a bit of a let down.  I really had a hard time connecting with any of the characters. This movie is not a complete waste, I was moderately entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>After AVP, I felt this franchise was dead. As a huge fan of the original Alien, Aliens and Predator, the AVP film was silly and inconsequential to me. Many of the scenes involving fights and the dialogue of the humans was almost comical (one of my "favorites" is when the human and predator "team up" and are running in sync with hair and braids flying in sync)-looks like I was in a romantic comedy. The first AVP was also very dark and slow moving.<br /><br />While AVP 2 Requiem does not come close to the quality of fright and "wow" reactions I experienced for the original franchise films, the second part, had a faster pace and some interesting "species" specific on screen behavior (such as the "insemination" of the human mothers). The scenes still remained overly dark, but the PQ and AQ were more than adequate. The sound was powerful and detail crisp.<br /><br />I was happy to see the return of a strong female lead character, although at times, there were simply too many characters to become invested in the survival. The end was a bit abrupt, but the last scene with "Mrs. Yutani" provided a twist that tied the first Alien movies to a possible sequel.<br /><br />In addition, I wish there had been a prolonged battle scene between the two species. They seemed more like "scuffles".<br /><br />For its effects and redemption, this film is worth a rent if you're a fan of the other films. Lets hope the next film continues a positive evolution of the franchise and introduces a more focused plot and developed characters.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>THIS IS A DIFFENTELY FOUR STARS THOSE WHO DONT THINK SO ARE OUT FOR LUNCH OR MAYBE SOME ZOMBIE ATE THER BRAINS</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>Have you seen Alien, Aliens and Predator? If so this will look familiar. Bits from these movies and a few bits from some of the lesser sequels are strung together to make an action flick, which whilst having the same creatures lacks any originality. So we get a recreation of 'Newt' from Aliens a Ripley like strong female character and all manor of other rip-offs from the other films in both series. In my view Alien vs Predator (2004) was a decent attempt to keep a franchise alive. Not brilliant but certainly worth watching. This isn't worth watching.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original films, or your have only seen Alien vs Predator you will have no understanding of my criticisms. If so go back to the beginning and watch 'Alien' (1979) alone in the dark for one of the scariest horror/Sci-fi films ever made. Then watch 'Aliens' (1986) to see the best war movie in space ever made. Finally watch 'Predator' (1987), which is not in the same class as Alien/Aliens but is still a high class action/Sci-fi movie.<br /><br />When you have done that you should then watch 'Requiem' and all will be revealed (tripe).</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>the first Predator was great, the second was good.

The plot was lacking somewhat when it came to character development as it seemed to just be a film building up the the massacring of most of the characters in the most gory way possible. There was a great deal of different characters in this film which didn't seem like it was giving us a main human character.<br />The gore is definitely something that the Strause brothers wanted to focus on in this film as it seemed to be neglected in the first AVP. This had a very interesting premise when compared to the first film, the first AVP was based in an underground isolated temple whereas this film was based in an American town which lead to a lot of chaos. The urban setting was something I have wanted to see the Aliens in and is something I have wanted to see the Predator in again since Concrete Jungle.<br />As explained previously this had a number of characters but what seemed to be a lack of a main human character. I felt this pulled a lot away from the movie as it didn't give us someone to root for as opposed to the first film when we had Sanaa Lathan.<br />The Strause brothers set out to make a completely different film when compared to the first and that's something they truly achieved. It's a fun popcorn movie that the casual film fan would enjoy emensely.<br /><br />Get it, you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie has a lot of scary and suspensful scenes for two-third of the its length. It's full of action from the begining till the end. It's one of the best movies released on DVD in 2008. However, I still think the Predator is still the best movie of the franchise. It's because the suspense never lets up in that film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I remember when both Alien and Predator were popular movies.  BOTH had me pretty frightened as a young child with his mind constantly wondering and unsure what was even going on!<br /><br />Now, many years later, I'm an adult now, and yet, I still feel somewhat scared when I watch the movies, because they portray humans unable to defend themselves against these huge POWERFUL creatures, and I think that's the thing that bothers me the most.<br /><br />Alien vs. Predator was disturbing in that, it seemed whenever someone lost their life, their friends and family would die next, in graphic ways.<br /><br />This movie shows everything from little kids having aliens shoot from their bellies while hunting in the woods, to pregnant women in hospitals having aliens munch through their stomach and stick their sharp dangerous teeth in the air, while the patients and nurses were forced to watch these graphic things happen.<br /><br />This made Alien vs. Predator a VERY scary film.  One I highly recommend.  Everything from nurses getting their heads popped off, to sharp teeth chewing on peoples faces, to a pizza delivery boy getting his buns kicked by the new boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />It WILL be a bit hard keeping track of what's going on half the time though, because there's like, 20 different main characters in the film, showcasing a variety of different friends and families, and because the film takes place at night time for the most part, it's hard to tell who actually won the fight between the alien and the predator.  I think the creature with green juice squirting out of him lost.<br /><br />There WERE some predictable moments though, such as the monsters swimming through swimming pools while people were in the pool, and you KNEW they would swim after the people.<br /><br />The amount of blood is very very high throughout the film.<br /><br />Oh, and the ending scene is VERY cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>AvP-R is another by the number sequels that has cool special effects ut easily could have been released direct to DVD instead of coming to the big screen.

He's such a bass a** alien. I liked Predator 1 and 2 more than the AVP sequel, however the AVPs were still great to watch.<br /><br />AVPR is different from AVP because this time Predator is fighting against an Alien that mutated into something between the Alien type and the Predator one. He's something in between! He's also stronger than the regular Aliens Predator used to fight against in AVP.<br /><br />The movie stayed exciting tll the end. I didn't appreciate the ending that much because the Aliens and Predator got killed very easily by humans via a nuclear bomb. But I guess that was the only way to get rid of them since Aliens were spreading all over the place.<br /><br />Anyway, I really don't wana see a new AVP movie anymore.

But I was definitely surprised that there was a sequel. For the uninitiated, the Strause brothers are visual effects artists who make their directorial debut with Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Their background shows in the snippets they steal from the Aliens and Predator franchises - an APC escape here, a human mamma grizzly protecting her young there. It's like Requiem was made by people who vaguely remember only the good parts of the two original films.  The problem is that there are important aspects of the Alien and Predator movies that are completely missed here.<br /><br />The Predator known as Wolf is a "cleaner" of sorts who is summoned from the Predator home world to clean up after the Alien mess of his comrades.  So the first thing he does upon landing on Earth is to skin a hapless deputy.  Thing is, Predators have a form of honor, and the deputy doesn't so much as fire on the Predator, much less threaten it.  Skinning simply doesn't make sense - Predators do that to trophy prey, particularly prey that fights back.  The cleaner wasn't even after humanity - he's there to clean up the Alien mess, after all.  So why skin the deputy? Because that's what Predators do...right? Or at least, that's all the Strause brothers could remember from the original film.  The Aliens explode, bleeding all over the place, but there are no ill effects. Wait...Aliens have acidic blood?  The Strause brothers don't remember that either.<br /><br />Maybe you're not a diehard fan of either franchise and just want to see monsters kill each other.  Well that's too bad, because the Strause brothers, using all their visual effects skills, mask everything in darkness, rain, and shadow. The Predalien, which looks pretty goofy, is never shot in full light.  Very little can actually be seen in this film. Perhaps that's a good thing.<br /><br />In addition to not respecting the franchises and marginal special effects, Requiem is just plain mean.  Children are face-raped by a facehugger. Infants are threatened (and, mercifully, eaten off screen). A pregnant woman is violated by the Predalien as it pumps eggs down her throat into her womb. This movie is ugly in a way that doesn't add to the plot.  It's just a lame attempt to distract from how lazy this film really is.<br /><br />How lazy? Glad you asked: humans recover from life-ending wounds that killed Predators in previous films,  a power station is invented so it can be blown up, sewers are invented so they can be slogged through, and a military mom returns from a tour of duty to give her daughter nightvision goggles as a gift (?!). It's enough to make you yearn for the good old days when Paul W.S. Anderson worried about violating the continuity of the previous films.<br /><br />Nasty, brutish, and mercifully short (101 minutes), the only bigger bomb than the ridiculous nuclear blast at the end of the movie is the film itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Picking up where AvP left off, AvPR begins with the Predators leaving Earth with the body of their fallen comrade, the last "man" to face the dreaded Alien queen.  Unbeknownst to them, the dead hunter was "implanted" with an alien embryo, a "chestburster".  However, unlike previously known Alien warriors, this one has distinctly Predator features.  When the "Pred-Alien" is unleashed, the Predators' ship crashlands in the Pacific Northwest, its cargo waiting to visit terror on the unsuspecting inhabitants of a small town....<br /><br />The most tragic thing about this horrible film is that we at the Rotten Review went into it with very low expectations.  Before our pessimism could be proven on target however, AvPR actually began showing potential.  That's right - AvPR could have been good, dare we say, it could have seriously rocked, become that fabled movie to rival "Aliens" on countless internet forums.  Here was an Alien movie that was willing to go the distance in escaping the confines of what we know to be an Alien movie.  The 1st Alien in '79 was set aboard a futuristic starship, crewed by professionals who at least knew how to start looking.  Successive sequels had characters who were informed, had their own technology or simply lazy scripting.  Here however, both Aliens and Predators are completely unknown - what a great way to jumpstart at least one of the two franchises here.  There's no 'Face-Hugger Wiki" for the heroes to log into.  The setting is also promising - the vast forests of the Pacific NW and the remote towns that dot it.<br /><br />It's all downhill from there.  Despite the millions doubtlessly spent to produce this movie, there's not a sign of a penny to be found on screen.  There isn't a single identifiable character in this movie, not even the doomed ones.  The story was so poorly paced, we began to wonder if, by some error, we were simply watching somebody (a nooby) play the game version of the movie.  The action scenes are horribly filmed - it's almost impossible to undertsand what's going on.  Between fast camera work and poor lighting, it's impossible to identify the "Predalien" among the other aliens.  The plot is so nonexistent, it's like the writers were annoyed by their own story.  The real mystery is why it was made - it doesn't appear that anybody was the slightest bit interested in the story.  The ending is stultifyingly simplistic - the kind of thing the main characters could have figured out in the first 20 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />A few problems with the direction that AvP has taken - at least the Alien franchise.  AvP unwisely explores the school of thought that Alien chestbursters develop according to the characteristics of their unfortunate hosts.  The problem with this is that if the Aliens seen up until now were patterned according to us, and the Pred-Aliens blow that away, then previously-seen Aliens must be the wimps of the Alien universe.  Sure, they're tough on us, but that's because we human beings are losers.  Stacked up against Aliens burst from more serious chests, and even those guys are history.  If the Pred-Aliens are so much more challenging, then why didn't the Predators ever find a way to make them - it's as if they chose the wimpy aliens.  The story never fills the plot hole of why the Pred-Alien is so much tougher when its host relied heavily on high-tech weaponry and invisibility (admittedly, this is a conceit underlying all Predator stories - for all their technlogy, it's a miracle that they don't have the physique of a teenage xbox champion.  Also, how the Predators missed the Pred-Alien to begin with shows that these guys are just idiots with funny costumes - they could have written this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Warning to Alien & Predator fans, STAY AWAY, you might cry due to the destruction of a franchise!<br /><br />As a kid, I have fond memories of having nightmares of aliens after watching "Aliens," and looking in the shower, because you never know when one's going to pop out at you. Predator/The Future Governor Movie, also has a fun place in my book. Flash-forward to this unfortunate movie, and the franchise of both characters are utterly destroyed like the nuclear bomb at the end. Real actors? We can use bad/obscure ones! Character building? Who needs it! Gore? Got it! Shock? You'll be horrified!<br /><br />In fact, the only actor I found recognizable is childhood Shawn from the TV show Psych, and an alien leeches on his face and pops out of his stomach... This is a 10-year old kid we're talking about! But why stop there? How about a particularly disturbing scene where an Alien pops out of a pregnant woman, or an Alien finds himself in maternity ward? It's just simply disgusting. Because let's face it, they dumbed it down to today's disgrac... distasteful group of teens. There's teen sex, the blonde bimbo, the gore, and yes, all the intelligence of a gnat is used in this movie. I mean, the majority of the movie is set in a dark, rainy town where it's hard to see any of the action.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a teen, or not a fan of these franchises, or somebody that likes mindless horror films, in more ways than one, then this is the movie for you. For the rest of us "normal" people, don't see this, because you'll be regretting it if you do. By the end, I felt like I had an Alien popping out of my stomach. By the way, what would the citizens of Colorado think of having a nuke dropped in their state? There goes the tourism dollars!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>Be forewarned. If you want to be able to see any of the action in this film, you will have to watch it with all the lights off. The film is dark and the action sequences are terribly frustrating as you can't see what's going on. I watched it with every light out in my living room and only my kitchen light as backlighting and it was torture. But I was determined to tough it out in order to witness the final battle between the Predator/Alien hybrid and the Predator warrior. I could barely see what was going on. Even the daylight scenes are strangely dark, like a filter was used. Other than that, the film is OK, but not terribly well written. The war vet heroine does a fair imitation of Sigourney Weaver. There are moments of homage to both the Alien and Predator films and the end of the movie is a rip-off of Terminator. The basic plot is that the Predator ship containing the hybrid and alot of facehuggers crashes on Earth, they all get loose and attack a small town. A Predator warrior comes to Earth to destroy them and spends most of his time pouring acid on their victims to eliminate all traces of the Aliens. The US government gets wind of all this and (spoiler alert) nukes the town. There's a lot of screaming in the dark. And that's about it. Oh, and there's an annoying cameo by the actor who plays the medical examiner in CSI-NY which is very distracting. This film is not recommended even for hardcore Alien and Predator fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>There's an old adage in the horror world: What you don't see is scarier than what you do see.  Or words to that effect.  I believe them, whole-heartedly.  The problem is, when there IS something to see, make sure your audience can freaking SEE it.<br /><br />That was the main problem with this film: It was way too dark.  If you haven't seen it yet, you might be thinking: "Oh, get over it.  Horror movies are supposed to be dark."  Yes, they are.  But when your central character (in this case, an Alien-Predator hybrid) is never revealed, because it's always in shadows...then there's a problem.  It's obvious the Brothers Strause were going for atmosphere, which I admire.  However, they completely failed--what we have is a picture in which all the great fight scenes are obscured, where a character dies at a central point and we can't even see which character it is.<br /><br />Everyone else has said it, so I shall too: I'm a huge Aliens and Predators fan.  I grew up on the movies and the toys; some of my first reading material consisted of the Aliens and Predators novel series (which may explain a thing or two about my twisted imagination).  Don't get me wrong--I wasn't expecting gold here.  The plot is lame, the acting is horrific, the dialogue is abominal--you know the drill by now.  But, gosh darnit all, it's a freakin' ALIENS AND PREDATORS movie--with an Alien-Predator hybrid!  If that's not something for us Alien/Predator fans to drool over, then I don't know WHAT is.<br /><br />The film was just poorly made; that's it.  The special effects would be great, if we could see them.  We'll ignore the numerous plot holes: characters actually running on foot into town, when they have the time and mental clarity to grab a set of car keys and take the SUV; how the Aliens' acid blood doesn't melt everyone and everything it falls on (that helicopter should NOT have been able to fly); how the single Predator can take on two or three Aliens at a time without his gun...these things are, in the long run, meaningless.  We aren't expecting the Academy Awards to acknowledge this pic.  We just expect good special effects, with a lot of violence and gore and slime and beastie-on-beastie action.  And we get it--we just can't see it.  That's the movie's ultimate downfall: It fails to deliver its goods.  Maybe next time (because you know another one's coming), we'll be able to see what happens.  As for now...well...watch the first one?</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Call his films horrible, badly-written and even filled with ripoff shots and scenes disguised as homages, at least Paul W.S. Anderson films are watchable in that dumb fun way (unlike Uwe Boll who can't even entertain a lobotomy patient). When Anderson took on the Alien vs. Predator series, many groaned when it came out since it had all the aforementioned trademarks as well as being PG-13 and rather tame considering the violence found in both franchises. The sequel, clearly with intent to change that, also falls into the same problems: it's dumb, unmemorable and inexplicably, it's kind of hard to see.<br /><br />Taking place directly after Anderson's film, a "Predalien" (hey, just be glad people didn't dub it the "Alienator") causes problems on the ship, causing it to crash on Earth. With a distant Predator answering the call, he's on his way to stop not only the Predator/Alien hybrid and occasionally killing any human that comes his way. Several humans such as a delivery boy, some high school students, a soldier returning from duty and a sheriff band together to hopefully escape the town alive.<br /><br />Besides "Predator", the films always centered on low lighting and creepy environments to get you in the frame of mind. However, not a single director confused too much darkness for horror and regardless of the lighting, you could always see what was happening. Not here since I'm not kidding when I say this is probably one of the dimmest and visually dull looking films I've come across. Even scenes in the daylight seem somewhat muted and things get awful when in places like sewers or dark hallways where it's hard to tell what you're looking at. One time, one human died and I couldn't even tell who it was; I'm serious. Couple that with the oft-used tendency to have quick editing during fight scenes and it's a pain just to watch the film.<br /><br />That is but one of the film's problems since it's badly-written with awful dialogue, unmemorable characters (I just watched and I could remember maybe...2 names?) and there's just plot holes and dumb decisions all over the place. AVP always felt to me like a good B-movie franchise but that doesn't mean they have to literally make something that bad. At least the violence is a bit more obvious and nastier than the first one but other times it seems more cruel and violent for the sake of being violent, as evidenced by a hunter and his son and a group of pregnant women.<br /><br />Anderson's take on the franchise may not be a good film by any means but strange for me to admit but I kind of liked it in that "it didn't waste my time" way. The sequel improves on key areas but then it fails utterly and completely in many other levels. Why they can't seem to get it right is very disheartening.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>Aliens Versus Predator - Requiem (or AVP: R for short)...where to begin with this piece of cinematic garbage?  First I'll begin with saying that I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise of movies and find the Predator franchise fun, but nothing really more than blockbuster films.  Secondly I'd like to say most movies I find some redeeming value in, be it silly, or serious.  From Ed Wood to films to many others of that nature there are bad films that you might find entertaining in their sheer absurdity.  AVP: R is not one of those movies.<br /><br />So what could possibly make this movie so horrific bad?  I mean everyone thought an R-rated AVP movie would be a great way to counter the let down of Paul W.S. Anderson's PG-13 film released several years prior...well the rating may say "ages 17 and up" as opposed to Anderson's "Ages 13 and up" but somehow the Strausse brothers have managed to make an even more childish movie than has ever managed to defile either one of these two franchises.<br /><br />This movie takes the Alien and Predator franchises where they've never been before.  A wondrous realm of endearing horror that surely no one would ever associate with either franchise; I am of course talking about the most infamous of horror sub-types aside from zombies: the dead teenager genre.  Essentially both Alien and Predator have both been beaten to death and buried by Fox (Alien Resurrection, Predator 2, and AvP) but none can compare to the audacity of Aliens versus Predator Requiem.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the Predator-Alien hybrid (as seen at the end of the first AvP) running amuck throughout a small Colorado town.  Their goal?  To rip-off as many scenes from the original Alien movies as possible! Why of course!  Of course a predator has to be involved for this to be Aliens versus Predator so a Predator, named `Wolf' by the production team (after the Pulp Fiction character - they forget the timeless rule of "Never reference good movies in your bad one") comes in to cover up the signs of the aliens...which you soon realize makes little to no sense because as fans know Predators are not ones for subtlety; between their skinning people alive, hanging them, skull ripping, and nuclear explosives they do not make for ones who care much about covertly cleaning up a mess they made.<br /><br />But somewhere the script forgot this was a horrifically bad action movie so they tried to add in some poorly scripted drama and clich&eacute; characters.  As if this movie couldn't get any worse they got the dead-teenager route to produce some of the most moronic characters I have ever laid witness to - EVEN by dead-teenager standards these characters are bad!<br /><br />Then we have the special effects which in their own way give this film even more of a sci-fi channel original feel.  I have never seen CGI and animatronics look quite as fake as this.  Those rare people who complain about the puppet facehuggers and chestbursters of the original Alien films- not to worry!  In cheap CGI they truly look horrific.  The effects are not subtle, and the gore is so stupid that even if you're one who enjoys schlock films you won't find any amusement.<br /><br />So let's overview this:<br />Alien movie: Fails<br />Predator movie: Fails<br />B-horror movie: Isn't even cheesy enough to be that entertaining<br />Gore:  Stupid, pointless, and no fun even for a raging gore-a-holic<br /><br />This movie is one to avoid at all costs.  It's dumb, every other scene rips off its far superior predecessors, and the directors seem to have no control over the mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>Okay, first of all this movie is rated R, it's a horror movie, and it's based on 7 previous films (6 of them were full of blood, violence, and language). This means: blood, language, violence will be the highlight of Aliens vs Predator: Requiem.<br /><br />After the first AvP came out with a rating of PG-13, many fans felt cheated. They wanted to see the gore they had come to love and expect whenever the predators showed up to collect some skulls.<br /><br />The cast is made up unknowns so I won't even attempt to give them any kind of recognition. (see later in this post why*)<br /><br />AvP 2 picks up right where AvP left off. There's a predator who has an alien inside it. The alien bursts out of the predator while it flies off into space. This alien happens to be a hybrid of Alien and Predator. An attack follows and the ship crashes back on earth.<br /><br />Elsewhere, on the predator homeworld, a buddy locates the downed ship and travels to earth to "clean up" the mess.<br /><br />We now have aliens running amok in a small town and a predator trying to fix everything.<br /><br />*Basically, the humans are in this movie to provide the deaths. Heads explode, faces dissolve, arms get blown off, people get impaled against the wall. You can understand that this movie is ultra violent.<br /><br />The sad part is that this movie, nor the first one, live up to the original Alien and Predator movies.<br /><br />Too much stuff to keep most people away from this movie, but then again, it is rated R for a reason.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LAA9SCENXLKN.html">A2LAA9SCENXLKN</a><br/><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. However, in this review I am reviewing the Unrated version.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />A.V.P:R|UN-R[4.0BETA](2007)<br /><br />What's the problem with the movie? Well, lemme tell you the good things. Every good thing from all 9 previous installments of the two separate franchises is carried into this film. Now for the bad things. There are horrid side stories that don't MATTER to this film. IN ALL OTHER ALIEN AND PREDATOR MOVIES, THE SIDE STORIES USUALLY MEANT SOMETHING! HERE THERE JUST ADDED TO MAKE THE FILM OVER 100 MINUTES!!!!! @#$%. And here's the real crap. Everything that is good about this movie, has the Ninja Assassin effect. YOU CAN'T SEE ANY OF IT. True both Alien and Predator (and Batman) movies are typically dark, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE ANY OF THE BRAWL!!! Do you understand? If you can't see anything, WHY HAVE IT!?!?!<br /><br />Oh wait, you can see something. THE STUPID SIDE STORIES!!! It's half the time boring, half the time as dark as space. Now, I will say something good about this movie. It updates the original ALIEN title screen from the first Alien, to say AVP:R and be more awesome. But that's just flashy effects covering up the horridness of this film. AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL! The action is awesome and fast pace, the screams and blood are top notch, and everything good about the original installments is carried into this one. YOU JUST CAN'T @#$%ING SEE ANYTHING!!!!<br /><br />Who the he11 is the cast&crew director...let's see...wikipedia...The Strause Bros.! Let's see what they've done...well I can see why the effects are so good they are special effects masters...m hm...Holly $#!T! They've done The X-Files Movie? The Nutty Professor? Titanic...oh wait...they're just special effects masters. They haven't directed a single film besides AVP:R. YOU DON'T DO THAT! A Big Blockbuster or any major film with a big budget doesn't deserve first time directors. Film directors should have experience in original material of independent matter and not jump immediately. Spielberg did two independent films before he directed a TV movie before he directed Jaws! YOU NEED EXPERIENCE!!!<br /><br />And only having experience with special effects is the worst kind. But this does worry me, because wouldn't a special effects guy know your movie hast to be bright? Wouldn't a special effects duo be used to bright effects? Well let's get the producer. John Davis is the big one. Holly $#!T, The Predator Trilogy? AVP? But no, he's produced some stuff you might not be so fond of. Asteroid, WaterWorld, Little Monsters, the new Dr. Dollitle, I Robot, Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties, and Marmaduke. But surely he couldn't have messed up the lighting for those movies, most of them are dead bright! Maybe the Predator movies and I, Robot aren't so bright but the lighting in them is still good!<br /><br />So another producer is on the list...Walter Hill. He is a screenwriter. He shouldn't know anything about lighting, and all the stuff he's done is unknown. I guess he co-wrote Aliens, but between 3 people! And I think we all don't like Alien 3, but I do. The only two notable films he didn't direct and are between more than one person. HE'S NEVER PRODUCED! I blame him. He had no experience, and just thought to himself "Alien and Predator are traditionally dark movies." Blaugh. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's see what else is in store. For one thing this movie has credit for, is for showing us a more in-depth look at the Predator ship and homeworld. But those come very early and don't really help this film.<br /><br />I could see they wanted to make a third AVP, because most people thought they could before the first came out, and I see that they've been testing on the Alien parasites. This could lead to some really good stories. In fact, look at the comics and video games that have come out!!! There's a scene in this film where both the father and son die from an alien in their stomach. I found this ironic, but some might just find this disturbing or even symbolic. I don't know, it's all three put into a pile of mashed potatoes. Here's something to piss you off: when a parasite isn't moving it's real effects! When it isn't moving, IT'S FLIPPING CGI! ASYLUM STYLE CGI! I thought the directors were special effects masters! But I guess it's the producers fault, for one had no experience producing and the other had produced terrible CGI.<br /><br />I will admit that the PredAlien (terrible name,) has a really cool design. IT'S TOO BAD WE NEVER GET AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT IT! The characters are idiotic, the storyline is idiotic, the lighting is idiotic, the makers of the film are idiotic, it is non-attention grabbing and the dialogue is idiotic! @#$%! This movie gets a 1.5/5!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>When a Predator spacecraft carrying Alien prisoners and face-huggers - as well as some crossbred experiments - has an accident and crash lands on Earth, humanity has no chance for survival.  Each wandering human on camera is certainly doomed.  Humanity's only hope is a master hunter from planet Predator, a creature with unequaled hunting prowess and futuristic weapons.<br /><br />The situation in town quickly becomes chaotic, with Aliens spitting out chest-bursters left and right.  A few stereotypical, assembly line characters not worth mentioning by name band together to feebly protect themselves from a town being taken over so quickly and completely that within 12-hours there is an Alien on the city council.  Meanwhile, master Predator follows human viscera, blood spatter, and a slug trail of Alien ejaculate throughout town in his version of CSI.<br /><br />Dumb father of dumb kid: "It sure is dark here."<br />Alien: "Oh hai...I'm gonna eat youuu.  Get back in there little mouth."<br />Human kid: "Don't kill my fodder!"<br />Predator: (Infrared mode) sees face-hugger carcass, follows bread-crumb trail of slime<br /><br />That's pretty much the movie.  There's a cool new Alien method of shoving eggs into pregnant women, and someone repeats the classic, "Get to the choppah" line from Predator, but otherwise it's a forgettable.  And the main reason it's forgettable?  The lighting is atrocious.<br /><br />Half the time you don't even know what's going on.  It is without a doubt, the worst lit movie I have ever seen.  Open, window-filled rooms are dungeons.  Sewers are absolute black holes.  There were several scenes I wish I had seen - and my eyes were open - but there was no way to ascertain what was happening.  None of the actors really stand out - a result of mediocre acting, a bad script, as well as the previously mentioned viewing issues.  The contrast level of my TV could not be calibrated enough to compensate for the "filming eclipse" technique used like camouflage.  Since the DVD release doesn't have a night vision or "through the Predator's eyes" mode, it is almost pointless to watch a movie through an ink-filled lens.<br /><br />Watching this again, recommending it to others...I can't see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Here we are with the second installment in the Alien vs Predator series and already there is the definite smell of something rank in the air,and it is not a dead alien.It is unfortunately the beginning of the decay of this franchise and if something is not done to correct the situation it will be permanently terminated;and I for one will be glad of it,for its' sake and ours.That is something I thought I would never find myself saying about this series because the first one while not that good either,had much more going for it plot and acting wise,even though I rated that only three stars.As with that movie,the special effects/aliens in Requiem are the whole movie;the best things/"actors" in it.<br />The story starts off with the crash of the ship from the first AVP movie into a forest near a town in Colorado.A man and his young boy are in the woods and find the crashed ship.Both are lept upon by facehuggers.We are then introduced to a guy just out of prison who arrives in town by bus and is greeted by the sheriff who he obviously is friends with.We are then introduced to a young man(who is the brother of the ex con)who of course is disenfranchised with his job and ends up with a delivery to  the house of a girl he knows.He makes with his delivery,and with the eyes,but as he departs he is set upon by her boyfriend and two others.We next meet a female soldier on leave(?)from active duty who is returning home to her husband and their young daughter who she hasn't seen in some time and the daughter is not in a particularly huggy-smoochy mood.This is the first 20 minutes of the film! Do the words "information overload" come to mind? Also "plot contrivances"? This is pretty run of the mill,hokey material the writer is dishing up here which is the worst way to begin a movie.You try and grab your audience from the start not alienate them(sorry for the pun).<br />The film moves on with civilian search parties out in force to look for the man and boy who went missing.Of course the upset mother is there and the stero-typical guns-are-us friend who informs the sheriff when he suggests they go home:"We look after our own".<br />As the film winds its' way along the townspeople of course are totally ignorant of the larger picture being played out by the aliens until they're practically shaking tails with them,and of course by then death reigns supreme.But there is a predator here too folks who has come from the homeworld to save the day and throughout he stalks,fights and shoots his way through hoards of these creatures,never giving an inch.Some nice scenes there.<br />Finally the National Guard is called in but they're no match for the aliens swarming the town and are dispatched by the blood thristy creatures in a timely manner.At this point the picture is concerned with the survival of a now tiny band of survivors which includes the sheriff,the ex con and his brother and the servicewoman and her daughter.When the troupe come upon the dead Guardsmen,who should coincidentally be there,and trained,in how to drive the armoured peronnel carrier? The servicewoman of course.And later when the group reaches the top of the hospital in order to use the helicopter to escape in,who is there again that just so happens is rated in flying it,and does? The servicewoman.What a coincidence!<br />In the end the whole town is nuked and the escaping helicopter crashes far from town in the woods.Soon after we get a back reference to the original Predator movie as the 'copter survivors are surrounded by a special force unit dressed similarly to Schwarzeneggers' band of men.They confiscate a predator weapon one of the surviving group is carrying.As the movie closes the weapon has been delivered into the hands of Ms.Yutani,as in the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.We have met Mr.Weland(or his likeness) before in the original Alien movies and in the last AVP,but this is the first time we have met the other half of the corporate name.It's too bad such an interesting ending should be couched by such an uninteresting and unappealing movie.<br />The Aliens here,as I said before,ARE this movie.And there are some interesting things we come to see and learn about both species.For example this is the first time we see the Predators' homeworld and a device which instead of being a nuking/exploding one(in order to destroy evidence) rather implodes it.With the Aliens we see a new predator/alien hybrid which this time seems to be androgynous and is queen-like in its' nature,as it controls the actions of all the aliens.It stands a bit taller than either the predator or alien but can inject through mouth to mouth contact alien eggs into its' victims.When they burst through there are three or four of them at once.<br />The actors in this movie are,what can I say,lesser known(can you say "cheaper budget"?).However even though lesser actors have made better(even great)movies,such is FAR from the case here.I feel especially sorry for the gentleman who played the sheriff.This should have been a great part and played with much elan and strength,yet a more wussy lawman I've never seen;he's weak and indecisive,the kind that can get you killed and he does.It is not all the actors' fault though.There is also the lethal combo of a bad script and even more bad direction;which is what really what hangs over this entire pictures' shoulders like a heavy yoke.<br />In conclusion, unless you are a compleatist(like me)you should avoid this newest AVP movie like a field of alien egg sacks.The only reason I didn't give the movie a one star is because of the special effects/aliens in the picture.They are generally first rate and there are at least some tantalizing crumbs of knowledge advancement concerning them here.But this  is a car with no engine;it looks good on the surface but there's nothing under the hood.<br />If 20th Century Fox has ANY desire to see this franchise continue at all it has to get better writing,someone with a good sense of direction and more especially people with a more thorough understanding of the franchises' roots both Predator and Alien.For if this movie is any indication of the direction it is going to continue to go in,they might as well dig the grave,throw it in,cover it over and put the tombstone up right now.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>After a lack luster release of Hitman I was hoping Fox would really put some effort into AVP Requiem,sorry but they didn't.First the good the DTS lossless audio really feels up the room with nice deep bass,really decent dialouge,and some great surround work.Also like the Hitman release this is a two disc release with the extra disc being downloadable to your computer or other portable device's.I really like this move by Fox,I think its great I can download and watch this legally to my computer if I'm away from home.Also if special features is your thing there plenty here for that,there's really to many to list but it includes two separate commentary's and plenty of Making of's and those sort's of things.<br />  Now the bad,first and worst is the picture,the picture is plenty sharp and shows some promise here and there but boy the contrast is terrible.Daylight scenes or at night the contrast is just off,it's just to dark for the most part.For those that spend alot of time tuning there TV's to that perfect contrast brightness ratio will be frustrated.Also the colors never really pop there not terrible just not very vivid either.On the good side the flesh tones are pretty good.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>What's with the lighting in this film.  Anytime there was an Alien or Predator in the scene, the lighting was nearly non existent.  I couldn't even tell if the special effects were any good, because I had trouble just trying to make out what was happening.  The story takes place in modern times which pre-dates all of the alien movies, but comes after the Predator stories.  The Predator/Alien hybrid is running amok along with several aliens and a revenge minded Predator.  I think the story took many liberties with the mythology of these races.  1.  Aliens have interacted with other alien creatures before and they always just hatch as standard aliens unless genetically tampered with.  2.  Multiple aliens bursting from the chest/stomach.  3.  The hybrid also has queen egg laying powers, but forgoes the egg and face hugger stage.  4.  The time for an alien from incubation to birth to full growth seems to have been sped up to about 10 minutes for this film.  What I liked about the film was the glimpse at the Predator home world and the ending(though I have seen it before in Return of the Living Dead).  What I didn't like was the frantic direction and the awful dialog in places.  This one is a miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Is it just me, or do SCI-FI fans take these & "Star Wars" to seriously, first of all to all you haters>>> "you don't own these films", why all the hate?, I read the reviews & finally watched AVPR for myself, & although the characters were somewhat one-dimesional, it didn't kill it for me, what I liked about this aside from the fact that it picks up where AVP left off, is the fact that a lone Predator comes to earth to wipe out some aliens, when the hybrid alien/predator crashes the ship seen at the end of AVP in a small Colorado town the face huggers get loose & start their infestation on the locals, a distress signal is sent to the Predator homeworld, & a lone Predator is dispatched to earth to clean up the mess, this Predator is very much like the one in the first "Predator" film with a take-no-prisoners approach & this dude can rock-&-roll, he is the coolest Predator yet & boy, does he kick the aliens a**, this is a simple film that held my attention, I don't know what these 1 star people were expecting, but for me this one was cool, some complain about the nursery scene, there is nothing to suggest the hybrid killed the infants, as far as we know they were nuked along with the rest of the town by the government, & once again we see further proof as to why the "Company" was so obsessed with capturing it in the "Alien" films, this subplot was really hinted at in this one, all in all this one was not a disappointment to me, although I wished the pretty blond had lived, I was not disappointed, the "Predators are some of the coolest characters to come out of Hollywood, & this Predator was cool, just as his kind were in the other films, & the Aliens are just as menacing & nasty here as they always are, & the DVD was not dark, movies do look better once they go from the big screen to DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>This movie is more loyal to the Predator series to me. It's back to the lone Predator and yes we all just about know his tricks, but this one is nonetheless still charged with that tension of a hunt in session. It also includes really bizarre twists to the hybrid universe of Aliens and Predators that you just have to see. I couldn't help to secretly cheer for the Predator who is more grounded by Rules of the Hunt. Unlike the Aliens who are strickly killing machines and the humans who seem to just try and gain your sympathy. This movie isn't stale by any means. I'm not some old stickler who demands too much and is pathetically attatched to what the Predator and Aliens use to be. I'm all in for change. Why make the same dull substance with such a changing audience? For me that would be so cowardly that I would be more upset about not giving it a try even if what they made was less than savory. The Extended Edition indulges in worthy things. Like getting to see how the Predator truely gears up for the most serious of Hunts. You see a better Intro and it all fits together making the ending seem more of a body of work complete. Excellent movie and the only reason it lacks the Highest standard, the fifth star rating, is because I compare it to all movies of both series. It certainly doesn't have the marvelous cinematography of Alien one, and it doesn't have a human character that I care about like Arnold in Predator.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>I could not believe it. This os simply one of the worst movies ever. IT's cheap, sickening, useless. IT does not serve even as mindless fun. evn if your turn off your brain, your senses will alert you how the intentions of the producers are fake, from the absurd lack of lightning (where you can't see the fights), to fast editing, through horrible "acting" and obnoxious directing (by two guys!)<br /><br />It's onet of the worst movies ever, where producers thought: "This is trash, but some people will enjoy it". It's the worst that Hollywwod can offer.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a sucker, because I've watched it. I did not even rent it, or downloaded it, I BOUGHT the DVD! (because, believe it or not, I thought the fist movies, although completely unecessary and forgettable twenty minutes after leaving the theater, an enjoyable one).</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Aliens vs. Predator Requiem picks up immediately where AVP Alien vs. Predator left off and the adventure starts with a bang.<br />I have to say that I am not a MAJOR fan of either the Alien or the Predator series, though I've seen all the previous movies and liked them. So, I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br />The acting is actually much better than its immediate predecessor (it was GREAT seeing Reiko Aylesworth from 24!), though the setting is not as good; AVP's Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones feel was definitely a bonus! Nevertheless, it is another action-packed thriller combining elements of adventure and horror.<br />The plot, the acting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the battle scenes, are all very good!<br />In conclusion, Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></br></body></html>

Still, I'll watch them, because scene to scene they have their moments and there are some very stellar (no pun intended) episodes scattered throughout.<br /><br />Next, I want to dis this film for some legitimate reasons.  To have Wil Weaton in the reception scene sitting next to his mom and then not use him in any other part of the film was ridiculous.<br /><br />I'm geeking out here, but considering Tasha Yar's daughter is Romulan, you'd think we'd encounter her as one of the Romulan commanders later in the film.  Since this is the final "future" Trek film, that would have been fitting to get all the cast members in.  How did they miss that one?<br /><br />The scene with Data and Picard in his Ready Room drinking wine and speaking of human ritual & bonds (I think that's what it was, it's been a while) should not have been cut. It's essential for both showing the audience more of the friendship between those two, the significant of the Chateau Picard wine toasted later in the film, and the poignancy of Data's sacrifice.  That cut was not only unnecessary, but detrimental to the film's arc.  Forget the "tempo", "momentum", or "rhythm" of the film.  We're not talking action scenes, here.<br /><br />The bat imagery and inspiration was a bit, how do I put this mildly, overt.  No, that's too kind.  It was beating me over the head with a big, dead, stinky bat, like some junior high student short story's grand creative stroke.  Less is more, folks.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue in the film, and one I probably let get in the way of my enjoyment of it, was the whole WMD, terrorism, and pro-Iraq invasion slant I perceived.  Now, the virgin terrorist bent on world domination with an awful WMD is something clearly Spiner and friends intended in the script.  The Iraq part was probably just my distaste with what was happening in the media at the time being unjustifiably channeled into the viewing.  I can't be sure, but I suspect that was unintentional and was just some bad luck in the timing of the film's release.  But, hey, maybe my first instincts were right.<br /><br />Nonetheless, like I said, I was too harsh on the film in the theater.  I was fuming, pissed even.  For the seeming Iraq slant, for Data's sudden death without the proper preparation and arc, for the soft, overly-groomed (common recent Trek problem), cheesy-looking Romulan Senate cgi scenes.  However, in retrospect, and especially considering that one scene I mentioned previously that should not have been cut, I think the film is mostly in the right place.  The ship to ship battle sequence at the end is masterful, combining all the techniques originated in the earliest TNG video games and novels, giving realistic division-of-tasks on the bridge, and presenting the events with a "truthiness" (finally, a use for that word!).  They were 3D, dynamic, nuanced, and believable within the established rules and technologies of this franchise.<br /><br />The short-hand and camaraderie between this troop of actors is here in full force.  I think they're right up there with the cast of MASH, quite frankly, and I'd put these actors in an echelon above that due to the serious and challenging subject matter they've dealt with over the years, not to mention the films. I really can't think of any other ensemble that's of this caliber, each and every one of them.  I'm still not certain the best aura of the series was ever captured in any of the films, but in this one I almost felt they arrived at something more.  Some of the kidding was put aside.  Not all, but more than most of the episodes and films.  There was a mature professionalism exuded by the characters.  Individuals well into the prime of their professional and personal lives, dealing with the threats, changes, growth, and loses life entails.<br /><br />The film's look, I have to point out before wrapping this up, is gorgeous.  The Romulan senate has that awful overly-groomed thing going on, like I said.  In the rest of the film, however, the textures, lighting, pure white lights to subtle colors, those lens flares, the fascinating hue of Data's skin and eyes...often all of this happening at the same time!  A feast for the peepers.  This is without a doubt not only the finest-looking Star Trek outing, but a striking visual achievement, by any standard.  It is not a five star film in my book, but in my opinion it was worth another look.  I know I'll be returning to it some more.  With reservations, but worthy nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I had stayed clear of this film mainly on recommendations of others, but when the Special Collectors Edition Series came along, I could hardly resist it. As Sci Fi Films go its not bad, but as a Star Trek film goes, I'll take a Captain Kirk film any day. I thought the basic story line was quite good, in the sci fi sense, but a total goose in the Star Trek Sense. Its not hard to  see why things went to horribly bad in the film, the director, as well as the principal writer were all non-trek oriented ( the main writer did admit to being a "Trekkie" however, when his idea<br />of advancing a plot was the glasses in Star Trek 2 that Bones gave to Kirk, then somethings wrong), also you can see how much of a heavy hand the Studio had in the edits with the deleted scenes... some of the most "Star Trek" styled moments just got the chop. Nemesis is a Good Sci-Fi film, but a superb example of how a franchise film is wrecked in the "do a film by Committee" style of film making that has so successfully killed many films.<br /><br />THE DVD: Great Extras. Lots of informative material in the commentaries, and in the disc 2 extras. Great to see Ron Perlman out of Makeup and without his digitally enhanced voice as Vice-Roy ( which he plays in NEMESIS).Very Good Collection of Interviews and lookbacks.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of the dark movies, it may create an evil effect, but also makes it hard for the viewer to enjoy all that there is to be seen.  This does live up to the Franchise history.  Good battle scenes, conflict between good and evil, and true victory to the one that out thinks or out strategizes the other.  I'm glad to see that they continue to bring the "technology" further into the future and that they allow the characters to grow and receive some "promotions" as side stories in it all.  All in all, I have to say that I wasn't really disappointed with this movie and have added it to my collection.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you should buy it.  If you like Sci-Fi movies, you should at least watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>I've heard it said that Nemesis was the last of the Next Generation movies (but how many last star trek movies had shatner..). It's a weak ending. The problem is a writer who hasn't written much and a director who is unfamiliar with the franchise and has little experience directing (though a lot of good editing jobs). It's an interesting story that centers around Picard and Data. Riker gets a good action sequence. Troi has a decent role. As does Jordi. But Worf was just overlooked in this film. They touched on all the different series in one way or another. I know that the Star Trek franchise won't end, even if it isn't the Next Generation cast anymore. I just hope that they can make movies better than this one. It's ok, but really only if you are already a fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>It had to happen sometime. Picard and crew had to engage for the last time. And they do in "Star Trek: Nemesis," a good, but not perfect 10th entry in the "Star Trek" movie series. Director Stuart Baird (Executive Decision) keeps a dark, violent tone throughout the film, a welcome element after the decidedly too cheery "Star Trek: Insurrection." The story is about the Romulans being taken over by an evil human-reman experiment, Shinzon, who happens to be a clone of Picard. Soon it is discovered that Shinzon hopes to take over the Romulan and Human races and probably rule the galaxy. That is, if the only man who knows him best can stop him: Picard. There is tons of action and the best special effects in the series. Shinzon is a great villain and is almost up there with Khan and General Chang. The movie isn't quite as good as the other even-numbered Treks, but it's definitely better than the odd-numberes ones (for those who don't know, the even-numbered Trek movies are usually better than the odd-numbered ones). "Star Trek: Nemesis" is very good, and a worthy final chapter in the TNG lineage. It's a must for all Trekkies.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>As a fan of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, I was glad to see this one work, After the last outing, the horrible &quot;Insurection&quot; I had little faith in this one, but that faith has been somewhat restored, like &quot;First Contact&quot; this one is loaded with action set pieces that fans have come to expect &amp; like &quot;First Contact&quot; it has succeeded where &quot;Insurection&quot; miserably failed!!!, but there are some inconsistent details, the series that ran from 1987 to 1994 were great, the last &amp; final episode &quot;All good things&quot; was a great way to end the series &amp; pick up with &quot;Generations&quot; the first feature film, which was also good, the last episode had Picard jumping from past, present, &amp; future, in the future scenes, appearnaces had not changed much, costumes &amp; ship designs were more advanced but had the same color elements to them, with &quot;First Contact&quot; &amp; &quot;Nemesis&quot; ship &amp; costume designs are somewhat different, In &quot;Nemesis&quot; the Enterprise E is sent to Romulas where Picard &amp; the crew discover a sinister plot by a villian that is an evil clone of Picard's younger self, who has a starship more superior than any ship in Starfleet, it seems he needs Picard's blood to live &amp; tries to sway Picard to his side, in an effort to rule the Romulan Empire &amp; seize control of Earth, when Picard refuses to help him, a battle ensues, a battle very similar to &quot;Wrath of Kahn&quot; where the two try to out manuever one another with many action set pieces, Data's death/sacrifice scene is emotional at best &amp; well done for the most part, but this is where consistency gets lost, it totally contradicts the last episode of the series where Data is still around in Picard's future, not unless it was a perception of the future to Picard, fans can only have their view on this detail, one neat element is Riker &amp; Troi finally marrying after ignoring each other's feeling through out the series, you always knew it would happen &amp; now it does &amp; Riker finally taking his own command, finally!!, somthing that he was always reluctant to do in the series, &quot;Nemesis&quot; does grow its characters very well, but Rick Berman like most producers fails in the consistentsy department, this is why George Lucas sought control over his &quot;Star Wars&quot; frnachise, because of people like Berman, &amp; their failure to keep consistent with past events, but that should not stop one's enjoyment of &quot;Nemesis&quot; or &quot;First Contact&quot; for that matter once you get past those issues!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JJOV69MAU2J2.html">A1JJOV69MAU2J2</a><br/><p>I am a bigtime Trek fan, so bear with me. I've seen every TNG episode multiple times, and the final TV episode ranks up their with the best television I've ever seen.<p>But this film, despite moments of excellence, is a turkey. I rented the DVD, and was so peeved at various parts, including, in particular, the ludicrous (and unfaithful to longtime viewers) ending, that I immediately rewatched several extremely annoying scenes with the director's commentary with my wife. Our mutual thought: What were they thinking?<p>Fans have invested a lot into these characters, and it would not be a bad trek move to kill them off -- if it meant something. This end was so lame that it had us wondering &quot;he died for that?!&quot; It was as if a garden-variety blown fuse had electrocuted Geordi. And, it invalidates the final TV episode (Arggh!).<p>The movie does get two stars, only because the basic plot itself is simply brilliant -- that a clone of Picard, with a far different childhood -- turns into a monster capable of ultimate evil. It could have been high concept Hollywood at its best. The actor who plays Picard's clone gives a fascinating, poignant and very cool performance that nearly rescues this wreck of a movie. Picard, as always, is superb, but he's stuck with C-grade lines too much of the time. All of the other characters are in some sort of fog, including Data. Many of the named cast (Dr. Crusher, anyone), are nearly written out of the script. And, in the worst Trek tradition, the cheese factor on some of the special effects and fight scenes is simply Velveeta. The scenes on Romulus include laughably bad sets...<p>Bottom line: There is a reason why this Trek is so cheap on DVD and the TV episodes so pricey. Go buy &quot;All good things...&quot; on DVD, and revisit the magic that has so tragically gone out of this series that had been so dear to me, and let this turkey lie.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Star Trek: Nemesis killed off the movie series, and on a second viewing it's not hard to see why. While it's not quite as bad as its detractors claim, it suffers from a terrible screenplay by John Logan that never manages to integrate characterization into the action, leaving most of it to be found in the DVD's deleted scenes bin, while slogging through an incredibly undernourished but tediously dragged out and dull story that has one good but barely utilized idea in having as its villain a younger clone of the Enterprise's captain. How did they manage it? They must have got a hair off the bald captain's comb is the main theory offered (this may be a joke, but judging from how crude the comedy is elsewhere that's doubtful). Why did they do it? Part of an elaborate conspiracy they, er, gave up on years ago. But he's got a plan to make the Romulan Empire great again, of course. Probably. Quite what his nefarious plot to destroy the Federation is is never really explained so there's not much in the way of threat - especially since the villain only has one spaceship and quickly loses his allies because he keeps wasting time playing mind games or committing the odd psychic rape rather than getting down to delivering the conquest and pillage he promised. Oh, and he needs Captain Picard's DNA to stop himself prematurely self-destructing. Only, on second thoughts, he decides not to bother and to do something else instead. Quite what isn't exactly clear, but it involves filling much of the last third of the movie with a desperately unexciting space battle against a dull green background before yet another of the regular TV cast makes the ultimate sacrifice. Unfortunately this time round there is absolutely no reason for him to do so, and this being Star Trek where no popular character is allowed to stay dead (it even took two death scenes to kill off Captain Kirk in Generations) the ending is yet another copout. Koboyashi Maru indeed...<br /><br />A clumsy and half-hearted rehash of The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country, this voyage is clearly one for the money, with the regulars topping up their pension funds big time and the guest stars getting screwed. Even Ron Perlman makes no impression whatsoever in what looks like a cheap Halloween Skeletor mask (easily the worst makeup job in Star Trek history, and that includes the green chick and the plastic lizard guy in the 60s TV show). Still, you can have a few cheap laughs at the expense of the distinctly unthreatening Tom Hardy and the gleeful sadism of casting someone who can't pronounce his `r's as a Reman who has usurped control of the Romulan Empire, leading to lines like "Womulans feel thweatened by Wemen upstawts" or "We will no longer bow befawr anyone as slaves. Not the Womulans and not your mighty Fedewation. We are a wace bwed for waw... and conqwest" - at times it's like listening to Biggus Dickus addressing the crowd in Monty Python's Life of Brian. The usually reliable Stuart Baird, wearing his directing hat, can do nothing to liven things up, and even the great Jerry Goldsmith's score is distinctly professional but workmanlike. Incredibly dull stuff.<br /><br />The extras package on the 2-disc set at least is impressive, carrying over all the extras from the one-disc release and adding to them comprehensively with additional added scenes and more featurettes than you could possibly want - even the Easter egg featurettes are a decent length for once. If only they graced a better film...</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I missed "Nemesis" when it hit theaters a few years back.  I was never a huge "Star Trek" fan, but I always enjoyed watching the films.  I especially enjoyed the original casts' flicks.  TNG, although good, just wasn't the same as the original cast.  With that said, I expected "Nemesis" to be a flounder due to the negative lashing it received not only from movie critics, but Trek fans as well.  I can see where loyal fans of the series could be upset with this film.  First of all, it has a heavy leaning towards action.  I always felt that TNG was quicker to try peace talks instead of phasers to solve a problem.  Secondly, fan favorites such as Riker, Worf, and Geordi were given the second-tier treatment in order for the focus to be placed firmly on Picard.  Even Data, though he has a crucial role in this film, doesn't get to really shine until the movie is about halfway to completion.<br /><br />The story, in my opinion, was wonderful.  **SPOILERS** A Romulan project gone bad, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), overthrows the Romulan Senate and almost single-handedly destroys the Federation by utilizing the warrior race Remens.  He also plays with the Remens' emotions by using the prejudices of the Romulans toward them as a weapon.  Not to mention the fact that this guy is a clone of Picard.  That alone makes for wonderful mind games between the pair.  Shinzon uses Picards mind and heart against him, trapping him with B-4, a prototype of Data, and then playing to his heart by telling him about the cruelties he suffered as a Romulan slave.  I actually felt a little sorry for Shinzon even though I knew he was the big baddie from the beginning.<br /><br />This movie plays well to a general sci-fi audience.  Hardcore TNG fans will definitely find a lot wrong with this film.  When all is said and done, however, we get a nice space action yarn that will appeal to most people in the long run.<br /><br />The DVD is very nice.  It comes with a plethora of special features, broken down into movie, Federation, and Romulan sections.  It's a nice edition to any sci-fi fan's DVD library and a necessity to any "Star Trek" completionist.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>The best of the Star Trek movies. More action than the others other than part 2. As in The Wrath of Khan, this part is all about WAR. Romulans develop a supership capable of fighting a dozen Federation ships at the same time. You get the idea. This is a must have for sci-fi fans, even ones who think Star Trek is boring. This changes all of that, A LOT.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>There are good action sequences here, many with tenuous reasons behind them. The special effects are done well enough. The story had the promise of galactic scope and great import to the audience. But there aren't nearly enough true character moments or Star Trek level humor to carry this one off in the minds of the viewers. True, Picard and Data have a lot of "character moments" where they get introspective and philosophical, but since those moments are brought out merely as the story forces them to re-evaluate their lives, they are more plot element than character points.<br /><br />One of the elements that contributes to the problems with this movie is the fact that it is directed by Stuart Baird, a film editor and a Star Trek neophyte. Granted, this is not the first time Star Trek has used "less experienced" directors. Star Treks III, V, Generations, and First Contact were all directed by people who were doing their first ever feature film, and Star Trek II was only Nicholas Meyer's second directorial outing ever. So lack of directorial experience is not necessarily insurmountable, but it is not encouraging.<br /><br />Also, Nicholas Meyer too was a Star Trek neophyte when brought on to direct II. However he delved into Star Trek to better understand it and realistically portray it on screen. In contrast, Baird reportedly reveled in his lack of Star Trek knowledge and insisted on simply making the movie he wanted.<br /><br />The script was written by John Logan, a Star Trek fan and the writer of the screenplays for "Gladiator", "Any Given Sunday" and "The Aviator". So the story should have worked better than it ultimately does. There is a great movie to be made here out of this story. But it just doesn't satisfy like it should. (Me, I blame the director.)<br /><br />If you want to watch a Star Trek movie, go with II, VI or First Contact. Only watch this one if you want an action movie with a Star Trek theme.</p></br><a href="../users/ADB8XCKNSDY5Z.html">ADB8XCKNSDY5Z</a><br/><p>First Contact was the best Next Generation movie, but this is my favorite Next Generation movie.  It's still not great, but I like it a little bit more than the other ones.  I think it's because this movie spends a little more time developing the villian than the other movies do.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't develop a villian in two hours that will match a cast of heros that were developed over seven years.  This film gives it a try though, and doesn't do a bad job.  The only problem is, so much screen time is spent developing this villian that not enough time is available to go to the familiar cast we all know and love.  It was a no-win situation.<br /><br />Watch this to see what happens.  You can watch it again if you want, but don't pay a lot of money to do so.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>I must confess that I'm not a huge Star Trek fan.  I've seen about half of the movies, and used to watch Deep Space Nine and an occasional episode of Voyager.  But, when a Star Trek movie comes out, there is enough interest in me to want to give it a chance.  So, when Nemesis came out on DVD I rented it and gave it a spin.  I was disappointed.<p>Near the beginning of the movie there is an attack on the Romulan Senate killing everyone.  We shift to the crew of the Enterprise where Riker (Jonathon Frakes) is getting married to Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Picard (Patrick Stewart) gives a nice best man speech.  When this is concluded and everyone is back on the Enterprise, Picard gets a message from Captain Janeway (from Star Trek Voyager) to engage in a diplomatic mission to Romulan.  On the way to Romulan they discover an odd signal coming from another planet and the Enterprise stops to investigate.  The signal is a disassembled android that appears to be an earlier version of Data (Brent Spiner) named B-4 (clever, yes?).  The Enterprise continues on to Romulan and upon arrival they learn that the situation has changed.  There is a new power, and it stems from a Remen uprising.  The new power is a man named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  He is a human (not Remen), but was raised among the Remens.  He is also a clone of Picard.  <p>This throws all sorts of possibilities for the rest of the film, and the diplomatic mission has changed completely because of the new circumstances.  There are scenes of action and some of fairly good.  Some parts of the movie were interesting, but as a whole it felt like the movie failed on some level.  As I said, I'm not a Trekkie, so I can't speak for how the movie fits into the larger picture of the Star Trek universe, but as a movie Nemesis just wasn't that good.  I wish that I could give more of a positive review, but the movie was not that interesting or compelling.  I cannot recommend Star Trek: Nemesis.  If you are a fan of Star Trek and absolutely must see everything with the Star Trek name on it, then rent with with no expectations and you might be pleased.  If you are only looking for a decent science fiction movie, look elsewhere.  The quality is not here.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Not unlike many Star Trek fans, when I went and saw Star Trek Nemesis at the theater the first time, I was a little blanched by it because it seemed to be a disappointment based on four years of anticipation and all the hype leading up to its release.  Upon a second viewing at the theater a couple weeks thereafter I warmed up to this tale a little more.  And now we finally have the DVD where a third viewing for me has clinched this as one of the better Star Trek movies.  Paramount has finally decided to not put the screws to us once again by releasing a DVD with just the movie and a trailer; they have loaded this one down with as much as possible.<p>Many fans have made reference to the writer John Logan who wrote "Gladiator" and someone who has been a long time fan of Star Trek that he embedded this film with way too many references to previously filmed scenes.  While this may be the case, I do not think it detracts from the film in any way.  Overall, I believe John Logan, Rick Berman and Brent Spiner who are all credited with writing this trek tale, did a wonderful job of dealing with the particular issues that they wanted included and tossing in some of the best Star Trek silver screen space battles ever done.<p>Credits to of course the entire Star Trek The Next Generation's cast for their usual high standard performances and to Tom Hardy for his wonderful performance as Shinzon of Remus.  We're even treated to a guest performance by none other than Kate Mulgrew as "Admiral" Janeway, which leaves many a Star Trek fan to wonder where Voyager will lead to in the future...<p>The premise:<p>Going into this film, the Executive Producer of Star Trek Rick Berman knew there were particular aspects that they had to include in this film as part of the premise that this would be "A Generation's Final Journey," which they did quite well to include leaving a huge possibility at the end of the film for this to "not" be STNG's final journey on the silver screen.<p>Shinzon of Remus, The Romulan Empires second and closest planet has managed to overthrow the Romulan Senate to include the Praetor and is now its Praetor.  Having ties with Captain Jean Luc Picard and a need to meet him, he sets into motion a plan that will draw the Federations flagship and her Captain to Romulus for a fateful meeting that will possibly herald the destruction of Earth and the Federation.<p>The DVD:<p>As referenced above, Paramount really outdid themselves with this particular release.  In past Star Trek film DVD releases we've received only the film and a trailer or two and for the past year or so they've finally been re-releasing the films as "Special Editions."<p>The cover art for the DVD is perfect.  In addition to the wonderful cover art the DVD case itself is new and different as well, with two clips for keeping the case closed which is fairly innovative!<p>The on screen menus for this DVD are nothing short of spectacular and probably the best I've seen so far for a Star Trek DVD.<p>Special Features:<p>Commentary by Director Stuart Baird<br />Exclusive Documentaries:<br /> - New Frontiers:  Stuart Baird on Directing "Nemesis"<br /> - A Bold Vision of the Final Frontier<br /> - A Star Trek Family's Final Journey<br /> - Red Alert!

However, this is a watchable film, and the movie certainly highlights the fact that by now the TNG characters all have wonderful chemistry with one another, and some of the characters' acting skills have greatly improved since the inception of the series. Patrick Stewart (whose acting skills have always been excellent in my opinion) turns in a bravo performance, as does Brent Spiner. The "dune buggy" scenes in the desert are lots of fun. However, how does this segment of the film square with the "Prime Directive?" I suppose we are destined never to know, but that's Hollywood. This is a minor quibble.<br /><br />My main criticism of the movie is that I found the plot to be murky and the evil protagonist somewhat unfocused as regards his motivations and purpose. I also don't like the idea of "good Romulans" (spoiler omitted here). The best thing about the film is that it deals with the Romulans/Remans who I have always thought are the best "Star Trek" villains with the possible exception of the Borg.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan, you will like this movie. Those who are not will likely be less enthusiastic. RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>StarTrek Nemesis is said to be the last film of the Next Generation cast. I think that's a shame because it would be am unworthy ending the series. I liked the film but it could of been better. The whole thing with Picard having a clone was silly, wasn't explained that well how he got cloned either. Date has a brother android that looks just like him and it's not explained too well where he came from either. What the film has going for is the special effects, action and the performances of Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner. The under-rated StarTrek  First Contact is a much better film and the best of the next generation movies. If they couldn't of done better than that they shouldn't of made more Next Generation movies. That should of been the last one.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>The longest in production, the lowest grossing and most limbo-bound Star Trek movie of all. Nemesis is neither here nor there. It entertains without satisfying and features loads of brilliant SFX, but little awe. Perhaps we are all just too familiar with franchise and it needs to forever be increasingly far-reaching to keep it fresh.<br /><br />However, it IS a lot better than Insurrection. In terms of direction anyway. Jonothan Frake's TV movie approach to the franchise lacked any sort of class or sophistication but Stuart Baird fixes that with a darker and more menacing tone. The script is more sinister than that of Insurrection or First Contact (the Next Gen movie titles still remain uninspired) but what ends up in the film is confused and undefined.<br /><br />The plot has Picard sent out to Romulous to help make peace with the new Preator, a man who calls himself Shinzon and who happens to be an exact clone of Picard. Data finds an android identical to himself buried in the sand of a nearby desert planet. Picard and Data are suspicious of their radical finds and the suspicion soon proves to be justified as treachery and double-crosses are revealed.<br /><br />With an unconfirmed amount of deleted scenes (rumors put it around the 50 minute mark) it's painfully obvious that important plot developments have been cut out of the film. The sense of the Enterprise emptying as all the main characters leave for new career paths is lost. Worf and Crusher are hardly featured for some reason. The relationship between Data and his long-lost brother B-4 seems very thin. The sub-text is muddled and hard to get to grips with. And a sub-plot involving Praetor Shinzon's lust (and subsequent repeated rape) for Deanna Troi is abandoned as soon as it starts. What was the point of starting it in the first place? Is B-4 actually Data's evil brother Lore?<br /><br />And despite the fact that Star Trek has been around for almost 40 years at this point, the STILL do the cheap 'desert outside of LA as some other planet' trick. And the dune buggies seemed to be kind of out of place. Like it was just added in at the last minute to make the film more exciting.<br /><br />Shinzon is not the slightest bit scary and even looks like the 3rd place runner-up in a Right Said Fred lookalike competition. For all the talk of him looking slightly different from Picard due to his life of hardship, he didn't look very hard.<br /><br />Also, Jerry Goldsmith's score just seems like loads of his previous scores with some cues altered slightly. Honestly, I recognised several cues from Executive Decision, Gremlins 2, The 'Burbs and many other movies changed just a little bit to make it sound different. Though I understand Goldsmith was very ill at this point so I can forgive him for that.<br /><br />But it's hard to forgive the rest of the film. Like I said, it's entertaining, but falls apart under even the most superficial of scrutiny. It could have been handled a lot better and I'm surprised and disappointed that Paramount fumbled their flagship series so badly.<br /><br />The DVD features a perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and brilliant Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. There are loads of extras but Paramount fumbles again by not including an extended cut of the film. It's like they just don't care!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>There are 36 dramatic situations in the known universe. Every plot is a variation on these 36 dramatic situations. The Greek playwrites came up with all of them and honed them to perfection. What does this have to do with Star Trek Nemesis? Well a lot, actually. It isn't a remake of Wrath of Khan. Certainly there are some basic plot similarities but these are mostly superficial. Thematically the film has less to do with Trek 2 than with Trek 8. So if there are 36 dramatic situations (and everything, remember, is a variation on these)and there are 10 Trek films, what is the likelihood that there could be some plot similarities? A whole lot actually and Trek 10 in my humble opinion does it better in some areas and, yes, a bit worse than Trek 2 in others. It's not the worst of the Trek franchise that a lot of Trekkers claim but it's not the best either. For the worst of the Trek films featuring the Next Gen, I'd recommend avoiding Generations which was like an episode of the series (not a particularly brilliant one I might add but average)inflated into an epic film for the big screen.<br /><br />What does work in Nemesis works extremely well. Picard celebrates the end of an era with his crewmates as Troi and Riker get married. As if that wasn't enough change, Riker assumes command of another ship (the Titan)with Troi at his side. Commander Data finally moves up in rank (and does so without anyone dying)to second in command of the Enterprise. <p>After celebrating their wedding on Earth, Riker and Troi embark back to Troi's home world for a ceremony there aboard the Enterprise. En route to the planet Betazoid, the crew picks up a signal that could only be from a positronic brain like Data's. Intrigued, the crew go to this planet unsure of what they will find. It's pretty darn close to the Neutral Zone so Riker, still Picard's right hand man, suggests caution. They discover another of Data's long lost relatives in the process. <p>Meanwhile, Star Fleet has received a communication from the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire. They've requested a Star Fleet representative come to Romulus immediately. Since the Enterprise is the closest ship available, Picard and crew are sent there where there are a number of surprises awaiting them.<p>Contrary to a previous review, the acting is solid throughout and hangs in there with some of the best in the Next Gen film series. I'm rather surprised that the director Stuart Baird elected not to reintegrate any of the cut sequences for the film. They would have actually strengthened the narrative and explained a lot (for example, why Worf was on the Enterprise after being appointed to a position on Klingon. Turns out the diplomatic life wasn't for him. That line of dialog was lost during the cutting phase of the film). The cut sequences consisted of interesting character moments and revealed quite a bit about Picard, his feelings about meeting Shinzon the new Praetor of Romulus.<p>My suggestion--give Nemesis a chance. It's an entertaining film that has a number of marvelous battle sequences and some nicely nuanced acting from the Trek veterans. While the pacing is a bit sluggish at times, the overall pace of the film actually helps the film achieve some of its thematic gravity and momentum. I'd also suggest lightening up a bit here--it's a film in a franchise series that attempts to entertain while examining a number of interesting themes (whether our decisions create who we are or if we are just a victim of circumstance and formed by these very circumstances).<p>The visuals are top notch. I had my reservations about the digital visuals used in the film (actually it began as far back as First Contact where the Enterprise was a virtual Enterprise and not a model) but I've been proven wrong. They look impressive and there are visuals that couldn't have been accomplished with models and animation that are accomplished here.<p>After 72 episodes of the original series, over 100 episodes of the Next Generation, ten feature films (not to mention the spin-off series DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all the novels spun off from the various series), sooner or later there was bound to be a dramatic situation that was repeated. It happened before (during Next Gen and the other series). I'm not quite sure what some fans were expecting but Nemesis is a fine (but far from perfect) addition to the Trek films.<p> Remember, next time you think you've seen that plot before, you probably have so be kind in your judgment. Nobody has had any success coming up with a 37th dramatic situation yet and until they do, we're stuck with those same 36 over and over and over again. Remember, it's not the situation but the telling that really matters. With Nemesis, Baird, writer Logan and the veteran Trek cast turn an eye to the difficulty of being closer to the end than beginning. Nemesis touches on a number of emotional issues that will eventually face all of us and does so with candor, wit and grace.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>There is a lot of merit to Star Trek: Nemesis.  As a fan of the original show, I always approached TNG films with skepticism.  First Contact was, of course, the pinnacle of this series, and I (unlike many ST fans) really enjoyed ST:Generations.  Insurrection was a definite turn for the worse, and I expected little of Nemesis.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the film, in spite of its many shortcomings.  It's certainly better than Insurrection, for example. <p>The good points: it's pacing and action are fantastic.  Director Baird is a respected action film editor, and the pacing and feel of the film is pitch-perfect.  The performances in TNG have always been uneven - Frakes and Sirtis, for example, cannot match the presence of Patrick Stewart - but the acting is uniformly equal to or better than any of the previous TNG outings.  There are Romulans - everyone loves the Romulans!  Finally, in spite of what others have written, the highlight of the film is the crewmember's death (I won't say whose, in case you haven't seen it) - it is startling in its speed and very effective due to the quick cutting.  The denouement following the death is short, but every bit as effective as Spock's in TWOK.<p>Unfortunately, there are a number of bad points.  As pointed out by others, the story itself is essentially recycled from The Wrath of Khan, and that makes it feel tired and dull.  Worse still, there are logical holes - where does Shinzon find this B-4 prototype of Data? how did the Romulans get Picard's DNA?  what has happened to the Federation head spy to Romulus (Mr. Spock)? why doesn't Troy sense Shinzon's lies? (there is an explanation in the cut scenes, but the actual movie ignores the issue.)  Even more annoying are the glaring and unecessary scientific errors.  I don't mind when Star Trek invents science to explain itself (transporters, shields, etc.), but I really mind it when they make scientific errors for no reason.  The explanation of the Reman weapon is particularly laughable - no electromagnetic radiation could have the properties ascribed to it, it's a physical impossibility.  Likewise, you don't need an android to generate positronic radiation - any idiot with a nuclear reactor (or a particle accelerator) can do that.  And don't get me started on the aftermath of the collision between the Enterprise and the Scimitar!  Newton is rolling in his grave.  The point is, all of these mistakes were unnecessary - B-4's planet was proto-industrial, so positronic radiation would be anomalous anyways; Data's spacewalk could still have been necessary if the two ships were still attached; and there's no reason the Reman weapon had to be &quot;electromagnetic&quot; - it could have been any kind of energy!<p>The average moviegoer is likely to forgive the defects in physics, but less likely to forgive the plot holes.  However, most of these you don't notice while watching the first time, because you're caught up in the action.  It's on reflection afterwards that such thorny issues appear.<p>This DVD is crammed full of extras, and I wonder how they all fit on one disc!  There are some little minidocumentaries that are fun and interesting, cut scenes, etc.  The director's commentary is somewhat dull, but there's some interesting info in there.  All this is stuffed on without (apparently) sacrificing the quality of the feature - it is clean, crisp, and sounds great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>STAR TREK X: NEMISIS is the supposed last of the Star Trek films in the 36 year history of Star Trek originally conceived by Gene Roddenberry (Andromeda, Earth:Final Conflict) back in 1964. Directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, US MArshals) the film has a dark tone. This film is definitely more interesting than the last installment (Insurrection), but not quiet as good as First Contact. I think the tone of the film is what missed its mark for me. There was too much talking between Shinzon played by ??? (  ) and Captain Picard played by the always brilliant Patrick Stewart ( ) and exposition and not enough for the other characters to do.<p>The star for this film was Data, played by Brent Spinner (Out To Sea, The Master Of Disguise ) playing a duel role as the ever misfitted android and an duplicate "brother" called B4. The scenes of his light-hearted humor, curiosity, quick wit and heroism make this film very enjoyable. Problem because Brent was also one of the three who came up with the story idea as well with producer Rick Berman (Enterprise, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator, The TimeMachine, Any Given Sunday).<p>The story is simple - but a little weird. Captain Picard was cloned by the Romulans (the Bad Guys) in order to be replaced in the Federation an infiltrate the "Good Guys". Due to a change of politics and governments - the plan was abandoned and the clone grew up under hardship to become the future destructor of planet Earth. Yawn....<p>Now the real action takes place more than half-way into the movie where Shinzon's ship gets rammed by the Enterprise. From that point the forward the movie is a roller coaster. And, thanks to Data, who destroys the most deadliest weapon known in the Universe - the Earth is saved. Data even has a moment where the audience cheered!<p>The supporting cast gets second seat in this film and even Jonathan Frakes (Clockstoppers, Thunderbirds ) gets a decent fight scene in this, but not a great contributor to the plot overall. Mr. Frakes did a great job directing First Contact.<p>There are cute scenes, wedding reception scenes, love making scenes, there is even some off-roading too  - but over-all it takes the last 40 minutes to get you involved. Also there is an emotional ending that may shock Star Trek fans - the two who didn't know anything about it. <p>The score is by the incredible Jerry Goldsmith ( ) and the special effects are top notch and completely believable. Overall Star Trek fans should be satisfied and the non Trekker will enjoy the detailed ending - just wished it had me humor and more for the other characters to do. Go see it and tell me what you think! (12-22-02) 3x</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>The sheer face-palming stupidity of this movie is enough to make Insurrection seem even slightly reasonable.  At the very least, Star Trek Insurrection has the benefit of the doubt as to whether the bad guys stance of relocating the hippie-liberal people for medical breakthroughs could even work, as the medical miracle of the planet's atmosphere might be impossible to replicate, or impossible to distribute, or the hippie-liberal people would be willing to share it if only the wrinkly-faced bad guys would go away.<br /><br />"Star Trek Nemesis" has absolutely none of that.<br /><br />Nemesis probably had a special place in my heart somehow for being the first Star Trek movie I fully and completely remember seeing in theaters when it first came out.  I'm 70% sure I saw Insurrection in theaters, and 30% sure I saw First Contact in theaters.<br /><br />So maybe it had to take this long, or rather it had to take my maturing into an adult, and becoming a real Star Trek fan to realize the movie wasn't just a bust at the box office and franchise-killing, but was a complete mess of sheer stupidity!<br /><br />So the story is our guys pretty much have nothing to do but wait for another Borg attempt (unless Voyager ensured that wouldn't happen any time soon), and Commander Riker is about to go off with Deanna Troi on a honeymoon, then captain his own ship.  But then suddenly comes Shin-Zon, who stages a coup on the Romulan Senate and takes control of the Empire with the military's backing.<br /><br />For some reason, this is treated with a remarkable amount of hostility and uncertainty, despite the fact that the Federation and the Romulan Empire had been on hostile terms for many years, and that a sworn enemy of the Romulans had just taken over the Romulan Empire, and that this could lead to a great many new and interesting diplomatic developments between the two factions.<br /><br />Ideally it SHOULD be treated this way, but that would probably take too long, and have too much "exploring" and "negotiation" and "diplomacy" and "logic", all the things a Star Trek movie SHOULDN'T have, right?  Oh wait, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STAR TREK IS ABOUT!  At least you'd think that from the Original Series and the movies.<br /><br />Instead, Shin-Zon is introduced and supposed to be someone to RIVAL KHAN NOONIEN SINGH in terms of sheer awe and power and evilness and such.  I have no idea of this is true, but I had heard that Rick Berman said that Shin-Zon would rival Khan, or even equal him.<br /><br />Rather than be a snotty pessimist, I will simply say that this is not possible because the writers did not even try to portray it this way, or else their attempts to do so ended up being edited out of the final script, or completely forgotten about.<br /><br />Shin-Zon is an artificial human created from Jean-Luc Picard's DNA by the Romulans.  They planned to have this clone created, rapidly aged, then inserted in Picard's place as captain of the Enterprise for some nefarious plan against the Federation.  Early on, this plan ends up being abandoned, and Shin-Zon is thrown away like garbage onto Remus, among the enslaved Remans.<br /><br />One of the Remans there takes Shin-Zon in, after seeing how he is horribly treated by the Romulan overseers.  Shin-Zon grows up in an environment of hatred of Romulans, hard work and torture.  Somehow he manages to gain ahold of much power and influence amongst the Remans, and stages a coup in which he assassinates the entire Romulan Senate, and gains power of the Empire with its military behind him.<br /><br />The vast majority of his story is over!  He can no longer be anywhere near Khan, because Khan's whole story was one that mirrored that of Captain Ahab in "Moby Dick"---a lust for revenge so overpowering, it destroyed him and everyone he held dear.  Shin-Zon achieves his revenge without losing anything, it seems.<br /><br />So here comes Jean-Luc Picard, his DNA twin, sent by the Federation to investigate, and even negotiate if possible!  He can do what has never been done before for the Romulan Empire; make a peace treaty between the Federation and the Empire that can see them united, break down the Neutral Zone, and be a powerful and dominating force together in a strong alliance!<br /><br />Instead, because arbitrary action and "Anyone who isn't a part of the Enterprise and has spooky evil music play whenever they come on-screen must be a bad guy", Shin-Zon for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL decides he has to attack and destroy Earth and the Federation.  Brbbrbrbrb, WHY?!?! WHY?!?!? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?!<br /><br />There is NO REASONING OR JUSTIFICATION AT ALL for Shin-Zon to arbitrarily ATTACK THE FEDERATION just because he's a clone of Jean-Luc Picard!  HE HATES THE ROMULANS!  EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLOT POINT AND KEY IN HIS BACKGROUND POINTS TO HIM HATING THE ROMULANS!  AND SUDDENLY HE HATES THE FEDERATION, WHY?!<br /><br />This would be as if Khan, after marooning Kirk and taking the Genesis Project, decides to go and attack the Klingon homeworld.  WHY?!<br /><br />So instead of making any sense and maybe, trying to hunt down the military elements of Romulus that DIDN'T support him, or preparing to put down attempted rebellions on Romulan colonies and territories that oppose him, or maybe trying to make sure the military is pleased with him and strongly backing him, instead of THREATENING THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD POSSIBLY QUASH YOUR NEFARIOUS PLOTS with random acts of violence for even DARING TO QUESTION HIM, Shin-Zon decides to threaten the only guy who could put an end to his life and reign, and go after Earth because Earth is good and good is dumb.<br /><br />The rest is just fudge frosting on the cake of idiocy this movie takes.  This is a true franchise-killer, and while J.J. Abrams did good in "reviving" the franchise with "Star Trek", after this mess of a movie, anyone short of Uwe Boll could have revived the franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>I'm not a huge a Star Trek fan, but I have enjoyed the movies as well as the Next Generation TV series.  As such, I found this latest movie to be an enjoyable and comfortable entry in the series.  Continuing the trend of the even number movies being better, Nemesis (#10) is arguably better then Insurrection (#9).  Plus, many favorites pop up in cameos.  <p>The Plot: An apparent coup d'etat occurs on Romulus, and the Enterprise is sent to investigate.  When Picard meets the new leader of the Romulans, he's shocked to see a striking resemblance to himself.  The Enterprise crew try to work with the new leader, but suspect treachery.  The special effects are not particularly impressive, especially in light of other recent sci-fi movies, but then Star Trek has never been just about the f/x.  The movie explores issues of cloning in a relatively interesting, but precursory, manner.  The DVD includes many deleted scenes, which help explain some of the underdeveloped plots (e.g., Troi's mind-melding) and underused characters (e.g., Dr. Crusher).  <p>Overall, a pretty good Star Trek movie that is likely to appease fans of the series; non-fans are likely to be a bit bored and unimpressed.

Though I personally enjoyed `Insurrection', many hardcore fans despised the movie, citing it as being too romantic and humorous and way too light on the action.  So, with that response to their previous installment, Paramount wanted to make the next movie be much darker, more action-packed, and featuring an even more intense storyline than previous films.  For the previous two films, Paramount was happy with actor Jonathan Frakes filling the role of director as well, especially with his extremely entertaining and successful effort with "Star Trek:  First Contact", but with the somewhat lesser performance of "Star Trek:  Insurrection", the executives at Paramount felt it would be safer to go with a fresh perspective to direct the newest film.  Enter renowned film editor Stuart Baird, whose talent for finding the perfect blend of action and drama has served him well throughout his career in film, and Paramount felt it was time to give this long-time editor the chance to put his skills directly behind the camera.  Would this choice prove to be a wise one, or merely another nail in the coffin for this slowly dwindling franchise, only time would tell.<br /><br />"Star Trek:  Nemesis" begins on a joyous note, with the wedding of Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis).  On this wonderful day even more good news arrives when Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives word that the Romulans want peace, and that the crew of the Enterprise-E are to be the emissaries of the Federation.  Just as the Enterprise makes its way towards the Romulan Empire, a brilliant villain named Shinzon awaits them, harboring an evil plan of destruction for the Federation, and a dark secret linking him and Picard.<br /><br />Prior to the release of this 10th film in the long-running `Star Trek' movie franchise, I felt that "Star Trek:  First Contact" was probably the best `Star Trek' movie made; however, after viewing "Star Trek:  Nemesis", I believe a new best of `Trek' movie has been named.  The hardcore fans of the franchise, or `Trekkies' as they prefer to be called, who were less than thrilled with `Insurrection', were without a doubt unbelievably impressed with `Nemesis'.  Even though "Star Trek:  Nemesis" was by far one of the best `Star Trek' films ever made, it sadly didn't do too well at the box office.  This was caused by the poor reception to "Star Trek:  Insurrection" and that the current TV series "Star Trek:  Enterprise" was receiving poor ratings, so support for the franchise was at an all-time low.  I also believe a big problem the `Star Trek' franchise faced, and the result was evident for this movie, was that the market had been oversaturated with the series, because pretty much for the last 20 to 30 years there has always been some form of `Star Trek' that could be seen either on TV or in theaters.  Perhaps, if more time had gone by between the release of `Insurrection' and the release of `Nemesis', the latter would have fared better at the box office, but now we'll never know for sure.<br /><br />The acting, as always in these movies, was top-notch due to the cast being so familiar with their characters that they all are second nature to them.  The director, Stuart Baird, a newcomer to the `Star Trek' franchise, did an excellent job helming this film, and delivered a high-octane thrill ride that delivered on so many levels.  All of the special effects in the movie were outstanding, and by far the best in the entire series, which added to the overall greatness of this movie.  Without a doubt, this movie should have done much better at the box office, and it's a shame it didn't because it truly is the best in the series, and is one `Star Trek' film that should not be missed!<br /><br />"Star Trek:  Nemesis" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Once upon a time Star Trek movies seemed fresh and exciting.  They could be purely cerebral sci-fi stories like The Motion Picture, intergalactic mystery thrillers like Star Trek VI, or even outright comedy, like Star Trek IV.  They often quoted great works of literature knowledgably, touched upon current events and even featured wry comments on American history ( "On Vulcan we have a saying: Only Nixon could go to China.")  They were intelligent movies made for an intelligent audience.  They presumed that the audience had read Dickens, Shakespeare, D.H. Lawrence, Arthur Conan Doyle, Melville and others.  <p>The rankings of the characters also changed and the introduced new ones.  The movies with the original cast did things which took real risk with the characters.  Kirk was an Admiral for the first four movies, Chekov was not serving on Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II, and Sulu was Captain of Excelsior in Star Trek VI and never set foot on Enterprise.  This is in addition to killing off Spock, blowing up the Enterprise, spending one full feature flying around in a stolen Klingon vessel (until the last scene) and finally retiring the crew.  They did not exist simply to have space battles.  In point of fact some of the movies managed to get by with few or no space battles.  The original series and much of the Next Generation had similar standards of quality.  <p>The Next Generation movies, in contrast, have been little more than extended episodes of varying quality.  No new recurring characters have been introduced and you can always count on seeing the original cast back on the bridge.  A great opportuninty for development was lost in Insurrection.  How cool it would have been to have Picard decide to retire on the planet right then and give Riker a field promotion to captain. Nemesis attempts to give us some development, unfortuneately it involves the death of a character at the climax whose potential for resurrection is made extremely obvious.  When Spock died in Star Trek II it was a moment of Tragedy which left me feeling cathartic, as well as extremely excited about Star Trek III which would be released in 2 long years. When a character died in Nemesis I felt like they were just imitating without understanding. I never had any feeling of loss or suspense.  Just a strong sense that I had seen it all before.<p>This may be the worst of the Trek films as it is little more than an extended space battle.  It was made by people who seem to have only seen the previous movies, found themselves most engaged by Star Trek II, and decided to repeat it.  These sequences have become so routine that, with a little more humor, I could compare it to elements of a James Bond movie.  <p>In terms of topical discussions, it touches lightly on the theme of Cloning, just with a tad bit more seriousness than Star Wars Episode II.  <p>Continuity is effected in terms of the rest of the series which makes me wonder if perhaps the film should be regarded as non-canonical, like the novels and, according to some, Star Trek V and the excellent animated series.  Perhaps in the next movie Picard or Riker or Data will wake up and all of this will have been a bad dream.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Being a long-time fan of Trek and especially of the Classic and DS9 incarnations, I've always had a bittersweet relationship with the ST:TNG concept.  I've never been able to understand the need for a ship's counselor as a senior member of the staff with a place on the bridge especially when you have an equally if not more competent Guinan and located where she should be to be an effective counselor i.e. as a bar tender.<br /><br />I've also wondered just what role Beverly Crusher plays other than just to blindly copy the Bones McCoy character from classic trek.  I detest the whole ridiculous Q storyline and overall, I found ST:TNG a totally miscast and unbalanced series except perhaps for Picard, Riker, Data, Jeordie and Worf.  And so it has always been painful for me to watch most of the episodes let alone the movies and yet with the exception of the Borg movie, I've enjoyed the ST:TNG movies the least and although this "final" one has some good points going for it. I can't help but feel that I've been shortchanged in some way.<br /><br />The whole dark mood of the film just wasn't Trek for me while it probably would have fit in say a Batman movie like say a movie of the "Dark Knight Returns" or something like that, this gothic type feel just didn't fit for me in this movie.  I've watched it a few times and perhaps it will grow on me but each time I watch I get the feeling in my tummy that I get when I eat a heavily hyped up meal that just didn't deliver.<br /><br />The dvd though has decent special features with a few documentaries and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very good although I regret not getting the widescreen version instead of this full-screen version and I wonder if they could have gotten a DTS sound option included as well.<br /><br />Overall, I think if the mood was more "Trek" instead of this "Jack the Ripper" gothic type thing, I would have probably enjoyed this a lot more.  Also, one of the deleted scenes was very amusing with the new number 1 trying to please Picard as well as the chairs with seat belts which really should have been included in the main picture and they would have certainly helped with the cheerful mood that is sadly missing in the picture.  Hopefully they would be included in a future director's cut that is brighter and has more of a "Trek" feel to it.<br /><br />Verdict: Wait for an improved director's cut with the good deleted scenes included and also for a widescreen version preferably in Blu-ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>OK, so we had several things going on here.

The story centers around family, or tries to.<br /><br />The conflict between brothers, between "siblings" as it were, was a valiant try, but failed for me.<br /><br />The performances fell flat -- the ramming of the ship into the "theta radiation" ship of Jinsan was not the best idea.  The conflicted Data dealing with his Data wannabe.  And Data's final fate was a disappointment.<br /><br />Imagine if you will a director who really wants to off the franchise.  To really make this the last Star Trek film.  The Generation is getting lazy and slow.  The plot devices are getting stale and silly.<br /><br />I feel this film was the final straw for Paramount.  The film was made for fans rather than a wider fan base.<br /><br />And that's why JJ Abram's film Star Trek was the best -- it cleaned up this tired malaise of the Captain, the crew, the explosions, the last minute or else we die plot lines and breathed new life into the franchise.<br /><br />Nemesis is the reason why!<br /><br />Decent performances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis.<br /><br />The director Stuart Baird knew nothing of Star Trek or its franchise before this film, so that might explain the cold reception at the box office.

It's dark and deep, but also a little too dreary and different.  Still, it's very interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality, and had some deleted scenes and featurettes.

The opening tone of the movie is perfect: Troi and Riker getting hitched (finally); Worf, Data and Picard off on an expedition to find the source of anomalous Data-like signatures; unrest on Romulus. Well and good. Unfortunately, the movie begins to hit the skids there. The story, written by John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator), is off his characteristically high standards. Logan has proven himself able to find the personal amid the epic, and Star Trek is often both, so he might seem an ideal candidate to pen this installment. However, this tone of this movie is too dour and too dark for most people to truly find enjoyable. This, I suspect, is more a direction problem than a screenplay problem (more on that in a minute), so I'll give Logan a pass. But you're on watch, Mr. Logan. The dialogue here is at its least memorable for Trek, all utilitarian, and although it mostly avoids cliche, it doesn't ever sparkle. There's no "the line must be drawn here" speech, sadly. There's an "I would be this guy if I grew up like he did" speech, in fact, there are quite a few of them. Cheer up, Jean-Luc, you'd probably have turned out like Idi Amin if you'd grown up like him. On an unrelated topic, I think Picard would have made a smashing dictator: imagine a planet full of bald, Shakespeare-quoting English-accented Frenchmen. Picardia. Rick Berman, give me a call.<br /><br />This movie tries so hard to be the Next Generation crew's Wrath of Khan, with the obsessed, delusional villain, an outmatched and outgunned Enterprise, and a crew member's sacrifice. All that's missing is the heart. And a great deal of substance. Like Wrath of Khan, an outsider was brought in to direct this movie. Unfortunately, the outsider for Nemesis was Eurotrip and U.S. Marshals auteur Stewart Baird instead of the multitalented Nicholas Meyer. THE Nicholas Meyer (hereafter referred to as Saint Nick) had never directed a film before Wrath of Khan, but his outing in Khan was more than luck: this guy knew what he was doing. He managed to coax an entirely ham-free performance out of William Shatner, no small feat (and I love Bill Shatner, so don't scream at me). Khan was a seriously messed-up guy, but Ricardo Montalban played him with such magnetism and charisma you couldn't help but love the guy, at the very least love to hate him. Wrath of Khan was perfectly paced, technically marvelous, and full of touching (but not manipulative) moments. Saint Nick also co-wrote the screenplay for Star Trek IV and co-wrote and directed Star Trek VI, all the original series favorites. His resume speaks for itself. Let's look at Stewart Baird's resume. A quarter-remembered action flick from eight years ago, a raunchy teen sex comedy (coming in rated and unrated versions speaks for itself), and his magnum opus, Executive Decision, an inferior Air Force One copy. As a result of his action background, this movie often feels like a standard-issue thriller instead of a Trek film, with precious little thought and introspection in order to keep the action a-comin', and what thought there is becomes tiresome really quickly. In all fairness, the action is good, as are the special effects. But who cares? The story sucks. It is misdirected up the wazoo.  When it started, The Original Series had the most talented writing staff on television, and it had to: the shoestring effects were nothing special, and the budget was as empty as Scott Bakula's chair is now on Enterprise's bridge (cold, yes, but true). Well, Scotty B, it's time for a big Quantum Leap--to conventions! Okay, I'll stop, but I'll ask this question: Since when did the effects become more important than the substance? Why should I spend my hard-earned cash (in this case, my parents' hard-earned cash, because they treated) on a light show with an equally light story? Sadly, it seems, Star Trek is Trek as the producers have learned to play it: safe, unthreatening, but also soulless. Worrying about audience segmentation and profits does not a great movie make. Gene Roddenberry is, I hope, spinning in his grave, because his Star Trek was the other way around. Star Trek needed (and needs) a Deep Space Nine more than it could possibly know: if there is no new blood in the franchise, it will die of inbreeding. How many different alien names can you come up with, really? You're going to run out, eventually. As sad as it makes me feel, Nemesis is the future of Star Trek, not its past.<br /><br />Say what you will about studio execs, but they can connect the dots:  most successful Trek pictures: Wrath of Khan, First Contact. Possible reasons: new directors, tension, excitement, epic action, substance. Lather, rinse, repeat. So, a great movie is a shopping list? If it's so simple, then why do so many movies suck? Apparently, the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy applies here--those factors were present in both films, but they weren't the reason they were great movies. These movies were spectacular because they spoke to timeless themes and gave the actors material to sink their teeth into, but also because they took extraordinary risks and succeeded wildly. Kirk is having a midlife crisis? Picard is obsessed with killing the Borg? These were quite bold risks to take with beloved characters decades in the making. Ultimately, for all the sermonizing and speechifying by Picard in this movie, this movie doesn't let him reject the thought that he could be the other guy, or be truly terrified of it. Data dies, but the B4 will probably take his place should another movie be made, and Riker not remembering the tune Data was whistling at Farpoint (Pop Goes the Weasel, by the way) doesn't nearly match the power of Kirk's final scene with his son at the end of Khan.  I would have liked to see what some really talented people could do with Star Trek: Paramount's got money, why not get great people to do this stuff (I fantasize about Aaron Sorkin writing a Trek movie), instead of second-rate action directors with portfolios consisting of fare that one sees during the summer, finds the ticket stub six months later in a coat pocket and can't remember the movie at all. Get Saint Nick Meyer on line one, Rick. You need him more than you know.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>At best, "Nemesis" is a decent Trek flick, though how much you like it will depend on how much you like TNG's band of Trek.<br /><br />PLOT: The Romulan Star Empire suffers a militaristic coup.  (Romulans are perennial rivals of the Federation, and their background hints at the Chinese as well as imperial Rome).  Though Romulan generals are backing the move (in which the entire senate is killed by a mysterious radiation weapon that shrivels them), the real culprits are "Remans" - Nosferatu-looking denizens of Romulus's sister world.  Leading the faction is a young man who is neither Romulan nor Reman, but a cloned human named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).  We learn that Romulans had cloned Starfleet Captain Picard years ago in hopes of substituting him and subverting Earth from within.  When the plan never panned out, Shinzon was discarded and sent to an almost certain death in the dilitium mines of Remus.  Big mistake - couldn't those silly Romulans have realized that Shinzon would survive the experience to become steeped in hatred of both Romulans and humans?  That he would rise to lead the Remans?  To build a monster super-starship that outguns and outruns anything built by anybody else in the Galaxy? And that he'd become everybody's problem?  Not realizing Shinzon's intentions or his origins, Starfleet dispatches Picard to Romulus to greet Shinzon - now the Praetor.  Before then, the Enterprise makes an unplanned stop on a remote pre-spaceflight world where they discover and activate an earlier model of Data.  Reaching Romulus, Picard soon learns the secret of their shared DNA and Shinzon's plans for Earth and the Romulans.<br /><br />At best, Nemesis is okay - though at worst, it's got a loose plot that unravels quickly - richer than "First Contact", but inferior to that film which was more tightly plotted.  The Picard in "Contact" had some genuine character flaw - will he let his hatred of the Borg sway him from taking the right course?  Here, he's just compulsively noble.  Just about every scene raises questions, and not the kind that scripts should engender - Picard becomes a one-man fighting machine aboard Shinzon's ship; the Remans can snatch Picard off the Enterprise, but can't locate him on their own ship? Shinzon is supposed to be a clone of Picard - but was Picard bald at that age?  Also, he looks, acts and thinks nothing like Picard (though, in a thematic sense, the main characters are so interchangeable, they are largely clones of each other); the crew lands on a primitive planet whose backward inhabitants have otherwise matched Starfleet in the critical technology of dune-buggies.  Fans of Worf will lament his under-use hear (he seems snappy, like he knows that he's about to become somebody's punchline).  The script plays up the sentimental connections between main characters, even as it makes them as stiff as ever.  The story itself seems a pastiche of storylines from other Treks, especially the classic "Wrath of Khan" (the villain is an obsessed enemy with a painful past; a weapon that can render whole worlds lifeless; starship dogfighting inside of some nebula-looking thing climaxes the movie, along with an act of sacrifice by one of our heroes) and there aren't enough plot turns or twists to set Nemesis apart from the rest.<br /><br />Still, it's a decent flick that won't send you scurrying for a copy of "Attack of the Clones".</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZE73RFY0GD3K.html">A2ZE73RFY0GD3K</a><br/><p>Remember the Star Trek - Next Generation episode in which the crew discovered, trapped on a remote installation, a &quot;double&quot; of Will Riker?  And this individual actually WAS Will Riker, who eight years previous had been on a mission there, and unknowingly had encountered some sort of ray that split him into two individuals, both the exact same person.  One Riker returned to the Enterprise and continued his career, and the other stayed trapped at the installation.<p>Eight years later, the Enterprise crew discovered him.  Effectively on vacation for eight years, he had not really grown any.  His career was in suspense -- while the other Riker had continued upward, and was now first mate of the Enterprise.  The relationship between Riker #1 and Deanna had cooled, but Riker #2 still cared for her, and proposed to her... but she refused, since her feelings for Will (either of them) had changed in eight years.  Riker #2 departed, and took up his middle name (Thomas) to distinguish himself from Riker #1 (Will).<p>Now, in this final Star Trek movie, Will Riker marries Deanna.  Don't you have to know that Riker #2 Thomas, still out there in the Federation somewhere, had to be majorly hacked off when he heard about that?  Riker #2 was the one whose feelings for Deanna had NOT changed, yet old Riker #1 ended up getting the girl.<p>If there was strife between the two Rikers at family reunions before, one can only imagine (with horror) what things are like now.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>This definitely could have been a better Star Trek movie, but it was still enjoyable.  I heard Marina Sirtis (the actress who plays Troi) talk about the flaws in this movie.  Most important was that the director never saw Star Trek before filming and never saw fit to watch any of it.  He wanted to make an action movie, which is what he did.  He cut out all the interpersonal relationships which make Trek what it is (check out the deleted scenes!).  He even wanted to cut the wedding completely out.<br /><br />That said, the villain was more engaging than the cookie-cutter villains in past TNG films, the special effects were great and the ending was surprisingly touching.  Worth the money!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>This is billed as being the final journey of the Next Generation crew, and it definitely IS the final journey for one of them.  Any time a major character dies, you have to wonder about how they're going to bring them back, but this character's death isn't a "Mr. Spock" kind of death...it's definitely a "Captain Kirk" dead-and-gone way to do it.  While I hate to see a character develop for 15 years and then be wiped clean in an instant, in this case the character's death makes sense, and they go out in the most heroic manner I've seen through any of the films or tv shows.  It's hard to believe the new crew is gone, but I guess the Paramount folks figured it was best to give these folks a rest and move on to their other two major ST franchises of Voyager and DS9.  Maybe for the next film we can see the remaining characters of all 3 series (Enterprise just doesn't count) get together to find Sisko or something.  Yes, this movie has it's cameos from Wesley Crusher (non-speaking, thank goodness) and Guinan too just for good measure.  And it's good to see Ryker finally taking a ship of his own (I didn't give anything away - that's revealed in the first 5 minutes of the movie).  The villian in this one is so subdued with that inner smoldering anger that he's almost comatose.  He definitely ain't no Khan, that's for sure.  I highly recommend this movie though and I eagerly await the next one in the series!

The plot is pretty imaginative, all except for the clone part, which seems pretty run-of-the-mill sci-fi stuff after "Episode II" and the "Austin Powers" movies.  But, the plot simply wouldn't be as good, or work as well, without it, and it is handled very well.  The plot is, however, at times somewhat confusing and underplayed, but not much.  And one can easily spot some similarities between this and other previous Trek films; "The Wrath of Khan" most of all, as well as "The Undiscovered Country", and even a dab or two of "The Search For Spock".  But these aside, it's a highly enjoyable movie, and makes a worthy end to the big screen voyages of Picard n' crew.  The whole Enterprise (which, by the way, looks better than ever) crew is in top form, of course.  The guy who plays Shinzon gives a highly entertaining, and different, performance.  While not trying to be as menacing as a Klingon or Khan, he gives a stand-out performance as the "Nemesis" of the title (and he really does look like a younger Patrick Stewart).  The ending is exciting and tense; yet, there is a sense of sadness as well (especially ********* to ruin it would be futile), but also of hope...........as with "The Undiscovered Country", which was the last voyage of the original Enterprise crew.<p>"Star Trek: Nemesis" is well-worth seeing on the big screen, and is certainly tied with "First Contact" as the best of the Next Generation film series.  Well worth the 4-year wait!<p>(Now I wonder if they'll make a film series of "Deep Space Nine", which I think would be interesting to see;  I haven't seen more than one full episode of that series, but what I remember of it was really boring.  but it had a great theme!  And after that, maybe films of "Voyager"?  "Enterprise"?)</p></br><a href="../users/A3QZCA4LTTVGAD.html">A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</a><br/><p>"Star Trek: Nemesis" reteams the crew from the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" TV series and ensuing feature films. Once more, we enter the sci-fi world of the intrepid crew of the Starship "Enterprise." This latest installment in the ongoing "Trek" saga opens with turmoil on Romulus, the homeworld of one of humanity's perennial foes. The "Enterprise," still under the command of Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent out to deal with the situation. The film introduces a new alien race: the Remans, who hail from Romulus' sister planet. Key to the story is Shinzon, who grew up on the Reman homeworld yet has a strange and very personal connection to Picard.<p>"Nemesis" certainly has a lot of good elements going for it. The Remans, who reminded me of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" type demons, are a visually impressive alien race, and equally impressive is Shinzon's massive warship. There are some well played action sequences, and it's great to see the Next Gen crew together again.<p>But I felt by the film's end that its makers had aimed for an epic scope and emotional resonance which they never quite achieved. While the film is certainly a great improvement over the last Next Gen feature (the limp "Insurrection"), it never achieves the heights reached in the best of the Next Gen films ("First Contact") or in the best of the TV episodes.<p>Maybe part of the problem is the villain Shinzon, played by Tom Hardy. He too often comes across as a petulant schoolboy. I didn't fully buy him as the brilliant, battle-hardened military commander he allegedly is. He's not in the same league as Trek's best villains, like Khan or the Borg Queen. Also, while the Remans are visually striking and as a species have a compelling history, I felt that in the end they were underdeveloped as a new alien race. And while Ron Perlman brings a commanding presence to his role as the Reman Viceroy, I felt the filmmakers seriously underutilized his great talents.<p>Other aspects of the film struck me as gratuitous or clumsily put together (particularly some sexual innuendo that seems stuck at a junior high mentality). And, like "Star Trek: Insurrection," some aspects of the film had a "been there, done that" feel to them; Hardy's Shinzon in particular felt uncomfortably like a rip-off of a certain blonde nemesis already faced by the Next Gen crew during their TV run.<p>These gripes aside, I must still say that I enjoyed "Nemesis," and I do hope that this film is not the end of the line for either the Next Gen crew or the toothy Remans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>Part of me really wants to be nice to "Star Trek: Nemesis."  After all, it could very well be the last Star Trek film ever.  However, this film has such major problems that it can't be viewed as more than a mediocre Trek entry.<br /><br />The entire first hour of this film is borderline boring.  Star Trek film usually take a while to get going, but "Nemesis" takes this to absurd lengths.  Other than a shocking opening scene, very little happens in the film's first act, with the exception of the car chase (more on that atrocity later).  With the exception of Stewart, none of the actors here stand out.  The Trek regulars are obviously trying because they knew this would be their last gyst, but they still come off as dull, and Worf is turned into a comic sidekick.<br /><br />The guest list in "First Contact" and "Insurrection" was impressive- Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Kridge, F. Murray Abraham, Anthony Zerbe, Donna Muprhey.  Here, we're instead stuck with Tom Hardy and Dina Meyer.  Hardy obviously tries as the villain Shinzon, but he's hampered by the fact that he bears no resemblance to Picard (who's supposedly his doppleganger) and that he spends half the film trying to imitate Khan (Trek villains really need to stop that; no one will ever again match Khan).  Meyer shows no energy whatsoever.  The only good guest star is Ron Perlman, but he's criminally underused (see "Hellboy" for what this guy is capable of).<br /><br />The greatest flaw of "Nemesis" is that it is, at heart, a dumb action film.  This is Star Trek Lite.  I suppose it was inevitable.  Star Trek films have always been about ideas over action, but in the age of loud explosions and mindless thrills (after all, Jerry Bruckheimer is now one of the most successful producers ever), this formula has come to look like a dinosaur to mainstream audiences.  The Star Trek producers would inevitably try to make the franchise appeal to mainstream audiences again by sacrificing Star Trek's very soul, while at the same time trying to keep hardcore fans on board.  The result is a film that is still too talky and slow for mainstream audiences, but is dumbed down just enough to piss off Trekkies.<br /><br />Case in point is the "car chase" early on in the film.  It has little importance to the plot, and it's downright stupid.  Of course, it is competently done, but you never get the feeling when you're watching it that this is a Star Trek film- it could have been pulled out of any Bruckheimer picture.  I'm not even getting into the flaws that geeks spot, such as how the Enterprise crew in this sequence basically ignores all Federation protocol.<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm roasting "Nemesis," let me say that it's not a BAD movie in the sense that "The Final Frontier" was.  Indeed, "Nemesis" can be lauded for doing one thing right- saving its best for last.  All of its memorable moments happen in the final 40 minutes, which contain such impressive and tense space battles that you almost forget everything stupid that's happened before.  Almost, that is.<br /><br />I gave both "Insurrection" and "Nemesis" three stars, but "Insurrection" is the superior film, if only because it tries to stick to the Star Trek formula.  "Nemesis" is a misguided attempt to reshape Star Trek into an action franchise, and it simply doesn't fit.  Star Trek is supposed to be about more than space battles and explosions.  I don't know if there will ever be another Trek film, but "Nemesis" shows what happens to good franchises when their producers decide that they must be dumbed down for mainstream tastes (see the 1989-1997 "Batman" franchise for another example of this).  It is an enjoyable film with some great action scenes, but it has little else.  And Star Trek deserves better.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Chances are, if you are buying this movie, you have already formed an opinion on it by now. As the reviews suggest, it is not an outright success story, but it has to be said it does miss the mark on a lot too.<br /><br />This re-release as a special edition gives a chance to re-evaluate what seems like it will be the last in the Next Generation movies. In viewing again, long after the excitement of a new Trek movie has passed, and the disappointment of something less than was hoped for or hyped has faded, Nemesis turns out to be not such a bad movie after all. The plot revolves around the Romulan Empire, specifically its new leader who has taken power with the Remans, previously the dominated race. This new leader, Schinzon, turns out to be Picards clone, and when Schinzon summons Picard and the Enterprise, the question is - what are his motives. Well, predictably after a period of cautious circling and meaning infused dinners, the motives turn out to be domination and destruction, and our heroes have to save the day - however, along the way the writer (John Logan, also writer of Gladiator) infuses much subtext of families and the dilemna of facing the evil within yourself, and aspiring to become something better - very much the stuff of Trek.<br /><br />For the movie, the writing is not bad, the effects fantastic, and this version boasts a wonderful dts mix as well as 5.1. However, as comfortable as the leads are in their roles, and Tom Hardy fills out his part well also, there is a nagging feeling of tiredness about it all. It's refreshing to see the characters move on - one of the excellent deleted scenes has Picard discuss with data the passage of time marked by occasions such as weddings and funerals, not just without but within too, and it's this sort of character growth that helped inject so much humanity into the classic trek characters - shame they cut that scene. However, the attempt to find a 'personal' villain for Picard does not hit the mark - we never do feel that passionately involved, as the characater is so completely new to us. How much more resonant it might have been if the character was from Picards past, and featured in the TV series, such as Khan was for Kirk.<br /><br />If you already have the movie and are debating whether to get it for the extras, I can only say - do it. The second disc is heaving with extras on all subjects possible. The deleted scenes last almost 30 minutes, and almost all genuinely add something. One can understand the need to trim a movie down, but honestly it feels like this could have been a richer movie with some of these scenes intact. The production, the music, the director, all are featured with extensive interviews. There are two commentaries on the disc, plus one text commentary - if you think you can really watch the movie that often! While mostly interesting, the extras do show less honest heart-searching on the end result, as it does sound like PR plurb, but that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />In short, for a Trek movie this would not be a first choice, but well worth buying to complete the Star trek movie experience. As a special edition, this is well worth it for the extras on display. 7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation made names for themselves by bringing speculative fiction to prime-time with a serious, long-running, and engaging series about a multicultural crew in a future where Earth's problems had mostly been solved.  Unfortunately, that formula never translated to the big screen.  The best Star Trek movies (what fans refer to as the "even-numbers" - Treks 2, 4, 6, 8, and now 10) are the ones that sidestep serious SF issues in favor of action and camp.  Look at the history: the odd-numbered, SF-oriented Treks involved V'ger, the Genesis Planet, God, and whatever was going on in Generations.  Every one of those films are almost universally reviled by fans. On the other hand, fighting a psycho, visiting the 1980s, making peace with Klingons, and defeating the Borg queen are the Trek movies everyone likes - and the Trek movies centered on action, camp, and outright humor.<p>Nemesis follows in this splendid tradition by offering the next "even" Trek, supposedly the last voyage of the Next Generation crew.  With everyone assembled for Riker's and Troi's wedding, the Enterprise-E picks up a strange signal on a pre-Warp world close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.  Of course, the investigate.  On a pre-Warp world, using the transporter violates the Prime Directive (don't interfere in stuff that ain't yours), but galavanting around in a shiny laser-equipped dune buggy is OK.  Picard gets a moment of pure joy as he tears around an alien desert, picking up parts of what turns out to be a prototype of Data.<p>No sooner does everyone get back to the ship than Admiral Janeway call Picard on the Interstellar Network, both establishing the nonexistent future of Voyager movies by revealing her new desk job and establishing the plot of the movie by ordering Enterprise to go to Romulus and discuss peace with the new Praetor of the Romulan Empire.  The new Praetor is Shinzon, a Reman.  Until Shinzon assassinated the entire Romulan senate, the Remans were the slaves and whipping boys of the Romulan Empire, a mix of 1920s-era Nosferatu-style vampires and modern, brooding high-school Goths.  Now, the Remans are a force to be reckoned with, because not only do they have an enormous battleship that fires Enterprise-sized torpedoes and has a new kind of radiation designed to wipe out entire planets, but they managed to build it all while they were miners and slaves.  Any race that can accomplish that deserves to rule the galaxy.<p>But the fun doesn't end there.  It turns out that Shinzon is a clone of Picard, who was at one time going to replace the good Captain. When the Romulans abandoned that project, instead of killing such a politically sensitive creature, they instead sent him to grow up bitter, resentful, and free of morals in a harsh mining environment.  Oops.  At any rate, Shinzon isn't interested in making peace - as if this wasn't obvious by his menacing visage and the sinister music that follows him around.  In fact, he's out to attack the Federation and use his nasty radiation on the unsuspecting inhabitants of Earth - and who better to stop him than Picard and company?<p>Nemesis follows the even-Trek formula to a T.  Yeah, it's campy, and there are some plot holes large enough to park Shinzon's ship for a little shore leave.  But that's what makes a good Trek movie, and Nemesis is better than average.  The only movie to successfully combine the SF elements of the show and the action of the films was The Undiscovered Country, and Nemesis doesn't come close to that, but for fun value and action sequences, it's right up there with Wrath of Khan and First Contact.  Fans who recognize the limitations of the Trek films should be duly impressed; the fanboys will no doubt pan it and complain.<p>Final Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>It's about friggin' time!  After 20 years and 7 mediocre films in the series, Trek FINALLY delivers the goods!  Undeniably the best of the Next Generation era films and arguable the best one since Khan,  Screenwriter John Logan and Director Stuart Baird are unequivocally the best thing to happen to Trek since Nicholas Meyer was brought into the fold.  The result is an entertaining installment that finally elevates the cast of TNG from the television series and solidifies their position to feature film status.  My biggest complaint of the post-classic Trek films is that they have always come off as 2 hour long episodes of the television series, and not even the best episodes of the show at that.  There have been much better episodes of the series that should have been made into theatrical films like "All Good Things" or "The Best of Both Worlds".  Until "Nemesis" came along, the Berman-era films have failed to distinguish themselves as theatrical contenders.<br /><br />Although the plot of Nemesis may seem a bit like a "clone" of Wrath of Khan, it definitely has the chemistry to make it an enjoyable and entertaining [copy].  For instance, the scene where a crippled Enterprise backs away from the Scimitar to escape the "Doomsday" weapon (see Genesis Device), you can practically hear the sinister Shinzon uttering "No Picard, you can't get away!"  The references to Khan are unmistakable, but scribe John Logan knows his audience and he knows exactly what they want to see and he knows these characters and injects the franchise with the right dosage of action and humor to resuscitate life into the dying franchise and keep the crew of the good ship Enterprise trekkin' a bit longer.<br /><br />As always, Patrick Stewart delivers a first class performance with Shakespearean benediction no matter how bland the script or dialogue may be.  Here, Picard has truly met his match in the form of a clone of himself.  This clone is younger and more agressive and mirrors his younger self in every flawed detail.  The whole time I kept thinking of the brilliant episode "Tapestry" where Q sends Jean-Luc back to change the mistakes of his past and we meet that arrogant and brash younger version.  Here, Shinzon is literally an example of Youth versus Wisdom and the themes are remakably explored between these two diametrical characters.  Khan he is not, but Tom Hardy delivers a diabolical performance as the calculating villain.  I still would like to have seen Shinzon complete the blood transfusion and jump 30 years in age in which we would have seen Patrick Stewart playing opposing roles against himself but perhaps that would have been too much like the classic Trek episode "The Enemy Within."<br /><br />The supporting cast are all present and (somewhat) accounted for.  Gates McFadden is basically "On Call" as Dr. Beverly Crusher making the house calls as needed.  As usual, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi serves basically one function, that of a psychic Ouija Board, but her engagement scene to William Riker was befitting.  Levar Burton once again holds the ship together as Chief Engineer Geordi LaForge delivering all of the technobabble and suffering from Scotty Syndrome.  As for the loveable Klingon warrior, Mr. Worf, it seems Michael Dorn is unfairly given the smallest part to play in this film.  During the film's climax, he seems to disappear from sight while Jonathan Frakes' Potsy-looking (see Anson Williams from Happy Days) Riker is manhandling the Reman Viceroy (Ron Pearlman) down a laundry chute while Jean-Luc Picard is fighting with (himself) and the Enterprise is taking a pummeling.  One must assume that either Worf is still too hung over from the Romulan Ale served at Riker and Troi's reception, or that he must be curled up in Ten Forward lounge with a bottle of Saurian Brandy getting drunk with Guinan.  I find it amusing that he only shows up again at the end for the free booze in the Captain's Ready Room during the toast to "absent friends."  I'm surprised that they didn't cut back to Worf during the corridor firefight with the Reman thugs.  I would love to have seen him break out the Bat'Leh and take them out in honorable Klingon fashion as it would have provided another element of suspense.<br /><br />Brent Spiner reprises his role as the charming android Data and once again explores his humanity through the presence of a doppleganger brother in the form of the childlike B4.  This could have been the perfect opportunity to bring back his evil brother Lore had they not written him out on the show.  Perhaps B4 was designed with the intention of giving Spiner an oportunity to explore new facets of his character having reached a redundant impasse with the development of his role Data.<br /><br />It is a shame that it took them 4 films with this exceptional cast before everything finally clicked on what may be the last film to feature the TNG crew although the door has been left open for possibly another voyage.  If they can continue with this level of dramatic intensity then by all means "Make It So."  And if they do decide to make another, I would love to see them bring back John DeLancie as Q.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>This is the film Paramount Pictures should have made for the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" crew for their theatrical debut, not the insipid "Star Trek: Generations". Although "Star Trek: First Contact" is slightly better with respect to pacing, "Star Trek Nemesis" is superior with regards to the script, acting and drama. Truly it is the "Next Generation" film which resonates most strongly with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's belief in mankind's ability in improving itself, as exemplified in the character of Lieutenant Commander Data (I shall not divulge any secrets, but Brent Spiner gives one of his finest performances as Data in this film.). <p>"Star Trek Nemesis" is also the most intelligent "Star Trek" film since "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country", with a villian, the Romulan Praetor Shinzon (portrayed well by young British actor Tom Hardy), who is a worthy adversary for Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise of Khan-like proportions. "Star Trek Nemesis" is the most intelligent film in the franchise in years because of its thoughtful look at friendship, improving oneself with the goal of aiding others, and political intrigue within the Romulan Star Empire.<p>Other excellent performances are from Patrick Stewart as Picard, Dina Meyer as Romulan Commander Donatra and Ron Perlman as the Reman viceroy. Unfortunately, not enough screen time is given to most of the crew, though they do have their moments (for example, you'll laugh at Michael Dorn's Worf during one of the opening schemes of the film.). Jerry Goldsmith's concert hall-quality musical score, John Logan's excellent script and Stuart Baird's crisp direction are other splendid reasons for seeing "Star Trek Nemesis".<p>I hope Paramount Pictures will have yet another cinematic voyage for Picard and company. It's a shame the film isn't faring well due to stiff competition from "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"; surely it is one of the best installments in the "Star Trek" film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>This movie was released during the first Lord of the Rings maina a few years back. How did they expect to do going up against a blockbuster like that?  It is a good film.  It has space battles and a antagonist that would have made a good two part episode.  It's all in the expectations...you are not watching the Matrix when you see a Star Trek movie.  It's about a cast of characters we've been watching for seven seasons and three movies...it's not the loser that critics say it is...</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The crew of the Enterprise-E squares off against the evil Shinzon (Tom Hardy), who, with the aid of a powerful starship, is out to settle a score against both Romulus and Earth.  Finally, a TNG movie allows some change--actually, quite a bit of change--in the lives and circumstances of our characters rather than returning them all to the kind of eternal stasis that is common to episodic television.  This is a quality that always made the classic Trek films feel like events--Kirk was promoted off his ship, Spock died, the Enterprise was destroyed, etc.  TNG films have always gotten that wrong, right from the first one, in which they were still flying around in the same ship and wearing the same uniforms from the TV series.  Now Berman and Co. seem to have finally clued in to that fact, but it feels like too little too late.<p>Final verdict: this is a passable but disappointing adventure.  Some good action is undermined by dark sets and a stagy feel to the proceeding.  And what's up with Worf?  He has been returned to duty aboard the Enterprise without explanation, although the finale of the Deep Space 9 series showed him becoming a liaison between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  It's a shame that the filmmakers chose to ignore that logical and well-developed bit of character evolution just so that he could stand around in the background for one more tired film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>I am not a follower of the ST movies, so I found this movie to be rather boreing.

But it's also nowhere near the best. Falling smack dab in the midst of mediocrity, this film is crying to be great but feels like a paint by numbers Van Gough.<p>Centered on the story of a subclass of Romulans gaining control of its council with the intent of taking over the Federation, the film follows the generation crowd at a time of change as second in command Will Riker and his new wife, ship's counselor Deana Troi, ready to leave the crew. It seems like the over-all theme of the film is supposed to be endings and new beginnings, but that bittersweet concept seems lost in the mostly uninteresting Romulan plot line. What is most frustrating though, is while Nemesis is better then the last Trek film, Insurrection, it had potential to be one of the best of the series. Instead the great scenes are hidden behind the tedious plot. Excellent character moments are screaming to get out, but are replaced either by boring plot developments or ill-placed comedic relief.<p>On the flip side, the special effects are probably some of the best Trek effects yet. But as is becoming more and more evident in modern film, effects don't make a good movie. There are also some fun cameos early on in during what is probably the best scene. In fact, the first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed like it was headed in the right direction. But that was all before the plot took a death grip on it.<p>If Nemesis' story could be related to any other Trek film, it would be that of The Wrath of Kahn, with its similar plot and structure. But this latest seems to be only a pale imitation of Kahn's brilliance. Definitely worth skipping until the video is released, except for the die-hard Trekkies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Sorry folks, but this movie not the Star Trek of just a few years ago. It was so boring, a yawner! I waited the whole film for something to happen and when if finally did, I could care less. This is not one of the 50 minute TV shows that used to get a little boring with all the talk, talk, talk, which would mercifully end at the top of the hour. This is a movie, they can't make talk fests out of them and expect them to be good.<br /><br />The Captan seemed out of character too, what was the deal with him being so happy in the beginning? And Data, boring, he ceased to be interesting when half the movie was about him and him! Then you had Picard and Picard why didn't the writers think to bring in Will and Will?<br /><br />All in all a very lousy movie. I thought the last one was bad but this one was really bad.<br /><br />How sad, that the advertised last voyage ended up as bad as Star Trek the Motion picture!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>I am not going to argue if the film's plot is like another.  I don't watch a film to hold comparisons.  I judge the film strictly on its merits.  And frankly, I really enjoyed this ST entry.  I love the series and have always thought the films never reached the greatness of the series that spun them.  It was bigger, fancier, but ST always revolved around the people not the plot.  And in that this film is one of the best ST films.<p>It maintains that esprit de corps and spectacular film.  Maybe expectations hurt this.  Everyone went in expecting this or that from the film.  I did not, so I truly enjoyed it.  I have watched if several times and each time I am impressed.<p>So kick by and stop analyzing and enjoy the fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>Once again this film (as does the DVD itself) has to be all about Brent Spiner.<p>Oh how I loathe his hammy acting and he just ruins this film. He co-wrote the script which pretty much gave him free reign to shut out other characters (Crusher, Riker, Geordi, even Worf!) while he, himself, got to play 2 roles! Data and B4! UNBELIEVABLE!<p>I purchased the DVD earlier today and was shocked to find that the entire packaging is centered around...you guessed it, Brent!<p>He appears on the front, the back, the side sleeve, the paper insert and even the disc! It would have been nice to have seen Picard alone, bit no..every picture of him either has Brent beside him or looking over his shoulder.<p>This last film by the TNG cast tanked at the box office. Maybe most fans, like myself, just got sick of the filsm always being about Data. Nothing kills a fun time better than an ego.<p>To save this film from a completly abysmal rating, I do give a major plus to Tom Hardy as Shinzon. That boy is talented &amp; I would much rather have preferred screen time going to his character development rather than watching the horribly untalented Brent Spiner sing at Troi's wedding.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Apparently the final film in the long-running STAR TREK film series, NEMESIS is simply the best of the franchise. It also works as a marker to show how far the films have come since the first snooze-fest STAR TREK. Stuart Baird's direction makes this one a tautly-paced, exciting adventure with fantastic special effects and a great score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. Both Patrick Stewart as Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker turn out great peformances, and the added gravitas fills the void left by previous Trek movies. There are some complaints; the middle section tends to drag on for a while and the cop-out ending seems to contradict the well-known publicity about this one being the last. But this is minor carping, as the film as a whole is great fun.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I remember first seeing Star Trek: Nemesis in theaters and being extremely disappointed. I thought it was too dark and was missing much of the "soul" of the Star Trek TNG series, which excelled at morality plays. However, in re-watching it recently, I've revised my opinion upwards, albeit it still doesn't rank as the greatest of the Star Trek films.<br /><br />First, the bad. While the movie seems to contain an interesting moral message about the "nature vs. nurture" debate, it sacrifices that subplot on the alter of action scenes. The idea of Data and Picard confronting "clones" of themselves is intriguing, but the plot device bringing them together seems forced. In fact, the whole chase scene at the beginning seems gratuitous and out-of-place for a Star Trek film.<br /><br />The second major problem with the movie is that director Stuart Baird seems unfamiliar with the ensemble nature of Star Trek TNG. After the initial scene, the movie becomes a "Data and Picard" show. The other characters only have minor roles. Geordi, Dr. Crusher, and Worf have little more than glorified cameos. While everybody loves Data and Picard, they work best when they can work with the other crew members. Admittedly, Deanna Troi gets to put her telepathy to good use, but her scenes, including a telepathic "rape," almost seem more awkward than exciting.<br /><br />Finally, the Remans and the Reman plot were simply not well executed. The Romulans would have been a perfectly good enemy for the TNG crew. They've always been manipulative and intelligent. By contrast, the Remans seem like a bunch of boorish brutes. They don't seem to plan any of the attacks or do much thinking at all, leaving that up to the human leader Shinzon. And the masks just don't look realistic. They look like Romulans wearing vampire masks. Their uniforms are shiny almost to the point of looking like disco suits. I suspect the producer and director thought the movie needed a more "menacing" enemy, but I think the Romulans would have worked better.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the movie does work as an action movie, if not the most faithful of Star Trek films. It's entertaining and suspenseful. The threat to Earth is serious and Picard's response to it is appropriately grave. The space battles look beautiful, especially with the green nebula as a backdrop. The damage the Enterprise E suffers in the battle is shocking, even more so than the destruction of the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations. Seeing the enterprise in such disrepair really raises the emotional stakes.<br /><br />Despite my earlier comments about the plot, this movie does have some wonderful "Star Trek" moments. I was ecstatic when I saw Riker and Troi's wedding - a moment anticipated since the very first TNG episode. The dialogue between Data and Picard about "nature vs. nurture" recalls the best of the TNG series. Picard's reaction to Shinzon's appearance and death are silent yet laden with thought. And, of course, the death of a beloved crew member at the end nearly made me cry.<br /><br />While I wish I could unreservedly praise Star Trek: Nemesis, given that it is the last of the TNG films, my reactions are mixed. There's a lot of unrealized potential and far too many poor choices. Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AGRR05FH945HR.html">AGRR05FH945HR</a><br/><p>I have only just seen this movie, partly because I began to lose interest after Insurrection, and partly because of the overall negative reviews.<br /><br />However, Nemesis is certainly worth watching, even if it is a little formulaic; although there are a number of questionables, many of which have been pointed out by other fans.<br /><br />For me, the recurring idiocy is the idea of being defenseless against a cloaked ship. Hello, the second the ship fired, even a modern-day military computer and radar system could pinpoint the exact source of the shot, and provide counterattack coordinates to the ship under fire. Even if you can't see the ship, you can see the point of emanation.<br /><br />As for using up all of the photon torpedoes in a single relatively brief engagement; as another fan pointed out, this is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />Please watch the movie and make up your own mind. It's better than Insurrection, but not a 'great' movie, like First Contact or any of the Classic Trek epics.<br /><br />There's certainly the possibility of a sequel built into the ending, but after the disappointing box office for Nemesis, they will need to be very sure they have a winner before they put anything else together. Especially since the sequel would be an odd-numbered movie...</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>You know, for all of their blind loyalty over the years, Star Trek Fans really deserve better then this. 'Nemesis' is probably the pitiful death-kneel of a once-proud franchise that was driven into the ground by a group of people at Paramount (led by Rick Berman) that just have little or no idea what made Star Trek so endearing.<br /><br />The acting is just terrible. Patrick Stewart just looks like he's going through the motions. I think it's clear that he wants to move on to other things.  Creatively, I think he's visibly bored.  Jonathan Frakes is a TV actor and still hasn't made a comfortable leap to the big screen, and Michael Dorn's Worf has basically become a Klingon stereotype. This brings me to the sad story of Data. First of all, you can't spend almost 16 years playing out the whole Pinocchio storyline with Data. All of those "I don't understand humanity and yet aspire to be human" moments have stopped being endearing quite some time ago, now they're just annoying. His big scene at the end of the movie (I'm really trying not to drop any spoilers) was just totally devoid of any kind of emotion (or emotional impact) at all. His dual role as B-4 (get it? "Before") is just terrible, clearly done just in case there's a sequel. The rest of the crew make a cameo, but are essentially given absolutely nothing to do.  Buried in the void of this film are also Dina Meyer and Ron Perlman.  You'd honestly never know they were there.<br /><br />When 'Nemesis' was being made I had a glimmer of hope for the film.  I thought that bringing on director Stuart Baird as a fresh start was a good way to move off of a creative rut I saw the franchise in.  Baird was a long-time understudy of Richard Donner, so I thought, at worst, the film would be exciting.  It didn't work at all though.  One of the reasons that Star Trek works is because of its attention to detail and the ability to respect its own continuity and rules.  'Nemesis', unfortunately, didn't do any of that.<br /><br />The plot is riddled with conflicts of logic. Shinzon is the double for Picard and explains that "other then his jaw and nose being broken years ago, they look identical"? What? This guy's face is as smooth as silk! If anyone could have gotten away with that kind of a statement, it should probably have been Picard! Stewart, just be virtue of being older, could very easily have had those injuries in his youth.<br /><br />How could the Enterprise have rammed a vessel when they had no shields and the opponent's shields were at 70%? Wouldn't the Enterprise have just broken up on the front of the other ship? I also love villains who cart around a Death-star caliber weapon and don't use it. I could actually keep going too; this is just the short list!<br /><br />So far the Next Generation movies are just 1 for 4 with 'First Contact' being their only redeeming moment. Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave if he knew the state his beloved franchise was in right now. I'm actually praying that there isn't an 11th movie. If there is, there had better be a complete, top-to-bottom turnover in its creative team right up to Rick Berman. What they have now is just NOT getting the job done</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Though I feel a bit out of place reviewing a &quot;Next Generation&quot; Star Trek Film--I was never a huge fan of the second Star Trek TV series or any that came after it--there's enough wrong with this particular entry to deserve comment.  Even on the small screen, ho-hum Jean-Luc Picard and crew were tedious substitutes for the original series' wonderfully adventurous and colorful characters, and it's that lack of charisma that is the main problem with &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis.&quot;  Without caring much about the characters, there's no emotional punch to the film's often poorly conceived and executed scenes, even if some seem lifted from the much less expensive but much more watchable predecessor, &quot;Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan.&quot;  In this one, several rather awkward plot contrivances pit a heretofore unknown clone of Picard named Shinzon against the Federation, though the reasons for the clone's psychotic hatred against humanity are murky, at best.  (From what we see onscreen, it makes more sense for him to hate his Romulan keepers.)  While the film's opening ten minutes are gripping--featuring the brutal assassination of the Romulan government--things go downhill from there, including a tired wedding sequence that has little to do with the rest of the film, several space battles created with topnotch special effects but that are as exciting as watching bathtub toys bobbing along, and the inevitable, surprisingly bland face-to-face confrontation between Shinzon and Picard.  The film's pace and story are so unengaging that I even had time to consider how silly it was to use vehicles with wheels in an age of spaceships zipping around (through a ship's corridors, no less) and people beaming themselves from place to place; &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; gave me plenty of time to disengage from what was happening on the screen.  So far, only one &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie has held my interest--the surprisingly fun &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;--but that's probably because it came closest in spirit to the 1960s TV series (though it contradicts what we learned there).  Even Jerry Goldsmith's score can't seem to pump any excitement into what should have been Captain Picard's finest hour.</p></br></body></html>

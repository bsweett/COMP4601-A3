I LOVE them! - and I loved this movie to pieces!!<br /><br />First off, this movie is just beautiful- just to LOOK at it!<br /><br />They did a wonderful job on the wardrobes, and all the settings, especially those of the inside of the palace, were just elegant and so..VICTORIAN :)<br /><br />I love all things Victorian, anyway and this movie is a treat for the eyes. All the eye popping COLORS were very pretty. The cinematography was the best,too.<br /><br />All this aside though, The story kept my attention throughout, and I thought the story to be very interesting.<br /><br />I think Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job portraying Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />But, like I said, it is a love or hate it movie.<br /><br />I just happen to love period pieces. (especially around this era) and the biggest thing that sold me on this particular one was the beautiful scenery/wardrobe/use of brilliant colors<br /><br />I give it an A+  .</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>After Sofia Coppola's successful films THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION, many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath. Taking on the life of MARIE ANTOINETTE is no small feat, too. Here is someone who's short life and reign as Queen of France ended in head-tumbling fashion, but affected France's government for years to come.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film, causing it to get booed at the Cannes Film Festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office. But many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure.<br /><br />I'm not going to give you a history lesson, as I'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of Marie Antoinette. But I will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film.<br /><br />First, expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes. Any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear (perhaps too many) and their excellent designs. Heading from the feet upward, the dresses, wigs, fans, and head-wear are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times. The film was shot on-location in Versailles, so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets.<br /><br />But from here the production takes a serious nosedive. The screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes (from Louis and Marie eating many silent breakfasts, to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls). The end of Marie's life is run through in slipshod fashion, as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the music. Incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before. The one that most comes to mind is A KNIGHT'S TALE. Although not the pinnacle of film success, A Knight's Tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story. But with Marie Antoinette, the connections are distant at best. Can you imagine songs from Bow Wow Wow and The Cure infusing a renaissance-style film? If you're like me, this is a bit hard to swallow.<br /><br />What happens in the end is we get a movie that is all pomp and no circumstance; visually appealing on almost every level but sorely lacking a decent script that would allow the acting to shine through. I'll give Kirsten Dunst a few claps of applause for her portrayal, as she made the best out of a pretty awful screenplay, but that's about it.<br /><br />A bit of a snoozer, I'm afraid.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>There is a great disparity of opinion on the '06 release of the film `Marie Antoinette' and it's really not that difficult to see why. Some viewers are more plot and substance driven, while others are more visually oriented. This movie obviously plays to the visuals. The film is cinematically stunning; the French landscape, the set design and the costumes are gorgeous beyond belief. If nothing else, this 2 hour and 3 minute romp through pre-revolutionary France will delight your senses to an array of color, texture and architectural wonder you'll long remember. For that it's worthy of at least 3 Stars.<br /><br />But what about plot and substance, is there any? The movie plays like a period piece on the lives of the rich and famous, however there are some good moments sprinkled in here and there. There are several charming and whimsical scenes concerning Marie's need to permanently establish her aristocratic standing by becoming pregnant and Louie's hesitation, lack of interest, or inability to consummate the marriage. There is also the presence of the constant, idle chatter amongst the bored, nobly born patrons of the King's Court that helps maintain your interest for awhile as the ill-defined plot lumbers to its eventual conclusion.<br /><br />Do I recommend this film? Well, if you're into period pieces and stories of Lords and Ladies, or if you're looking for magnificent scenery and sumptuous attire you'll probably enjoy it. If not you should pass on this one.<br /><br />My Rating: 3 ? Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>You can't really expect traditional style filmmaking when you deal with Sofia Coppola. A lot of what she does is more based on atmosphere and a serene landscape rather than being super realistic and narrative driven. It's probably because of this that the film wasn't that well received at Cannes or with most of the critics. While it's true that the film is potentially polarizing, you got to admit it's nice now and then to watch a film that actually cares about how it looks and what kind of emotions it brings out. It's like a film by Terrence Malick if he ever learned to quit pointing the camera at stuff every 20 seconds.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette was an Austrian member of royalty who was shipped off to France to marry Louis the XVI and provide an heir. Inexplicably Louis doesn't seem that interested in bedding the beautiful girl which is only one of many problems since she lives in a world where etiquette and protocol are the most important things. At first it's a little minor: she can't dress herself but has to wait for people to do it for her and manners in addressing the King's mistress. But pretty soon things get to her head and she gets into rockstar mode and spends a lot and parties which doesn't sit well at all with the people of France.<br /><br />If you're looking for a history lesson, read a book. You'll basically get the personal life and intimate details of who she was rather than getting caught up in dates and facts. There's points where you can't tell how much time has passed and have to gauge the film's timeline based on things around her such as the age of her first daughter or dialogue mentioned. But she was likely one of France's most hated queens and rampant rumors spread in France concerning her personal life, such as alleged lesbianism and sodomy. This is a look at a life who never seemed to make a right decision in people's eyes and it's a fascinating look at someone thought to be unbelievably reviled.<br /><br />One of the more controversial things about the film is the use of a more comtemporary soundtrack, with songs from artists like the Strokes, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Sometimes, such as the case of the Cure's majestic chording in "Plainsong" announcing Louis XVI becoming the next King of France and at times there's almost a rock backing with drums and guitar and it works great but then you have the opening credits set to a punk song and the Strokes on here, it just sounds a bit misguided. Certain ideas like the Cure work but other ones didn't work at all and it's a bit of a fumble.<br /><br />While music-wise it's a little iffy, this is certainly a dreamy kind of film. From the immaculate set design and costuming to the cinematography whenever they actually go outside which is very little is quite stunning. That's one of the things I always liked about this Coppola's movies is that she does know how to frame and point a camera but one brief scene in a garden Marie Antoinette had made had too much of a Virgin Suicides look to it. But regardless this is certainly Sofia's most ambitious looking film and thankfully it delivers. The pacing might throw people, the modern soundtrack might be too distracting but you gotta admit it's a lush looking film.<br /><br />On one hand, I'm disappointing by the lack of features but since Virgin Suicides or Lost in Translation weren't that packed, I guess it's a director thing. But if you're a fan of this film, and be warned that not everyone will; it's serviceable for a film that'll confuse for some and seduce others.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>As an instructor of film-studies, I was prepared to hate this piece. Since I have an interest in "historically inspired" work and the controversy which surrounds it (think Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231202">Amistad</a>, Lee's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002ND77">Malcolm X</a>, Stone's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDL93">JFK</a> etc...), I felt compelled to watch Coppola's film. So, I released a burdensome sigh when I dropped this DVD in the player ... then, I stared at the "two hours and two minutes" stamp with an expression of pain. Within minutes, I was completely riveted ...<br /><br />Coppola's work is masterful. The mise en sc&egrave;ne is breathtaking. Coppola's design-training (always evident in her work) is in full bloom: each frame is its own work of art. (And, until now, I have never seen the garishness of Versailles as beautiful). I was charmed by the artist's attention to the most minute detail. As if taking a cue from her cinematographer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a> (Edward Lachman), Coppola uses pale pinks and blues to emphasize Marie Antoinette's innocence (although Dunst was in her twenties, remember that Marie Antoinette was a mere fourteen years-old when sent to France). After an affair with Count Fersen, the queen's  infidelity is emphasized by a scarlet belt (very clever). The lushness of the film cannot be conveyed with words ...<br /><br />The acting is sublime. While I have never cared for the roles into which Dunst is usually thrust (save <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RFFS">Interview with the Vampire</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a>), this role is pure perfection. Dunst brings warmth and vulnerability to a much maligned historical figure. Moreover, Schwartzman is both compelling and amusing in his role as Louis XVI ... he, too, is wildly sympathetic as a "child-king" (only twenty years-old) ... "God help us. We are too young to reign."<br /><br />Coppola never intended to create a work faithful to history. Why should she? Anyone can flip to The History Channel or PBS to see that. Instead,  Coppola grants us the portrait of a frightened child ... with the hopes of France and Austria pinned to her frilly dress ... trying to navigate a tangle of tradition ... very much alone.<br /><br />Two hours and two minutes passed in a flash of decadence and heartbreak. After viewing Coppola's junior project, I can hardly await her next film. This is a phenomenal effort and a phenomenal success. Thank you Coppola for such a beautiful film!<br /><br />Suggested reading:<br />Fraser, Antonia. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307277747">Marie Antoinette: The Journey</a>.

With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette.  Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between.  I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.<br /><br />As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul.  When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France.  Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know.  The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all.  Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her.  Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.<br /><br />Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution.  As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen.  She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.<br /><br />`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her.  In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her.  This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution.  The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.<br /><br />One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used.  Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained.  That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do.  It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation.  Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance.  Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy.  The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.<br /><br />As a whole I was very impressed with this film.  Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully.  Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination.  Love it or hate it, `Marie Antoinette' is a one of a kind film that supports a revolutionary vision and serves us entertainment as sweet as pie...err cake.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>When your father directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, and is an executive producer of your film, and you've just won an Oscar for your last film, Lost in Translation (2003), I guess that gives you carte blanche to film a costume drama about Marie-Antoinette on location in Versailles. At least until they boo it at Cannes. It is after midnight and your coach has turned into a pumpkin. Good luck getting your next project green-lighted.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: It's not too much, is it?<br />L&eacute;onard: Oh, no!<br />==========<br /><br />For me a telling moment was in the bonus footage where they showed Sofia's daddy saying his daughter came to him for advice and he said something like "Just think of it like you're throwing a Marie-Antoinette party." The film was very much like a Marie-Antoinette party, but what a hangover the next morning, cleaning up the mess.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: Letting everyone down would be my greatest unhappiness.<br />==========<br /><br />I liked some things in Marie Antoinette a lot, so let me mention some of them: I liked the cast and the location. I liked the costumes and the art direction. Sofia Coppola had Spanish footwear designer Manolo Blahnik create hundreds of specially made shoes for the film; and Ladur&eacute;e was chosen to make all of the brightly colored pastries and cakes. It was a period drama with great attention to detail, yet with a contemporary twist--a pair of blue Converse tennis shoes was deliberately left in one scene to make the connection that Marie-Antoinette was like a typical teenager. The soundtrack featured post punk 80's music like Bow Wow Wow's cover of Bo Diddley's "I Want Candy" The Cure's "Plainsong" and Adam Ant, who by the way, modeled a lot of his stage costumes on the Louis the XIV look. Sofia returned the favor when she based the look of Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), one of Marie-Antoinette's lovers, on Adam Ant.<br /><br />A Marie-Antoinette with punk rock black lipstick says the famous quote attributed to her "Let them eat cake!" but then, the "real" Marie-Antoinette, sans the black lipstick, denies that she would ever say something so callous. Indeed, the not-so-hidden agenda of Marie Antoinette, the film by Sofia Coppola, was to show the human side to the doomed monarch.<br /><br />This is where I stopped liking the film. Not that I object to the idea of making Marie-Antoinette sympathetic per se, I just think that the film did not accomplish this feat. Perhaps she also wanted to show that in spite of all the lavish parties, life at Versailles could be pretty boring. At two hours plus (that seemed like much, much more), she accomplished that. I fell asleep trying to watch it three nights in a row. And after using up all that time, she didn't really manage to tell what was going on. There was one cryptic scene where a portrait of Marie-Antoinette and her family was moved into a sparsely furnished hallway. Then moved again. What was the point? Was someone painted over or added? What? The birth of her first child, a daughter, was shown, but later, as she is forced to leave Versailles by an angry mob, she has more children. With all the emphasis on her producing an heir it seems like Sofia could have mentioned something about their births. As a story teller she went off on so many tangents, burning up over two hours of time, but neglected the basic plot.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: So, I hear you like to make keys as a hobby?<br />Louis XVI: Yes.<br />Marie-Antoinette: And do you enjoy making keys?<br />Louis XVI: Obviously.<br />==========<br /><br />Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI did his job--being the most boring person to ever sit on the throne of France. Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, Danny Huston, and Steve Coogan are all very talented, but their talents were largely wasted here. Even Kirsten Dunst (who acts very well here BTW) was better utilized in Bring It On, where she managed to make the head of the cheerleading squad at a privileged school who had stolen all of their winning routines from a school in Compton sympathetic. Marie-Antoinette? Not so much. I tend to agree with the mobs, and Robespierre, and the Red Queen: "Off with her head!"<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OFFRQ2">How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</a> (2008) Kirsten Dunst was Alison Olsen; and Danny Huston was Lawrence Maddox<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMJG">Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2004) Kirsten Dunst was Mary<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXMP">Bring It On (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a> (2000) Kirsten Dunst was Torrance Shipman<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a> (1999) Directed by Sofia Coppola; and Kirsten Dunst was Lux Lisbon<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a> (1998) Jason Schwartzman was Max Fischer<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303369162">New Age [VHS</a>] (1994) Judy Davis was Katherine Witner<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8U8">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a> (1976) Rip Torn was Nathan Bryce<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303066879">Return to Two Moon Junction [VHS</a>] (1995) Molly Shannon was Traci<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000077VQY">Scarlet Diva</a> (2000) Asia Argento was Anna Battista<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007BK2N">24 Hour Party People</a> (2002) Steve Coogan was Tony Wilson; and Shirley Henderson was Lindsay<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: This is ridiculous.<br />Comtesse de Noailles: This, Madame, is Versailles.<br />==========</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Sophia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette," starring Kirsten Dunst, is a big old piece of cheesecake . . . it looks and tastes delicious, but eating of it too heartily will only make you sleepy and obese.  There is little or nothing of resonance in "MA," beyond some spectacular costume and set design.<br /><br />"MA" begins with our "heroine" as an innocent Austrian teenager, whisked away by geopolitics into a marriage with the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  And so begins Ms. Coppola's "poor little rich girl" story, where she tries valiantly to redeem Ms. Antoinette and make her an object of sympathy and admiration.  Ultimately, that's a dog that just won't hunt.<br /><br />We see early scenes where the spoiled rich nobility - empty suits and dresses all - smirk behind their gloves at the uncouth Austrian princess while also imposing the most ridiculous set of rules and protocols upon her.  Judy Davis exemplifies the silliness of the French court as she sternly instructs Marie to leave her beloved dog at the Austrian border - you can have as many French dogs as you like, my dear!  All these scenes pummel us into acknowledging Marie as a sympathetic figure, and yet so far she is nothing more than an undefined teenager.<br /><br />But soon, Marie adopts the spoiled ways of her French counterparts - she shops endlessly, takes a lover (that seems to be little more than an infatuation than a soulmate), and ignores the plight of her subjects.  The fact that Marie lives in the uber-opulence of Versailles (gorgeously shot, as if it could be filmed any other way) undermines any attempt to shore up Marie's sympathetic side.  In one shocking scene, Marie is confronted with the troubles of her people - there is a horrible bread shortage.  Her response?  She makes the less-than-magnificent concession, "Tell the jeweler to stop buying diamonds."  Truly, a woman of the people.<br /><br />Much has been made of the anachronistic '80s soundtrack, and I'll add my own quibble.  The movie seems to go about it half-way.  Much of the movie comes straight out of Merchant-Ivory, with baroque music and a period feel, but occasionally a Cure tune or other '80s punk band drops in.  Coppola could have gone all-out post-modern, like Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet," but this half-measure in unsatisfying.<br /><br />There are positives in this movie, but it is hard to come down on that side of the scale where the overarching purpose of the film - to redeem one of Europe's most glamorous villains - rings so false.  It is also unsettling that Schwartzman is given so little to do - his recent turn in "Shopgirl" shows that "Rushmore" was no fluke.  Dunst is beautiful, but her performance does not even match the intensity Madonna brought to Eva Peron in "Evita."<br /><br />And to top it off, after "Lost in Translation," I had exceedingly high expectations for Coppola's follow-up effort.  Perhaps unfairly high, but regardless, they were not met.<br /><br />Check out this movie if you are a huge fan of costume and set design, but other than that, it's worth a rental, nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a visually sumptuous film. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Costume Design, it rightly won that Oscar. That being said, it was the only Oscar for which it could possibly have been nominated, as the film itself was a disappointment. As a lover of period dramas, I eagerly rented this film. Not even its visual beauty, however, could keep me fully engaged in a film that simply does not tell a cohesive story. Unless one is fully familiar with the story of Marie Antoinette, the film will impart little to one's knowledge of the time, place, and people. As with a meringue, a frothy, delicious confection that promises much, one will find little of substance after one bite.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunce gives a tender performance as Marie Antoinette, a young Austrian princess thrust into a role that she did not seek, who is forced to leave all that she knew and loved in order to forge an alliance between Austria and France. An ephemeral portrait of this much maligned historical figure emerges, one that is somewhat sympathetic. Moreover, the use of rock music in the film is an interesting choice, as it serves to remind the viewer that Marie Antoinette was a young girl, not much different than young girls of today, with hopes and desires of her own. Yet, hers had to be sublimated. Without something of a cogent and compelling narrative, however, the story of Marie Antoinette falls by the wayside.<br /><br />While the social climate of France, which serves as a necessary counterpoint for the excesses of Marie Antoinette's court, is alluded to, it is little more of a blip in the film. This social event that caused two worlds to eventually collide, as the French Revolution became a reality rather than just a political theory, remains as elusive as the focal point of the film itself. The historical context of Marie Antoinette's reality, that is, the events that propelled her into the annals of history, is barely a footnote.<br /><br />Although the story of Marie Antoinette is historically a poignant one, the director, Sofia Coppola, simply  fails to tell a cohesive story, as the film meanders along, a tribute to extravagance and beauty but little else. This film, therefore, remains an elevation of form over substance. While loosely based upon a biography of Marie Antoinette by Antonia Fraser, it is little wonder that the author went on the record to disavow herself of this film.  I can also fully understand why this film was booed at the Cannes Film Festival. It is simply little more that a yawn yarn, though a visually enticing one. Unfortunately, the film's stunning visuals are not enough to fill the empty shell of this film.<br /><br />If one is not a fan of period pieces, deduct one star from my rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>Now that I've seen Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette", I understand the mixed critical reviews. I doubt many people could deny that visually this film is stunning: the costume design, sets and art direction are spectacular. But the 80's soundtrack and languid, dreamy tone are sure to polarize the audience.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought it all worked. This film portrays Marie Antoinette as a privileged, yet controlled and smothered, teenager. Arranged to marry the prince of France, her political survival depends on her giving birth to an heir. Unfortunately, her awkward husband, for reasons that are never really clear, can't consummate their marriage. So Marie Antoinette blows off steam by enjoying her stilted life the only ways she can: by spending loads of cash, partying nonstop and, eventually, finding some sense of purpose in motherhood.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst gives an understated, yet somehow charismatic, performance as the young queen. And although the film probably amounts to more style than substance, it's still well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's movie was "Marie Antoinette." I found it on our DVD shelves  and it must have been purchased by my wife at least a few years ago. The movie was interesting, to be sure, but presented a very incongruent mixture. For one, you should expect to just be overcome by the visuals. Magnificent! Stupendous! Totally unreal! Visually, this is one of the best movies I can ever remember watching. It doesn't matter whether it's the French countryside, the French palace and palace grounds, or the elaborately costumed cast, everything about this film is visually overwhelming and the photography is absolutely first rate. This is a movie I could enjoy by turning the sound off and just watching the visuals. It's that good.<br /><br />Then there's the music of the soundtrack. Well, in general it's rather good. There's some excellent classical music and there's a lot of what I might term "French party music" which is also quite good. Either fit the story of the movie quite well. Interspersed with this fine music are a handful of rock 'n' roll selections. Now, don't get me wrong here. Rock 'n' roll includes some of my favorite music and the selections which they chose were quite good. Evidently, someone had good taste. But, this is a 1770 French period piece and everything is done in that fashion, and done quite well. Why include 1980 American rock 'n' roll songs in the soundtrack, good though they might be? It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't help the movie, it disrupts it. Totally incongruent!<br /><br />Then there's the acting. It's stiff and formal. I just never could get into it. None of the people seemed at all real, except, perhaps, Kirsten Dunst in her role as Marie and that was marginal. Her husband was a stiff and wooden figure that I could never develop any empathy for, and that goes for the overwhelming rest of the cast. What goes here? How can they have such a wonderfully costumed cast and then acting that practically no one could relate to? Then there's another problem. Marie was evidently a widely-despised queen. Well, it didn't show at all. She was by far the most likable person in the cast. Then, and it was fortunately not shown in the movie, she was beheaded shortly after the time of the movie. It just doesn't fit her role in the movie. If she's so despicable, why set her up as the most likable person in the movie? It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />In any case, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, both good and bad. It's just a splendid spectacle but could have used a lot of work in the writing and directing, in my opinion. I'd rate the visuals as five stars, no question. But the story, acting and sound track might rate no better than a three. Okay, I'll list it as four stars, but I'd consider it to be a badly flawed movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>This has got to be one of the most asymmetrical period films I've ever seen ~ and I don't mean that in a good way.  Kirsten Dunst is a natural as the title role of Marie Antoinette, but beyond that the movie falters badly.  Even with all of the lavish sets & costumes, it simply doesn't resonate as a well done period film.  {If you're looking for a fabulous period film, albeit from a few hundred years earlier, then check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RJWTC">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>}<br /><br />The focus of the film is to depict a young Austrian girl who is shipped far away from home to a country full of rude people whom she's never met before.  She marries Louis XVI, but she hardly gets the  Harlequin Romance happy ending.  She becomes homesick & finds that her royal husband has little interest in her.  This leads to her becoming a spoiled, free-spending, fun-loving party girl who uses her status to get whatever she wants.<br /><br />The anachronistic soundtrack does not fit at all & I found it very distracting.  Hearing Rock songs juxtaposed with late 1700s France is not an auspicious combination ~ at least not to me.  On top of that, there are problems with the sound mixing as there were times that I couldn't hear the dialogue clearly because the music was too loud.<br /><br />The most egregious part of the movie is what it omits.  Yes, Bastille day goes on in the background of the movie and there are references to it (kind of like in a Shakespearian play) but it is not treated with a whole lot of depth.  The end of the movie shows the French king & queen riding in a chariot away from their palace and an angry mob.  Not to sound crude, but the arrest, imprisonment, (sham) trial and execution of Marie Antoinette are among the most interesting aspects of her life.  The "feel good" ending just doesn't fit.<br /><br />All in all, this production struck me as a cross between a 1980s brat pack movie & a high school play.  Very amateurish and disappointing overall.  Fans of history (and the French Revolution in particular) will not come away from watching this film with a good taste in their mouths.  As for fans of Kirsten....she makes the movie tolerable....albeit barely!</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I still vividly recall the abundant trailers and promos that accompanied Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" upon its theatrical release. From the gorgeous visuals, the eye popping color palette, and the anachronistic rock soundtrack--it seemed, to me, that "Marie" could be an adventurous and bold success or a complete disaster. And, in truth, as I survey the hundreds of previously submitted reviews--it does appear that people fall on one side of this spectrum or the other. So is Coppola's film a daring masterpiece or pretentious drivel? I can see a rational explanation for both points of view. However, in my case, I'll say that "Marie Antoinette" first exceeded my expectations and then let me down. holla<br /><br />I will preface my next remarks by saying that, in no way, did I go into "Marie Antoinette" anticipating a traditional historical biography. Anyone entering the film expecting great insight into Antoinette's real life or even French history is likely to be disappointed. But, seen as a bit of fiction, there are simple pleasures to be had from the film.<br /><br />The film is not nearly as radical as one might suspect. The lovely first hour tells the relatively straightforward story of Marie (Kirsten Dunst) as she leaves her home, moves to France, and takes her place as the future Queen. Seen through Marie's inexperienced eyes, the court is a place of wondrous beauty and baffling protocol. Trying to connect with her new husband Louis and maintain the spirit of her youth, Marie is an oddity that people come to accept and admire. I really enjoyed this first hour of "Marie Antoinette." Aside from the gorgeous sets and costumes, there is much charm and humor in the small details of the film's setup. However, just as I was completely captivated, the film lost all momentum. When Marie has a child, the narrative just seems to stop for a while--idling in the countryside that Marie so enjoys. And, then, as things turn more serious, the film lost me entirely. Every real issue is presented in only the vaguest of terms. Here is where a bit of valid historical context would have aided the movie tremendously. As the couple fall out of favor, I know there are dozens of significant reasons--but the film isn't at all concerned about the facts of the matter. And if the film doesn't care, why should I?<br /><br />Dunst does a nice job with Antoinette, especially in the more innocent times at court. Jason Schwartzman seems an unlikely match as husband Louis. He begins as a bit of a cartoon but has a compelling sweetness that won me over--although the "real" Louis remains a complete enigma to me. Rip Torn and Judy Davis class up the film to great affect. While both offer moments of sheer delight, I wished they were utilized even further. So while the performances are nice, the technical merits noteworthy, and the visual pleasures abundant--the screenplay ultimately loses the battle of style over substance. It's unfortunate, though, the potential for greatness was here--but, for me, "Marie Antoinette" ends up missing the mark. KGHarris, 11/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie might be visually pleasing, but story-wise, it is very lacking, and historically inaccurate in some parts. One thing that really bothered me was how they don't explain why Louis and Marie did not consummate their relationship at first, so the movie just made it seem as if he was disinterested at first and then bam, one night he gets horny, so if you don't know the real story (there are several versions. One is that Louis was just very shy, since the marriage was arranged. A second is that he was afraid that his bride might attempt to manipulate him, since courtly intrigues were the norm at the French court. Another was that Louis had a medical condition that made having an erection painful, it is not until after a operation that he was able to finally consummate/enjoy sex) you wonder what is going on.<br /><br />The movie is just fluff, and in real life, in the 1780's, Marie Antoinette gained weight due to having children and indulging in treats, yet this is not shown in the movie so even at the end of the movie she is still slim and pretty. It may be nice to look at, but if you're a history enthusiast, it is painful to watch, and even if you're not, the story has little substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>Marie Antoinette is perhaps one of the most famous women who ever lived.  Exactly how did this woman of privilage go down in history as being one of the most reviled and hated?  This movie gives some insight on a few slightly off center methods.<br /><br />Born into the royal family of Austria, Marie Antoinette was sent to marry the crown prince of France, the doomed Louis XVI, in a strictly political rather than a love situation.  The costuming and sets are beautiful if not completely decadent, but how could anything not be in the palace of Versailles?  Unsure of herself, plus not knowing what to do with a husband who is more interested in his hobby of key making rather than her, Marie creates a core group of friends and has fun.  She parties and has a great time.<br /><br />The music was panned in this, as it truly did not fit at all.  Post punk rock music for 18th centure France?  Doesn't work.  That's what turned me off, the blatant marketing tactic, even casting Maryanne Faithfull as the Queen of Austria in a bit part.<br /><br />Eventually, Marie finds herself under pressure to produce and heir when her in-laws start having babies and the court starts gossiping.  She does produce the much needed for heir, thinking that this will be the end of her official duties.  The rest of the movie only hints at what will be their fate.  Marie and the others at court, as it seemed, really had no idea of what was going on outside the palace doors nor across the ocean.  Instead, Louis XVI would make some bad decissions, but she would stand by him.  Perhaps not as a wife or supporting him in his political decissions, but because she was truly ignorant.<br /><br />The movie ends at a very curious point.  Those who know their history know what their fate would be, but the movie chose to end at a point where if one didn't know anything about history you would be guesssing.  Marie and Louis flee the palace, going off as the mobs were closing in on them.  They were saying good-bye to their lives as royalty, and looking to an uncertain future.  THE END.  I would have liked to have seen just a little bit more.  This ending and the soundtrack left me lukewarm about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>Sofia Coppola has created quite an interesting film about Marie Antoinette.  She has mixed a story based on the life of this fascinating historical figure with modern rock music and that seems to make parallels with Marie Antoiniette's life with that of modern-day celebrities.  After all, she was quite frivolous at some point -- spending astronomical amounts of money on jewelry and clothes, having lavish parties and being the focus of vicious gossip (like the whole, "Let them eat cake!" misquote).  When put into that context, I suppose Marie Antoinette's life was not all that different from a famous person from the 21st century.  This film does paint a more sympathetic look into the young queen's life with her struggles with giving King Louis XVI's an heir.  This film implies that he had been the one to blame, for he had no sexual appetite, but it was never proven whose fault it was, or if indeed there was someone to blame.  Historically, it does address some of the things the queen went through -- like having to relinquish her Austrian roots, getting dressed every morning by her ladies-in-waiting, the king's insatiable appetite for food, and many of the things that led to the French Revolution.  However, this film felt extremely rushed at the end and I didn't like the fact that there was nothing shown about her tragic demise when she was beheaded for supposedly committing treason. That is not to say that the film isn't great.  Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job with the title role.  She brought in Marie's innocent and frivolous side as well as the more human, vulnerable side.  I was impressed with her delivery.  The film is also a feast for the eyes.  I loved the period costumes and the scenery.  I love everything about the 18th century except for the men's powdered wigs.  Marie Antoinette is an artful film that takes some rather risky artistic license that manage to work well with the overall tone.  However, I would have liked to see more of her during the last stages of her life.  I know this isn't a biopic in the classic sense, but I nevertheless would have liked to see how this interesting woman's story translated into film.  The DVD is okay.  I'd say rent it before you decide to buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Director Sofia Coppola's follow-up to her excellent "Lost in Translation" is a jaw-dropping disaster. "Marie Antoinette" has everything money can buy - except focus and pacing. Coppola doesn't know whether she's making a detailed historical drama or a postmodern satire for the MTV generation. The 123-minute running time should have been slashed in half. Kirsten Dunst does her best under trying circumstances, while a miscast Jason Schwartzman does his worst. Beautiful cinematography and an eclectic soundtrack are utterly wasted. I want my two hours back or the producers can send me a free round-trip ticket to Versailles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>I have to admit I came to Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" with a touch of bias. I absolutely loved her previous film "Lost in Translation" (it has now become an absolute favorite) and my curiosity was peaked by the high energy trailers for the new film, that anachronistically mixed 18th century images with a '80s punk/pop soundtrack.<br /><br />Well, I wasn't disapointed. Once again Coppola has produced a wonderful film, that just takes your breath away with both it's beautiful 'in your face' cinematic visual imagery and an emotional character study of a young French Queen, who is primarily remembered by history for her materialistic extravagance and unfortunate end.<br /><br />Coppola's film (based on Antonia Frasier's biography "Marie Antoinette: The Journey") takes an impressionistic viewpoint of the young Queen. Marie (Kristin Dunst) is a beautiful, fifteen year old Hungarian princess, brought to the Court of Versailles to marry the equally young, Louis XVI. Her family wants the marriage to secure a Franco-Austrian alliance, while the French want her for one reason only...to produce an heir for the throne. Until she does this, her title and place within the socially/politically vicious French court is on unsound footing.<br /><br />The film follows Marie's emotional metamorphisis from a shy, lonely teenager to an extravagant young woman, who loves both high fashion and partying. She becomes the 'A' list celebrity of her day. Finally we see Marie become more reflective as a caring wife and mother. But by the time she finds maturity and some emotional closure in her life, the angry mobs of (unseen) peasants are at the palace gates.<br /><br />Once again Sofia Coppola produces a stunning film. Not unlike "Lost in Translation", she transports us to what seems like the caccoon of another world, where we follow the life of a lonely young woman. Everything about this film is brilliant. Kristin Dunst gives a great performance and really is the movie's emotional core. The supporting cast, which includes Jason Shwartzman, Rip Torn, Judy Davis and Molly Shannon are quite good as well. I'm also impressed by the beautiful cinematography, art direction, costumes and locations.(Where are the multiple 'Academy Award' nominations?) All these aspects readily contribute to recreating the extravagance of the French Court. It's a visual feast for the eyes!<br /><br />Finally, I want to mention the vivacious, high energy soundtrack made up of mostly punk/pop songs of the eighties. Some critics have been negative about using this type of music for the film. But I really think it contributes to the portrayle of the boisterous spirit and wild lifestyles of the characters. If Marie Antoinette were alive today, she just might be listening to "Bow Wow Wow", while she drank champagne at some debauched party! (Sofia you can make a 'mix tape' for me any day!)<br /><br /> A great movie! Highly recommended! Can't wait for the next film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Booed at its Cannes premiere this year (as Anthony Lane in the "New Yorker" states: "Who was in the audience, Robespierre?"), "Marie Antoinette" is that rare bird: a film that is beautiful on the outside (everything about the physical movie is eye-poppingly gorgeous: Costumes, Food, Pastries, Shoes {yes shoes...in fact I can't remember a film in recent memory of which almost every reviewer credits the shoes to the designer: in this case, Manolo Blahnik}) as it is on the inside: studiously, exhaustively researched, thoughtfully written and impeccably directed by Sofia Coppola who gives us a revisionist portrait of M. Antoinette that is humane, heartfelt and above all measured and compassionate. There is no doubt who is in charge of this huge production and Coppola's obvious tender touch is evident everywhere throughout this film.<br />This "Marie Antoinette" is told from a Marie as a girl perspective: she is very young, she is giddy, very much impatient of the French Court and it's customs, very much into clothes and shoes yet she matures, has children, takes a lover grows wise, becomes the subject of gossip, learns to love Louis and becomes a loving and doting mother. This is a fully fleshed out role of a victim, really: a victim of politics, of circumstances beyond her control.<br />At the center of this film is the tragic, sad and revelatory Marie of Kirsten Dunst. Dunst's Marie is the outsider, reviled by the French court (called "L'Autrichienne" by most...the Austrian *itch), lost and 14 when she first arrives in France, literally stripped of everything Austrian, Dunst navigates this difficult role with ease. But this is not a surface performance...not at all. Dunst digs deep and reveals all the nuances, all the insecurities, all the strengths of one of the most hated women in all of history. Dunst plays Marie from her gut and she leaves her blood as well as her tears on the celluloid. Do not be swayed or fooled by the naysayers: this is a towering performance of the first order.<br />Coppola is getting a lot of bad press or her use of 80's music on the soundtrack (Bow Wow Wow, Gang of 4, The Cure) but she has so far in her two previous films ("The Virgin Suicides" and "Lost in Translation") proven to be nothing if not a populist, a product of her environment, a lover of popular culture. In "M.A." the music serves the story effectively by blasting away and preventing any cobwebs from growing on what could have been a stodgy Historical drama.<br />Though Coppola will not be beheaded for making this wonderful film, it is apparent that most people just don't get "it."  With all that said the fact remains: "Marie Antoinette" contains one of the most beautiful images ever committed to film: Marie in a carriage, having been forced out of Versailles, deep sadness in her face, clutching her children and holding Louis's hand, the camera pointed out at the grounds of Versailles, she poignantly says "Goodbye" to the only place she can claim as home...as the carriage takes her family to Oblivion.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I enjoyed "Marie Antoinette" a lot more than I thought I would. The film begins with Marie (Kirsten Dunst), the Austrian Archduchess, setting off to France to marry Louis-Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). Unfortunately, Marie's new husband has little interest in her or in the act of consummating their marriage, so the future queen finds herself in limbo for quite some time, as it is uncertain whether she will produce an heir to the throne and thus survive at court. Eventually Louis-Auguste comes around, and Marie gives birth to a daughter, and later a son. In the meantime, Marie becomes known as the Queen of Excesses, spending copious amounts of money on clothing and jewels instead of bothering to become acquainted with the issues of relevance to the French people. Marie enjoys parties, sweets, and even an illicit affair, but the fun comes crashing down when the monarchy falls out of favor with the citizens of France, who angrily storm the castle in an attempt on Marie's life. Eventually the royal family is forced to flee their home and go into hiding.<br /><br />Obviously, the best thing about this movie is the way it looks on screen. Watching "Marie Antoinette" is like stepping into a high-end bakery and admiring a bunch of scrumptious, frilly wedding cakes. Everything about the film is absolutely beautiful: the costumes, the shoes, the palaces, the desserts. However, the dialogue in the first half of the movie is very choppy and sparse, so the only thing for the audience to do is admire all the visual beauty. After a while the script does manage to turn itself around, and I think the second half of the movie is much better in terms of storyline and character development. "Marie Antoinette" has a fabulous soundtrack that consists of mostly punk music, which is a lot of fun. Also, the cast is excellent. I was impressed with all the performances, especially Dunst's. She portrays Marie as a naive, frivolous, but not entirely unsympathetic person. I thought she did a really good job.<br /><br />I was surprised that the film ended so abruptly and did not take us to the end of Marie's life. I think the story could have wrapped up a lot better than it did. All in all, though, "Marie Antoinette" isn't great, but it's very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Perhaps unfairly, the name Marie Antoinette has become virtually synonymous with the upper class' indifference to the sufferings of the poor.  Even all these centuries later, many people still believe that the much-maligned French queen actually uttered the words, "Let them eat cake," when confronted with the news that her subjects were starving (the phrase actually comes from a play popular at the time).  Writer/director Sofia Coppola's new film, "Marie Antoinette," based on the book "Marie Antoinette: The Journey" by Antonia Fraser, seems determined to clear her name and change that perception.<br /><br />In this film, Marie Antoinette is seen as a sheltered, somewhat frivolous young girl unprepared for the role history was about to thrust upon her.  The movie begins at the moment when the Archduchess of Austria, aged 14, has been promised in wedlock to France's Prince Louis XVI as part of a treaty between the two countries.  She is quickly whisked away to her new nation and new role, becoming a virtual prisoner to the proscribed rites and regulations of court life at Versailles in the late 18th Century.<br /><br />In a wise move artistically (if not commercially), Coppola has seen fit to bleed the film of most of its potential hyperbole and melodrama, choosing instead to concentrate on the gossipy pettiness and mind-numbing rituals of royal life at that time.  We see Marie completely stripped of any sense of personal privacy, as she endures the indignities of a virtual cast of thousands having a hand in her dressing herself in the morning and being constantly under the watchful eye of moral advisers on the lookout for any breach of etiquette or protocol deemed unbecoming of a queen.  Coppola immerses us in all the finery and opulence of the glittery setting, while the drama ever so subtly plays itself out.  Even though Marie clearly resents the restricted life she is forced to endure, she rarely whines or wallows in self-pity, choosing instead to accept her role with an uncomplaining, almost fatalistic, good grace.  Even when her husband refuses for years to consummate their marriage, she remains generally sympathetic to him and understanding of his "problem."<br /><br />There are those who will find this movie slow-moving, stultifying, and boring because it doesn't go over-the-top by focusing on major moments of crisis or by overplaying the queen's famed cruelty or self-indulgence.  She is, instead, seen as a woman neither actively engaged in the outside world nor entirely dismissive of it.  Some have objected to the fact that the filmmakers have stacked the deck in her favor by showing us so little of what life was like for the suffering populace of the nation.  But it is just that insularity that helps us to see how a woman with such an apparently good heart could have been so badly misunderstood by those in her own time and by generations that followed.  At the end, when she and her family are being carted off to certain doom by a mob thirsting for rectification and vengeance, she seems genuinely bewildered, yet also strangely heroic in her stoicism and grace.  Much of this is due to the tour de force performance by Kirsten Dunst, who never overstates the obvious but allows us to see the complex woman trapped beneath all the jewel-encrusted trappings of pampered French royalty.  Marie may not display an interest in world affairs or the arcane machinations involved in running a nation, but she is shrewd enough to know how to maneuver her way through the often absurdly arbitrary power politics of court life.<br /><br />The movie has garnered perhaps its greatest notoriety for employing an anachronistic rock music soundtrack (a la "A Knight's Tale").  For me, this worked fairly well (though I don't think it is indispensable to the film by any stretch), mainly because it brings a more contemporary sensibility to a film that might otherwise feel weighted down by period piece stuffiness.  History-obsessed purists may object to the choice, but even they may find compensation in the relatively understated and historically accurate approach the screenplay has taken towards her life as a whole.<br /><br />"Marie Antoinette" is, more than anything else, a study of repression, of what happens when human beings are locked into figurative gilded cages and then are expected to go about their daily lives as if anything really mattered.  Seen in that light, this is a very sad, very poignant - though often quite funny - movie indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Marie Antoinette  DVD<br /><br />This movie is about the life of the teenage Austrian girl who married King Louis XVI of France.  I had read about her saying "Let them eat cake" for years, when she asked why the peasants were rioting during the French Revolution and was told that they had no bread to eat.  What I didn't really realized until watching this movie was how sheltered and out of touch she was.  She was only 14 when she was packed off to marry Louis, who she had never seen before, was stripped and inspected for blemishes when she reached the hand off point( how embarrassing) and had something like forty people sitting around her bed watching on her wedding night.  "Nothing happened, apparently."  Well duh?<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst gives an excellent performance as the teenage queen, in this movie which starts off set in Austria in 1768.  She spoke German, by the way, not French.<br /><br />Highly recommended for students of History who want a better insight of this period of European history.

When a filmmaker creates a successful film, they earn a certain amount of cache. Imagine they receive a credit card. If the film is both financially and critically successful, they earn a higher credit balance. They can then use this credit card for their next film. The amount of credit they spend on their next project would depend on the esoteric quality of the film. Then, based on the success of that film, their credit card either has a revolving balance or a fixed spending limit.<br /><br />Sofia Coppola had a big success on her hands with "Lost in Translation", her first film. It almost earned Bill Murray an Oscar, made a star of Scarlett Johannson and earned a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Coppola. Then, she decided to make "Maria Antoinette". I suspect her credit balance is very low.<br /><br />On paper, "Marie Antoinette" sounds like an intriguing project. An American director shooting a film about an Icon of French History, in Versailles, with a rising American actress and a largely American and British cast. Throw in some modern music and great costumes and you have the concept behind Coppola's newest film.<br /><br />On the screen, "Marie" lacks substance. There is a ton of great production design, but that is like frosting on a cake. It looks good, and tastes good, but it doesn't provide a lot of substance.<br /><br />At 14, Marie (Kirsten Dunst), an Austrian princess, is sent to France to marry the Dauphin (Jason Schwartzman). Initially, she is very confused and feels isolated, but her mother pleads with her to make the best of the situation, for her home country. The King (Rip Torn) takes a liking to the young lady, but there is trouble in the marriage bed. The Dauphin is very scared of his new wife and it takes seven years for them to consummate the marriage. During this time, the gossip in the court of Versailles is rampant. Why can't she produce an heir to the throne? Is she barren? Would she prefer some strudel? Finally, a daughter is born and then, soon, a son and an heir to the throne. Then, the King dies and the Dauphin becomes King Louis XVI. And Marie, the new Queen of France, goes on a spending spree, cavorting with her friends, buying new clothes and shoes with every turn. As the French people fight for every scrap of food, the Queen's excess comes to notice and they start to protest.  There are moments in "Marie Antoinette" that reminded me of some of the films of the 70s. There are long sequences meant to establish a mood, rather than to depict a specific part of history. During these sequences, we see Marie running through fields with her daughter, brushing her cheek, reveling in motherhood at long last. Or she lays in a rowboat with other friends, on a lazy, sunny afternoon. Or she runs excitedly through the hallways of Versailles.<br /><br />This style of filmmaking is interesting and uncommon in this day and age, but it takes some getting used to. You either have to be able to figure out what the director is trying to accomplish or let your imagination run wild.<br /><br />The other problem is that these same sequences often resemble Nivea, perfume or female medication ads. The sun sparkling in Dunst's hair as she runs through fields of wildflowers. Marie Antoinette just has to take one pill for a problem free month.<br /><br />And because there are multiple scenes like this, it makes the film seem long and without substance.<br /><br />There are better scenes depicting the excess of life in the Court of Versailles, the gossiping among the ruling class and more, but these don't fill the story.<br /><br />The performances are interesting. Dunst does a good job of conveying Marie Antoinette's confusion, then boredom, then sexual attraction. But we don't really get a look inside her head. Maybe that's the point. Because she lived in such excess, and the court lived in such seclusion, maybe that is all we are supposed to see. We see her eat a lot of expensive food, try on a lot of shoes, the like. She mentions a couple of times that she would like to go to Paris, to the Opera, but the family lives at Versailles and rarely ventures outside.<br /><br />This is also a key point in the history of France. Because the ruling family is so isolated, it is difficult for them to understand the difficulties of their people. We get it.<br /><br />And from the way the film portrays her, Marie Antoinette didn't seem to care very much. But we never see what the people are doing, what their struggle is like. A couple of advisors make some vague statements, but this is the extent of the influence from the outside world.<br /><br />The other interesting addition is the use of modern day music. This has been done before, in "A Knight's Tale" and "Moulin Rouge", to name two memorable examples. In "A Knight's Tale", the music was more pervasive but never really worked, except for the use of Queen's "We Will Rock You". In "Moulin Rouge", director Baz Luhrmann fully integrated modern day music into his tale of a doomed relationship set in Paris during the early 1900s. Coppola doesn't use enough music to make it part of the fabric of the film. Because she uses so little music, it stands out all the more, making it seem odd and out of place. For this reason, her effort is more similar to the dreadful "A Knight's Tale" than the sublime "Moulin Rouge".<br /><br />It seems like if we are going to watch a film depicting Marie Antoinette's life, we need to learn something about her, see her in a different light, or learn about the other influences on her life. Because she and the rest of her family live in such isolation, it is difficult for us to see beyond that as well.<br /><br />And because we are looking for something more, and the film doesn't deliver this, our sugar high is quite brief indeed.<br /><br />I just wish I had been allowed to eat more cake.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Director Sofia Coppola certainly takes an audacious look at the life of the legendary 18th century Queen of France who supposedly "let them eat cake" in this elaborately costumed 2006 film. At the same time, Coppola keeps the dramatic focus relatively small versus the expansive political backdrop of the story. The approach works to a point since the filmmaker has an obviously reflective handle on how a young girl can feel when thrown unexpectedly into the spotlight and then made mincemeat by her critics (think of her aborted acting career when 1990's "The Godfather III" was released).<br /><br />The downside is that the dramatic arc of the French monarch's life feels somewhat misshapen by this unique perspective since the film's first three-quarters meticulously follows Marie's youthful ascent to the throne and her wearying efforts to consummate her arranged marriage to Louis XVI. There are throwaway scenes of shopping sprees with her ladies-in-waiting and an underdeveloped illicit romance with Count Fersen, all of which would not look out of place in an episode of "Sex and the City". Once she conceives and delivers her first child, the movie starts to feel cursory about subsequent events with little of the historic context needed to make the climax resonate.<br /><br />For all the film's dramatic flaws, I have to say Kirsten Dunst is ideally cast in the title role. Starting her role as a 14-year old Austrian princess taken from her family, she captures not only the giggly vacuity but the sense of self-possession and decorum that makes her viable as a queen. A curiously cast Jason Schwartzman gained weight for the role of her bulbous, emotionally indifferent husband, Louis. He says relatively little but his natural awkwardness in period costume succeeds in making the king an ultimately sympathetic figure. Others come in and out of the story though with little resonance, even with proven scenery chewers like Judy Davis as the instructional Contesse de Noailles, Steve Coogan as the advice-giving Ambassador Mercy, Rip Torn as the libidinous Louis XV, and Asia Argento as his blatantly whorish mistress, Madame du Barry.<br /><br />What does work well are most of the visual elements - the use of real Versailles locales augmented by K.K. Barrett's luxuriant production design, Lance Acord's candy-colored cinematography, and Milena Canonero's resplendent costumes. The anachronistic use of 1980's-era new wave music, blended with the Baroque music true to the period and Jean-Beno?t Dunckel and Nicolas Godin's original score, turns out to be a daring choice that works well toward Coppola's revisionist view of the queen. Yet for all the creativity on display, one is left to linger on the movie's unfulfilled possibilities of how the economic downturn and class disparities in 18th century France could be seen as a mirror for today. But that aspect obviously doesn't interest Coppola, who shows as she did in "Lost in Translation", a deep affinity for women caught out of place and the ways they handle their loneliness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>I loved the costuming, make-up, set design, & cinematography as a whole as it was all very well done throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting was so-so.... The rock music sucked entirely as it didn't go at all with this period piece.<br /><br />The storyline was understated throughout this movie only touching lightly on various important themes/topics involving Marie Antoinette and her life, while vaguely touching upon her role and placement in France as Queen.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie the high marks, is due to the positive features I mentioned at the start of this review.

What follows is high pressure protocol and frustration over a husband who is reluctant to bed her and produce a child. Marie begins to live the life of a 'Paris Hilton' and angers the subjects of France during a difficult financial period for the country. Whether Marie actually said 'let them eat cake' is still being debated, but I liked the way the movie was written and the performance by Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>As the movie opens, a marriage has been arranged for 14-year old Maria Antonia (Kirsten Dunst) of Austria and Louis, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  She is immediately packed off to the court of Versailles where she is the object of suspicion as a foreigner, and her husband is unable or unwilling to consummate their marriage.  Plucky Marie Antoinette manages to quickly adjust to her lavish and pampered lifestyle by indulging in power-shopping and taking a lover.  At the age of 19, she is Queen of France, a mother, and totally unaware of the desperate conditions of the poor in Paris.<br /><br />From the first punk rock tune during the opening credits, I knew this was not going to be a typical historical drama.  Indeed, the soundtrack mixes rock songs with a few classical pieces, creating a quirky, surreal atmosphere.  If you liked the odd mix of a period story with modern music in the movie "Moulin Rouge," you'll like this one.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to feel immersed in court life, where all the nobility had to do all day was dress in stunningly gorgeous outfits, gossip about everyone, and see and be seen.  The costumes are incredibly opulent and much of the filming was done in and around Versailles, so this is a visual feast, to say the least.  I did find it annoying that no mention is ever made of dates and the passage of time (19 years) is vague since the actors don't seem to age.  Dunst is horribly miscast as Marie Antoinette.  She looks and sounds like a mid-west Girl Scout, using words like, "yeah" and "gonna," and generally looking silly amid the sophisticated surroundings.  I give it five stars for the photography and one star for Dunst and the soundtrack, for a score of 3 ***.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Imagine a movie about JFK that ignores the Cuban Missile Crisis, his assassination, every important speech he ever made and every decisive action he ever took, and instead focuses on backyard football games, quickie affairs and all the pills he chewed for his ailing back.<br /><br />That's writer-director Sofia Coppola's take on the famously executed French queen  in "Marie Antoinette." Daring and defiant, it's gorgeous and entirely superficial. It'll bore and offend casual filmgoers as a monotonous, two-hour rock video void of spiritual and historical integrity.<br /><br />But it's deliberately repetitive. It's deliberately vapid. Does that make it more essential art?<br /><br />Some critics have argued just that, as Coppola's aim is to dissect the modern consumptive culture through the eyes of a queen who ruled France before she was 18, spent lavishly at her Versailles palace, and became the best-known victim of the French Revolution. She's a girl who wanted to have fun. Off with her head for it!<br /><br />This Marie, played friskily by Kirsten Dunst, is more or less a clothes and jewelry hound who knows nothing of that impending doom. She's a party kid with a teenage husband who won`t touch her in bed. She's trapped in a royal court until she breaks away and strips off the corset for a certain Swedish count at her hideaway bungalow in the country.<br /><br />Is that the real Marie? I don't think so, and neither did many of the French who lustily booed the movie at Cannes upon its premiere. Coppola is aiming for a "Portrait of a Pop Culture Artist as a Young Queen." What she produces is a lot closer to "My Super Sweet Sixteen at Versailles."<br /><br />Coppola shoots montages of shoes, and cakes and fantastic wigs to the song "I Want Candy." She crafts a purposely unsophisticated screenplay that renders Marie California articulate. Her husband, king Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) barely speaks at all. The drama is never underlined, peripheral characters emerge and disappear, and key events are MIA.<br /><br />Is it crucial to depict the fallen queen's beheading? No. But The Affair of the Necklace, as it was called, represented a crucial shift in Marie's popularity with her people. It goes unmentioned. And the tragic part of Marie's story - her imprisonment after the fall of Versailles - is entirely absent.<br /><br />In its place? Parties, drinking, sex, shopping, wide shots of the Versailles grounds, a segment in the country where Marie writhes around in the grass, more parties, drinking and gambling.<br /><br />Director of photography Lance Acord, does a terrific job creating lush, moody visuals. And Dunst does her best to act the icon her director wishes her to be.<br /><br />It's Coppola, coming off the terrific "Lost In Translation," who's not up to it. Where is her ambition? "Marie Antoinette" unfolds as if she's afraid to take the woman head on in the epic her life deserves.  Instead of grandeur and scope, Coppola bangs around the halls of Versailles, puts on a shiny dress and calls it cute.<br /><br />It smacks of fear. A modern art critic might argue "Marie Antoinette" is subverting the rules or channeling a fresh perspective. But historical rules and perspective are occasionally useful because they generally point toward the truth. This movie points to "Laguna Beach."</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Sophia Coppola's third film `Marie Antoinette' just may be her finest cinematic accomplishment.  It's enriched with life, character and charm and it still manages to layer itself with the subtle illusion of grief and misery that surrounded this tragic story.  Sophia, along with a brilliant cast, was able to take a story plucked fresh from the history books and make it relatable and entertaining, refreshing amidst the modern era of the biopic.  Coppola's film here mainly focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and through Kirsten Dunst's brilliant performance the audience is brought to the soul of this woman and the soul of her conflict.  She as young, she was na?ve but most of all she was lost in a world far above her head, one trust upon her, one that embraced her and then turned on her when they needed a scapegoat.<br /><br />Dunst is riveting in the title role, and the film is really a showcase for her talent.  The film starts off with Marie just a young teenager who is promised in marriage to Louis-Auguste, played by Jason Schwartzman, in order to unite the countries of France and Austria, and it carries on till just shy of her execution.  Dunst is magically able to manipulate her character so effortlessly that the audience is baffled at Marie's subtle and gradual growth as a young Queen.  Schwartzman does a wonderful job playing the young husband, a man too young for the responsibility on his shoulders and too uninterested for the wife he's been given despite her beauty and magnetism.  One could say he's overwhelmed, maybe even a bit frightened.<br /><br />Sophia Coppola brilliantly scripted this masterpiece; everything from the dialog to the musical soundtrack is inventive, effective and refreshing.  The script is especially noteworthy, giving the royal courts a modern twist that resembles the tabloid covers that litter the concession stands each week.  Having long sequences of murmured gossip, whispered rumors and lust centered jealousy help make for a memorable and relatable experience.  The costume designs and set pieces are magical and add so many lavish layers to the already layered biopic.  The scenes blossoming forth with colorful fabrics, high fashion inspired shoes and pastries add visual depth to the reality that this Queen was just like every other young girl and helps make her more real to us.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette's devotion to her newfound country is stifled by her husband's refusal to consummate their marriage and her dire frustration in her inability to provide an heir that would unite her birthland with her homeland transcends right to the audience.  Marie Antoinette was a tragically misunderstood woman who did all that she could in a situation she had no control over.<br /><br />The supporting cast does a fine job as well, Judy Davis and Rip Torn sinking their teeth into their small roles, and Asia Argento is fantastically catty as the Kings mistress, but it's Rose Byrne that really stands out to me.  Her brazen obnoxious almost impish sexuality writhes off the screen and into the seat next to you and makes a very long lasting impression.  Danny Huston and Marianne Faithfull are brilliant if not sorely underused, but like I've stated, this movie is all about Marie Antoinette and its focus from her never wavers.  She's in just about every frame and as we watch her move from na?ve young girl to loving mother and wife to confused, hated and betrayed Queen we are moved for her, to her and with her in this brilliantly paced and expertly crafted masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>no where near as bad as the critical reception led me to believe it to be, i **almost** gave this movie a third star, but theres just too much wrong with it and not enough right with it to justify that.  i actually rather enjoyed the first hour, but the last five hours just went on and on and on and on ...  am i giving you a hint as to why i am not a big fan?  the use of modern music in stead of the to-be-expected period score was a cute metaphor the first time around but it soon grows tired, as does the cloying performance of kirsten dunst in the title role, who seems as unable to grow as an actress as little claudia was in size in that stupid vampire movie.  director sofia coppola showed great promise in "lost in translation" a few years back; whether she fulfills that or just winds up a dilettante only time will tell ...</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>I take umbrage at the notion that I "just don't get it" if I don't think this is a five-star film. That's utter nonsense. I watched it, and I got it - and while some parts of it worked, overall, I found it unsatisfying.<br /><br />The film started with potential. It took great pains to demonstrate what Marie Antoinette was losing in order to forge an alliance with France. When she arrives at the French border, a tent straddles it. She enters the tent on the Austrian side, is forced to give up her dog and all of her clothes (everything Austrian), and she is garbed in French clothes and told that she can have as many French dogs as she likes. She exits on the French side, ready to meet the dauphin. A wonderful "show don't tell" example.<br /><br />I felt that far too much time was spent examining superficial aspects of her life. She spent money, she gambled. She spent too much money. She gambled too much. OK. She's a party girl. I get it. Later in the film, we find that she had three children, and then we are shown that one died in a scene that lasted for twenty seconds: a picture was hung on the wall that showed the Marie with three children; then it was taken down and replaced with a picture of Marie and two children. To some this might seem clever. I thought it was self indulgent. Her affair was glanced over, and her hatred in the hearts of the French people shown in a voiceover that echoed her most infamous quote: Let them eat cake. To a bored observer (I was watching the movie with one such), this is easily missed.<br /><br />The soundtrack, a mix of period music and New Order/Adam and the Ants/Bow Wow Wow seemed as confused as the movie. If something doesn't add anything - i.e., contemporary music to a period drama - then it doesn't belong. My feeling was that the music (all of which I'm a fan of, by the way) detracted from the story being told.<br /><br />So did the unconventional casting decisions. Jason Schwarzman as Louis XVI? Molly Shannon? Rip Torn? I have enjoyed each in other works, but they were as out of place as a mobster at a tea party.<br /><br />What did work were the costumes, the orgiastic parties of champagne and confections, and the portrayal of the queen as a tart. But this is, of course, a superficial examination. This was a skin deep movie that didn't attempt to dig. And Kirsten Dunst, another whose work I enjoy, didn't dig deep here. But that wasn't her fault. She wasn't given a shovel, and one can only do so much with their nails.<br /><br />2? stars rounded up to 3 for costumes and period evocation</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Cultural fashions come and go. Apparently, of late, there has been a resurgence of interest in the life of Marie Antoinette, late of Austria and Queen of France during the period of the great French Revolution that began in 1789. Although you would not know that revolution was in the air from this film since it is very tightly focused on the alleged trials and tribulations of being a teenager, fodder in the dynastic politics of the period and unsuccessfully maturing in the late 1700's. And it is also a quasi-feminist attempt to bring Marie into the `sisterhood' of modern feminism. Someone once said that revolutionary periods create conditions where the old society can no longer rule in the old way (although they sure as hell try) and produce leaders particularly ill-suited to the tasks of the times. That is certainly the case here. Ms. Coppola's attempt to create some retroactive sympathy for the character of not so sweet Marie simply does not work. Although Marie probably did not say "Let them eat cake", she certainly could have.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This movie tells the life of Marie Antoinette after her betrothal to Louis XVI. From shoes to scandals, this movie outlines Marie Antoinette's nature, and her dedication to a life of fabulousness and outrageousness. We hear her utter those immortal words that caused such an outrage amongst the peasants of France, but we soon learn that it was a lie, as was much of her life. The visuals and auditory elements, which evoke a powerful image of 18th-century Versailles, are the movie's forte. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt, the last image shows the royal family heading to Paris to be imprisoned in the building of the Conciergerie. There is no mention of the guillotine anywhere, which again can seem surprising, but which shows that Coppola deliberately tried to eschew stereotypes and do something different. I was wonderfully surprised by this unusual movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>This movie can be described in one word...BORING! Absolutely nothing happens so I can't imagine why it was even 2 hours long. This is one of those movies that is ultimately forgettable. It's the kind of movie that in a year or two you'll remember seeing it, but you won't really be able to remember what happened. I think somebody already beat me at saying it, but it seems like the movie was mostly about Kirsten Dunst eating cake and drinking wine for two hours, but that's only when she wasn't buying shoes, clothes, and hats. Other than that, she was married to a man that wouldn't have sex with her..SO WHAT! I felt so mislead after reading the coverbox to this film in the video store. I couldn't believe they referred to this character as a villianess who lived life on her own terms. A woman who didn't walk the line between royalty and being a commoner. I saw none of that at all, but I did see beautiful cinematography and costumes. Even the intentional use of music (very bad music) that wasn't even apart of that era didn't help this movie out. I turned this movie off and took a nap at least twice before I finished it which is never a good sign. Sophia Coppola is really tring to make her family proud of her by living up to the family name, but she won't be able to do it like this. At least not when she's responsible for movies like this. Don't waste your time like I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>I watched Marie Antoinette for the first time last night, and was it ever a snoozer!

For a while it seemed like a solid period drama, a but slow, a bit flat, but a drama.  Then the diretor seemed to change direction, and the combination of filming and music (e.g., during some of the carriage scenes) reminded me of some rather bad 1960s films, back in the day when film-making was striving to be "artsy" at the expence of watchability (is this a word?  well, whatever), and then there were times when it looked like the director was shooting music video for MTV.  It was hard to keep up.  It all seemed somewhat disjointed.<br /><br />All in all, I have to say that it was "OK."  I doubt that I will ever watch it again, but 3 stars is all I can give it in good conscience.<br /><br />3 stars...too little acting, too little character development, too little consistency in filming and soundtack, so, it was just adequate...3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>Despite my intuition that this was going to be a bad movie, I watched it anyway. My intuitions weren't wrong though. Kirsten Dunst's acting is spotty - varying from good to unbelievable to horrible. This film was pretty bad - the storyline was flimsy, historical facts were adjusted or conveniently eliminated, the ending was anti-climactic, the acting from the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. The only exception is perhaps Joan Cusack, but her performance is so brief and hardly her personal best. The soundtrack was highly inappropriate and actually detracted from whatever goodwill the movie managed to generate with its outstanding sets. Furthermore, the one thing that must be said about this movie is that the costumes were exceptional and rightly Oscar-nominated. In the end this is hardly surprising - it says a lot about the movie when the shoes (Manolo Blaniks) are more likely to be discussed than everything and anything else about the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Perhaps I am setting a high bar for Sofia Coppola, talented actress, writer and director.

While this movie relished in beautiful costumes, interior design and architecture, it totally misses on providing  a more suitable musical score or background on French Revolution and the mob that offed this unfortunate queen.  I do not understand the awe about Kristen Dunst's performance.

This film will do nothing to resolve the debate over the director's talent or lack thereof, since Ms. Coppola has chosen to make a stylized, candied presentation of already controversial characters in a politically complex 18th century context that the French take pretty seriously. Its purpose is partly to rehabilitate Marie Antoinette's image in the eyes of Americans, who tend to regard her as a wastrel with contempt for the common people. Having studied this period of history while in France, I can say that the French view Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as the least  to blame for France's economic crisis and Revolution.<br /><br />In 1768, to cement an alliance between Austria and France, the Empress Maria Theresa betroths her youngest daughter to the French Dauphin. The 14-year-old, trepidatious Archduchess (Kirsten Dunst) marries the shy prince (Jason Schwartzman), only slightly older than herself, and becomes Marie Antoinette, Dauphine of France. In addition to the loss of privacy and oppressive protocols of the French court, the young Dauphine is expected to produce an heir. Yet her husband, though kind and respectful, won't have sex with her. In 1774, King Louis XV dies and his son ascends the throne as Louis XVI, making Marie Antoinette Queen of France. Years of pressure to consummate her marriage finally end with the birth of a daughter. But France has huge debts, bread shortages, and revolutionaries do all they can to paint the King and Queen as villains.<br /><br />"Marie Antoinette" is self-consciously eye candy. It's a baroque visual feast of crisp, vivid pastels. There is little dialogue. Marie Antoinette's life at Versailles is expressed visually through a dynamic camera that seems to float, sumptuous production design, and countless scenes of the Queen and courtiers doing nothing of importance. It's not about matters of state. This is a kind of prolonged vignette illustrating the humiliation, confinement, and extraordinary luxuries that defined Marie Antoinette's lifestyle, and how this effusive, affectionate woman coped with it all, successfully or not. The sets, costumes, and hair styles are stylizations, not intended to be entirely accurate but to convey the kid-in-a-candy-store indulgence with which Marie Antoinette consoled herself in the years before she had children.<br /><br />This all works well until Marie Antoinette becomes a mother at age 23. As she aged, the Queen mostly abandoned her spendthrift ways and tried to sacrifice for France to the extent that a person so isolated could. The film tries awkwardly to express this and ends up being rather muddled. Two of her children died. The tone of Marie Antoinette's life changed. The tone of the film doesn't. The inclusion of her alleged affair with Count Ferson seems incongruous. The result is that the film's second half is unclear and ineffectual. Where a broad emotional portrait of her life at Versailles allows unique insight into Marie Antoinette's youth, her later life cannot be understood without more structured and intricate storytelling.<br /><br />Liberties taken with details and design aside, I expect French viewers will dislike "Marie Antoinette" on the basis of language alone. The French language reached its height in the late 18th century, and the ability to speak cleverly and beautifully was highly prized at Court. But words in this film are simple and sparse. It has been definitely established that dialogue is not Sofia Coppola's forte. But her intention here is to shift focus away from manners and onto emotions, which may be appropriate. I think "Marie Antoinette" succeeds as a fresh, innovative way to understand this ill-fated Queen's emotional life up to a point. But the MTV-inspired style is less suitable as Marie Antoinette ages and she exchanges old pressures for new. 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 2 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 ? min), a theatrical teaser (1 ? min), and 2 featurettes. "The Making of Marie Antoinette" (25 min) features on-set interviews with the cast, behind-the-scenes footage, discussions of the film's themes with Sofia Coppola, and interviews with the film's creative team about production and costume design, colors, lighting, and more. In "Cribs with Louis XVI" (3 ? min) Jason Schwartzman takes us on a tour of his palace at Versailles in the style of MTV's "Cribs". Subtitles are available for the film in English and French.

Very bad indeed--and Coppola convinces us of it, which is an accomplishment. Marie is the youngest daughter of the powerful Austrian Empress, sent off at the age of 15 to France. She's a pretty unspoiled child, who is stripped of everything she knows--her maids, her dog, her clothes--and turned into a gorgeously dressed doll to be presented to the rapacious court as the next queen of France. Dunst does a lovely job, by turns frivolous, reckless, sympathetic and loving. She and Louis XVI are really just a pair of clueles teenagers, deliberately shut off from the world by a court filled with schemers. To Dunst's credit, she portrays Marie as a child who manages to mature into a loving mother and caring wife.<br /><br />At first I too was puzzled by the music, the dialogue, the dreamy progress from scene to scene. But would English with a French accent be any more authentic than English with an American or British accent? I don't think so. Once you get past that, the film is a visual feast, and Coppola won an Oscar for costume design. Many complain that the movie ends when the royal couple leave Versailles, but we know what happens next, don't we?

With her third film Sophia brought us a modern twist on the true life story of the Austrian born Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. Shedding almost a comedic light on this heartbreaking story Sophia was able the deliver a once in a lifetime film, a grand spectacle of entertainment that is bound to be this years `Moulin Rouge', a film to be loved or hated...there's no in between. I, as you can tell, am a lover not a hater.<br /><br />As Marie, Dunst is at her grandest, embodying her character mind body and soul. When we are first introduced to Marie she is fourteen years of age and being given away in marriage to the heir to the French throne, Louis XVI (Schwartzman), in order to establish an allied bond between Austria and France. Dunst gives us the emotions, not of an adult in her situation but of a young girl, intrigued and excited about her current situation as well as confused and alarmed by what she doesn't know. The whole scene where she is to lose everything Austrian, including her beloved dog, says it all. Marie soon learns to adjust to the ways of her new people, the strange customs, the constant back-biting and gossiping, the cake, the parties, the shoes...but the one thing she's unable to grow accustom to is her husbands complete lack of interest in her. Under constant pressure from her new country, as well as her mother, to produce an heir to solidify the union of the two country's Marie is constantly haunted and distressed by her inability to do so.<br /><br />Marie seems to immerse herself in the parties and gambling and trips to Paris in order to forget her state but it eventually causes her to fall out of favor with the country as a whole that in turn blame her for the nation's debt and insist on her execution. As the now Queen of France she became known as the Scapegoat Queen. She was beheaded in order to appease the country who blamed her for their current situation, wherefore the film subtly sheds light on the fact that there where other reasons for the country's current lack of funds.<br /><br />`Marie Antoinette' though focuses on the woman that was Marie Antoinette and not the tragedy that befell her. In fact the film ends before her historical beheading but instead opts to end right as the country turns its back on her. This is symbolized first by their refusal to clap along with her (in the beginning of the film we see that it's not customary to clap after a opera but Marie, who feels they deserve it, convinces the crowd to clap), and then confirmed when they crowd outside her residence with pitchforks and torches chanting for her execution. The film plays out more like a fairy tale, giving us the Paris Hilton of the royal courts, with extravagant hair and of course a lap dog.<br /><br />One downfall or I guess I should say pet peeve was the fact that the cast was so extensive yet so under used. Other than Kirsten Dunst the cast barely spoke and the characters where barely examined or explained. That just further goes to show what the main objective of this film was to do. It's here to let us know the woman, not the situation. Actors like Danny Huston and Asia Argento get brief screen time, and then supporting players like Judy Davis and Jason Schwartzman barely stand out in comparison to Dunst's riveting performance. Jason plays France's new king with such inexperience and dread that you almost feel bad for his character...he comes across like a little boy. The scene where he's being convinced to help the American armies just goes to show his lack of experience and almost lack of interest in his new responsibilities.<br /><br />As a whole I was very impressed with this film. Sophia was able to harness what makes her such a brilliant director and deliver to us a one of a kind biopic that has never been done before and in that sense has never been accomplished to wonderfully. Dunst delivers one of her finest performances to date (Sophia definitely brings out the best in Dunst for her performance in `Virgin Suicides' was a definite Oscar snub) and will hopefully become this years Knightly for her performance was enough parts humor, enough parts drama and ample parts charm to at least get her in the runnings for an Oscar nomination. Love it or hate it, `Marie Antoinette' is a one of a kind film that supports a revolutionary vision and serves us entertainment as sweet as pie...err cake.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Probably I would be one of the minority reports here, but I should be honest. I didn't mind if Marie Antoinette is played by Kirsten Dunst speaking American English because I knew Sofia Coppola's revisionist biography is not a schoolteacher's lesson about history in France. And I liked the mixture of colorful costumes and modern pop music which is unique and imaginative (thanks to the photography of Lance Accord and costume designer Milena Canonero). But to me, Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" turned out unexpectedly boring especially during its second half of it even though it tells a story of a person who lived a very eventful life. Retelling a familiar story is a good thing, but when the new story bores you, that would be a big trouble.<br /><br />I won't repeat the life story of Marie Antoinette. The new film presents her as a more vivacious, playful, or often brave and vulnerable person than is generally supposed. Casting Kirsten Dunst is a success to achieve this goal, and her portrait of the Queen of France shows undercurrent loneliness and emptiness of her life in Versailles. Colorful costumes and pop numbers like Bow Wow Wow's `I Want Candy' perfectly match her image as a young woman living the life of unreality.<br /><br />Sadly, as in her previous `Lost in Translation,' Sofia Coppola fails to create and develop anything original out of the great materials she is given, except good acting from some of the cast and the gorgeous mood of the place. While the film traces the life story of Marie Antoinette and her relationships with Louis XVI, Louis XV and his mistress and her affair with Count Fersen, it never sheds light on the inner side of her enigmatic character which still intrigues us. Here Louis XVI is reduced to a shy and weak youth; Madame Du Barry a disreputable woman, and Count Fersen a hunky aristocrat. All these hackneyed characterizations only help make the persona of Marie Antoinette less credible and more melodramatic.<br /><br />Of course Sofia Coppola has a right to show her own vision, or what she wants us to see, and sorry, but having interested in Marie Antoinette, I expected more. This film is a real eye candy which is good, but if this is only about the gorgeous costume and hairstyle, what's the point of re-telling the story of this famous historical figure now?</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's not perfect, but it's a much better piece of cinema than its critics would have you believe.  In fact, what is created here is a deliciously personal movie about a historical figure - made not as an epic, but as an intimate and `in-the-moment' portrayal of a teenager in over her head.<br />It's the first key to liking this movie - it is a teen-movie.  Not for them but about one.  such, all we are seeing is how Marie Antoinette must have seen her life.  A young teenager put into a political arranged marriage as the Dauphine of France, she has to leave all behind and finds herself in an intolerable situation (an unconsummated marriage - for 7 years!) with no frame of reference.  That's the second key to liking it - it is about her removal from a sense of reality - Versaille is geographically, politically, socially and economically isolated from the reality of France, until the tragic end.  (a tragic end which the movie stops just before, incidentally).<br />This lack of a reality touchstone sends the teenager into spirals of excess - and yet Kirsten Dunst finds new depths in portraying her as indulgent, and yet sincere.  Petulant yet patient and revelling in luxury, yet loyal regardless of cost.  The movie itself has been criticised for having discordant elements - modern (and 80's) music, hand held camera movements, brighter than bright colours - and yet this is highly effective at making this story real, and not a historical document - exactly what Sofia Coppola was trying to achieve.  One scene which exemplifies this, is the masked ball - an occasion which should in most period movies would be starchy and elegant - but here is almost like a night club or a rave with pounding soundtrack - and this is precisely the excitement and impression this occasion would have engendered in a spoilt and privileged teenager.<br />Finally, the other ingredients (an apt turn of phrase since everything looks like candy) that complete the feel of the movie - the set design and the music.  The film was given complete access to Versaille, which makes the location vivid and real - and yet in set design the filmmakers have made these places not a museum, but a real vibrant place home to many.  And of course all the wonderful bright and pastel shades made so that `everything looks like cake' are terrific to watch.  And then the music - apart from the occasional pop song as mentioned before, the music actually evokes various moods - from the lyrical simplicity of rural France, to melancholy similar in tone to the soundtrack of Lost in Translation, through to modern beats - it's a brilliant and imaginative score.<br />Top marks to Coppola - I preferred this even to Lost in Translation.  It certainly won't be to everyones taste and best rented than bought - but it is a uniquely personal movie deserving a viewing so you can make up your own mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>I found Marie Antoinette to be a visual feast for the eyes and I found Kristen Dunst quite dazzling and pretty. Both of those elements found my favors. However, I really failed to understand the purpose of this movie outside of showing off the fantastical visual feast and beauty of Kristen Dunst. This really isn't a bio-pic on Marie Attoinette. It really doesn't captured the flavor of late 18th century France and the story line goes from one relatively meaningless party scene after another. Jason Schwartman who played hapless Louis XVI, proves equally hapless in a thankless role. Sofia Coppola made very interesting choices but they were choices that will be dated in a few years as today's music in the movie become yesterday's news. That where some of the mistakes of the movie come in was that many of contemporary 21st century concepts were inserted in this movie about a 18th century woman.<br /><br />Perhaps, the saddest thing about this movie was that it ended just when Marie Antoinette's life was about to get very interesting. Kristen Dunst had a chance to show off her acting bit instead be being so one dimensional carefree, free spending character. Coppola had a chance to create a landmark movie but instead, she choose to make momentary statement movie that sounds dated even now.<br /><br />The DVD of this movie proves to be well made. The sound are excellent and images proves to be astoundingly well presented. The extras proves to be average, your usual "Making of the...." and few interviews that follows. Overall, an average package for a movie that really don't have much to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I couldn't get through ten minutes of "Marie Antoinette" without questioning what the point was. It certainly wasn't to tell a historically accurate story; despite the bold set and costume designs, the sparse moments of dialogue were completely modern, and the film's soundtrack made use of recent pop songs. That didn't really bother me, considering that many well-made period films have been very inaccurate. Maybe then the point was to portray the title character in a different light, one that would reveal how misunderstood she was in real life. If that was the intention, then something went wrong; I left the theater feeling no more enlightened than I did upon entering. Rather than delve into the complexities of Marie's mind, the film focuses on the rituals and traditions that were common in eighteenth century Europe. It was interesting, yes, but it didn't feel personal enough, and it did little if anything to help me understand the real Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />No wonder this movie is a mess; it was written and directed by Sofia Coppola, who completely missed the mark in 2003 with the grossly overrated "Lost in Translation." Both films prove that her writing style simply doesn't work (and I think it's about time someone told her so). In the case of "Marie Antoinette," we're presented with a story that goes absolutely nowhere, with each cut marking the end of yet another flat, bloodless scene. It doesn't help that half of the actors are miscast, including Rip Torn as Louis XV and Molly Shannon as a snobbish gossip-freak. Because of that, the style and emphasis they give their characters are way off track. Adding insult to injury are the film's unbearable pacing and length. I can't recall the last time I've been this bored watching a movie; I needed a jolt of caffeine by the middle just to keep from nodding off.<br /><br />And then there's Marie Antoinette herself, played with girlish innocence by Kirsten Dunst. I didn't feel as if I had the chance to explore her character fully; she felt shallow and unrefined, as if Dunst wasn't interested in the role. There's a wealth of things to see on the surface, such as laughter, tears, and the rebellious need to party and gamble in the midst of sophisticated royalty. Historically, it's easy to understand her behavior; in 1770, at the tender age of fourteen, she's arranged to marry Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman). This required her to leave her native Austria, not just physically, but emotionally, as well, casting aside all traces of her previous life (including her clothes, her friends, and her dog). Such a transition is understandably difficult for a teenager, considering she now has to take on responsibilities that a lot of adults aren't ready for.<br /><br />This alone was good material for to Coppola to work with, and it's a shame she used it without giving much thought to Marie. The best we're initially given is the occasional critique of how ridiculous some of the royal rituals are, such as having lower-ranking royalty dress her in the morning. We also have some tense moments between her and Louis, with the pressure to produce an heir weighing heavily upon them. But Louis is incredibly shy, pretty much to the point of ignoring her. Here's a character that didn't require a lot of effort; he's a quiet, detached young man who spends most of his time looking down. With such a passive attitude, you'd think Schwartzman could have perfected the role. He didn't. Truth be told, he completely ruined it. I've rarely seen an actor give less for a performance; he was an emotionless drone who didn't act so much as he read his lines.<br /><br />How could such a flat performance help an already weak film? The reality is that it can't. This is bad because the more serious portions of the story begin to pile up. For one thing, Marie isn't getting along with Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), Louis XV's mistress and a former prostitute. But more importantly, Marie and her husband have not been successful in the bedroom, with her attempts at initiating sexual contact flatly rejected (it's historically known that their marriage wasn't consummated for about seven years, and the audience is shown this during some incredibly repetitive scenes). Marie's mother, Maria Teresa (Marianne Faithful), is convinced that her daughter isn't "inspiring" him enough, and she continuously writes her letters of concern. Apparently, the future Queen of France can't be taken seriously unless she's pregnant.<br /><br />All of these ideas would have worked had Dunst not been directed to be so unflatteringly dull; even some elaborately shot party sequences didn't do much to enhance her screen presence. The material excess is shown to the fullest during these scenes, not the least of which come in the form of little pastries that Marie can't get enough of. She drinks champagne by the bottle. She wears dresses made of the finest materials. She even plays casino-type games with her friends, laughing the entire time. These moments are rich in visuals, yet they're completely hollow in spirit. There's no substance to what we're watching; there's only the illusion that an important story is being told.<br /><br />It isn't until the last half hour of the film that Marie becomes interesting, and by then it's too late. Such a pity: that's when she speaks a majority of her dialogue (before then, she couldn't have gotten more than ten lines in). Many years have passed and now she has children, all of whom she loves dearly (the film establishes early on how comfortable she is around children). Slowly her life comes to revolve around the need to be herself. She has her husband build her a sanctuary where she can be a mother as well as a free spirit, complete with a guesthouse, a vegetable garden, and some animals to take care of (lambs, chickens, ducks, etc.). She's the happiest during these scenes, and from the audience's point of view, she feels more like a complete character and less like a sketch. That level of complexity should have been there from the very beginning; at least then it wouldn't have been so excruciating to sit through to the end.<br /><br />And what of the end? The ultimate fate of the real Marie Antoinette is well known, but even then, I found that the final scenes of this film adaptation lacked something. Historically, we know that the people of France came to hate her for her constant spending (not helped by her husband's financial support of the American Revolution). But the film pays such little attention to this that it virtually voids the entire idea; just because Marie was sheltered from the realities of daily life didn't mean that the audience had to be. I wanted so much more from "Marie Antoinette." I wanted complexity. I wanted intensity. I wanted some kernel of knowledge about the main character to be planted in my brain. It didn't deliver; Sofia Coppola directed an empty, uninteresting film, one that is neither entertaining nor insightful. Much like the operators of the guillotine, I say off with its head.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>We watched this one because of our fall 2006 trip to Versailles and because of our daughter's study of French in school. Kirsten Dunst, who plays the title role, is also a very beautiful and somewhat accomplished (two Spidermans; Eternal Sunshine; no doubt some others I haven't seen) actress that's becoming one of my favorites of her generation (along with the wonderful Natalie Portman).  Jason Schartzman, who plays the Dauphin Louis-Auguste and then King Louis, was terrific in "Rushmore".<br /><br />Directed by Sofia Coppola (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011RPB0">Lost in Translation</a>), "Marie Antoinette" is much more of a visual experience than a plot-driven story.  Marie, a princess in her own right in Austria, arrives at the Court of France as a 15-year old promised to Dauphin Louis-Auguste, a sluggish boy of 16 with a passion for locksmithing.  She tries her best to ingratiate herself to Louis, to adjust to the attentions of the court, and eventually to enjoy all that is available.<br /><br />The movie features the most fantastic depiction of desserts ever filmed (at least for a Hollywood production) and also some of the most outlandish hairdos (many of which resemble pastries).  However, once she becomes mother to a dauphine and the long-awaited new dauphin, Marie becomes more serious about her role, to the extent that this is possible in the hothouse of Versailles.  Dunst is brilliant as the young, confused and eventually giddy Marie; she struggles somewhat with the more serious depiction near the end---perhaps that's intentional to convey Marie's actual struggle in the situation.<br /><br />Schwartzman was disappointingly flat as Louis--I think that the writers and Coppola could have made better use of this talented actor.  There's also some heavy innuendo (and a little more) about Marie's relationship with a Swedish soldier (and perhaps the fatherhood of the dauphin) which I've read is not well-supported by history, though it adds a note of tension to the story.<br /><br />Most memorable are the scenes where we watch Marie attended to by 15 or 20 courtiers, led by Judi Davis (each with a particular role, determined by seniority) as she rises in the morning, and the even larger group in attendance as she delivers the couple's first child.  Talk about needing privacy.  We also enjoyed seeing the mini-palace and country "cottage" that Louis had built for Marie after the birth of each child.  We saw the palace and walk the cottage grounds (it was a working farm of sorts) when we visited last year.<br /><br />A little offputting, probably for me moreso than younger viewers, is Coppola's use of modern pop music in the score.  My thought all along was that Mozart and others wrote some beautiful music that would have fit the scene better and sounded just as good.  Still, I guess she felt she needed more of a hook to younger audiences than the appearance of Dunst.  To Coppola's credit, she ends the film well short of depicting the historical end for the King and Queen of France; another plus for young viewers.  All in all, "Marie Antoinette" is an engaging and informative movie, certainly appropriate for adults and all teenagers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Marie Antoinette' tries to do with it's subject matter what 'Amadeus' did for Mozart.  This playful rendition is done reflectively by the artful hand of director Sofia Coppola who through Kirsten Dunst gives us a sympathetic portrayal.  Being the olive branch from and for Austria, Marie's acquisition as the queen of France takes on a whole new meaning.  Since her young husband King Louis XVI is more interested in hunting than consummating their marriage, she fails to live up to her role of providing a successor--for a consequentially long time.  She drowns her sorrows through the morning ritual, complete with courtiers who dote on every morning whim, including champagne, sumptuous food, and a large appetite for extravagant confections.  All the details are done in stunning detail, even if Ms. Coppola stops to reflect too long and too often.  Their dereliction is not entirely apparent to them, but is solidified when Louis, ironically, decides to fund the American Revolution at his expense--in more ways than one.  Once her appetite for gambling and jewels is solidified, it is hard to retract its effects on long bread lines and excruciating poverty.  The repercussions creep up on them, making the audience feel its blind-siding impact from the couples' point-of-view.  In order for the film to work, we have to sympathize with the protagonists, and at first we do.  For throwing away decorum, she charitably introduces applause at the opera, and quickly and easily freezes all need for new jewelry.  The classical and rock music accentuate the scenes, and, while it may seem misplaced for the latter, we realize how much of a tragic misfit she may have been in the royal scheme of things.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />'Marie Antoinette' is a stylish, if not overlong, new look at a colorful, misunderstood famous figure.  Usually personified as arrogance itself, she shrugged off being misunderstood and let's us know that she did not indeed say, "Let them eat cake" afterall.  Whether revisionism or not, this film is interesting in its own right.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>This movie was a huge disappointment; If wanted to see beautiful shots of Versailles for 2 and half hours I would look pictures up on the internet.<br />The only redeeming aspect of was the costumes and scenery, everything else was horrible. Kirsten Dunst was not very well suited at all for this character. Her performance came off as very artificial, not realistic at all.  Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone. And it feels like it's about four hours long.  The film is utterly useless to anyone who wishes to learn anything about Marie Antoinette's life.<br />Apparently, Sofia didn't inherit the talent gene from Daddy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Sophia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" (2006) is an embarrassing disaster - glamorous, colorful, shot inside and outside of French Versailles in its most lavish but disaster nevertheless. I don't know for whom the movie was made - perhaps, for Ms. Coppolla herself to add another chapter to her dreamy quiet slow moving films about bored and confused young girls. Her previous work, "Lost in Translation" was quite good even if not a timeless masterpiece as some critics and viewers tend to believe. Her latest film about a girl who happened to be born in 1755, a daughter and sister to the Austrian Emperors, the future wife and mother to French Kings, simply does not work. The film starts when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI. She arrives to the most fashionable, glamorous, and corrupted European court where she would remain "the foreigner", "The Austrian". The film depicts Marie Antoinette's life up until 1789 when the Great French Revolution starts with the storming of Bastille, the infamous Paris prison on July 14, 1789, and the King and Queen leave Versailles forever to meet their destiny. The film completely omits the final chapter of Marie Antoinette's life and never mentions the circumstances of her last five years. These five years were filled with the purest tragedy: death of her husband who was tried for treason, found guilty and executed on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her and died in captivity when he was 12 years old. She herself was brought to trial where she was accused among the other things in sexual abuse of her son. To this horrible accusation, the former queen, "the Widow Capet" or simply "Antoinette Capet" replied with the genuine royal dignity, "If I have not replied it is because Nature itself refuses to respond to such a charge laid against a mother..."<br /><br />When I visited Paris several years ago, I went to see The Conciergerie Prison where Marie Antoinette was kept before her death and from where she was taken on the morning of October 16, 1793, "forced into a tumbrel and paraded through the streets of Paris for over an hour before reaching the Place de la R&eacute;volution where the guillotine stood." Spending short time in the Antoinette's prison cell let me learn about her tragic final days that Sofia Coppola chose not to include in her movie. I respect her decision to tell the story of the ill-fated last Queen of France as a bored and frustrated teenage girl with a sweet smile and charming dimples, whose equally young, shy and totally inexperienced husband was more interested in the history of locks and keys than in making love and children to her but by making Marie-Antoinette the central figure of the film and never taking her camera outside the palace, Coppolla limited her movie to the typical "chick flick" that happened to take place in Versailles.<br /><br />Marie-Antoinette as played by Kurstin Dunst is not very interesting person; she leads a boring life within the strict etiquette's rules of the Royal Palace, and all she wants - to have some fun. It is OK to make a movie about boring life of boring and bored insignificant people but it is not OK to never mention what actually was going on outside the palace where the real life was happening and the revolution was brewing way before Coppola chose to mention the shortage of bread for the commoners and storming of Bastille. The second half of the 18th Century was enormously interesting and eventful time in the history of France, Europe, and the World. It was the time when Mozart wrote his music, Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais had finished his three Figaro plays, and the most brilliant one, "The Marriage of Figaro" was banned by the King for its irreverent attitude towards the aristocracy from being performed. Outside the Palace's walls, very intelligent, free thinking angry young men from "Third Estate" (the "Commons"), grew up, received good education, and became lawyers, physicians, journalists, and scientists. Influenced by philosophical and political ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the principles of Libert&eacute;, Egalit&eacute;, Fraternit&eacute; that they embraced in The Jacobin Club in Paris, they later would become leaders of the French Revolution that would destroy the old regime of the absolute monarchy but eventually turn into the Reign of Terror in which the passionate revolutionaries would perish along with the aristocrats. Among them, Mirabeau - a great orator and able statesman; Danton, a figure larger than life; Robespierre, known as "incorruptible", Jean Paul Marat, scientist and revolutionary. None of them have been ever mentioned in the movie. Even the notorious Affair of the diamond necklace that was historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's bitter disappointment with the monarchy and contributed to the growing hatred toward the Queen who had been nicknamed, "Madam Deficit", did not deserve a single remark in the movie about Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />I've read some articles that defend the film by saying that it is not a historic movie but "the story of the silly teenager who embodied a corrupt, absolutist state in its terminal decadence". These articles keep pointing to the visual beauty, production design, Oscar winning costumes, and nice cinematography. They are indeed lovely and the movie is an eye candy but Marie Antoinette as she was presented in the Sophia Coppola's movie can't herself hold this viewer's interest no matter how many pretty dresses with the elegant matching shoes she has changed and how many tiny delightful pastries she has eaten, and I am a huge fan of low cut dresses and those delicious pastries, believe me.<br /><br />2-/5 or 3/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>Nicely acted, nicely photographed.  The use of modern rock music with a period costume drama just doesn't work.  Why make this movie?  The characters are shallow and boring.  Perhaps this is supposed to convince us that the French revolution was justified.  But we were cheated out of seeing the execution.  We just get endless scenes of self-indulgent aristocrats munching on bon bons.  We get the sense that the director is somehow curiously sympathetic to Marie Antoinette, but we can't figure out why.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Every scene, if not every frame of Marie Antoinette is beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. The sets, the costumes, the FOOD. Everything. It's a demonstration of what big movies should strive to provide. Everywhere you turn there's more amazing costumes, hair, and backdrops for the story to play out on.<br /><br />The problem is that there's hardly any story to play out. Amidst all the decadent, eye-popping design the story falls entirely flat. Actually falling would imply that it was moving and then stumbled. This story decides never to stand up. Over half of the movie is dedicated to the "oh-so-depressing" storyline that poor Marie can't consumate her marriage with her husband. Over and over we see Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman in bed, unable to... to what? If we're supposed to be shown how bored Dunst's Antoinette is, believe me, we've got it.<br /><br />The idea of the movie seems to involve exploring the self-indulgent lifestyle of the queen of France, while also painting her as a real human who's had such a "tough" life because her husband won't sleep with her and she had to leave her homeland of Vienna. In examining this queen, however, the entire film comes off as hopelessly self-indulgent.<br /><br />Marie Antoinette feels like a posh joke played on an unsuspecting audience. Although, just from the cover, you've got to be suspecting something. The cast features a mixture of British and American actors. So, some of the "french" characters and some of the "austrian" characters have American accents and some have British accents. Molly Shannon is thrown in for good measure, along with Rip Torn as the King of France. If that doesn't tip audiences off that something is wrong, what will? Jason Schwartzman, who's usually a delight to watch, is entirely miscast, unless miscasting is the idea of ALL the casting, in which case Sofia Copolla cast her film perfectly... making sure that nothing would actually make sense, and no one would actually look like they belonged.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a waste of $40 million, unless you want to hang your television on the wall, put this movie in, mute it, put on some good music, and host a party. Then I could see how the eye candy might be worthwhile. But as far as a story-line or anything that is comprehensible or enjoyable, look somewhere else.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are mostly typical: trailers, trailer for Marie Antoinette, and a pretentious "making of" featurette, where we get to hear about how amazing Sofia Copolla's adaptation is (including Francis Ford Copolla, PRODUCER, saying that the more personalized Sofia made it, the better it would be). The one cool bonus on the DVD is the short "Cribs with Louis XVI", where Jason Schwartzman is walking through the palace in semi-character describing his crib to MTV. Slight hilarity ensues.<br /><br />So, if I haven't made it clear enough, this movie is like a runway model: Beautiful, Self-Centered, and Boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I've always disliked period films that take inspirations from the 21st century. It doesn't work and its annoying. Modern music does not belong in any period drama. Having said that, the movie itself actually has a very modern feel. But that is because Kirsten Dunst is in it. She is not believable in the least. However, I really couldn't get enough of all those costumes. Gorgeous and unbelievale isn't even enough to describe them. Probably some of the best I've ever seen in any film. At least the movie looked pretty. The barely-there plot doesn't really help it. It was just sort of an odd movie that happens to be visually stunning. I'm sure there are people that would love this type of film, but for anyone looking for a real film on Maria Antoinette, look somewhere else.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>As she did with the two competing young American women in contemporary Tokyo (Anna Faris and Scarlet Johansson), omce again Sofia Coppola has written and directed a story, based on her own life, of an unsatisfied young bride hungry for attention who must contrast her own stifled dreams with the dramatically sensuous life of a rival.  In this case Coppola casts Asia Argento as the legendary Madama Du Barry, the favorite of the king.  Argento, the daughter of Italian horrormeister Dario Argento, is but one of several actors cast here because they, like Coppola herself, are "Hollywood royalty" and thus lend the picture an extra dimension by their mere presence in the cast list--Danny Huston, the son of the late John Huston, plays the Emperor of Austria here, in a few amusing scenes.<br /><br />It is said that just as she pursued Bill Murray for years, hounding him into taking the lead role in LOST IN TRANSLATION, Coppola used all her wiles, but unsuccessfully, hoping to lure French film icon Alain Delon into playing Louis XV, the man who kept Madame Du Barry constantly on hand no matter how much scandal it created in court.  Alas, Rip Torn took the part and plays it exactly as if he thought he was still filming THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.  He's great and all, but a little out of place, whereas he should have been the still, ominous center of the film, the master of everything he controlled.<br /><br />It was whispered that Du Barry had been arrested 14 times on charges ranging from prostitution to witchcraft by the time she was presented at court in 1769, about a year before the action of Coppola's film takes place.  What a spectacle Asia makes of herself--licking Torn's face, feeding him wine and bits of food, letting him slobber up and down her generous cleavage.  "Don't hold back," Coppola must have told her.  "Remember, you're a magnificent wench!"  To ensure she gave the performance Coppola wanted, the director arranged for Asia Argento to watch a special screening, at the Cinematheque Francaise, of King Vidor's DUEL IN THE SUN, in which Jennifer Jones rips up the screen with passion as the "half-breed" Pearl Chavez.  Elderly theatergoers with long memories might recall that Ethel Merman, of all people, also essayed the part of Madame Du Barry, but Merman was refined as Gwyneth Paltrow compared to the finger licking, throw your head back and laugh evilly je je sais quoi of Asia Argento.<br /><br />Next to whom, poor Kirsten Dunst can do very little except refuse to speak to her.</p></br><a href="../users/AGNOPNCN6FHB6.html">AGNOPNCN6FHB6</a><br/><p>OK got the opulence and decadence with the Versailles deal...and the musak was just one major annoyance to deal with...I have no clue why the dialogue was such a mystery, editing process, script, writer problems...how could you possibly as a serious director solicit such poor performances from decent actors???

But then I found it was a Sofia Coppola movie. Not a big fan of this chick. Let me be honest. The Virgin Suicides was interesting, but disturbing and not all there. Lost in Translation was just that: lost in translation. But Marie Antoinette manages to deliver. Kinda. The movie's not as fast paced, not as colorful, not as musical, as you may think. The use of modern music, a la A Knight's Tale, is cool, but way under-used. I say that if you're going to do something modern with a period piece, you might as well go all out. The movie teeters between being flashy and cool and boring and dramatic. It never quite decides what it wants to be. And that's really my only beef with this flick. Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman are awesome. The costumes are amazing. And the story is involved, detailed, informative, and interesting.<br /><br />The movie centers around the marriage of Marie Antoinette, daughter of the Queen of Austria, to the French dauphin. Everyone's counting on her to produce an heir to the throne, but she and her husband aren't even sleeping together. They haven't even consummated the marriage. Every morning, there's a huge rigamoroll involving the entire court just to get Marie dressed. Then everyone watches as she eats. You can see on her face that she hates the hoity-toity customs, but she lives with it anyway. It really is a blow by blow of this chicks life, and one thing after another happens. Rent it. Enjoy it. May not be the best movie (it's a little slow), but it's worth a look see.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>OK people ~ most queens throughout history have been severely misunderstood  {think Bodicia/Hatshepsut/Cleo/Lillebet II - after all it was [is] still a man's world?}  BUT -<br /><br />Miss Dunst, Mr. Schwartzman, Miss Davis [Judi], and all of the rest of this charmingly sad view of the lost epoch fare quite brilliantly - so does Canonero's exquisite costumes ~ period perfect!<br /><br />Highly recommended to bring that spark back into life and thank God [somewhat] the 'removal' methods are not so quite drastic as it was ... close in theme to the erasure of the Romanoff dynasty, this was just a futile series of misadventures.<br /><br />MISS DUNST RULES though!

I mention this because Sofia's career path is following a similar trajectory as her father's.  With this film and "The Virgin Suicides" and "Lost in Translation"(which I didn't get) Sofia is not yet on equal footing as her father but she has established herself as a talent to be reckoned with.  "Marie Antoinette" is not a great film but most certainly it's an interesting one.  The intent here is to portray the notorious Queen of France in a sympathetic light.  The film follows her from the time she was a callow teenager born of Austrian nobility forced into a loveless marriage of convenience to the Dauphin of France till her inevitable fate with the guillotine.  Kirsten Dunst, always a formidable actress, probably gives her best performance ever in portraying the evolution of her character.  Jason Schwartzmann, in what could have been a totally unsympathetic role, engenders some empathy for Louis.  The great Rip Torn gives a lusty turn as the King of France.  The decor is sumptuous and the Oscar winning costumes are breathtaking.  The film's lone glaring debit is the intermittent use of latter day pop music.  Really, Sofia, what place does Bow Wow Wow's "I Want Candy" have in the Eighteenth Century?  That quibble aside "Marie Antoinette" is a worthwhile viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>LOVED IT...let's start there!<br />I finally did something right IMO; I disregarded all of the controversial press this film received,read Antonia Fraser's book from which director Sofia Coppola drew her inspiration,bought the DVD,watched it....and WAS ASTOUNDED!!!THIS IS NOT ANOTHER DOCUDRAMA, so be advised!<br /><br />This film is so eye-catching and refreshingly unique in its approach to the much documented and oft misunderstood Marie Antoinette ( an endearing and perfectly innocent Kirsten Dunst),the Austrian Princess who,at the young age of 14 is married out to Prince Louis 16th to secure an alliance between Austria and France.Coppola,using Fraser's novel,recreates an image of carefree decadence and careless youth in bold colors and daring costumes (Oscar winner Milena Canonero-"Chariots of Fire") as Antoinette flitters around the real Versailles Palace learning to adjust to French Court life,a ridiculously shy "husband" (Jason Schwartzman?-THIS CASTING  WORKS!!!!), and the ridicule and gossip that cuts like a knife from the courtiers.This film is bathed in candy colors and fresh pastels that Coppola uses to convey a sense of 21st century sensibility to an 18th story.Coppola uses gorgeous Baroque French music and opera to give us a feel for the times, but is unabashedly bold to use heavy metal rock tunes in order to bring her unique and fresh perspective on a Queen whose youth and inexperience at life and lack of knowledge concerning "her adopted people" causes her most ruinous downfall.Coppola's view towards Antoinette,like Fraser's book, is sympathetic towards their subject.This is good,because Marie Antoinette was much skewered by the Press and much false propaganda caused much distrust among the French.Fraser,s book and Coppola's film endeavour to possibly correct some,not all, of the misconceptions surrounding the Royal Couple.<br />Other films that add light on Marie Antoinette and Court Life would be THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE,PBS' MARIE ANTOINETTE,MARIE ANTOINETTE:QUEEN OF VERSAILLES,SADE,RIDICULE,LADY AND THE DUKE,THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL (any version) and somewhat AMADEUS.<br />I challenge viewers to see this film with an open eye and mind.It is revelatory while being incredibly innovative,eye-dazzling and downright entertaining.<br />One of the smartest films I ever waited to see.DVD extras contain a great look at Coppola and her vision for this work.<br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Marie Antoinette starring Kirsten Dunst left me in a heavenly state. What a gorgeous film to look at, the dialogue and music is current and accessbile for younger auidences. I can see why this film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, you can't take your eyes off of those over-the-top costumes. I have never been a Dunst fan but she is surprisely good as the doomed Marie Antoinette. Dunst plays the Queen of France very reserved, motherly, and understanding towards her husband's "bedroom issues." I have to admit I hated Sofia Coppola's first film, The Virgin Suicides and I wasn't expecting too much from this film but I felt Coppola stayed true to the life and legacy of Marie Antoinette. I highly recommend giving this film a look at, it's beautiful yet refined. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Sofia Coppola offers another look at history's infamous Marie Antoinette, the premise being that she was in life just a simple young Austrian girl delivered to France as a political queen candidate, who liked pretty things, loved children, flowers, clothes, shopping, and sweets, and lived a life oblivious to the political turmoil outside the confines of Versailles until it was too late.  Coppola delivers her side of history with a maximum budget, endless sumptuous costumes, shoes, wigs, oft-changed costumed huge cast, top of the line creative cuisine and pastries, a nice little performance by Kirsten Dunst, an extended tour inside Versailles and two hours of minimal dialogue about rather inconsequential matters.<br /><br />Coppola does mix contemporary music with period music, an anachronism that is not additive but does allow us to see snippets of Rameau's 'Platee' (and a cut version of Susan Graham as Gluck's 'Orfeo' singing 'Che faro Euridice' in French translation on a beautiful stage with a sensuous nude model lying at her feet).  And if Coppola's purpose is to demonstrate how the 'media', whether that be printed or verbal history, has painted an incorrect picture of a charming young child/lady who happened to be blissfully unaware of the changes of the day, she has succeeded.  It just doesn't seem to be enough story for a two hour slick magazine spread on indulgences in France of the late 18th century.<br /><br />The cast is well chosen: Judy Davis exudes court etiquette as Comtesse de Noailles,  Rip Torn is a fine Louis XV more interested in his consort du Barry as well imitated by Asia Argento, Steve Coogan is Steve Coogan as Ambassador Mercy, Rose Byrne keeps the story afloat as Duchesse de Polignac, and Jason Schwartzman makes us understand why the distracted Louis XVI capitalized the troubles of a clueless court during the time of Revolution.<br /><br />The endless costume changes are entertaining to the eye but about as repetitive as the too frequent boudoir lack of activity between Marie and Louis.  This is one of those films where the Featurette on the DVD makes the evening worth tolerating; it is fresh, funny, informative, allows bonuses, and ultimately explains why the movie was made in the first place. As for the film itself, it is a long static song. Grady Harp, February 07</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>This period of French history is my favorite to study, yet somehow, this movie makes me cringe.<br /><br />I think the movie is an excellent collection of beautiful scenes and fun episodes of frivolity.  However, Coppola's disregard for making her audience understand and feel for Marie made this movie boring and trite.  I never once felt like I could identify with any character.  All of them seemed emotionally removed from the film.  I could understand how this would play up to the characterization of the time, but it was poorly done nonetheless.<br /><br />The movie is pretentious and overdone.  It was trying too hard to be aloof and cold, yet visually stunning.  The visuals remind me of a Pleasures perfume commercial--okay for a commercial, but not so good for a movie (to see this hazy, romantic cinematography done well, try the 2005 Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley).  Understanding Marie and Louis's demise was difficult.  Understanding Marie's true feelings was also difficult.<br /><br />I did not mind the soundtrack, I actually enjoy it.  There is no better way to convey the decadence and mindlessness of the time than comparing it to the 1980s.<br /><br />It is a fun movie that should be taken lightly as a period spectacle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>Marie Antoinette gives an honest portrayal of the French Queen from the time that she was just Archduchess Maria Antonia (the daughter of mighty Empress Maria Teresa) to the time shortly before she and her husband lost their heads in the French Revolution.<br /><br />Between the two time periods, Marie Antoinette led a very interesting life.  At first the Dauphine of France who wanted to have children, but whose husband would not make love to her so she substituted the longing with shopping, to the French Queen who was the mother of the future King of France who had an affair (and maybe child with) Swedish Count Axel von Ferson,  to a political prisoner and the Widow Capet.<br /><br />All in all a very well done movie with an interesting cast headed by Kirsten Dunst. Based on a book by Antonia Fraiser the movie is very faithful to the life of this interesting French Queen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Just misunderstood? A scapegoat? A pawn in their game? A flibbertigibbet? That's the impression you get of the infamous Marie "Let Them Eat Cake" Antoinette presented here. Kirsten Dunst, well cast as the queen, actually says she would never say "Let them eat cake" in this movie. There seems to me elements of truth to this but I took it all in very lightly while looking at beautiful and elaborate costumes, the Palace of Versailles, the wigs, the shoes, the food and pastries, all the while listening to that New Wave/"alternative" soundtrack. I think we're exploring the personal and subjective here more than the political and historical... And we are enjoying playing dress-up. I had a sense of what to expect before seeing it so I enjoyed the show. The film Coppola made wasn't one that many critics wanted and nor for that matter is it a portrayal of Marie Antoinette and the French court that I'd have been most interested in. But it is what it is and it's a good movie and the one the director wanted to make. You got to give some points for originality. Judged based on what seems to be what Sofia Coppola wanted to do here, it works.<br /><br />I look forward to more from Sofia Coppola. LOST IN TRANSLATION is a favorite. Her films are so moody and atmospheric, at times dreamlike, and I that's what I like most about them.<br /><br />Maybe check out "Ten things that occurred to me while watching MARIE ANTOINETTE" by Roger Ebert on his website for some nice insight and appreciation. Ebert is a great friend to the movies and I hope he's around for a long time to come. Also, The New Yorker's Anthony Lane's piece "Lost in the Revolution" is excellent. For a different reaction see "Sofia Coppola's MARIE ANTOINETTE: Not even cake?" by Emanuele Saccarelli on World Socialist Web Site. Lol.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I still vividly recall the abundant trailers and promos that accompanied Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" upon its theatrical release. From the gorgeous visuals, the eye popping color palette, and the anachronistic rock soundtrack--it seemed, to me, that "Marie" could be an adventurous and bold success or a complete disaster. And, in truth, as I survey the hundreds of previously submitted reviews--it does appear that people fall on one side of this spectrum or the other. So is Coppola's film a daring masterpiece or pretentious drivel? I can see a rational explanation for both points of view. However, in my case, I'll say that "Marie Antoinette" first exceeded my expectations and then let me down. holla<br /><br />I will preface my next remarks by saying that, in no way, did I go into "Marie Antoinette" anticipating a traditional historical biography. Anyone entering the film expecting great insight into Antoinette's real life or even French history is likely to be disappointed. But, seen as a bit of fiction, there are simple pleasures to be had from the film.<br /><br />The film is not nearly as radical as one might suspect. The lovely first hour tells the relatively straightforward story of Marie (Kirsten Dunst) as she leaves her home, moves to France, and takes her place as the future Queen. Seen through Marie's inexperienced eyes, the court is a place of wondrous beauty and baffling protocol. Trying to connect with her new husband Louis and maintain the spirit of her youth, Marie is an oddity that people come to accept and admire. I really enjoyed this first hour of "Marie Antoinette." Aside from the gorgeous sets and costumes, there is much charm and humor in the small details of the film's setup. However, just as I was completely captivated, the film lost all momentum. When Marie has a child, the narrative just seems to stop for a while--idling in the countryside that Marie so enjoys. And, then, as things turn more serious, the film lost me entirely. Every real issue is presented in only the vaguest of terms. Here is where a bit of valid historical context would have aided the movie tremendously. As the couple fall out of favor, I know there are dozens of significant reasons--but the film isn't at all concerned about the facts of the matter. And if the film doesn't care, why should I?<br /><br />Dunst does a nice job with Antoinette, especially in the more innocent times at court. Jason Schwartzman seems an unlikely match as husband Louis. He begins as a bit of a cartoon but has a compelling sweetness that won me over--although the "real" Louis remains a complete enigma to me. Rip Torn and Judy Davis class up the film to great affect. While both offer moments of sheer delight, I wished they were utilized even further. So while the performances are nice, the technical merits noteworthy, and the visual pleasures abundant--the screenplay ultimately loses the battle of style over substance. It's unfortunate, though, the potential for greatness was here--but, for me, "Marie Antoinette" ends up missing the mark. KGHarris, 11/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Hummm, this was an interesting movie, I loved the locations, Coppola getting to film at Versailles was a real coup, and it added so much to the movie, it made it feel very authentic.  I liked Dunst as Antoinette, usually im not a fan of hers,  like i hate her in the Spiderman movies, but she really works as the Queen.  The things i did not like were the BIZARRE music choices, I mean what the f?  it sounded like the exact soundtrack to Lost in Translation, but it totally does not work here, frankly it nearly ruins the movie.  I also am not a fan of Coppola's direction, she has this pretentious way of lingering on people or objects for like several minutes and your like why are we looking at this for so long? it's very annoying, that and her aforementioned bizarre soundtrack choices.  Overall, id recommend this movie, the locations are amazing and the performances very good, really it's Coppola's direction and music choices that keep this from actually being a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>I had serious reservations about this film. I am a lifelong lover of Marie Antoinette and her story. 'The Journey' by Antonia Fraser is one of the best Marie Antoinette books I have ever read. When I heard who the director was for this film I was skeptical, but I finally had to buy the DVD. I like Kirsten Dunst.<br /><br />The film has some very small details and events that are historically accurate. Marie Antoinette did indeed have to strip down nude in order to cross over into France, Louis XV was indeed interested in her bosom, and Marie Antoinette did stand shivering as her clothing was passed from one lady in waiting to another.<br /><br />The French court and atmosphere was accurate on film, cold, haughty and uppity, and yes at times ridiculous. Du Barry was portrayed well as were Marie's close circle of friends. Louis XVI was played perfectly. In my personal opinion, I will believe to my dying day that Louis XVI was a homosexual. Seven years to consumate a marriage and the first king NEVER to have a mistress?? C'mon folks, it isn't hard to figure this out.<br /><br />The costumes are magnificent. Kirstin Dunst is breathtakingly beautiful, and the luxrious life she lead in her early stages of her reign are pretty accuratly portrayed. Some find this film boring, I will admit that those who do not appreciate what this woman went through or what her life was all about, would find it boring. However the stage had to be set for what was about to come.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there is no mention of the infamous Diamond Necklace episode. That event is as significant to the French Revolution as the fall of the Bastille. Yet the final scene we see the royal family leaving Versaille never to return. The movie ends just as the adventure, drama, and heartache of Marie Antoinette's life begins.<br /><br />In my opinion this project cannot end here. It is a terrible waste to just leave it hanging here. What about the escape attempt in the Berlin? The September massacres? The Tower imprisonment? The war with Austria? The trial, and finally her long ride to the guillotine? If a part two were to be done correctly and with Kirsten returning to her role as the doomed Queen, Marie Antoinette part 2 could be as lavish, loved, and succesful as the movie Titanic.<br /><br />For what the movie was, it was very good. I can honestly say I was not disappointed neither as a Marie Antoinette fan or a student. I think Kirsten was superb. I think for the period of her life that this film covered, it was very good and accurate. Lavish and boredom was the theme of her life until the Revolution began. But again, this movie is only half the story. I would recommend to anyone whio saw this movie to read 'The Journey' or any other Marie Antoinette biography. What happened to that woman and her children is one of the greatest tradgedies in Western History.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Sofia Coppola's version of Marie Antoinette focuses on the grandeur and opulence of Versailles, the strained relationship between Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and the repurcussions that their youth and wild ways had on the future of their country. When Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI meet they are mere children who know nothing about one another. For more than a year of their marriage they are virtual strangers who sleep in the same bed, but have yet to consummate their marriage. Louis is portrayed as a distant husband who cares more about his hunting and lock-making than the future of his country. Marie Antoinette is portrayed as a confused, spendthrift who attempts to mend the rift in her marriage by indulging in court gossip, stuffing herself with sweets, and spending copious amounts of money.<br /><br />As a whole, I enjoyed the film. I thought Kirsten Dunst was better than I've ever seen her (though I will allow that comparing this performance to Bring It On and Spiderman is a bit of a stretch) and the costumes, lighting, and direction were superb. I've never been a big fan of historical movies that are retold to suit the writers' purposes, but in this instance I was willing to look past it and just see that this was a well-made film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers, however, that the soundtrack left something to be desired. Although I do like a lot of the songs that were used in this movie, most of the time they seemed discordant with what was happening on screen. Still, as a whole this movie was entertaining and I think that's what's most important.</p></br></body></html>

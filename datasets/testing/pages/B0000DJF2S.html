In this twist on history, literary characters are real, and each of the characters in blended into one great story.  After reading the graphic novel, I was very excited about the movie, but I found myself disappointed with the retelling and rewriting.  What was wrong with the original?<p>The extras on the DVD discuss how Sean Connery was approached, and perhaps as a way to get him involved, the script was rewritten to take Mina Harker from her leadership role and replace her with Alan Quartermain.  Also, Quartermain, in this telling, is merely a retired adventurer rather than an opium fiend found in a back alley.<p>Because I had such high expectations, I was only mildly pleased with the movie.  Seeing each character fight his or her inner demons was interesting, but I couldn't stop comparing it to the book.  My wife, on the other hand, had not read the book and found it very exciting.  Although I would recommend seeing this, I would recommend reading the graphic novel more.</p></br><a href="../users/A15MLF38WROSWU.html">A15MLF38WROSWU</a><br/><p>To truly appreciate this movie you had to have a love of literature.  This movies brings together some very unlikely  heroes to help save the world from a madman that is planning the destruction and take over of the world.  Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Wilhelmina Harker, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Jeckyll.  Connery is Quatermain.  The movie is really good, and it really surprised me.  You have the usual plot of who is trying to be a saboteur, who can you trust, tease of a past love affair, and some good action.  While this movie is not great, you get drawn in.  I was really enjoying the Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde character!!!  Watching him change, and this big monster actually be heroic!!  You will find yourself rooting for him big time.  I really enjoyed this picture.  I also enjoyed Mina's Vampire character.  She was so lady like, even after biting someone's neck!!!  Loved her!!!</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>Why the heck does everybody hate this movie so much?!  I am completely stumped at why this is so.  LXG was definitely the most underrated film of 2003 (along with HULK and THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS), and it deserved much better than it got.  One reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because it's that kind of adventure we never get anymore: the Fantasy Adventure.  You know, like the INDIANA JONES trilogy, or THE MUMMY.  The very concept of mixing all these historic figures of literature and legend together I found very intriguing.  I've heard fans of the comic say that the movie completely destroyed what the comic did so well.  Well, since I've never even seen a single comic of LXG, the movie worked exceptionally well for me.<p>I was so pleasantly pleased after watching LXG.  From all the horrible reviews it received, I wasn't expecting very much.  Just a big, dumb, stupid comic book movie.  Well, let me tell you, my expectations were completely blown away!  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN is, in fact, a very well-done film, from the fine acting of its stars &amp; supporting cast, the awesome production design, the fantastic and mood-setting/tone-matching music by Trevor Jones, and the very treatment of the characters.  They're obviously altered from their original forms, but the actors and events never go so far as insulting the characters.  Rather, the film brings the heroes into new ground, and provides each one with new twists.  I found each of these twists highly entertaining (yes, even the turban-sprouting, kung-fu practicing Captain Nemo; I though it was fascinating how they showed him worshipping the god of death).  And of course, you have Sean Connery: THE MAN.<p>Thankfully, director Stephen Norrington did a much better job with this than he did with BLADE.  I hear that he's going into independent films now, so knowing that, watching this film made it all the more interesting.<p>Do yourself a favor and don't bother listening to the critics.  But don't go in expecting LORD OF THE RINGS, either.  Instead, go in expecting THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN to be a marvelous piece of entertainment, sure to become a cult classic as time goes by.  It's the perfect thing for a Saturday night!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>In the superhero genre, this film scores a 4!<p>Sean Connery, Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend, Richard Roxburgh, and Jason Flemyng almost jump out of the screen as some of literature's greatest heros (or villains depending on your take).  Based on a graphic novel of the same name, the film provides us with an introduction to each character as any good superhero film should and then WHAM! we're in the action!<p>Don't make the mistake that many might - that this is an action film - because, while it has tons of action, this is a superhero film!  Back before there were comics, there were fantasy novels, science fiction, and horror.  It is this genre that this movie (and since I've not read the graphic novel - I'll assume it as well) mines for its characters and plotline.<p>The time is 1899, and some meglomaniac is attempting to bring the world into a world war (remember the first world war began some 13 years later).  So the head of British Intelligence attempts to sign on Allen Quartermaine, the great explorer and adventurer as the leader of a group known as the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The man who brings them together is known as "M".  (Now, this mere character name flashed brightly for me as it alluded to the current cinematic version of the British Secret Service overseeing James Bond - M.  Now, kids, anyone remember who played the first James Bond? - Can you say Sean Connery?).  I don't know how faithful this occurrance is to the books, but, man, it struck just the right note for me.<p>Hesitant, Quartermaine agrees and we are quickly introduced to the rest of the League (and does this "League" name strike anyone as vaguely familiar to the "Justice League" of comic book fame?):  we have Stevenson's invisible man, Mina Harker from Stoker's Dracula, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Well's Captain Nemo (really outstandingly fleshed out for us here), Wilde's Dorian Gray, Twain's Tom Sawyer are brought to life for us vividly.  The streets of London are brought to life wonderfully.<p>I loved how the science fiction aspect was developed:  Captain Nemo is obviously a scientific genius and so he has advanced modern science on his own by creating an automobile (which were actually invented in around 1875 by Daimler Benz in Germany, but were not yet known widely) that looks like it belongs in the 1930's and a submarine which looks as if it is the size of the Titanic.  He also has heat seeking missiles on board the Nautilus.  This is all quite fantastic and farfetched - but HEY! - this is an action film of the superhero nature.<p>Why these characters?  Quartermaine is undeniably the first "Indiana Jones" of literature.  Mina Harker is a brilliant choice, because she is a vampire - who can fly and transform herself - but one who can walk in the daylight. The Invisible Man is stealthy and ....invisible!  Dorian Gray - well he's indestructible - but he does have his Kryptonite.  Captain Nemo...well there's got to be a superhero who knows everything about everything, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...well let me tell you that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote about "The Hulk" in the late 1800's - long before Stan Lee borrowed the concept for his comic.  Tom Sawyer?  He's the American version of Quartermaine and a crack shot.<p>The acting is top notch and the storyline is really quite well developed.  I want to read the books, because I've got to believe Fox was somewhat faithful to them, because movie studios routinely screw up good literary stories when they put them to film.<p>The special effects are awesome and the storyline really works.  I really loved who the villain turns out to be.  I'm not going to tell you, but do remember the characters are all from Victorian literature.<p>Definitely go see this movie!  I fully intend to purchase this when it hits DVD.  Loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>To be honest LXG is probably the underdog because X-Men seems to have this summer blockbuster category filled and even though LXG tries very hard to be a contender it can go nowhere near really hitting on what X-Men has achieved and certainly Spider-man has nothing to worry about. So where does it rank? Well if you did not like The Hulk then you will find LXG a much more suitable superhero mash.<p>LXG has a few problems. Sean Connery is not exactly flaring across the screen and even though all the other superheroes are given enough screen time it is surprisingly a fairly wooden affair with not much fleshed out in the way of their backgrounds even though quite a bit is hinted at. So really our dependence in engaging these characters is with their action quality. We would expect LXG to have lots in that department, but sadly what action there is just turns out to be a "been there before and bought the T-shirt" except for one good action sequence in Venice which is quite frankly a little bit hard to follow or understand and never really amounts to much. So the action is a way below par, especially if you have seen the likes of Blade from the same director - Stephen Norrington.<p>Where LXG really stands out is in the design and the concept realized onto the screen looks simply amazing. It is like Batman crossed with Wild Wild West. In fact Wild Wild West is exactly the same kind of summer bummer unblockbuster as this one. LXG looks incredible and certainly moves along at a good pace but ultimately it just as forgettable with nothing to really make you want to catch a sequel.<p>When all is said and done LXG is far from the worst DVD you can pick up for some pop-corn fodder entertainment but at the same time is pretty much an under-nourishing experience with some good scenes but not a great movie. The plot is a little banal and certainly the twists that come about are not really anything suspenseful. I somewhat enjoyed it enough to say that it was worth watching if there is nothing better on the shelf but I would not exactly be running to the cinema to see the sequel by any means.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>A superteam of fictional heroes taken from the works of H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Oscar Wilde?  Sounds like it can't miss, especially when it's Allan Quartermain (q.v. King Solomon's Mines), Dr. Jekyll, Minna Harker, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, and Dorian Gray.  On the other hand, it sounds like X-Men 1899, or should that be The Fantastic Seven?<p>The year, 1899.  Tensions already hot between England and Germany due to the naval arms race (not mentioned, but something I thought I'd throw in, due to my knowledge), come closer to boiling point when a tank, similar to the ones that would be used in World War I, makes a raid on an English bank.  Germany is blamed.  A Zeppelin factory in Germany is attacked.  Naturally, Britain is blamed.  Worldwide consequences are foreseen, despite the fact that it's eight years before the formation of the Triple Entente.<p>Allan Quartermain is dragged from the wilds in Kenya back to England and asked by a gentleman cryptically named M, to have a martini shaken not stirred.  Kidding, but think of the similarities between this M and another M in a series of movies starring Connery.  Anyway, this M resurrects the League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, comprising of unique personalities, to combat the villain, identified only as the Phantom.<p>A lead takes them to Venice, courtesy of Nemo's ivory-coloured submarine, the Nautilus.  (Cue "We all live in an ivory submarine" haha).  Digital technology has to be commended for the realization of this nautical marvel.<p>Connery puts his usual combination of charm, dignity, and toughness as Allan Quartermain.  However, given his employer's name, "M", I wonder if he felt more than a trifle of annoyance at the James Bond reference.  I'm not sure about Tony Curran playing the Invisible Man with some cheekiness.  However, Peta Wilson, exuding a calm beauty as Mina Harker is a surprise, playing Jonathan Harker's widow with restraint, that is until she gets stirred up and goes on a red-wine binge, vintage A, B, AB, or O.  She also becomes an object of attraction for the debonair Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), invulnerable because of... Oscar Wilde readers will know full well what I mean, and plain-speaking Tom Sawyer (Shane West).  West plays Sawyer as kind of a surrogate son for Quartermain.  And veteran actor David Hemmings (Barbarella, Blow Up, Deep Red) has a small role in the beginning as Nigel.  Jason Flemyng as Dr. Jekyll is interesting, as he has conversations with his CGI alter-ego.  Naseeruddin Shah plays the turbaned Nemo, resplendent in blue,  with an air of dignified leadership.<p>Apart from the obvious inspirations, there is a nod to Victor Hugo's The Phantom Of The Opera and in a scene in Paris, Quartermain's mention of the police trying to catch an ape owes something to Edgar Allan Poe's "Murders Of The Rue Morgue."<p>While not a bad yarn and an interesting concept to boot, I find its comparison to a 19th century version of the Marvel Comics heroes to be very derivative.  The action scenes still have that dizzying sound-and-fury effects that's become the norm in today's action movies.<p>One positive thing I see about this movie is that it might get people to read the book from whence these characters came from.  You know, book, n. "a volume made up of written or printed pages fastened along one side and encased between protective covers"?  Yeah, those things!  Overall rating:  3.45 out of 5, rounded to 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Don't quite give up on the comic-books-turned-movies franchises yet. If you're sick of the latest spandex hero fighting the forces of evil, LXG might give you a little refreshment. While deeply flawed in some areas, it's a lot more unique and possibly more entertaining. (Especially if you are a &quot;book&quot; person)<p>It's 1899. A monstrous tank barrels through London and into a bank, where special diagrams are stolen. In Germany, Zeppelins are blown up. The world is on the brink of a widespread war, and a horribly scarred, masked Phantom is the one responsible. So the British government calls on Allen Quatermain (Sean Connery), a reclusive hunter with many amazing adventures behind him, and asks him to help England. He's about to refuse, but a firefight and a bombed-out club change his mind. <p>He arrives in London to join the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a vampire, an invisible thief, Skinner (Tony Curran), and Captain Nemo, a pirate (Naseeruddin Shah). They try to recruit Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), a beautiful and dissolute immortal, but are attacked in his home -- and aided by a young American agent, Tom Sawyer (Shane West). After recruiting Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) and his alter ego Mr. Hyde (also Jason Flemyng), the League is on its way to Venice, to protect an international conference from destruction by the Phantom. But the League soon learns that their situation is much more complex -- and that one of them cannot be trusted.<p>To some degree, this movie is in a &quot;league&quot; of its own. Most comic books center on people given or born with extraordinary powers, but not much else. LXG, instead, focuses on characters who already existed, ranging from the bizarre (Mina the vampire, Dorian Grey) to the obscure (Allen Quatermain -- how many people reading this have read H. Rider Haggard?). As a result, it may be the only truly literary comic book adaptation. It's a motley crew, but somehow they fit. Unfortunately, while the literary references are solid enough, the plot is not really smart -- the good guys are hunting down the bad guy, who is trying to rule the world. It's fun if you switch off your brain and just watch.<p>It can't be denied that the action scenes and fight sequences are amazing. Some of the characters are given more development, like Quatermain, who is still torn up over the loss of his son. For better-known people like Mina Harker (&quot;Dracula&quot;) and Tom Sawyer, not so much introduction is necessary. Not a huge amount of character development, but since these characters are already known to us, they feel good anyway. The identity of the Phantom (another literary character) is a genuine surprise (a good one, too), and the identity of the traitor becomes evident when you think carefully.<p>Among the problems are the special effects -- Hyde's first scene is particularly bad, and some of the transformations are unconvincing. And some of the shots of the Nautilus and the tank (looked like a miniature), not to mention the flaming zeppelins, were very unconvincing. The first shot of the Phantom's fortress is enough to make you groan. That said, the follow-up shots of the fortress are lovely, and the Nautilus is (mostly) enticingly gorgeous and lush. (I want to live on the Nautilus -- that thing is absolutely beautiful)<p>Connery proves that he's still a great presence at 70 plus. (He keeps beating up bad guys, and it never seems improbable) Wilson seems completely befuddled as to how to play Mina; Townsend is deliciously foppish and disdainful; Shah is likably dignified and solid; West is okay, not exceptional but not bad (he's at his best when bonding with Connery); Jason Flemyng is excellent as either incarnation of Jekyll/Hyde, switching between savagery and torment. And Curran steals every scene he's in -- or isn't in. Even though he's only a voice half the time, he's hilarious. (One of the funniest scenes is when Quatermain kicks the invisible Skinner out of his office)<p>Despite the respectable and brainy background of these characters, LXG isn't a smart movie. It's not really dumb either. Consider it a James Bond movie if you took out Bond and populated it with classic characters. Amusing for fans of classic fantasy/scifi/horror, and an entertaining action flick overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Having not been too impressed by the comic book series on which this was based, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but this adventure-fantasy filled with 19th century literary characters turned out to be an entertaining couple of hours. Bring together Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), the Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, Nina Harker (a vampire), Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll (and, of course, Mr. Hyde), and an American referred to only as "Agent Sawyer," and put them under the direction of a government figure called "M," and you have a formidable force for saving the world. And the world certainly needs saving, or at least Venice and parts of Africa. There are numerous sly references to other books and films, from Moby-Dick to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Okay, the acting wasn't top-notch (not even Connery, who didn't seem to be enjoying himself much), but the visuals were great (especially the Nautilus) and the plot was pall-mall. Not Shakespeare, but not bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>The heroes of classic 19th century literature come to life in this action-packed adventure film.<br /><br />The year is 1899 and a villan known only as "The Fantom" wishes to launch global armageddon.  He has developed an armored tank impervious to any other weapon, smashed into a London bank, and captured blueprints for the city of Venice.  He wishes to destroy the city and the leaders of Europe who will be attending a conference hosted by the city.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a gentleman known as M (Richard Roxburgh) has recruited a group of legendary superheroes, including adventurer Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), invisible man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), submarine commander Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), and Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Fleming) to track down and destroy the mysterious Fantom.<br /><br />After arriving in Venice aboard Nemo's Nautilis, the group finds that the city is literally collapsing in on itself after several underwater bombs were detonated by the Fantom and his thugs.  The adventurers set off after the Fantom, only later to discover the Fantom's shocking identity.  This discovery throws everything into chaos, as the group struggles with what to do next.  Will the gentlemen succeed in saving Venice, or will the Fantom, who's true identity has been revealed, succeed in his devious plan?<br /><br />I thought this was a very good film.  I've always been a big fan of Sean Connery, and he does an excellent job as the legendary Quatermain.  The other actors in the movie give fine performances as well.  The special effects, including the scenes containing Nemo's Nautilis and Harker's menacing vampire bats, are well-done.  The story is good, and it's fun to watch these legendary literary heroes working together.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  The story is good and the acting is excellent.  Watch how the literary heroes of 19th century literature band together to fight evil.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>The great rule of turning a comic book into a movie is this: Thou shalt not change the premise of the story.<br /><br />League of Extraordinary Gentlemen breaks the rule. All the creators of the movie had to do was stick to the source material. They could've had a blast of a movie but no they had to go and make changes....such as adding Tom Sawyer to the mix. This did nothing for the story at all. Mina, an English woman who survived Dracula is turned into Amazonesque woman with what sounds like a Swedish accent. Mina is also a full fledged day walking vampire in the movie. In the book she is not. In the book Mina and Quartermaine (played by the always sexy Sean Connery) are intensely attracted to one another despite their age difference.<br /><br />In the movie Mina is messing around with Dorian Gray who doesn't even appear in the book. The Invisible Man is wildly different from the character in both the comic book and the original novel. Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are, at least, handled  mostly true to the comic book though the movie gives no indication about how Hyde feels about Mina. Captain Nemo, the real hero of the movie is the only character to make the jump from the book to the screen unscathed.<br /><br />I wanted to love this movie. I was certainly pumped up when I sat to down to watch it but the creators blew it. Consign this one to the What Might Have Been File.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Once again we have the temptation to compare the book to the movie, which I will succumb to just a little.  Books and movies are different media, and each brings its own strengths to art.  Such is the case here.  The book was full and lengthy, and while it brought the same breadth of characters, it was able to provide a broader background for each of the characters.  There were some spots where I thought the book was just a bit fuzzy on the plot, but I loved the style.<p>The movie provides more visuals, but with a two-hour length it had to cut back on the length of background for the characters.  The movie glossed over some of the darker aspects of the characters, particular Alan Quatermain, but enhanced others, particular the background of Mina Harker.  The other strange addition was that of the character of Dorian Gray.  I also objected to the change in the invisible man character from the book to the movie.  I much preferred the book's Hawley Griffin as the invisible man versus Rodney Skinner, who supposedly stole the formula.  Griffin was a much stronger, more tormented character, though his characterization would require more film time to establish and would likely have weakened the roles of the primary actors.<p>In terms of characterization, Sean Connery clearly shined as Quatermain, as he always seems to do in every role.  Peta Wilson is excellent as the sultry, dangerous Mina Harker.  Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo returns Nemo to his original characterization by Verne as a Sikh.  Shah's Nemo was a welcome variation to previous Nemos, providing a sense of command, control and honor in comparison to those others who sometimes seemed simpering and typically talked far too much for Verne's Nemo.  The other actors have insufficient screen time to fully flesh out their roles, partially because of the large number of lead characters.<p>The plot itself is a bit of a muddle.  It's difficult to follow the progression and contrivances that lead from point-to-point.  Often the logic is non-existent, and the viewer is left to wonder how they knew they were headed the right direction other than a trite explanation by one of the lead characters.  Had the movie been extended by another 15 or 20 minutes many of the incongruities could have been reduced and the story flow could have been smoothed.  To try to minimize the various confusions: Essentially the story is about a group of sort of good guys out to stop a definite bad guy from conquering the world, except the bad guy has been cleverly manipulating the sort of good guys all along and has a nefarious reason (of course) for doing so.<p>The special effects end up providing much of the focus of the movie in lieu of a more coherent plot.  Some of the special effects are very good, such as the bizarre image of the Nautilus sailing the canals of Venice.  The destruction of Venice by underwater bombs is standard fare by today's standards.  The other special effects vary in their quality and effect on the viewer, but are generally good.  As noted before, the special effects often substitute for plot.<p>Though some of my criticisms are not encouraging, I actually liked the movie.  As a B movie it is okay.  Clearly not in the league of movies such as The Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless a rousing adventure.  In general the movie rates 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the three actors that really made this movie for me:  Connery, Wilson and Shah.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>yep!youve got the invisible man,dr jekyll,tom sawyer,cptn nemo,and sean connery.the team is brought together with some others to stop major evil forces.there are also a vampire chick and a dude who cant die played by johnny depp.its nothing the kids cant handle.if you liked the x-men,youll like this one.the vampire ckicks kinda sexy but shes such a uptight pain in the butt.i think this movie will not get the credit it deserves.id say its sean connerys best film followed by the rock.a sequel could be good also.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>I like movies that involve people with super abilities and supernatural talents.  This movie sort of hit the warm spot in my heart with good entertainment and action at the same time.  It is based on a comic book series but the storyline has been changed and it is based in the late 1800's.  The super heroes are based on the characters developed by H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and many more famous authors so you have a combination of super heroes and villains.  It sort of uses an alternate history where the German soldiers are involved in a series of raids on both British and German facilities.  Someone is trying to start a war between Germany and Britain.  Alan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is reluctantly recruited to help find out what is going on and stop a potential war.<br /><br />A team of super powerful beings are recruited to investigate and solve the mystery.  That is where the real problems begin....<br /><br />This is a high action movie with a lot of good stars and the story line is that the super heroes are supposed to stop the bad guy from conquering the world.  The special effects are pretty good and some of the actors did a very good job in their roles.

Books and movies are different media, and each brings its own strengths to art. Such is the case here. The book was full and lengthy and while it brought the same breadth of characters, it was able to provide a broader background for each of the characters. There were some spots where I thought the book was just a bit fuzzy on the plot, but I loved the style.<br /><br />The movie provides more visuals, but with a two-hour length it had to cut back on the length of background for the characters. The movie glossed over some of the darker aspects of the characters, particular Alan Quatermain, but enhanced others, particular the background of Mina Harker. The other strange addition was that of the character of Dorian Gray. I also objected to the change in the invisible man character from the book to the movie. I much preferred the book's Hawley Griffin as the invisible man versus Rodney Skinner, who supposedly stole the formula. Griffin was a much stronger, more tormented character, though his characterization would require more film time to establish and would likely have weakened the roles of the primary actors.<br /><br />In terms of characterization, Sean Connery clearly shined as Quatermain, as he always seems to do in every role. Peta Wilson is excellent as the sultry, dangerous Mina Harker. Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo returns Nemo to his original characterization by Verne as a Sikh. Shah's Nemo was a welcome variation to previous Nemos, providing a sense of command, control and honor in comparison to those others who sometimes seemed simpering and typically talked far too much for Verne's Nemo. The other actors have insufficient screen time to fully flesh out their roles, partially because of the large number of lead characters.<br /><br />The plot itself is a bit of a muddle. It's difficult to follow the progression and contrivances that lead from point-to-point. Often the logic is non-existent, and the viewer is left to wonder how they knew they were headed the right direction other than a trite explanation by one of the lead characters. Had the movie been extended by another 15 or 20 minutes many of the incongruities could have been reduced and the story flow could have been smoothed. To try to minimize the various confusions: Essentially the story is about a group of sort of good guys out to stop a definite bad guy from conquering the world, except the bad guy has been cleverly manipulating the sort of good guys all along and has a nefarious reason (of course) for doing so.<br /><br />The special effects end up providing much of the focus of the movie in lieu of a more coherent plot. Some of the special effects are very good, such as the bizarre image of the Nautilus sailing the canals of Venice. The destruction of Venice by underwater bombs is mundane by today's standards. The other special effects vary in their quality and effect on the viewer, but are generally good. As noted before, the special effects often substitute for plot.<br /><br />Though some of my criticisms are not encouraging, I actually liked the movie. As a B movie it is okay. Clearly not in the league of movies such as the Lord of the Rings, it is nonetheless a rousing adventure. In general the movie rates 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 stars because of the three actors that really made this movie for me: Connery, Wilson and Shah.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...and having rented it once before I have no good explanation for it! This is all effects, and a "flatline" script. And not something Connery should waste his talent on. After all, I do miss a good, new classic from him now not having seen him in a in a good picture since perhaps The Rock, that movie was ok.<br /><br />If you didn't like Van Helsing, I know I didn't - then stay away! All these different famous characters (Mina, Dr.Jekyll, Captain Nemo and more) who appears in the movie simply don't belong together in the same story. And I realize that this is an adventure-movie, fiction, and a bit wild imagination - that I in fact do believe a have a doze of myself, but the story of the movie somehow doesn't fit anywhere, wether it's on screen or paper. This is a technical overdoze, and I agree with one of the reviewers below who didn't like what the moviemakers have done with The Nautilius (spelled correct here?).<br /><br />Some movies should just not have been made...</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>When I first heard that they were doing a film adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I was very excited at the prospect. Alan Moore's alternate historical tale of late 19th-century literary characters of Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Allan Quatermain, Invisible Man and Mr. Hyde was well-received by both critics and fans of comics. This story was one of those kinds that just begged to be made into a film and I remember many discussions with other fans of who exactly should play the characters from the book. This property was one of those can't-miss. But too much tinkering with Moore's story, characters and overall themes made too much of a mess of a film.<br /><br />I'll start by admitting that I enjoyed the film enough. The film had enough action sequences to keep my attention. The story was fun enough to follow, albeit confusing since I was expecting something else on the screen after I'd read the graphic novel prior to seeing the film. The special-effects work were done well enough, though a few shots here and there looked to much like CGI. LXG looked good overall, but it wasn't the League that Moore created that I so enjoyed reading. As I said earlier, too much tinkering by the producers, director and writers from the original source material made what was an ok, fun film experience into something even better.<br /><br />The film that I saw was so different from the book that it should've been called something else. Characters were added that were never in the book. Usually such film adaptations of comic books make such changes, but in LXG they made major character additions that changed the entire dynamics of the team and those they were were up against. Some characters from the book that had pivotal supporting roles were removed outright. By the time all the changes were done the film and the book were two separately, distinct works that only had certain characters in common and that was it.<br /><br />In the end, as a big fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel I was disappointed to no end. I still enjoyed the film once I realized that I wasn't seeing the book come to life but watching a wholly different animal. LXG (as the studio sometimes marketed the film as) is an ok enough film even fun if one was into such types of entertainment, but it could've been better and it should've been. I can understand now why Alan Moore wanted his name removed from the credits and why he doesn't want his name included in anymore film adaptations of his other published works.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be. Even the retro Victorian look seems uninspired. Overall, a huge disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>With the majority so far here...this picture, panned almost to a man by the critics, was actually as enjoyable as I thought it would be before I started hearing the avalanche of negative reviews. Why did they hate this film so much?! It has NON-stop action, great art direction, good casting, (I am in love with Peta WIlson!) a nice, world-threatening plot, (probably yet another nod to Connery,) and passable special effects.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the obvious hand that Marvel may have had in it...the whole movie reminds me an AWFUL lot of "Van Helsing",  what with Mr. Hyde having a prominent part in it, on top of the presence of Richard Roxburgh, who played Dracula in that movie. "Van Helsing" also, in turn, bore a strong resemblance to "X-2, X-Men United". CGI effects are also a lot more obvious in Marvel's movies than they are in anybody else's, and they are here...THAT could have been a put-off...but for me, the not-so-great CGI was hidden well enough by shadows so that it wasn't as bad as it was in "The Hulk" or "Spiderman".<br /><br />The group consists of: Allen Quartermain, (Connery...glad they didn't pick Richard Chamberlain,) Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, (wait 'til you see the Nautilus...WOW!) and a persona de femme from "Dracula", Mina Harker, played by Ms. Wilson. Dorian Grey is along for the ride, too, but how much can you trust a character made up by Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />It's great seeing Connery slug a villain and making it stick, at his age...(he's 77 now, can you believe it?) and Peta Wilson...YES!! Love that accent, love that stature, love that improvement-on-Julie-Christie thing she's got going for her....Love that car, too...I'll bet you anything either Panther Westwinds or Sbarro had something to do with that beast! That looked like a Lancia grille, too!<br /><br />Anyway, there is, indeed, non-stop action! You really do root for the good guys, especially after it's revealed that the group's being conned by a surprising source, and just marvelling at the great sets and cinematography used in the film is a kick. I highly recommend this underrated little film, one that the critics made look much worse than it is!</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  For me the movie didn't really start to be fun until after the Venice thingy.  I didn't quite understand what that whole thing was about and then sighed with relief when that plot line turned out to be a ruse.  I thought there was an interesting assembly of characters set in a Victorian age and I agree Dorian Gray stood out in his performance.  I can't quite put my finger on what this film is missing, but I do know that it's missing something.  Maybe a better explantion of bringing this assembly of people together in the first place when they, quite frankly, didn't have you in their radar to begin with.  Couldn't he go about gathering what he needed from them without all this elaborate drama?

Where else  could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie?  About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors.  The only real drawback is the length.  About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.<br /><br />All in all, a good popcorn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>At first when I saw this movie I thought nothing of it and dismissed it as nothing but somebody blending X-Men , The Incredible Hulk , and Mythical Creatures.... but after learning that this is a bunch of different storys of legends of the old fiction world I gave it one more go, and it seemed better the second time around!<p>A war has broken out during 1899? and the man behind it is a villian who calls himself &quot;the Fantom&quot; who really does all the worst acting of the film!

The fight scenes are too many and the stunt doubles can be too easily spotted for Connery and Naseerudin Shah ("Nemo"). <p>The final battle between Mr. Hyde and a similar incarnation is almost laughable.

The movie attempts to show how secret forces operated behind the creation of the Twentieth Century and the world wars during that century.  At the end of the movie, the character representing the British empire played by Sean Connery, Alan Quartermain, remarks that as the Nineteenth Century belonged to him so the Twentieth will belong to the young American boy, &quot;Sawyer&quot;.  Thus, we see how the British empire has faded and the rise of the American superpower brought about through the First and Second World Wars.  The movie unfortunately isn't able to fully show the detail of this interpretation.  I enjoyed this movie and it raised for me many questions about the role of secret forces influencing the birth of the Twentieth Century.  When the League is initiated we see a masonic symbol on the door to the hall where the League has its first meeting.  Perhaps this indicates that the masonic societies have played a role in initiating wars and revolutions.  Now, that the ultra-violent Twentieth Century has come to pass and man faces a new millenium one can only begin to ask what the future will bring.</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>During the summer of 2003, there were three movies in particular I was looking forward to: Terminator 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (hereto referred as LXG). The latter two, in particular, as both would be released in the same week and, from what I gathered in their respective trailers, harkened to the summer blockbuster I enjoy the most, the "Spielbergian" adventure. <p>By that, I mean the grand escapism that was virtually created by Raiders of the Lost Ark, later to be surpassed only by its second sequel, The Last Crusade. As of right now, none of the Jones flicks have ever been matched in sheer exhilaration. I look upon the trilogy as the three greatest and most purely enjoyable action movies ever made. Pirates and LXG both seemed to be striving for the same sense of fun, and I watched the former film first, left bitterly disappointed (though it's not a bad movie and it's one I'll probably give another look), then decided for some down time before I'd see LXG, much of that having to do with the dreadful reviews it'd been receiving from even typically "lenient" critics (Berge Garabedian, AKA Joblo, gave it a 4/10).<p>Having just seen it, I found myself surprised by some aspects and not so surprised by others. It's got a totally unspectacular story, sort of a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to start a world war so he can reap the profits. Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is brought in to form an "extraordinary" team of unique individuals to stop the villain. Among the league include Tom Sawyer, the Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray, the latter of whom being the only literary character I'm entirely unfamiliar with. <p>LXG grossed just a little under 70 million dollars, and while not entirely a paltry sum, it's a lot less than I was expecting, even if the movie was as bad as most critics made it out to be. The trailers and concept, after all, wisely appealed to two crowds, Indiana Jones-style adventure lovers and superhero/comic book fans. I'm thinking, perhaps, the Indy crowd was turned off by the teamwork and special powers while the superhero crowd probably preferred their heroes more modern, or less "literature-ish." <p>Whatever the reason, I'm sure LXG is still destined for a reasonably-sized fanbase in the years to come, whether or not it's actually deserving of it. When all is said and done, LXG is nothing more than a ludicrous movie that entertained me somewhat for the duration of its fairly short running time (which I'm a bit thankful for, after sitting through the bloated Pirates of the Caribbean). Though I realize the movie has its roots and origins in a comic book, there's a lot here that's difficult to swallow. Too much, in fact, but I'll give a few examples.<p>For one, when it's discovered who the traitor is (spoiler warning), and it turns out it's the guy who formed the League in the first place, his reasons behind his actions make no sense. He claims he created the group so that he could steal their powers, but with the "spy" he had working for him, he could just as easily have accomplished his task without forming the league. Captain Nemo's submarine varies in size the same way Godzilla did, and the sub even manages to squeeze into the Venice canal. Connery's Quatermain is in amazingly great shape for a man of his age, able to leap off a moving car with no repercussions (and lands on his two feet without a hitch, no less!). Mina Harker, a vampire, is able to walk around in broad daylight.<p>I realize these kinds of movies are made for pure, unpretentious fun, and LXG at least has the action and f/x to back it up. The film is packed to the brim with gun battles and all-out brawls, and despite way too much rapid cutting from director Stephen Norrington, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch, if never truly rousing in the same fashion all the action from the Indiana Jones trilogy was. I was also impressed by a lot of the visual effects, particularly the Mr. Hyde creation, which is as at least as convincing as the Hulk.<p>Unfortunately, the cast mostly failed to impress me, probably the movie's damning fault. While Sean Connery is every bit as charismatic as ever, everyone else is clearly under his shadow. Only Shane West as the cocky, but likeable Tom Sawyer and Jason Flemying as Jekyll hold their own. Peta Wilson's Mina Harker is uninteresting, Stuart Townsend is what Johnny Depp would be if he were a bland actor (though, to be fair, Depp is a vanilla plain performer when he's playing non-eccentric roles), and Tony Curran's only noteworthy for sounding exactly like Jason Statham.<p>I suppose, in the end, LXG is a reasonably fun, but singularly idiotic experience. With a better script, this could have been an adventure movie for the ages, not just a middling timewaster. As of now, I'm still hoping for the best from the soon-to-be fourth Indiana Jones film, which could bring the movie that brings that grand escapist Saturday Matinee style serial back into fashion.<br />** 1/2 out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This Movie is awesome.

When he finally arrives in London he finds that his fellow squad members are each gifted with unique talents.....and even darker secrets.  Reading like a Who's Who of 19th Century literature, Quartermain must deal with characters ranging from the never-aging Dorian Gray to the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  Given the unstable personalities, can this squad complete its mission...or will they turn on each other?  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN takes this conceit and crafts a flick that, while short on depth, provides a non-stop ride of action and thrills.  Based on the now-classic comic book series by Alan Moore,  the film is wonderfully mounted and harkens back to the old days of 19th Century thrillers. The movie moves at a good clip and never drags as events move along.  Also, the special effects are very solid, with Captain Nemo's famous sub, the Nautilus, being the most impressive. By now, Sean Connery is an old hand at this types of roles, and he brings a delightful crustiness as the aging Quatermain. Stuart Townsend is delightfully snide as Dorian Gray, while Peta Wilson smolders with sexuality as the vampiric Mina Harker (the heroine from Bram Stoker's "Dracula.")  Naseerruddin Shah is stern and stalwart as the legendary Captain Nemo.<br />However, the movie isn't without its flaws.  Fans of the comics may find themselves disappointed, since the film substitiues a new plot for the comic's and only Shah's Nemo is true to the source.  Also, aside from Connery and Shah, the characters are pretty much one-demensional.  Indeed, the movie assumes that you already know the back stories of these characters.  As a result, if you haven't read the comics or the novels in which these characters appeared, you'd be at a disadvantage. Also, when Quartermain deduces the identity of the real villian near the end of the film, there's no real indication of where he got the knowledge.<br />Overall, though, LEAGUE is a solid film that will appeal to the action-lover who takes his English lit with a sense of fun, and it's worth recommending if you have the right frame of mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>Q:  What do you get when you create a story based on teaming up the combined talents of heroes born of many of the world's most famous literary classics of the past, including H Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines, Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea, H.G. Wells' The Invisible Man, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, Robert Louise Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick?<br /><br />A:  A ripping good yarn. But you also inherit a minefield by borrowing from so many loved literary classics.<br /><br />A ripping good yarn is the way that the big-budget, popcorn action film The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen should be approached. It is a highly entertaining, rip-roaring tale exploring the fantasy of what might have been possible had all these extraordinary fictional characters been able to team up for a common purpose. The thought that these characters were originally created of completely different time periods and not of the same collective fictional universe should be left behind. This film is not meant to be taken too seriously - it is purely and simply a bit of fun. Unfortunately though, many critics have panned the film outright by seizing on numerous inconsistencies in the portrayal of these classic literary characters as not being completely authentic to their original authors. I can appreciate from a literary sense where these critics are coming from and can understand why this film irks those who love the classics. But still, one should hardly expect that a story idea based on bringing together such a highly fanciful collaboration of all these characters will result in anything other than an excuse to have a bit of fun. Viewed with this overriding goal in mind, once you allow your criticism of minor inconsistencies of the character portrayals to be suspended, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen delivers on the fun scale in spades.<br /><br />The fun thing about this film is that you don't have to have read all of these literary classic to enjoy the movie. There are many "in-references" inserted throughout to cater for those who have an appreciation of the abovementioned novels and others including the works of Ian Fleming and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but certainly the movie can be appreciated as a stand-alone experience even if you only know some or few of these works. As an aside, the fact that the film tries to be rather cute in playing to the intelligentsia of its audience with its many deliberate "in-references" is only problematic, given that those same audience members to whom such references are aimed will also by corollary tend to be the same people who care enough about the classics to highlight the resultant inconsistencies in the character treatments. I think this, more than any other reason, is ultimately why The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen failed to impress the critics more than it did; you simply can't have your cake and eat it too.<br /><br />The storyline is very well thought-out, if not arguably a bit too rushed for my liking, with a large amount of story and action crammed into a 110 minute film. The plot is premised around cramming in as much action into the story as possible, with every hero given a chance to shine in their turn. This is also a big-budget action film, so the production values are high, particularly in aspects such as the attention to detail in the character costumes. The special effects are also, for the most part, great - it's just a pity that only one or two dodgy effects shots stand out to prove an exception to a great job (these one or two shots being suboptimal only due to the lack of time available to complete them before the theatrical release date (the usual story)). The acting in this film is certainly rock solid, and this is particularly the case - yet again - with Sean Connery. Can this man do nothing wrong in the acting stakes? I don't think I have ever seen him deliver a poor performance. This view has been stated a million times before me by a million other film reviewers, but I agree that Sean Connery really is one of, if not the, most arresting and most charismatic screen personalities of our time. With all of these positives going for it then, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a highly entertaining action flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>This film is an absolute mess.

Granted, I can see why some women find Stuart Townsend pretty, but every role he's in seems to place a rather smug "Gosh, I know I'm beautiful" look on his face.  I mean, Dorian Gray...an IMMORTAL?  Please.<p>Mina-the occasional vampire lady-seems on the verge of evoking some sort of emotion, but just can't get past the costume.  One laughably memorable moment is where she looks frightened in the car as Dorian jumps off to supposedly attack some bad guys.  A few seconds later, she positively growls something to the effect of, "These men are mine!" whilst launching herself into attack.  Fear...anger...whatever.  It's in the script, right?<p>Jekyll/Hyde...I won't even go there.  And the Invisible Man was too smarmy for my taste.<p>Despite the lack of talent, there may have been some room for good story, character development, etc., but there's nothing there either.  The evil Phantom wants to take over the world, or some foolish nonsense of the sort, and there are plot twists and double-crosses that perhaps an 8-year old might be taken aback with a childish, "I didn't see that coming, Daddy!"  Funny, the rest of the adult audience could see a lot of this nonsense straight off the bat.<p>One prime example of where character development fails centers around the loss of Sean Connery's son in the film, but even the Phantom's taunting doesn't even get a rise out of him.  The American who is oh-so-obviously-a-detached-replacement-of-a-son hardly conjures any tears, sympathy, or any emotive response for that matter.<p>Effects.

If it's based on a comic book it's going to be big, loud, dumb and ridiculous. If you don't go into "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" expecting Oscar-caliber work you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1899. Characters that we know from the literature of the times are assembled as the League: Alan Quartermain, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Dina Harker from Dracula. They are asked to work together to stop a man called The Phantom who is amassing a huge army and futuristic weapons to take over the world. You don't need to know much more because in the end it doesn't make any sense anyway. But why should it, it's source material is a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced with some good special effects and well staged action scenes. There are also some bad effects and poorly staged action scenes, cliches aplenty and some dreadful dialog. I didn't take any of it too seriously and found myself enjoying the movie quite a bit. If you absolutely can't stand people with automatic weapons shooting at point blank range and not hitting anything or effects so overblown you can't believe them, this isn't the movie for you. On the other hand, if you can suspend your disbelief and just politely shake your head at some of the more ridiculous scenes, I would recommend "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."</p></br><a href="../users/A258MSMKY2710V.html">A258MSMKY2710V</a><br/><p>there was some decent action. the sets also looked pretty good. the dialog was really stupid. connery's character said that the american way was to shoot a lot of bullits without aiming, but with five round clips if you were lucky, firing indescriminantly wasn't an option in the beggining of the 19 hundreds. and he forgot that sharpshooters were a big reason that america kicked his country's a$$ and became a country.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>The LXG is a fun popcorn flick. I have read the graphic novel and found that the only real similarities are the characters. The movie is fun and enjoyable. Someone said this is a family flick? Ummm, no. Unless everyone in the house is 13 or older. Don't expect to much and you will have a blast!<br /><br />NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: It looks better and sounds better! However, they did not carry over any of the special features or very few of them. Only worth an upgrade to the hardcore fan. FINAL VERDICT: NOT UPGRADE WORTHY.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen brings to the screen the story of an unlikely group of people that have banded together in order to put an end to a criminal mind's schemes bent on plunging the world in total war so that he may profit from increased arms sales.<br />The year is 1899 and the British government has called upon hunter Allan Quatermain to join a band of 19th century superheroes in preventing the Fantom from destroying the world.  The Fantom, however, begs to differ...<br />There are hints of James Bond, Dracula, Van Helsing, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde among others so the movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.<br />Sean Connery and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills.<br />The setting, the plot, the special effects (!), the music, and the costumes are all good.<br />The only major setback was in relation to Tom Sawyer (?), who seemed totally out of place among the rest, and who probably was incorporated for the sake of including an American hero.<br />In short, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.<br />BRING ON THE SEQUEL!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This film will be nominated for worst picture of the year.  I put this in my DVD player with all the negative critical reviews in mind, thinking I would then enjoy it more if I didn't expect too much.  No, sorry, this movie is poorly made comic book tripe.  The special effects are incredibly poor, looking more like video game nonsense than a big budget extravaganza.  When the Nautilus first rises and we are all supposed to be in awe of its immense size and grandeur, it looks more like a shiny toy on a blue screen.  Then there are the characters.  While I at first felt a kind of nostalgia at seeing the Insvisible Man, Dorian Gray, and Mina Harker from Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula,&quot; that feeling soon wore off and I was left with a motley cast spewing out one-liners and dumb babble.  Captain Nemo entering the picture was my first indication of downhill progress.  He looks and acts monumentally stupid, and is somehow able to perform martial arts like Jackie Chan.  Mr. Hyde is another poor creation, with obvious makeup effects and bad dialogue.  There are many plot flaws here, as well. The Nautilus, this huge vessel when first revealed, is then able to shrink in size and then traverse the narrow canals of Venice?  Mina Harker, a vampire, is standing in the daylight at the end of the film?  There were other scenes that were plugged in for time consumption.  One example is when Allan Quartermain is atop the Nautilus firing at red buoys being launched by Captain Nemo.  If there was ever a scene that needed to be cut, this was it.  The special effects are not special; the acting is okay in moments, but poor overall.  This is a really bad movie in virtually every way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>With Sean Connery appearing in roughly one film per two years, one would think he has the time, or at least would take an interest in choosing quality work. But alas, we are subjected to "The Avengers," one of - if not the - worst film of the decade...and now...this? Hardly a bad motion picture, but then again, hardly an Academy Award Winner.<p>Believability isn't this film's strongest trait. I came close to recommending it a few times - I really did; I wanted to - but there was a particular scene involving a car chase through the streets of Venice (streets that, like the film critic Roger Ebert stated, do not even exist) that literally insulted my intelligence - at least, what little intelligence I have. I may not be the smartest person but by George I think that a bit more confidence in the audience's knowledge is in store. <p>Keep in mind that the year is 1899 - automobiles have hardly been invented - yet we are shown one zipping around at not 100 miles per hour, through streets that never - and don't - exist, past guards who can't seem to be able to shoot a cat off a flea's back at two yards, and through pillars and windy little crevices and who knows what else; and all the while this vehicle is being driven by a young American not twenty-four years old. I'm the last person to complain about believability - but this even pushed it for me. And I'm the guy who recommended "Commando."<p>Ah, yes, there is a plot behind this mess, but not a very smart one at all. Sean Connery plays Allan Quartermain. With the intended audience of this film obviously being little kids and rednecks living in their parents' basement in Louisiana with fourth grade educations (you know who you are), perhaps the filmmakers thought that they could dupe everyone into believing that Allan Quartermain is responsible in part for the creation of the quarter. Heck, for the heck of it, let's just say he is - we can't screw up facts any more than they already are!<p>Quartermain is like the father of Indiana Jones - oh, wait, didn't Connery play that part already? He's a legendary adventurer responsible for renowned events around the world - events never ventured into whatsoever. An emissary from England mentions he is the role model for all little boys and the focus of all their stories. Perhaps he meant to say the laughing stock. Who knows?  <p>No, seriously, Quartermain has been invited to join "The League of Extraordinary Gentleman," a league of gentlemen with extraordinary powers - ironically one is a woman. Perhaps a more appropriate - and yes, more marketable - title would have been "The League of Extraordinary People Which May or May Not Include Hot Women." It sure would be more marketable to the male teenagers out there, wouldn't it?<p>Also in the team are such daring and wonderful characters as Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah - say it ten times fast), a retired pirate; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), a she-vampire; Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), a British pickpocket with an obviously low IQ but yet a man who managed to dabble in invisibility, hardly an easy subject for those with simple minds, with strange results; Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), who you may remember is the man who remained at ease with his conscience through incidents relating to a portrait of his soul; Tom Sawyer (Shane West), one of them thar' American folk; and last, but certainly not least in terms of mass, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng and The Incredible Hulk), who bears a striking resemblance to both The Hulk and the nightclub gorilla from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" (1988) when morphed.<p>There are a lot of mistakes in "The League of Extraordinary Gentleman," and not all of them have to do with geographical or factual errors. First of all, the characters from classic fiction are totally f****ed up. Since when was Dorian Gray invincible? In one scene he comes up with bullet holes through his body and he never even flinches. As far as I knew his mind was at rest with his actions in Oscar Wilde's classic tale, and his age remained permanent, but he was hardly ever indestructible; and the thing that got me the most was Mr. Hyde. Having read Robert Louis Stevenson's truly wonderful tale, I felt cheated by the character shown here - he looked like Shrek and a giant gorilla's offspring. Only uglier. I always got the idea from Stevenson's text that Mr. Hyde was a bit of a shy, awkward, short character who lurked in the shadows and had a disfigured face - this Mr. Hyde is just another special effects extravaganza who gets to wipe out hoards of enemy soldiers like bowling pins with one mighty swing of a forearm. And since when did he get to choose when he wanted to turn back into Dr. Jekyll? I always assumed it happened involuntarily...<p>To be honest, this isn't a terribly bad film, but there are a few low-points that, if they were combined together without the stretches of "okay-ness" in between, would result in one of the most horrific films of the last two decades. The movie insulted my intelligence many times, particularly with the Venice car chase, which played out more like a testosterone junkie's videogame dream rather than anything more intelligent. And then there are the disgraceful reinventions of some of the most beloved of all characters.<p>"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" boasts some extraordinary visual effects, but the rest of the film is anything but extraordinary. And I really felt cheated when I realized that Mr. Hyde was a big Hulk who could change back and forth voluntarily just like the former rather than being the darker, more disfigured character Stevenson envisioned. Some day they should get a good modern remake of the book with just enough visual effects to make him look terrifying but still somewhat human. In the meantime, the director of "The Extraordinary League of Gentlemen," Stephen Norrington, may soon be receiving a phone call from Stan Lee.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>Being a fan of the graphic novels I was not really eager to watch this film, scared about how badly they would wreck it.  But in the end it was a delight.  I enjoyed how they brought in each character, how they set up the plot, how they carefully set up the foundation to make it easy to move right into the action and adventure of the latter parts of the film.<br /><br />I wish they had kept some of the deleted scenes in the film, because some of them were important, linking one scene to another, but in the end the film was a good one.  The extras in the DVD, from the behind-the-scenes documentary and audio commentaries, really add to the DVD.<br /><br />Something to add to your DVD library if you are a fan of the old novels, with such super-stars like the great white hunter, Allan Quatermain, the sub captain, Captain Nemo, and that great scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie, remember that the graphic novels are available.  The movie is based on the first volume, but there are TWO out at the time of this review.  Great books.<br /><br />Evil thugs, explosions and lots of dark city streets that all look alike.  Have fun!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I love action movies, particularly fantasy/Sci-fi action.  Given this, I certainly have no problem setting aside reality for a while and getting lost in a good bit of fantasy.  I had sean some not-so-positive reviews of this film, so I lowered my expectations and hope for some fun excitement.  Oh, there was plenty of excitement.  However, there were so many dumb "flaws" in this film that it sort of sucked the fun out of it.  Let's review;<p>THE GOOD<p>-Special FX were very entertaining.  Hyde transformation was intense.<br />-Mr. Hyde was, by far, the most entertaining character in the film.<br />-The basic story was ok.  Adequate for an action film.<br />-Acting is passible. No glaring weeknesses here.<br />-CHaracter development was as good as could be expected for such a large ensamble.<br />-Music was really not a factor.  Didn't add or detract.<p>THE BAD<p>-A 400 foot long, 80 ft tall submarine would not fit in the canals of Venice let alone be able to make any turns.<br />-The entire city of Venice is not built on stilts.  Venice is a series of marshy islands.  The buildings are mostly 3 stories tall and anchored into the ground.  Placing bombs under the city as shown is not possible.  To sink such a large part of Venice would require the removal of the Islands.  Yea, right!!<br />-England and Germanys respective militaries did not have steel helmets in 1899.  These were developed during WWI (1918 ish).<br />-Nemos car is too 1930s.  As an industrial designer, I can tell you that the probability of someone developing a car of that style in 1899 just wouldn't happpen, not even a forward thinking guy like Nemo.  Car styling is evolutionary not revolutionary (dispite what the car makers tell you).<br />-GPS (global positioning system) in 1899?  COME ON!!!<br />-Invisible man survives siberian wilderness in winter and running out of a room after being flame-throwered...  WHILE NUDE!?!?!<br />-When the HQ of the LXG is first shown, Paintings of past "leagues" hang on the wall.  Later, the head of LXG tells the heros it was all a lie.  Were the paintings really necessary?  If this was the real HQ, who was running the show?  <p>-Plot has 9 bizillion holes in it.  Too difficult to trace them all.<br /> <p>I'm sure I'm missing a few things.  Some of this may seam nit-picky to some of you.  Just keep in mind that the film maker's responsibility is to make me believe that this fantasy is real (even if in a different world).  But you just can't ignore history or technological probability.  So much reality was suspended to make the story work that it falls into the realm of the rediculous!  It seams to me that the writers never researched anything!!!  They just did what ever would "look cool".  A good sci-fi or fantasy takes responsibility for making the viewer buy into the events that are happening on the screen.  LXG failed in it's responsibility to depict the year 1899, known architecture, and the laws of physics accurately.  Because of this, The longer I viewed the movie, the less I believed anything that was going on.  B.T.W.  I've never read the comic.  Perhaps it too is as rediculous as this movie, in which case they were trying to be honorable to the books.  Still makes for a rediculous film.  Curb your curiosity, wait and rent.  Save some money.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>Half of a city is bombed to rubble, but Connery and his sidekicks escape without a scratch. They use swords and furniture as weapons to defeat men armed with fully automatic guns. Mr Hyde has the ability to become a Hulk like muscular monster.<p>Plus many more &quot;extraordinary&quot;(illogical) scenes.<p>Don't be fooled by the strong ads relating this to the movie Blade. There is absolutely no comparison between the 2 movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>I wish those ... Hollywood executives would stop mangling comic strips into movies.  With a few rare exceptions, it doesn't work.  Comics are a medium that can make extremely illogical scenes seem plausible, whereas film can take that same scene and render it ridiculous.  Consider these examples from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen:<p>? The League is introduced to the Nautilus, a prototype Submarine.  It's roughly the size of the Titanic with sexy lines rivaling anything modern, with speed and maneuvering capabilities to match.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be @ 1899.<br />? Oops, somebody took a high-performance sports car and tacked a body shell over it to resemble a Victorian land yacht.  That's the vehicle our heroes are jerking around through the streets of Venice on a chase scene.  Is it still 1899?<br />? In his over-the-top "Darth Vader meets Colonel Klink" getup, the villain just looks like he stepped out of a comic book.  Since this is a film, he shouldn't.<br />? Captive scientists in the villain's lair are performing genetic manipulations such as cloning with samples from our heroes.  Uhhhh....<br />? There's much more, but I think your intelligence was insulted enough with those.<p>A few words about the plot:  a motley assortment of people from around the world with extraordinary abilities are called to help Britannia foil an evil plot to start World War 1.  These include fictional literary characters like Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo, as well as a few made-ups.  An interesting set up with lots of potential that just didn't get explored enough IMHO.  However, because of the above-mentioned problems with translating this to a film that was, oddly enough, marketed toward teens and adults sophisticated enough to sneer at it, this concept just seemed stupid.<p>Some nice things can be said about this movie.  The cast was well-chosen for their character roles, and do reasonably good jobs.  Visually, TLOEG was a wonderful rendition of a Victorian world made fantastic.  The special effects and art direction at least deserve nominations.  But that, my friends, is IT.<p>Rent TLOEG if you're into the comic series, just so you can see how our modern special effects technology did justice to it.  But remember to keep the volume turned off to avoid brain cramp.<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Ok this isn't a great movie but I found it to be a lot of fun. I don't know why so many people hate it. It has it's flaws yes but I still don't see it as a one star movie. The end makes no sense and it's also dumb that there's a female vampire that seems to be able to be out in the sun. I mean if you're gonna have a vampire in a movie you should go by the rules, they can't be out in sun light. <p>  Still for someone who is a big fan of classic books I found it fun to have all these classic characters together. The movie is brainless but brainless fun, I see no reason to really hate it. Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned) is the best thing about the movie as Dorian Grey.  He has the best lines and he has fun in the part as well. The movie has been compared to bad summer movies like Batman & Robin and Wild Wild West but it's a lot better then those. I didn't expect much and I was surprised how much I got into the movie. If you give it a fair chance who knows maybe you'll like it too.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>You know, I kind of do feel confused that a lot of people disslike this movie. I, on the contrary, thought that is was a fun ride with some great characters and awesome action scenes.<br /><br />The movie is kind of like X-Men even though I have to say that  preferred X-Men and X-2 over this. But, this could be compared to them because it has numerous heroes and not just one like in Spiderman or Batman. The movie has these heroes that gather: Alan Quartermain played by Sean Connery as a skilled hunter, the invisible man who is..invisible, Captain Nemo who's got some big swords and a BIG ship, Dorian Gray who's skilled and yes.. invincible, Dr. Jekyll/ Hyde who's at times skinny and punny and at times absolutely gigantic and monstruous, Tom Sawyer and Mina Harker, a vampire. So, now that the gang's all here, they've got to stop a madman.<br /><br />The movie's plot is simple but the movie has some awesome action scenes and good special effects. If you liked Hellboy, Spiderman and X-Men, I'm sure you'll like this, just not as much as the other superhero movies. It's definitely worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Theatrical adaptations of famous comic books are becoming the new trend these days in Hollywood. The major studios are digging out every comic book superhero imaginable even the lesser known ones and so far the films have been successful. So it isn?t surprising that 20th Century is stepping up to the plate for the third time this year. Daredevil was a moderate success garnering $100 million against a $75 million budget and X2: X-Men United kicked off the summer season with a bang gathering $210 million against a $100 million budget. Fox is hoping that The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be just as successful but it will be a hard sell. The League is a much lesser known comic book mini-series then big profiles superheroes like Spider-Man or X-Men, so there won?t be as big of a fan base to rely on. Another problem is the now blatant fact that not all comic-book adaptations take with movie-goers. Though The Hulk?s opening weekend became the highest grossing opening weekend ever for the month of June, the film itself was received poorly by both the critics and the general public and experienced a nearly seventy percent drop in its second weekend. Rumors of fights breaking out between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington helped generate bad buzz for the film. and the lackluster advertising campaign for the film have not helped in the studio?s efforts to create substantial buzz going for this feature.<br /><br />The story centers on the formation of a team of extraordinary individuals that must fight an evil man who has plans for the world. During the year 1899, an evil individual by the name of The Fanthom has gone around the world capturing scientists and causes major catastrophes in order to have the European countries blame each other. This, he hopes, will cause the countries to create a world war and with his advanced military weapons, the European countries will have to buy from him creating a huge profit for himself. The British Empire, determined to avert a world war, calls upon a man named ?M? to assemble The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Allan Quartermain, the hero of such tales as King Solomon?s Mines, is chosen to lead the team. Other members of the team include Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Mina Harker (Vampire), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll, and Dorian Grey, each of which holds a special ability unique to the team. Joining along for the ride is Agent Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) from the United States. Each individual seems to have a hidden secret and don?t get along with each other but they must put their scrabbles aside in order to save the world from the brink of war. The story for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen gets off to a good start and ends fairly well but sequences in between seem to drag the entire picture down, making it the entire experience seem worse then it actually was. The dialogue stays on the serious side which works for it but when it begins to slip into a more comical form, the quality of the picture is lost. Those not familiar with the famous literary characters involved in the film may be confused with the lack of background information given on many of them but perhaps that just means you need to bone up on your reading skills.<br /><br />If you looking for extraordinary acting and premium star power, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is definitely not your film, but most people, those with a brain, will know that going into this film. Sean Connery lights up the screen in the role of Allan Quartermain and feels appropriately cast as a man who continues to do the job he has been doing for many years despite his increasing age. There were consistent rumors from the set that Connery and director Norrington were at each other?s necks throughout the shoot but there is no evidence to say those fights affected his performance from what is shown in the film. Tony Curran, who plays the role of The Invisible Man, does as best of a job as he can but this character has its share of problems. The Invisible Man seems to be nothing more then a comedic special effects diversion and seems to just plain disappear (no pun intended) for a good portion of the movie with no explanation as to why he left or how he came to a particular place. Jason Flemying does his best with the role of Dr. Jekyll, which is pretty good for the most part, but his character is also a special effect diversion when he becomes Mr. Hyde. Shane West is great as Agent Sawyer, though the film could have done a better job explaining how this care free boy from Mississippi came to be in the secret service but that is a minor squabble. Peta Wilson, who is best known from La Femme Nikita fame, does what she can with the role of Mina Harker but there are too many questions and not enough answers, a constant theme in this film. What is the deal with her and Dorian Grey? And speaking of Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend is horribly miscast in this role and the character itself is predictable and uninteresting.<br /><br />Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen make come as a disappointment to the average moviegoer, one who isn?t a comic-book fanatic or literary wizard, but even for those select few who are this film may still be a little tough to swallow. Specific background information on many of the film?s primary characters is missing which leaves most of the audience struggling to figure out where they are coming from and how that helps play out the film?s ending. The League?s special effects are difficult to put on a scale based on the films offered thus far this year; on the one hand, they lack the superior quality present in Pirates of the Caribbean but on the other hand, they aren?t clunky as was present in The Hulk. What is certain is the scenes containing the repulsive Nautilus, Captain Nemo?s submarine, are the worst examples of computer animation presented this summer. The action sequences are the sufficient enough to keep the attention of movie-goers looking for some different for one night as opposed to seeing Pirates once again. It may not be fantastic, it may not even be mediocre to some, but it?s worth the price of admission ? for a matinee at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`The Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is quite simply a comic book movie done almost exclusively to revel in special effects excesses. Virtually the only useful thing I got from this DVD is the fact that Sean Connery was offered and turned down parts in both `The Matrix' and `The Lord of the Rings'. I hope Sir Sean is regretting the fact that he gave up the chance to play Gandalf in the hands down most successful fantasy movie series of all time!<br /><br />Since I am recommending you not bother buying this clunker, I will review the premise.<br /><br />The story gathers together seven major fictional character from 19th century novels. Specifically, there is:<br /><br />Alan Quatermain (Connery's character) from H. Rider Haggert's novels.<br /><br />Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's novels, especially '20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'.<br /><br />Dorian Gray from Oscar Wilde's `The Picture of Dorian Gray'<br /><br />Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde from Robert Lewis Stevenson's `Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde'.<br /><br />The Invisible Man from H. G. Wells `The Invisible Man'.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's `Tom Sawyer' and `Huckleberry Finn'<br /><br />Minna Harker from Bram Stoker's `Dracula'<br /><br />The cast is made even more improbable by casting Dr. Hyde as the perp of Edgar Allen Poe's `Murders in the Rue Morgue'.<br /><br />The immediate and most obvious anomoly here is the absence of the singularly most useful character, Sherlock Holmes, or at least his even more shadowy brother, Mycroft Holmes. The value of Quatermain, Nemo, and the invisible man are fairly easy to take in a CIA wet work type of operation, but the appropriateness of the other characters are a real stretch. Except for the displacement of about 100 years, this story is basicly something straight out of `The Fantastic Four' or the `X-Men', except that the X-men movies were much, much better than this clunker. Like a similar movie, `Van Helsing', the whole affair is nothing more than to execute a special effects tour de force, with practically no other good coming from the exercize.<br /><br />This fantasy may have been just a bit easier to take, if it were not for the truly great fantasies done recently such as `The Lord of the Rings', `The Narnia Chronicles', and the Matrix trilogy.<br /><br />Save your money!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>One of, if not the, worst movies I have ever seen.

So much so that Harrison Ford, when asked if Connery will return as his father in the next Indiana Jones film, tersely says, "He's retired").<br /><br />I'd like to see what the original graphic novels this was based on are like.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A87TUBBDPMF0.html">A1A87TUBBDPMF0</a><br/><p>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the kind of film that, in order to enjoy it, you need to leave your sense of disbelief at home (or, if you are at home, leave it in the closet).  It also helps if you have read either the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill or any of the classic adventure novels from which the League's characters are borrowed (King Solomon's Mines, Dracula, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Portrait of Dorian Grey, just to name a few).  If you embrace the idea that this is a popcorn-adventure movie and not one of those serious Oscar-contending films, then you'll have a good time.  <p>As comic-book-based movies go, LXG isn't on the same legendary adaptation level as Superman: The Movie or Spiderman.  Nevertheless, the conceit of uniting some of the best adventure/fantasy characters from late 19th Century literature and pitting them against a clever wannabe world dominator in order to stop a world war in 1899 is not exactly a bad one.  And of course it helps to have Sean Connery (Dr. No, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) as the head of an ensemble that includes TV's La Femme Nikita's Peta Wilson, Shane West, Stuart Townsend and Jason Fleming.  As legendary hunter Allan Quatermain Connery (who's also executive producer of this project) exudes world-weary cynicism and a sense of honorable duty as he leads a group of literary superheroes on a quest to stop the mysterious Fantom, a war-hungry arms merchant/inventor who seeks to pit the European superpowers against each other.  Of course, it's up to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to stop this madman and preserve world peace (at least until 1914!).<p>Screenwriter James Dale Robinson and director Stephen Norrington keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the whole movie sparkles with a sense of fun and humor that was clearly lacking in both Daredevil and The Hulk, both of which are examples of how not to make a comic book movie.  LXG succeeds where many of this genre don't, partly because it doesn't take itself too seriously, but mostly because it is fast-paced and dares to take chances.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>The problem with people who could not get themselves to like this doozy film is that they were expecting it to be like the graphic novel that inspired it. <p>The only attributes the film retains are the period, the plot summary (at a very simplified level) and the basic cast of characters. If you're expecting the characterization of the literary comic figures, well that isn't happening either. <p>The best I can about this film is that I was not disappointed. There's plenty of action, a surprise bad guy, and some pretty spiffy special fx. <p>Watch it as a no-expectations thriller with a twist and you'll do fine.

A disappointment for the cast and the director Stephen Norrington who directed the first Blade. Sean Connery (Dr. No, Entrapment) who shouldnt be in this catastrophe, plays Allan Quatermain. Him, Tom Sawyer, played by Shane West (Tvs ER, A Walk To Remember); Mina Harker, played by Peta Wilson (La Femme Nikita, Mercy); Captin Nemmo, played by Naseeruddin Shah (?); Dorian Gray, played by Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned, Shooting Fish) who is only redoing his corny ass Lestat impression; Skinner The Invisible Man, played by Tony Curran (Flight of the Phoenix, Blade 2) and last but least Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde played by Jason Flemyng (Snatch, Layer Cake). Dr. Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde is laughably stupid and the guy who drinks all the potion at the end and turns into that cartoonish special effect is even more stupid. So, these band of heroes go out to try to stop The Phantom (No it is not Billy Zane's The Phantom) played by Richard Roxburgh (Van Heling, Mission: Impossible 2). I thought of this as the Van Helsing of it's year because Van Helsing was pure and utter crap just like this. The action scenes are badly staged and as for the story and script....nothing is there. Think before you write something like this....man! What a waste of time this is.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Though the premise promises some bang, what you get is a basic dud!

The film features an interesting cast including Sean Connery (Dr. No, Highlander), who's also credited as one of the producers, Peta Wilson ("La Femme Nikita"), Tony Curran (Blade II), Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), Naseeruddin Shah (Monsoon Wedding), Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned), Shane West (Dracula 2000), and Richard Roxburgh (Van Helsing).<br /><br />The film, set in the year 1899, begins with a bang as we witness some mysterious assailants with German accents breaking into the Bank of England in a giant tank.  Next we see a zeppelin factory in Berlin assaulted by what appears to be British troops brandishing sophisticated weaponry.  As the various attacks continue Europe is thrown into turmoil as countries begin pointing the accusatory finger at each other.  Seems the British gooberment, believing an individual named The Fantom, who uses a Phantom of the Opera mask to conceal his identity, to be orchestrating the attacks, decides to assemble a team of extraordinary gentlemen (and a lady) including the following...hunter/adventurer Allan Quatermain (Connery), scientist/pseudo vampire Mina Harker (Wilson), sailor and inventor Captain Nemo (Shah), Rodney Skinner (Curran), who possesses the trait of invisibility, a snide, effeminate immortal named Dorian Gray (Townsend), and an American secret service goober by the name of Tom Sawyer (West)...oh brutha...anyway, after an run in with The Fantom, the group pops over to Paris in Nemo's ridiculously ginormous submarine called the Nautilus to gather a hulking Mr. Hyde, who, when in his non brutish form as Dr. Jekyll is played by Flemyng, finally setting sail for Venice, where a group of European leaders is set to gather offering a prime target for the villainous Fantom (seems The Fantom is interested in starting a world war so that he may profit from selling his fantastic weapons).  Anyway, the group manages to foil The Fantom's plans and avert a catastrophic disaster, but there's treachery afoot as one of the team members is a double agent, working with The Fantom, eventually escaping in Nemo's mini-submarine called the Nautiloid...that's cute...but not before seriously crippling Nemo's ship through some sabotage.  Soon after the group manages to get a line on The Fantom, following him to his secret base, which is actually a massive fortress somewhere in Mongolia, and learn the true nature of his nefarious plans along with his actual identity.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the source material for this film, but I am a little familiar with some of Alan Moore's other works including V for Vendetta, which I thought translated into an excellent film, and Watchmen, which was in the process of being adapted to the screen but currently seems to be in limbo.  Given this familiarity, I got the impression the film strayed a bit, the focus on the special effects emphasized over the actual content within the source material.  Now generally films do lose something in translation (they're rarely as good as the books they're based), but in this case it seemed especially true...anyway, as far as the positives...the movie was very slick, the action sequences plenty, the performances relatively decent...and the negatives...the dialogue often felt goofy, the heavy reliance on computer generated effects grew tiresome (I thought the miniature work awesoma), and the characters had little substance.  I particularly despised the hokum, pseudo father/son relationship developed between Quatermain and Sawyer as it the more it grew, the more I gagged on its sickly sweetness (apparently Quatermain had a son-in-law who got killed under his watch, and now has found a sort of surrogate in Tom Sawyer...bleeech).  I thought Peta Wilson looked good (she actually looks better here with dark hair than her normal blonde) but I thought her character odd in that she was supposed to be a vampire, but had no difficulty venturing into the daylight.  Seems with what I know about vampires sunlight is especially harmful, with a special exception to Wesley Snipes character in the Blade films, but that seemed not the case here.  The silliest character, for me at least, was Hyde.  He was ridiculously huge, in league with Marvel's The Hulk...near the end there's a bit, without going too much into the story, where Hyde ends up fighting a misshapen Mega-Hyde, and things move into the realm of the asinine.  As far as the other characters, well, they were there I suppose...I found it difficult to root for these so called `heroes' mainly because they possessed little of the substance one would have expected from their namesakes.  Perhaps this was a case of trying to incorporate too many characters in a single film, and as a result most of them come off like cardboard cutouts, lacking various qualities necessary to flesh them out fully.  As far as the main villain, well, I thought his plan, as initially presented, an interesting one, but once his full plan (which included a number of aspects) was revealed it mired itself into convoluted mess, at least in terms of execution, specifically because it was dependant on elements which were out of his control.  I thought the `Fantom' persona unnecessary, overly cumbersome, and senseless in general.  I also thought, given the character's obviously extensive resources, it seemed foolish that he should always be in the middle of the action (and danger), especially since he had an army equipped with highly sophisticated weapons of mass destruction.  By the way, one might feel a certain sense of immunity having their secret hideout/fortress in a remote location, but that doesn't mean one should skimp on security measures.  The League showed up at The Fantom's door, knocked out like two guards, and they were in. just like that.  Oh well...all in all a there's a whole lot of colorful, farcical action throughout, but if you're looking for substance, given the abundance of so called literary characters, or something akin to Moore's original vision, you're probably going to be disappointed.<br /><br />The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) looks excellent, and the audio, available in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround (English and French), and Dolby Digital Surround (Spanish), comes through most excellent.  As far as extras there's two commentary tracks, one with producers and cast members, and another with a number of crew members, along with 12 extended and deleted scenes, a behind the scenes documentary titled `Assembling the League' which provides a lot of `making of' materials, and subtitles in English and Spanish.  I dunno...seems kind of skimpy for a film that was as heavily promoted as it was prior to its theatrical release.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />A couple more things...I thought the film could have used a couple more comely females running around because as it stands, it kind of comes off as a sausage fest (and it's not like a couple extra characters would have hurt the film as it is).  Also, did anyone else who saw this have a hankering to yank on Captain Nemo's extraordinary long beard?  He kind of looked like the lost member of ZZ Top...</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>Other reviewers are correct, this movie is not a masterpiece.  It probably will never have a sequel.<p>So, why did I give it four stars?<p>Simple, I had fun.  I was not expecting a masterpiece.  I wasn't even expecting to like it much, but I was pleasantly surprized.  Almost from the beginning I enjoyed Sean Connery's character.  It helped that I like him and that I saw KING SOLOMON'S MINES several years ago.  Then I started playing at identifying as many lines from various books as I could find.  Then I just sort of got into it.  If I compared it to professional sports I'd have to say that it certainly wasn't the Super Bowl, perhaps more like all star wrestling.  Then again, out of all the sporting events I've been to, one night ring side at an all star wrestling event stands out as my all time most fun.<p>RECOMMENDATION:  Don't expect THE LORD OF THE RINGS or STAR WARS. Losen up and have fun with it and you will find an enjoyable movie.  Pop some popcorn and laugh as you watch it with a friend.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" got such punishing reviews when it was released in the summer of 2003 that it took me two years to finally get around to watching it.  And I must say that, now, having seen it, I can't understand what all the fuss was about.  This is a perfectly serviceable big budget action movie as such things go - not much better, but certainly no worse, than half a dozen similar movies released that summer (it's actually less bloated than the far more popular "Pirates of the Caribbean" which inexplicably garnered rave reviews and sailed off with boatloads of money).<br /><br />It's 1899, the dawn of a new century, one in which all the old weapons of war are fast becoming obsolete and are giving way to far more lethal implements of mass destruction - machine guns, armored tanks, submarines and mega-explosives - all capable of killing far greater numbers of people than was ever thought possible before.  Enter the Fantom [sic], a mysterious villain bent on using all this quickly developing technology to wage a global war with himself as commanding general.  To counter this, a man named "M" gathers together a group of characters culled from 19th Century literary sources - among them Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even Tom Sawyer! - to do battle against the menace.<br /><br />Although the script could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and making them more intriguing and distinct as individuals, the film has a couple of interesting plot twists and enough high-tech hardware to keep us entertained, if not exactly enthralled, through most of its running time.  The movie is breezily paced and the screenplay has a fun time tossing around a lot of "in" jokes for those in the audience familiar with the literary backgrounds of these various characters.<br /><br />Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quartermain, an aging adventurer contentedly wiling away his golden years in Africa, until he is called back into the queen's service at this critical juncture in the empire`s - and the world's - history.  Naseeruddin Shah,  Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Richard Roxburgh round out the rest of the cast.<br /><br />There really isn't anything that "extraordinary" about this "League," but if you happen to run across this film on cable some long, lonely night, you may find it passable for an evening's entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I haven't read the comic book series this movie is based on but I sure hope it is better than this movie was.<br />If you remember the TV ads for it you've seen the best bits and that isn't much of an exaggeration. Sean Connery was good but most of the others were just sort of there to take up space.<br />The idea of taking characters from several works of 19th century fiction never really works very well and could often have been better developed. Tom Sawyer, U.S. Secret Service, how'd that happen?, we don't get a clue. Mina Harker, Vampire, widow of one of the men who fought Dracula, never a clue as to how she isn't evil or can survive in sunlight, doesn't seem to need to feed very often either.<br />The best sets were the club/hotel(?)in Africa where Quatermain is recruited to the League and a couple of libraries in London, all either blown or shot up. Nemo's submarine looked as big as an aircraft carrier in some ways but also like it was razor thin, certainly bigger on the inside than the outside.<br />I kind of liked  the tank raid evil whatever his name was did on the Bank of England, a bit ahead of it's time but mostly looked OK. Nemo's 1930's style car was really pushing things for 1899, too much for me as what cars there were looked like (and were)horseless carriages. One of the most ridiculous bits was the League's journey from London to Venice. First you have this huge razor thin submarine rising up in the Thames (which is probably too shallow for anything so big) and then they make it to Venice in only three days! Around southern England then France aand Spain and through the Straits of Gibraltar alone would take more time than that even today even without travelling halfway across the Mediterranean Sea.<br />Sean Connery did well but I certainly won't be buying it, the rest of the movie is a mess.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Well, it wasn't half bad to tell you the truth. It's such a joy to find that the literary characters of ages past could be brought together in one massive idea of someone's imagination. It makes you wonder "Could these people have been the first superhero team if they really exsisted?"<br /><br />These titans of american fiction all have their special abilities and legendary skills:<br /><br />Alan Quatermain - an excelent exploerer who has a taste for adventure even at an old age.<br /><br />The Invisble man - a creeping sly cat who is stuck in his invisible body until he could find an antidote.<br /><br />Captain Nemo - famous spy who pirates plans and builds massive machinery.<br /><br />Mina Harker - the fabled wife of johnathan harker who has a deep dark secret, a perfect dark ability that strengthens her independent spirit.<br /><br />Dorian Gray - a man with a cursed ability to never die.<br /><br />Tom Sawyer - the adventurous risk-taker who mimics quatermains spirit.<br /><br />Dr. Jekal/ Mr. Hyde - the man and the myth of changing into a massive beast of a man with great strength but a short temper.<br /><br />All of these fictional characters combined makes for a team that is stylishly clever and ready to fit the screen.<br /><br />Together, they unravel the mystery of their newest foe: the Phantom.<br /><br />It sounds like something totally out of the pulp comics but this little concept was made famous by the talented Alan Moore of the popular comic book series.<br /><br />It's worth a look.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>One of those films where the inspiration was better than the execution.  THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN has top-notch action, special effects, and overall production values. However, it doesn't gel.  TLOEG is based on a comic book miniseries by award winning novelist and comic book writer Alan Moore and it translates better in the comic book. Moore took homage to DC Comics' team books in which their stable of characters (i.e. Superman, Batman, Flash, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern. etc) are put into one comic book in titles such as JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA; the characters share in on one adventure each month in the comic book.  In TLOEG famous literary characters are put into one adventure to save the world  (Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde). The film however takes its style of direction from the Jerry Bruckheimer school of moviemaking which is loud, 'in-your-face', and chaotic.  The film is reminiscent of the recent film ARMAGEDDON.  Sean Connery is a presence in everything he does and fares quite well as Allan Quatermain, and the standout character here is definitely Captain Nemo played by Naseeruddin Shah.  Peta Wilson as Mina Harker is another in a long list of unneeded vampire characters that have been flooding the movie market these days.  The 'Hyde' character is a parody upon itself looking like THE INCREDIBLE HULK (HULK was created by Stan Lee to be a cross between Frankenstein and Mr. Hyde in the first place). Lastly, the plot twists involving some of the characters' motives  (i.e. 'M', Dorian Grey, and The Invisible Man)  were not surprising, inventive, or justified. They were suddenly turned into bad guys just so the 'good' characters would have someone to fight with.  Overall, another failure of translating a comic-book into film and had the film been successful, the ending was set up for a sequel...Its not going to happen.  Note: It was reported that Sean Connery had a choice to do this film or to do LORD OF THE RINGS.  He chose TLOEG because he understood the material for the film, but did not understand 'RINGS'.</p></br></body></html>

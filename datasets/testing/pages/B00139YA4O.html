It works as a spellbinding character-driven fantasy and science fiction series about a group of forty-odd survivors of an airplane crash lost in a remote mysterious Pacific island. As a character-driven series with an overarching plot arc, it resembles most closely "Babylon 5", with a cast of characters as complex as any aboard the 22nd Century space station. These include Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), a former Iraqi soldier, Hugo "Hurley" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), the unexpected winner of a lottery,  Kate Austin (Evangeline Lilly), and Jack Shepherd (Matthew Fox), the doctor who unexpectedly becomes the leader of the survivors. Veterans of other science fiction and fantasy television shows and films are included in this cast: Daniel Dae Kim from "Crusade", portrays the enigmatic Korean businessman Jin Kwon; Terry O'Quinn, whose roles include "Star Trek: The Next Generation", portrays the equally enigmatic John Locke; Dominic Monaghan from "The Lord of the Rings" is drug-addicted rock musician Charlie Pace. Each of the episodes have focused in depth on one or more of these main characters and others in the cast, confronting secrets as diverse as a mysterious man-killing monster and Danielle (Mira Furlan from "Babylon 5"), the lonely half-mad French survivor of another plane wreck on the island. While some may find that the plots seem to drag out needlessly, most will instead appreciate how well the cast and creators of "Lost" have built up the show to an intriguing climatic first season conclusion which may or may not resolve the fates of several in the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A one of a kind series, Lost, brings to the screen the parallel stories of (mainly) fourteen survivors of an airplane crash trying to survive on an island somewhere in the South Pacific.  Things, however, are not what they seem in the Garden of Eden...<br /><br />Terry O'Quinn, Josh Holloway, Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Naveen Andrews and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, tears, not to mention scares.  Lost does a great job of describing people's personalities, secrets and the problems they face.  It's all about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />The setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, Lost is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>Finally, finally, finally... there is a unique and original drama series on television!<br /><br />Everything else is old soap... CSI times twelve, Law and Order over and over, Desperate Housewives a sexed up, prime time soap opera...<br /><br />Finally, we have a series that offers almost everything. Deep, complicated and flawed human characters... mysterious puzzles... romance here and there...  and true chills and thrills!<br /><br />The only complaint I would have is that "Lost" moves at a snail's pace. Other than that,<br /><br />LONG LIVE "LOST!"<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of the novel "The Shroud of Torrington."</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>TV is a visual medium. Let's not back away from that. The written word and radio obviously has a different set of criteria. And the acting acumen that these (for the most part) young(er) actors bring to the fore may even be more difficult to present when you consider that they know that their appearances are going to be chopped up by . . . you guessed it, the sponsors. That's the nature of the beast. So say we see an early Jon Voight talking with his friend Lewis (Burt Reynolds) in "Deliverance." Voight's a 'woos' and Reynolds is so macho  that he makes you feel uncomfortable. BUT THAT'S THE WAY VOIGHT WILL BE IN 100 MINUTES. He knows it. The Director knows it. He can grow into the part over the course of an hour and a half. The actors on LOST have a lot of moments in the sun but they may be 30 and 40 minutes apart.<br /><br />And these actors look good. They are articulate, know their craft, and the women are sexy and yes, there's a lot of skin. When Jack is out on the makeshift driving range with Kate, she ain't Roseanne Barr; no offense meant. Even Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriquez) who is one tough, nasty person, even when she's busting someone's head or threatening to cap them, she just looks gorgeous.<br /><br />Additionally, the juxtopositioning of the then-current time-line with the past is brilliant. One of the reasons for this is because it reverse telegraphs what went on. Dr. Jack running stairs in one of the early scenes in the 'past' and pausing to commiserate with a stranger . . . whew. And the story of the Kims, Daniel and Yoon, and how they met, just excellent. A love story within the drama. It was like "The Notebook" without all the other sacharine.<br /><br />The writing is tight. The episodes are very well crafted. There is an urban legend that the production-management staff didn't count on the success and that while failure wasn't planned on it was considered. Hence the overwhelming success caught everyone especially the writers, off-guard. Here is a problem as I see it. We all have a certain half life we give to TV shows. Much as we love 24, for instance (I think still a 'smidgin' in front of LOST for sheer magnetic, breathless episodes), we know eventually Jack will have done everything possible in any human's imagination. He's been electrocuted, shot, addicted to heroin, and all the women he's slept with have been killed or left him. Time to move on. Ditto The Wire. So where do we go with LOST?<br /><br />One of the comments mentions a hubris with this staff of writers-producers-directors that they're great in the opening rounds but fade after the 8th. At the risk of using too much of a jock analogy, they have no bullpen. We'll have to wait and see. I haven't been bored yet for one episode in I (or II for that matter.)<br /><br />To go back to 24 and The Wire for a moment by analogy. We expect the year to produce one story. We expect the story, that story, to be completed in the 30 weeks alloted time.<br /><br />With LOST, it's a continuum and it will be curious to see where it goes. A lot of comments have been made about the show being Gilligan's Island with an edge. I would submit to you that those women aren't ANYTHING like Ginger and Maryanne. Great stuff for TV and coming at the end of a decade of truly worthless junk on television when we were all about to don the trappinigs of Peter Finch in Network and and say "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore" and hurl our TV's into the garbage. The recyclable bin, naturally. We're much more environmentally sensitive than Finch's character.<br /><br />But a quick word about Reality TV. Yeah. It's crap and my only hope is that Springer et. al. (the Judges' shows also) produces a thorozine calming effect on that portion of the public that is their audience. But . . .<br /><br />If you're giving props, check out the early shows of Survivor and Amazing Race. (granted, forget the spinoffs)). Are you kidding? This is where LOST emanates from. Stress. Conflict. Competition. Sex. Reward. Hardship. Bad weather. Bad characters. Come on. There are only 28 basic plots in storytelling. TV found a tangent. 5 stars.

The bad news is that it will spoil you from wanting to sit through new episodes, one week at a time with commercial breaks.<br /><br />Everything about this show works...the cast, their performances, cinematography, soundtrack, plot devices, EVERYTHING!  Skill and serendipity come together in a perfect mixture.  Having the ability to watch multiple episodes in one sitting greatly enhances the LOST experience.  Unfortunately, having to wait for new episodes on TV each week results in forgetting certain nuances or plot points that are so integral to the fun and mystery of the overall show.<br /><br />Great special features on Disc 7 (the entire product is as thoughtfully and beautifully produced as the series itself).  If only all series were given the care, backing and attention of this one, the world of network television would be elevated to a much higher level.<br /><br />My only pet peeve is that most (NOT ALL! There are definite exceptions...) of the commentary tracks feature participation from multiple actors/producers that essentially turn into a joke fest of insider's humor or recollections that do little to enhance the "behind the scenes" information.  It would have been better to limit these commentaries to one or two participants at a time and have them addressing the home viewer rather than each other.<br /><br />LOST Season One has set a very high bar and I hope they'll keep it up for all the seasons to follow.  I'll look forward to getting the next DVD collection as well, for this is far superior to watching it first-run on Wednesday nights.  A definite set for your collection and a bargain at the amazon price.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Funny how the opening credits perfectly sums up the feeling of the show. The word "Lost" appears among a black background out of focus coming closer to camera, then it goes clear for 2 seconds than goes blurry again before disappearing. Exactly like the show: plot points and answers are revealed only to have them not appear like they are and it's gone. Like trying to finding a really fast cat.<br /><br />A man wakes up in the jungle disoriented. While going through the jungle and reaching the coastline he sees a certainly eye-opening sight: the flight he was on as crashed and debris among with survivors are on the beach. This has to be the best scene in the entire series, it's suspensful and gripping, especially the um, turbine part. Then the pilot continues with the series next 2 best scenes: the hearing of something ominous in the jungle and an "attack" on the front end of the plane.<br /><br />After that, things don't really get as gripping, except for a little phantom passenger but other than that, nothing really sinks its claws in like those opening 2 pilot episodes(including the transmission scene, btw recommendation: don't read the booklet with the episode sypnosis, they're not the most discreet about certain things.) What does compel you though is the answers to those questions which oddly just literally hang for episodes on end.<br /><br />With such a huge survivor list you would think we'd lose perspective on how many people they are but you notice that there's just enough although 48 survivors is kind of pushing it. We'd all develop our favorites too, and that might change since every episode one character tends to have their own flashback episode where something about their life is revealed. So some survivors you probably wouldn't like but end up liking them anyway. One of my favorites is Sawyer: funny, brash and quite complicated. And I can identify with Charlie, always wants to help but never seems to have it appreciated, even when he needs the help as well.<br /><br />If they're could be one complaint is that the show almost seems like buckling under its own weight. Like loading a table with boxes, the more you put on the more it'll crack and break. So it seems with the show: with so many questions and very few answers being given, you're not really sure how the writers will pull off the ending without it being like "oh come on, as if!"<br /><br />The packaging is odd too. 2 discs come stacked with one on the other rather than separate parts. But it's still a great set and incredibly interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>A lot can be written about the TV series Lost.I personally think that there is a Lost for everybody,and viewers take what they need from the show. Intricately written, wonderful cinematography , all the clues and twists meshing together like a gigantic 500 piece puzzle. The story has some little plot twists ,aside from the big ones which hit you like a bus,But the real gems are the little ones that make you say hey wait a minute...A really enjoyable series with lots to think about.Beautifully shot in HD than scaled down for DVD ,looks super on a nice TV</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>ok, at first i only heard of lost and always shrugged it off. but then after the success of desperate housewives and the huge speculation and fan base review i finally sucumbed to lost and got season 1 on DVD and was BLOWN away. it was a supurbly acted show with smart writing, top-notch thrills, the axing of main characters, and mysteries that left people talking. the show is about flight 815 when it suddenly crashes, stranding 48 people on a uncharted island but it was then the islanders found out this island...had many secrets from the french woman, poler bears on a tropicle island, the mysterious group called the 'others', a set of cursed numbers, and the strange hatch in the ground. the cast is manly composed of 14 main characters each with there own background and story that somehow ties them with the island. all this leads to a huge cliffhanger that will leave people scrambling to find out about season 2. so buy this truley great show that will leave you breathless.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>It is too early to state for certain just how good LOST is compared to the great shows in television history, but by the highest possible standards its first season has to stand out as one of the great seasons in the history of the medium.  Season One of LOST was not merely good but great television, and not merely great television but great narrative storytelling.  But the impact of LOST goes completely beyond its aesthetic success.  Along with another show on ABC (albeit one that I do not care for), DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, LOST has managed to cause the prodigiously stupid television execs to realize that there is a huge demand for quality scripted television.  After years of an endless string of simply awful reality shows, all of the networks suddenly want shows that are written ahead of time and feature casts of actual actors.  Although final schedules have not yet been announced, it looks as if the 2005-2006 season is going to have both a dramatic decrease in reality shows and an increase in scripted shows.  The stunning success of LOST has played a major role in this sea change.<br /><br />We have in recent years seen genre shows that were huge hits with critics and managed to generate a passionate cult following.  Probably no show was more critically praised than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (with hordes of high brow critics preferring it to more respectable hit series like THE SOPRANOS), but at its peak it managed only a small audience.  LOST has generated critical praise almost as strong as BUFFY, a core of fans nearly as passionate, but unlike BUFFY managed absolutely stunning ratings.  It is one of the few instances in recent television history where what is arguably the best show on TV also managed among the strongest ratings.  In fact, LOST would be considered a cult show based on the number of websites that it has inspired and the passion of the fans, except that the ratings instead make it a mainstream hit.<br /><br />Who would have thought that a series dealing with plane crash survivors on a most unusual island would have been this successful?  Before it debuted I remember people joking that it sounded like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND without the humor.  But it ended up matching or surpassing the most optimistic expecations, in quality as well as in ratings.  The mention of ratings is not gratuitious.  So many superb shows have been cancelled in recent years (FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DEAD LIKE ME, ANGEL) that there was even a "Save LOST" website started . . . before the show even debuted!  Luckily, the ratings have made cancellation seem not only remote but impossible.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to acknowledge everything that LOST does well in the space allotted here.  Above all else, it is a superbly written show, not merely on an episode by episode basis, but in the way all of the episodes mesh with one another.  The continuity is the best that I have seen in a long time.  For instance, the first time we see one character in the show, she is rubbing her wrist.  Later, we learn that she had been a prisoner of a U. S. Marshall and had obviously gotten rid of her handcuffs just before we first met her.  Almost any detail like that will be dealt with at a later date.  But the scripts are just as strong on character development, humor, excitement, and adventure.  I do have a tiny bit of fear about Season Two:  former BUFFY and ANGEL writer David Fury, who wrote many of the finest scripts of the year, including "Walkabout," which could very well win Fury an Emmy for best written episode of the year, has left LOST to work this summer on the new FOX series THE INSIDE, before joining 24 as a writer and executive producer.<br /><br />My initial fear when the show started was that the central cast was perhaps too large, but it turned out to be unjustified, and the great ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the reasons for the show's success..  Yes, there are a lot of characters, and sometimes I wish some were more central than others, but the depth and power of developing the stories of a dozen characters ended up being both unique and exceptionally entertaining.  Jack is the titular lead of the show, although show creator J. J. Abrams has confessed that their original idea was to have Jack assume leadership in the first couple of episodes, and then have him die off, forcing the lovely fugitive Kate become the leader for the castaways.  But they quickly realized that Matthew Fox's Jack was too valuable a character to toss aside so cavalierly.  If there is a second main character, it is Kate, who is performed by a remarkable newcomer, the excruciatingly beautiful Evangeline Lily, who despite virtually no prior experience (I did recently spot her in a very, very tiny role from the first season episode "Kinetic" on SMALLVILLE, where her only task is to kiss her supposed boyfriend).  One of the most consistently fascinating characters is John Locke, played by Terry O'Quinn, a veteran television actor familiar to anyone who has seen shows like ALIAS, THE X-FILES, MILLENIUM, and THE WEST WING.  Although he has always performed marvelously, LOST has made him a star.  Every one of the major characters has his or her own set of fans.  Naveen Andrews, for instance, a Londoner of Indian descent, has been a big hit playing Sayid, the former Iraqi soldier, as has Jorge Garcia as Hurley, the obese lottery winner who is as unlucky for others as he is lucky himself.  And while Dominic Monaghan shared in the enormous success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS playing one of the Hobbits, he has achieved more individual success as Charlie, the heroin-addicted bass player for the fictional band Driveshaft (one hit wonders famed for their song "You All Everybody").  So rabid are the show's fans that there are websites dedicated to Driveshaft.<br /><br />Structurally, the narrative shifts between the efforts of the survivors to adapt to and understand the island on which they are marooned and flashbacks that explain the personal history of each character.  Some people object to this, wishing instead that they focused exclusively on the events on the island, but I think that this is wrong.  If you focused merely on the events on the island, it would be only an adventure story, but through the flashbacks we learn so much about what makes the people tick that the series becomes as much a character study as an adventure.  By the end of the season, we get to know the characters so well that we can anticipate how they are going to respond to even the smallest events.  We learn very quickly that the island contains a host of mysteries, including invisible monsters whose location and function remain unknown until the end of the season (if we even understand them then), other inhabitants whose intentions seem both sinister and unknown, and a lone insane Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau.  But there is not much more than we know about the island.  Rousseau talks of the Black Rock, but it isn't what we expect when we finally see it.  And then there is the metal doorway that Locke discovers in the middle of the jungle.  How can it be opened and what lies behind the door?  By the end of the season many of the mysteries are explained, but more are left open-ended.<br /><br />LOST clearly has the potential to be one of the great series in the history of television.  The producers are highly ambitious, but so far their execution has matched their aspirations.  I read an interview with David Fury before the first episode aired in which he said they had a plot line that runs over several years, so their clearly is a well-conceived storyline.  I have only one concern with the show, and that is the executive producer and creator J. J. Abrams.  Although he has two prior hit shows, FELICITY and ALIAS, he has had some problems with taking his shows to higher levels.  What made BUFFY so extraordinary was that each year they managed to do something new and amazing, even if some fans were disappointed by some directions it headed.  But ALIAS has started to disappoint some fans by the fact that it hasn't progressed much beyond what it was in the first season.  Instead of doing strikingly new things, Abrams just tends to recycle the same general storyline.  And there has not been much of a payoff for all the focus on Ramaldi (for nonfans of ALIAS, a Renaissance genius whose artifacts provide much of the narrative force of the show).  Abrams clearly is brilliant at conceiving and initiating great shows, but he has not yet demonstrated that he is a great finisher in the way that Joss Whedon has.  I'm forever the optimist, and I believe that Abrams either will come to terms with this or the other creators and executive producers will help LOST get to a place that we will all find satisfying.<br /><br />Regardless of the future, this nonetheless is one of the most remarkable rookie seasons any television series has ever enjoyed.  I'll end with food for thought.  THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE, to name just a few shows, were much better in their second and third seasons than their first.  What if two years from now we are able to say the same of LOST?</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>"LOST" the series that took America by storm in 2004 and has since been a fan favorite today.<br /><br />In 2004, the series was hyped as the latest series from J.J. Abrams who was known for his TV series "Felicity" and "Alias"  and joined by a talented team which includes executive producer and writer Damon Lindelof ("Crossing Jordan"), executive producer and writer Carlton Cuse ("Nash Bridges", "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.") , writer Jeffrey Lieber, producer Ra'uf Glasgow ("The Big Easy" and "Profiler"), Jack Bender ("Eight is Enough" and "Beverly Hills 90210'), Bryan Burke ("Alias") and Jean Higgins ("CSI: Miami") .<br /><br />The series debuted on ABC in Sept. 2004 and was instantly a critically acclaimed hit as people all over the Internet would discuss and debate the circumstances of the show.  Series creators would plant Easter Eggs on the TV series, on the Internet, on commercial trailers and eventually people were drawn in by the well-written dramatic thriller and sci-fi storyline, wonderful acting but the overall signs of conspiracy and mystery.  The series would inspire many blogs, podcasts and so much hype that around 17-20 million people were drawn to the series each night a new episode aired.<br /><br />The series won an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Drama Series" and series creator J.J. Abrams was award an Emmy in September 2005.  The series also won the Writers Guild of America Awards for "Outstanding Achievement in Writing for a Dramatic Television Series", 2005 Producer Guild Awards for "Best Production" and the 2005 Director's Guild Award for "Best Direction of a Dramatic Television Program" and the "Screen Actors Guild Awards 2005' for Best Ensemble Cast.<br /><br />For the first season, a total of 25 episodes aired from Sept. 2004 through May 2005.

"SeasonPlay" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"LOST"  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and "LOST" is no exception.  There is grain that can be seen in each episode and I have to admit that the quality is not up to par as "LOST - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON" (not sure if they are using better equipment in the later seasons) but the picture quality is still pretty good.<br /><br />There is little compression artifacts that can be seen in low light conditions but overall, the picture quality of "LOST" is not perfect but still looks gorgeous!  I compared both my DVD box set to this Blu-ray set and the picture quality in High Definition shows off detail that I never caught on DVD.  From the plane wreckage to the orange dimples on the orange peel in John Locke's mouth.  These can be seen quite clearly on Blu-ray.<br /><br />As for the audio, "LOST" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  The explosions of the plane is caught all around you and you are literally immersed into the destruction of the plane as audio is heard on the front channels, surrounds, rear surrounds and through the LFE of your subwoofer.  Very nice!<br /><br />Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of "LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE" is featured in Standard Definition (480i) and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Several discs are full of special features and Easter Eggs.  Included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary for "PILOT (PART 1)" by Executive Producers J.J.

I was on the main forums every week, downloaded every "LOST" podcast available, read the magazines and just pretty much got drawn in by the story but the various theories that people had about the island, the characters and more. In fact, I have owned the first season on DVD, listened to the audio books and even owned the pilot on UMD.  That's how hooked I was to this show.<br /><br />Personally, I just found that mystique of crash landing in an island and having to survive to be quite exciting but even moreso, finding out that there are some weird things going on in the island that makes you wonder if what we were watching is actually happening or are the people actually dead.  There were so many unusual things that have happened and "LOST" was what was needed on network TV.<br /><br />Also, as much as "LOST" would seem like a wreck with so many characters featured, the way the show is presented through various flashbacks of each of the main characters, the writers really focused on character development and making the viewer feel positive (or negative) about a certain character and learn about their behavior and a past that somehow each character has some kind of connection with each other.<br /><br />There were so many amazing episodes, one such episode that will always be a favorite was the first death of one of the main 14.  What a shocker! What was equally amazing was watching the season finale and I can remember being shocked and having to go back and forth on my DVR and then later on my DVD copies to see these "secrets" that fans have caught in the final episode.  Nevertheless, that finale was awesome and left myself and many fans highly anticipating the second season.<br /><br />The first season of course leaves the viewer with plenty of questions (and we're currently awaiting season 6 and many questions still exist today) but it was those questions that help fuel the fire to various theories that many fans could not help but take part of.  It was quite fun to see how this series captured the attention of so many people and how the producers, writers and even the talent were so surprised of the various theories themselves.<br /><br />I have to say that watching the first season of "LOST" on High Definition five years later is quite amazing.  The series is absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and  was also impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack.  And it was great to see all the special features on the DVD included (although I wonder if all Easter Eggs are also included on the Blu-ray since I've only found a very few so far).<br /><br />Fans who enjoy the "LOST" series will truly want to own the series on High Definition.  If you are a big fan of the show, it is pretty much a no-brainer to pick up both Season 1 and 2 (as well as the previously released Season 3 and 4) on Blu-ray.  This season is what started it all and with the final sixth season coming soon, you can't help but be happy that all four seasons are now available on Blu-ray.<br /><br />"LOST - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Hopes were not terribly high for "Lost," the action-drama about a planeful of castaways lost on a tropical island. "Gilligan's Island" all over again? Not quite. This mysterious show rapidly turned itself into a runaway hit. Mystery, drama, the supernatural and horror seep into this series, turning it into one of the most intriguing shows on television.<br /><br />The series opens with a wrecked plane on a beach, surrounded by panicking people who manage to escape the wreckage. Jack (Matthew Fox) manages to group the refugees into a makeshift camp on the shore -- but soon they hear strange noises and see palm trees being trampled by a gargantuan monster. And when he ventures into the jungle, with the mysterious Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and junkie rocker Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), they find the still-living pilot. The pilot reveals that they are hundreds of miles off course, and no one will be able to find him. Then he gets eaten by an unseen monster.<br /><br />Now the island is occupied by a motley band, including a strange warrior-sage with a knife-throwing knack, a traumatized con man, a pregnant girl whose baby holds a secret, a secretive Korean couple, a snobby rich girl and her exasperated brother, an Iraqi ex-soldier, and a "dude"-talking chubby guy who has a dark secret of his own. Despite Jack's best efforts, the group splits into two camps, and tensions grow between them.<br /><br />And there are even worse things coming -- the survivors are not the only ones on the island. A possibly crazy Frenchwoman (Mira Furlan) is hiding somewhere in the jungle, and the murderous "Ethan" kidnaps and nearly kills two of the survivors. The island itself has mysteries -- mysterious monsters, voices in the woods, radio towers, a metal hatch in the jungle ground, and a string of numbers that bring madness and ill fortune...<br /><br />Yes, it's a weird show. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for "Alias," outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different. The best way to describe it is as "Swiss Family Robinson," as written by Stephen King.<br /><br />The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline. Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense -- the mysterious monster (a dinosaur?) is only briefly seen by the characters, and nobody knows exactly what it is. Nor are we sure who has been there, or what is up with the island. Adams keeps viewers guessing by slowly peeling away the layers.<br /><br />What's really interesting is that "Lost" is truly an ensemble show -- Adams gives every character a chance to shine, and flashbacks reveal what makes them tick. Some, like ex-con Kate, are a bit more mysterious than others, but some like the Korean marrieds and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer get a lot more dimension and humanity.<br /><br />Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor. But it's the secondary actors that really catch your attention: Dominic Monaghan gives a simply amazing performance as Charlie, especially when Charlie goes through withdrawal, Jorge Garcia is equally good at comedy ("Dude, that was a Jedi moment!") and drama, and Terry O'Quinn is stellar as the enigmatic cubicle-worker-turned-jungle-warrior. Evangeline Lilly gives the debut performance of a lifetime, as tormented criminal Kate.<br /><br />"Lost" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird, it's definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Clearly the creators of Lost know their audience very well judging by the number of meaty extras that cater to the obsessive fan. These commentaries and featurettes explain a lot about the mechanics of the show without giving away any of the mysteries.<br /><br />On the first DVD, there are audio commentaries for both parts of the "Pilot" episode by executive producers J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. They talk briefly about how they pitched the show and take us through the making of the episode. In an interesting moment, Abrams actually stops the episode to show us how they did an explosion in the crash site sequence. These are very informative tracks with lots of anecdotes about filming.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary on "Walkabout" by executive producers Jack Bender and David Fury and actor Terry O'Quinn. Bender talks about the challenge of working with trained wild boars that ate too much and didn't feel like moving in a scene that required them to charge the actors. Unfortunately, O'Quinn doesn't talk much only offering brief insights.<br /><br />The second DVD includes a commentary for "The Moth" by Lindelof, Burk and actor Dominic Monaghan. The Lord of the Rings alum tends to spend most of the time cracking jokes and offering little insight on this so-so track.<br /><br />The fourth DVD features an audio commentary on "Hearts and Minds" by executive producer Carlton Cuse, supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach and actors Maggie Grace and Ian Sommerhalder. The two producers dominate the track as they talk about their intentions with the actors offering their occasional two cents.<br /><br />The bulk of the extras can be found on the seventh DVD. "The Genesis of Lost" is a good look at how the show's story came together. The network had a script but it was awful. At the time, Abrams was the network's go-to guy and he had already been toying with an idea of a plane crashing on a deserted island.<br /><br />"Designing a Disaster" takes a look at how they put together the chaotic crash site in the "Pilot" episode. The creators had no script and very little time but the production crew was able to find the right plane, take it apart, ship it and put it back together (sort of).<br /><br />"Before They Were Lost" examines how the cast came together in only three weeks. The actors talk about how they got the gig with footage from their audition tapes.<br /><br />"Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot" takes us through the first day of filming to completion. Cast and crew recount the sometimes harsh weather conditions they had to shoot in but it did help them bond as a team.<br /><br />"The Art of Matthew Fox" is a collection of photographs the actor took while shooting the "Pilot." He talks about them as they flash on the screen in this nice extra.<br /><br />"Lost@Comicon" is a brief clip of some of the cast and crew at that year's San Diego Comicon and their impressions of the event.<br /><br />"Lost: On Location" is a collection of behind-the-scenes featurettes that give insight into how certain sequences in select episodes were achieved, like the least-threatening wild boars, the humanizing of Sawyer, the revelation of Kate as a fugitive bank robber and a look at the climatic season finale.<br /><br />"Onset with Jimmy Kimmel" features the late night talk show host visiting the cast on location in Hawaii in this whimsical extra. Kimmel asks Monaghan to compose a (lame) theme song for the show and goofs around with everyone.<br /><br />"Backstage with Driveshaft" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band, which thinks of themselves as the next Oasis but is probably only a one-hit wonder.<br /><br />There are two flashbacks from the season finale with Claire and Sayid.<br /><br />Also included are 13 deleted scenes that feature mostly minor exchanges between characters, like a nice bit where Charlie bums a cigarette off of Sawyer, that are interesting but not essential and were probably cut because of time.<br /><br />"Bloopers from the Set" is an amusing montage of blown lines and funny pratfalls on this very physically demanding show.<br /><br />Finally, there is a Q&A session "Live from the Museum of Television and Radio." The select cast and crew joke with each other in this entertaining if not frivolous extra. Although, Abrams does reveal that originally Jack was supposed to die in the "Pilot" episode.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>On the day of the 6th season premiere, I finally decided to watch Lost to cement the fact that I will forever be six years behind or ahead of pop culture. I would have watched sooner, but by the time I wanted to jump on the bandwagon, a lot of my friends jumped off, "It was great for a while, then it just got weird" they'd say. But now, with the final season upon us, and with my hearing that answers will be/have been given, I jumped on the fated Lost plane. Thus, this review will be in the context of a first-time viewer starting from the beginning, so forgive me if these facts are later changed, resolved, or otherwise not true in later seasons.<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />Pilot<br />Walkabout<br />All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues<br />Hearts & Minds<br />Deus Ex Machina<br /><br />From the opening moments of death-dog, Vincent waking up our fateful hero, then finding out that a plane has crashed on an island, and the ensuing chaos that follows, Lost comes up with one of the best pilots in TV history. It's absolutely mesmerizing for anybody that watches it. How could you not become a fan after watching this? The beach scene not only has some great special effects, but the tension and feeling of terror on the beach is just so well-done. In fact, this scene is so iconic, every show like it that has come afterwards has tried to come up with their own version of this scene. Guess what, they all fail. What may seem like a simple scene, is actually an encapsulation of all that makes Lost a great show, at least in the first season.<br /><br />Another aspect of Lost that the show does so well, is that while it's most known for its story, it's characters hold the show together, and it's mostly what makes the characters so good. It's so hard to get to know so many people since it's an ensemble cast, but by the end of the season, you get a good sense of most/all of the characters, their motivations, and what brought them to the island.<br /><br />Jack is the reluctant leader who was told all of his life that he didn't have what it takes to be a hero (He's also the first of many characters we learn that has MAJOR daddy issues). Sawyer is the local conman, unlikable maybe, but he gives clever nicknames, so he can't be all bad. Locke is the local philosopher, always the wiser, he struggles with issues of faith. Sayid is the local Iraqi torturer. Hurley is the comical fat guy with a heart of gold and a harsh unlucky streak. Jin & Sun are the local Koreans that are surrounded by emotional and linguistic barriers. Charlie is the local drug-addicted former rockstar that finds a new addiction in the pregnant/sweet/cute Claire. Boone & Shannon are the high-class step-brother & sister that slept together. Michael & Walt are a father & son that struggle to build their relationship. And even though Kate is often criticized for being the worst character/actress, she's a tragic type who's built by circumstances, and only suffers because she's the least likable out of the whole cast.<br /><br />To build out and flesh out that big of a cast in only 25 episodes is an amazing accomplishment to me, especially since a lot of it comes in the form of well-placed flashbacks. And again, in this season at least, Lost puts its characters above its story. Sure, it may string you along with a few mysteries, Lost Season 1 was all about the characters. This is where Lost succeeds, and for me at least, makes it such a compelling watch.<br /><br />Overall, it's a must that you at least try the show out at least thought the pilot, and probably through episode 4 or 5. If you're not satisfied by this point, then you'll probably never be satisfied, and if you continue and make it through the whole season and you still don't like it, then just drop it. This is the best that Lost has offered so far, and to me, it's a TV gem.<br /><br />Also, if you've already seen this season, after you've seen the whole show, I hear it's equally comelling and facinating the 2nd time around. Which is always great when a show stands up to, and even benefits from repeat viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>When Oceanic Flight 815 from Australia to Los Angeles wrecks in the middle of nowhere, the survivors find themselves stranded on a deserted island in the middle of the ocean. Led by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), a doctor back home, the survivors fend for themselves looking for shelter, hunting for food, and having to find clean water while trying to get the word out that there are survivors of the devastating crash. But when unexplainable events occur, including polar bear attacks, the new residents of the island begin to ponder the meaning of their existence on the island. Furthermore, they may not be alone.<br /><br />I'm just a little late jumping on the Lost bandwagon, partially by choice. After missing the first few episodes due to scheduling conflicts, and hearing that missing an episode would cause you to be, for lack of a better word, lost in the series, I figured I would hold off until they were further into the series before picking up the DVD's to check it out. As time went on Lost became a "water cooler sensation" and I wanted to dive in, but with the love/hate relationship people had with the series slowly unravelling it's mysteries making it pertinent that you not miss a single episode, I thought it would be better to wait till near the end of the series to start the first season. So here I am. The sixth and final season starts on February 2, 2010 and I just finished season 1. Was it worth the wait?<br /><br />Absolutely! With Lost, JJ Abrams and his team of producers and writers have created a fresh and intriguing story with characters that feel real with real arcs. Each episode focuses on an issue on the island while also focusing on a specific character's past. Even though each episode follows this patter it never feels gimmicky and allows the writers to further flesh out the characters in an interesting and inventive way, while also giving story arcs that will further flesh out the world and mythology of Lost in seasons to come.<br /><br />A lot has been made of how Lost keeps piling on mysteries while slowly solving them, if at all. After watching the first season you can definitely see the seeds of this starting to bloom, but since the first season is an introduction to the characters and their predicament, mysteries are part of the territory. Still, for better in my opinion, as the writers let you in on one secret another two or three in most cases are bound to pop up. Since this process always feels organic rather than feeling like a gimmick to keep ratings up, it keeps the viewer intrigued in the story while making the viewing experience more interactive as you try to figure out the mysteries on your own.<br /><br />The acting in this show is top notch, probably one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen for television next to Battlestar Galactica and this season's Flash Forward. With a cast that includes Naveen Andrews (Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Matthew Fox (Party of Five), Daniel Dae Kim (Crash), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), and Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings) they found a cast that more than excels at the challenge of bringing this story and these characters to life. Of all the great actors on this show, the one that really stuck out for me though is Terry O'Quinn (Primal Fear, Tombstone, The Rocketeer). As John Locke, O'Quinn really makes you feel every tick of this character, and with a character like Locke, who starts off making you wonder about his secrets and his allegiances that's not an easy task. As the season carries on you see him bring out the psychological and emotional scars buried beneath the confident exterior of the character.<br /><br />If you haven't checked out Lost I highly recommend that you jump on this wagon. The first season is a brilliant ride that will keep you guessing and engrossed in the characters. Since I've started the first season I've had a hard time putting the series down to do or watch anything else. I can't wait to get started on the second season now!<br /><br />5/5</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>To me, LOST is the best TV series of the third millennium, so far. Prison Break comes as a closed second and Heroes is closely behind. I am very surprised that TV series can be made this good these days when cost cutting and declining standards seems to be the norm everywhere else. But, not in the world of television, it seems.<br /><br />LOST employs a cast of dozens to tell a big story. How big the story is? I don't know yet, it seems that we could have another 10 seasons and not come close to an end. But, slowly, what begins as your run of the mill airliner crash survivors story keeps adding layers on top of layers, expands, branches out in unexpected directions and, episode after episode after episodes keeps us mesmerized, guessing, mourning those lost and left behind, surprised, intrigued and always ready for more.<br /><br />The first season starts a bit slowly and, speaking for myself, I didn't care much for the first couple of episodes. I will not reveal the plot but, it's probably proper to note that you are going to see peoples struggling to overcome extreme circumstances, stories of friendship, solidarity, spontaneous cooperation, the inevitable conflicts between people of many different upbringings, chasing different dreams, sometimes competing for the same rewards. Facing danger, the unknown and, what appears to be, the incomprehensible, the initial state of anarchy spontaneously gains textures and a fragile structure.<br /><br />The first season is mostly about our heroes' survival and their struggle to go back to what used to be the `normal' life. Scenes of life and struggle on the island are often interrupted by increasingly disturbing flashbacks and puzzling hints that little that's going on is accidental, random or `normal'. The survivors are tied to each other in most surprising ways and, little by little, the supernatural, the mysterious and the plain unbelievable begin to manifest. We learn that the island is not what it seemed to be. There are monsters and unexpected beasts roaming in the woods, there are hints of other inhabitants and the familiar laws of nature don't seem to always apply.<br /><br />LOST has an incredibly well-written story line, great acting and it's shown to us in the highest quality picture and sound. It is, without a doubt, one of the best TV series I've watched in a long, long time. If you haven't watched the weekly episodes on TV, you should consider yourself lucky. I haven't either and I am glad I didn't have to wait, week after week, for yet another mystery to solve itself in the next episodes.<br /><br />If, after watching the first season, you felt it was entertainment time well spent, then you should definitely acquire the subsequent seasons because it only gets better. A LOT BETTER. Seriously.<br /><br />Oh, and talking about viewing addiction, it took me a couple of weeks to devour Season One. As I was done with it, Amazon made available a Seasons 1-3 bundle and I bought that. I finished seasons 2 and 3 in the next couple of weeks. Season 4? It only took me 2 nights.<br /><br />Oh, and, one more thing that you should keep in mind - but you will constantly fail at it: NOTHING is what what it seems to be and nobody is what he/she claims to be.<br /><br />Happy viewing :)</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>is just to get you hooked and believe me once you watch it, you will be.

After leaving Sydney, Austrailia the plane crashes and the men and women are left to defend for their own. Of the dozen or so main characters there includes:<br /><br />A young doctor by the name of Jack who came to Austrailia to find his father who disappeared only to find out he died and wants to bring his body back for burial.<br /><br />A young woman by the name of Kate who is shown as a criminal with a mysterious past of running from the law.<br /><br />A sarcastic "Don't need help from anybody" man with the name of Sawyer. He tends to stick to robbing the wreckage of the plane for money and jewels in case they survive.<br /><br />A construction worker by the name of Michale who wants to build a raft to take him and his small son Walt to safety.<br /><br />An obese, yet really funny, lottery winner by the name of Hurley, who seems to think that he is a jynx.<br /><br />A young Japanese couple that cant speak English [Well, at least one of them can't]<br /><br />A musician by the name of Charlie [You might recognize him from Lord of the Rings] who is addicted to drugs.<br /><br />A young woman by the name of Claire who is nine or so months pregnant.<br /><br />A young man and his spoiled step sister.<br /><br />A very interesting character by the name of Jon Locke who was a handicap yet regains the feeling in his legs and learns the secret of the Island.<br /><br />And last but not least an Iraq Republican Guard by the name of Sayid. [My favorite character]<br /><br />While there are about 30 other survivors, the show tends to stick to the main group, but there are several episodes that show more survivors in the main stories.<br /><br />Besides the flashback episodes that show each and everyone's trouble past with that character shining in their own ways, there are also numerous plots that take place:<br /><br />From the raft being built and vandalism occuring, to another woman of a different group of survivors who has been on the island for 16+ years, to even the main plot of having a huge monster that you can never see, roaming in the forests.<br /><br />We dont see what the monster looks like but we can certainly hear what it sounds like in several of the episodes. However the monster doesn't appear in all the episdoes, in fact, he actually disappears for several weeks worth of episodes and only untill the secret of the island is starting to come into the story does he make his return.<br /><br />There are also the big, big mysteries of a hatch found in the middle of the woods that is extremely hard to open, and also the mystery of a group of other people who are living in the woods and wants to kill the survivors. Both these two mysteries added to the suspense of the last episdoe, as the hatch was finally opened and the strange people finally showed up.<br /><br />The episodes are really powerful, and some are even more captivating than others. I find that the shows that revolve around Locke, Sayid, and Sawyer are the best ones, especially with Locke. This show was great, can't wait for the realease, and I definately reccomend you watch the second season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Lost was rejected by some viewers just due to all the re-runs. Which is probably the only excuse anyone could come up with to not like this show. It's a poor excuse too. Sure re-runs are frustrating when you're hooked on a show and want new episodes. However I remember times when Buffy or Smallville were on re-runs for weeks and weeks. I've even seen 1 star reviews here for that reason and it's just dumb. Every show has a big ammount of re-run breaks after a certain time. If you're hating on this show for that reason and then you're a baby and this show is too good for you lol.<br /><br />  Lost offers engaging stories, a fine cast, interesting plot twists and some of the best acting I've seen on tv in years. A plane crashes on an island and 40 people survive. There's only 14 of them that we really get to know though. Matthew Foxx plays a doctor named Jack who takes charge of the situation. Whenever there's a problem people come to him. Whether someone needs to be attended to or if they're out of bottled water, he's the man they complain to. Since he always does the right thing, he's not a bad guy to have in charge. There's also Kate (Evangeline Lilly) who's a misunderstood women on the run. She and Jack  strike a friendship right away with some friendly flirtation. They'll probably get together sooner or later. But she also has Sawyer (Josh Holloway) as an option . He's a slick wiseass who's also misunderstood and fighting inner-demons as well. Both can have trouble getting people to trust them too.<br /><br />  Although Jack, Kate and Sawyer have their love triangle going on. This isn't no mushy soup opera. It's about people who were lost before they even got on the island.  Because they were lost almost mentally and  find themselves again on that island. We get flashbacks showing how their lives weren't exactly great before the island. Plus the show is brilliant how it handles prejudice and humanity. How people get things done quicker if they learn to get along.<br /><br />  It also has it's supernatural side with something lurking in the jungle ripping survivors of the crash to shreds. Plus with a crippled survivor finding he can walk after the crash  on the island. A pregnant women who gets told by a Psychic that only she can raise her baby and that it's special. Also polar bears  are on the island causing havoc and no one knows how they got there. They also have to contend with dangerous mysterious people that weren't even on the plane.<br /><br />  Lost is the most daring and unpredictable show to land on tv in a long long time. This review doesn't even give the show justice to how good it is. There's so much to cover but it's better to just let you see for yourself if you haven't already. If you gave up on this show because of re-runs then you should get this dvd to see how much of a mistake you made.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) wanders around an isolated beach for a few minutes and then realizes other people need help. He rushes to a pregnant woman, Claire (Emilie de Ravin) who is being comforted by an overweight man, Hurley (Jorge Garcia). Soon, people realize they have survived a plane crash. They manage to move Claire right before an engine explodes. Eventually, the survivors learn that Jack is a doctor and they look to him for leadership and guidance. Jack is attracted to a mysterious woman, Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) seems to be unaffected by the crash, hoarding valuable items (aspirin, glasses, etc.), using them as currency. A father and son, Michael and Walt (Harold Perrineau and Malcolm David Kelley) are working on their strained relationship while trying to survive the island. Sayid (Naveen Andrews) is a sort of counterpart to Jack, providing expertise on electronics and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) seems to have all the survivalist instincts they will need to survive. A Korean couple (Daniel Dae Kim and Yoon-jin Kim) struggle to communicate with the English speaking survivors. Finally, Boone and Shannon (Ian Somerhalder and Maggie Grace), step-siblings, struggle to get along. As they learn some of the secrets of their new home, they also learn that each of the castaways have secrets. Which will prove the more dangerous?<br /><br />When I first heard the concept for "Lost" (the complete "Season 1" is available on DVD), I was intrigued. A dramatic "Gilligan's Island"? A fictionalized "Survivor"? I'm usually willing to give even the most far-fetched ideas a try. If they don't prove compelling, I tune out after one episode, but if they manage to lure me in, I'll stick around. "Lost" lured me in, but in my mind, I promised that the first time they tried to make a coconut radio, I was tuning out.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was the quality of "Lost". Fine, compelling performances married to good writing hooked me almost instantly. This is the type of show we have recently had to turn to HBO or Showtime for refuge. Granted, the characters never swear and nudity is non-existent, but network television has shied away from multi-episode storylines. On most dramas, everything has to happen in the space of 44 minutes. Next week, new story, new 44 minutes. (Yes, an hour long drama contains about 16 minutes of commercials.)  In "Lost", the characters still don't know everything about their new island home, and the second season is set to start in a few weeks.<br /><br />The first episode begins with the survivors on the beach. As they interact, fully realizing their situation, we see flashbacks to the moments on the passenger jet before it crashed. Each person was in a different area, so they all have different memories of what happened. What soon becomes apparent is that all of these survivors were in the same section of the plane. Where did the other sections of the plane end up? Where there any other survivors? In one episode, a married woman sits at the edge of the beach in shock. Jack walks over to comfort her. He learns that her husband was in the back of the plane. Jack tells her he is sure that he didn't suffer. "Oh, he's not dead". "But there were no other survivors." "They probably think that about us as well."<br /><br />Throughout the season, creators J.J. Abrams ("Alias"), Jeffrey Lieber and Damon Lindelof have peppered strange incidents into the storyline. The survivors have had a couple of run ins with a large beast only they have seen. They have also killed a polar bear. A polar bear on a desert island? And they found a French woman, the survivor of a shipwreck 16 years earlier, who keeps talking about "them".<br /><br />The bit about the people on the other parts of the airplane is ingenious. From a dramatic standpoint, it gives the show creators license to introduce new characters and new storylines. If things get a little stale with the core group of survivors, someone can walk dazedly out of the jungle and we'll accept it.<br /><br />From a production standpoint, the producers have done a brilliant thing. I'm sure many fans will disagree, but a core member of the group was killed off in season 1, providing a lot of drama. It also told the rest of the cast that they are not expendable. Yes, the story is set on a deserted island but we can introduce new people and we can kill off boring, stale characters. The producers sent a loud and clear message. "We will not be held ransom by huge salary demands", something that happens with almost every hit show.<br /><br />The strange incidents are compelling because they aren't consistent. One episode may have a brief encounter with the large beast, another may have Locke trying to unearth a metal hatch in the ground before returning to the main story. This works, because it keeps us guessing.<br /><br />Watching a show about a group of people on a desert island is interesting, but it can also become a bit stifling. Each episode tells basically two stories; the current events of the survivors on the island and a back-story involving one of the main characters, depicting the events leading up to them boarding the plane. For instance, if Jack is facing a weighty decision on the island, the story is intercut with one of the back stories involving his father. A back-story about Hurley winning the lottery proves to have a strange and unexpected connection to the survivors on the island. These back stories help to open up the show, taking us off of the island, maintaining our interest. Even more important, all of these back stories are connected to the main story, that of the survivors. It would be a completely different beast if the stories had no connection and nowhere near as compelling.<br /><br />"Lost" is a fine example of what television can do when everything works. If you haven't already seen the first season, this is your chance to catch up. Don't get lost when the second season begins.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This series was a incredible intricate affair. This is how it begins and they crash onto the mystical island.  They DO NOT ALL DIE, as some people mistakenly later claimed after the end of series six. In fact , their adventures on the island are all too real. And they begin here and on blu ray you get the same extras but the picture is just fantastic , much better than on the dvd. I think that this series is worth your time. And you can now watch it all on blu ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I write in 2010, as someone who had never heard of the series until it was recently suggested to me as something worth seeing in my, by-now long hiatus, in television watching. It also appears that it had survived until this year terminated its run.<br />Seeing this first season now, I can recognize that it had promise even that first year: the creative staff knew how to create evening soap opera and the director and cast had the talent, overall, to put their ideas into convincing performances. That is not to say that anyone was challenging Sir Lawrence Olivier's pre-eminence as master of the English speaking stage, but mostly the strength was where it was needed. I have no ideas what troubles were devised in the remaining years, but these refugees from civilization stranded on an island, sure had plenty of nicely suspenseful ones. Seeing the season without commercial breaks, without delay of a week between episodes, puts a production to a very tough test it was not devised to surmount. The breaks are built into the structure of each program. However, the production bore up well. Obviously, there is a family resemblance inevitably built in to make the show somewhat like other good (and bad) stranded on an island stories, but rarely does the material seem stale.<br />I can commend the show to any television viewer who likes to immerse him-or her-self in the challenges to life that that a threatened community must face.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>Ranking up there with great movies, Lost has redefined the scope and quality of what you can do with a live-action television series and is easily one of the best tv smashes of all time.  The viewing experience is enhanced greatly through the boxed sets as opposed to watching an hour a week on the regular broadcasts - widescreen high-definition shows uninterrupted by commercials, with the ability to watch several episodes in a night, and, if you wish, an entire season in a relatively short span.  And at a price like this (listed at just $16.99 as I'm writing this), this is just too good a value to pass up for anyone who doesn't own the sets yet.  Note: the 'rewatch' quality of Lost is a lot higher than with a lot of other cases, as seeing earlier episodes with the hindsight of knowing how those early events tie into later developments, just makes for a great experience.  If you haven't started the Lost series, or have only seen sporadic episodes, it's much better to start off from the beginning and see everything in order than just jumping right into where the tv show is at now.  That would be kind of like starting an epic novel at page 700 and trying to figure out what's going on.<br /><br />  The basic premise of Lost is well-known by now and simple: a commercial airliner crashlands on an uncharted tropical island and the survivors have to try and carry on, keep themselves alive until rescue comes or try to find a way off the island themselves.  How the story actually unfolds, of course, is anything but simple.  The first, double-length episode is a perfect example.  For almost its whole running time, it focuses as if it were, in fact, just that simple: the survivors, confused, afraid, and sometimes injured, try to survive in the immediate wake of the crash, with chaos reigning and the plane wreckage still aflame.  People have to come together very quickly.  It's only after things have settled down, that night, at the very end of the pilot episode, that the first real sign comes to the survivors and the viewers that things aren't as cut and dried as they might seem, with the classic view of what happens off in the jungle (which I'm not going to spoil here for anybody who hasn't seen it).<br /><br />  Also in the first episode, the flashbacks begin to the lives of the various passengers before they boarded the plane.  The continuing flashback usage was seen by some as annoying, and even I initially thought they might be over-using it just a bit, but you realize later on how vital everything is and how it all ties together.  In fact, it may be less accurate to view Lost as a story being told, with the help of a lot of flashbacks; than to view it as a story that's being told in more than one time frame simultaneously.  I'd seen this technique used in comic books and some movies (it's since become more prevalent in movies than it was) but I don't know if any ongoing tv series had ever tried to do this before Lost.<br /><br />  Few of the passengers know each other before the crash, and the initial episodes focus a lot on the early day-to-day survival, the early forming of friendships, sometimes the seeds of relationships, and in some cases rivalries and enmities.  Some of the characters come into this with volatile personalities (yes, that includes Sawyer), others (like Jack and Hurley) ty in different ways to act as the glue that will hold the fledging group together, some (like Kate and Sayid) have secret pasts that will figure into things after a while, and some, most notably John Locke, quickly come up with their own, sometimes way off-the-beaten-path, ideas of what the group's priorities and long-term goals should be.<br /><br />  Clues begin coming that make it more evident that things aren't as simple as a plane accidentally coming down on an uncharted island.  For starters, it quickly becomes apparant that the island is awfully Large for something that's supposedly not on any map.  Things happen that would seem to indicate that the survivors aren't the only ones on the island, and other things seem strangely out of place, even unnatural.  The first seeds of the idea that it isn't coincidence that this particular group of strangers has come to be on this island at this time, are planted, as Locke comes up with a lot of ideas concerning fate.  And the season continues on to a spectacular cliffhanger season finale, which will become the standard with the show.  Lost looks and feels like an extra-long big budget movie, but one of the well-written, well-executed big budget movies, not a movie with high budget but low in other factors.  One of the most skillful things about the overall series is how some seemingly minor incident will happen, and only much later (sometimes several seasons later) be revealed as tying into other events in a big way.<br /><br />  Lost got me to re-asses television shows as a whole.  I don't watch a lot of tv programming as opposed to the number of DVDs I watch, but Lost opened me up to the idea that there might be some good stuff on there I was missing.  I like the boxed sets of series better than seeing the regular broadcasts with their commercials and with there often being several weeks between episodes.  Renting disc one of a series and then buying the box set if disc one was good enough seems like a good way to go about it.  But even as I've become more familiar with some of what's been on tv, and enjoy some of it a lot, there are still relatively few programs past or present that can come close to Lost.  This is up there among my favorite movies, or favorite stories from any other medium (comics, novels, etc.).  Very highly reccommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>It is not too much to say that "Lost, Season One" is an astonishing television event.  Somehow this series manages to avoid all of the pitfalls that usually lead to the downfall of a television series.  The acting is first-rate and the storylines are engrossing and vibrant.  This is an imaginative show that constitutes first-rate entertainment.<br /><br />The theme is simple yet subtle.  A plane headed from Sydney Australia to Los Angeles USA goes off-course and crashes on an uninhabited island in the Pacific.  There are 41 survivors.  There are many strange things about the island, to put it mildly, and these anomalies become increasingly apparent as the story unfolds. (The most obvious anomaly is that it becomes apparent very shortly that there is little prospect of rescue.)  Further, there are connections between the passengers that most of them were unaware of.  The use of flashbacks concerning each of the principal characters is brilliantly done, and this often misused device is devastatingly effective here and serves to weave the story together.  The overall effect is a series that is incredibly absorbing and addictive.  The basic theme of the story, subtly recurring is "Don't tell me what I can't do...!"<br /><br />The acting is first rate.  Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack Sheppard is particularly good, but many of the others are also superb.  Naveen Andrews as Sayid is an especial favorite of mine, as are Harold Perrineau as Michael and Evangeline Lilly as Kate.  Every viewer will have his or her own favorites. As the series progressed I found myself liking Jorge Garcia as "Hurley" more and more.<br /><br />Rarely has television succeeded in producing a series of such quality.  Highly recommended.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>I am, traditionally, wary of extremely popular things. Many of the shows and movies that command the #1 (or #2, or #3) spot on TV leave me wondering if I'm some sort of defective for disliking what everyone else apparently adores. For once, I'm a part of the group: I like Lost. It's not the best show I've ever seen, but the productions values are very nice, the plot is interesting, and the characters are likeable without being perfect (morally, at least; physically they are still mostly too pretty for the real world. Which is why they live on TV...but I digress.)<br /><br />Other good things: a willingness to tackle issues most TV shows wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and a Siberian tiger pushing, an amazing cast, and have I mentioned the writing? The camera work is fantastic! I realy love the cinematography and the flasbacks, for once in a show, are an actual treat which I anticipate instead of the usual filler and annoyances. I love that the intro isn't some 5 minuite music video advertisement, but a 5 second clip of the title - that's so cool it gives me shivvers. And I love the setting. It's lovely.<br /><br />My one fear is that it'll all end in disgusted fans. A show like this must have a fitting end, a conclusion, a finale. You can't keep going just because your ratings are up and people will buy it. You have a plot with mysteries - as every mystery fan knows, there is a time and a place for everything, and all myseries must be solved.<br /><br />So - as much as I love the show - until it ends I'll worry. If they do it right, and end it, then come up with another show with the same high production values and excellent writing the producer and director will have gained a big credit account with me, and I'll be a devoted and trusting fan. If they draw it out and mess it up and get tangled I'll chalk it up as another great idea ruined by shoddy execution and go back to watching my reruns.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Hopes were not terribly high for "Lost," the action-drama about a planeful of castaways lost on a tropical island. "Gilligan's Island" all over again? Not quite. This mysterious show rapidly turned itself into a runaway hit. Mystery, drama, the supernatural and horror seep into this series, turning it into one of the most intriguing shows on television.<br /><br />The series opens with a wrecked plane on a beach, surrounded by panicking people who manage to escape the wreckage. Jack (Matthew Fox) manages to group the refugees into a makeshift camp on the shore -- but soon they hear strange noises and see palm trees being trampled by a gargantuan monster. And when he ventures into the jungle, with the mysterious Kate (Evangeline Lilly) and junkie rocker Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), they find the still-living pilot. The pilot reveals that they are hundreds of miles off course, and no one will be able to find him. Then he gets eaten by an unseen monster.<br /><br />Now the island is occupied by a motley band, including a strange warrior-sage with a knife-throwing knack, a traumatized con man, a pregnant girl whose baby holds a secret, a secretive Korean couple, a snobby rich girl and her exasperated brother, an Iraqi ex-soldier, and a "dude"-talking chubby guy who has a dark secret of his own. Despite Jack's best efforts, the group splits into two camps, and tensions grow between them.<br /><br />And there are even worse things coming -- the survivors are not the only ones on the island. A possibly crazy Frenchwoman (Mira Furlan) is hiding somewhere in the jungle, and the murderous "Ethan" kidnaps and nearly kills two of the survivors. The island itself has mysteries -- mysterious monsters, voices in the woods, radio towers, a metal hatch in the jungle ground, and a string of numbers that bring madness and ill fortune...<br /><br />Yes, it's a weird show. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one. J.J. Adams, best known for "Alias," outdoes his first hit TV show with something totally different. The best way to describe it is as "Swiss Family Robinson," as written by Stephen King.<br /><br />The gorgeous Hawaiian landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline. Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense -- the mysterious monster (a dinosaur?) is only briefly seen by the characters, and nobody knows exactly what it is. Nor are we sure who has been there, or what is up with the island. Adams keeps viewers guessing by slowly peeling away the layers.<br /><br />What's really interesting is that "Lost" is truly an ensemble show -- Adams gives every character a chance to shine, and flashbacks reveal what makes them tick. Some, like ex-con Kate, are a bit more mysterious than others, but some like the Korean marrieds and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer get a lot more dimension and humanity.<br /><br />Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor. But it's the secondary actors that really catch your attention: Dominic Monaghan gives a simply amazing performance as Charlie, especially when Charlie goes through withdrawal, Jorge Garcia is equally good at comedy ("Dude, that was a Jedi moment!") and drama, and Terry O'Quinn is stellar as the enigmatic cubicle-worker-turned-jungle-warrior. Evangeline Lilly gives the debut performance of a lifetime, as tormented criminal Kate.<br /><br />The blu-ray edition amps up the visual effects, especially in the jungle and with special effects. And the blu-ray basically has the same ol' extras -- episode commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, making-of stuff, bloopers, deleted scenes, extra flashbacks, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />"Lost" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird, it's definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>Season one was great. I mean really, really great. And yet it seems so long ago now, doesn't it? A jarring jet crash, polar bears in the tropics, an invisible monster, hatches buried in the ground, a plane full of mummified heroin smugglers, a crippled man rising and walking, a scary villain kidnapping a heavily pregnant young woman for purposes unknown, a spoiled blonde rich chick bickering 90210-ishly with her stepbrother, a Republican Guard veteran who turns out to be a good guy---in the George W. Bush Age? Whoa! Nothing like it had ever been seen before! Season one was golden, and here it all began, the original concept, the original cast, just an unlikely group of jet crash survivors and their addictively intriguing back stories. Lost has come a long way since season one, but it's great to look back on the beginnings. Also unlike most TV series on DVD, the extras are actually worth watching. There's the eight-minute long Art of Matthew Fox, in which the actor does voice over of photos he took of the cast, crew, locations, from season one. There's also the cast gathered at Comicon, shots of the massive undertaking that was acquiring, dismantling and shipping an actual jumbo jet to Hawaii, all with the intent to make the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 that much more realistic. All the episodes of the first season of Lost are here, plus about eight hours of special features. Yep, it's engrossing entertainment that'll keep you busy for weeks: just don't forget to come up for air sometimes.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Before I begin my review of this show's actual content, let me make one thing perfectly clear: LOST is the greatest sci-fi/drama show I have ever watched.  Now, this is saying something, as I am also a huge fan of Star Trek and The X-Files.  From the first episode, however, LOST hooked me in with its mysterious plots, emotional drama, and flash-back storytelling method.<br /><br />In a nutshell, LOST tells the story of a group of people who survived a plane crash and now find themselves on a deserted island, with little chance for rescue.  Yet, this show is NOT a dramatic version of Survivor.  Producer J.J. Abrams makes this clear right from the get-go, as on the first night on the island a dinosaur-sounding monster invades the group's camp and adds a mysteriousness to the entire situation.  From there, the survivors come into contact with a polar bear, a French woman who has been broadcasting an SOS on the island for many years, and a metal hatch buried deep in the ground.  Obviously, the island is not as "innocent" as it would seem.<br /><br />Besides the X-Files-like plot twists (but LOST actually executes its plot better than the X-Files because it always follows up on all key plot elements), the stories of a selected group of the plane crash survivors add the emotional drama to the show.  By flashing-back to their lives before the clash, it is revealed how certain characters wound up on the plane to begin with.  Also, the undercurrent beneath every flash-back implies that each "Lostie" is somehow connected to each other, and perhaps they are even "brought" to their mysterious island for a particular reason.  I would go into more details about some of the survivors' flashbacks, but too many spoilers would abound if I did.  Suffice it to say that you WILL be emotionally "hooked" by each and every one of their stories, and your emotion will be compounded by the surprise endings (almost Twilight Zone-esque) of most of the flashbacks.<br /><br />To conclude, LOST is the perfect blend of emotional drama, intense action, and mind-bending mystery.  This first season primarily serves to introduce the important characters (through the ingenious flash-back method) and scratch the surface of the mysteries the island has to offer.  If you purchase this produce, I recommend buying the second season right now as well, as you WILL NOT want to wait after this season's cliffhanger ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Lost - The Complete First Season is a good start to this sci-fi fan-favorite.

With its intricately planned plots, fully fleshed out characters with well-thought out back stories, and a wild premise that is brilliantly executed, this is a show with truly universal appeal.  It's enough to entertain the "we love action!" crowd, but there is also a deeper level to this show, which often works on metaphor as it connects the `main story' of Lost to the characters' histories, utilizing flashbacks in each episode.<br /><br />Unlike J. J. Abram's last series (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5V8DG">Alias</a>), you won't be checking the time while you're watching the first season of "Lost."  Every one of these twenty-two episodes is completely enthralling, focusing on the history and current situation of one character at a time.  Even the less interesting characters are easily able to hold up their own episodes.  There is always more to find out about each character as the seasonal arc builds, never giving the audience too little or too much.  Because that's what this show is really based on: mystery.  Be warned, Lost is not, I repeat, not for the impatient.  The arc of this series is based on the mystery of this island and the people who have landed on it, and every single time one of those nagging questions is answered, we are given a new question.  From the mystifying hatch, to the captivating character of John Locke, to the island itself, the sheer need to find out `what the heck is going on' will drive you through this season.<br /><br />Take all of that good stuff and add a cast of actors with rare talent and the most beautiful on-location scenes you'll find on network television, and you have the phenomenon that is the first season of "Lost."  Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QDLSR0">Heroes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SULWJA">Veronica Mars</a>, this is one of the strongest television series we've seen in recent years.<br /><br />9/10</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>The first season of Lost was fascinating television ... or at least it seemed like that.<br />From the get-go this series was unlike anything I'd seen on television, a brilliant mix of powerful human drama and mysterious science-fiction adventure and suspense. It was so exciting. TV was exciting again.<br /><br />I have to add in retrospect that the second season was disappointing because it seemed the writers were unsure of which direction to go, and they just kept adding mystery after mystery, leaving us with endless questions. I stopped watching after Season 2 because the series could not live up to its first season's promises (and the seasons were getting alarmingly shorter anyway).<br /><br />As for season one, well, for a bunch of Wednesday evenings in 2004, I was absolutely enthralled. I actually looked forward to a television program; a drama, no less. But in the back of my mind there was a seed of doubt. So the promise that "Lost" held to intrigue me slipped away into smoke, vanishing into thin air. I didn't even tune in to Season 3. I'd had enough disappointment and endless unanswered questions.<br /><br />But the potential and possibility presented in the first season was unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I don't watch many TV shows, but every once in a while I like to wathc the first episode or 2 of a new show.  This has to be one of the best shows ever.  I have not been this deep in a show since OZ.  The character development of every character is explored to unravel things that happened in their life to show why it contributed to them being on the island.  The monster is pretty intriguing and the storylines get better with each episode.  My favorite character is Lock.  His life has been branched out to hit on everything possible that could have happened to him.  I am still trying to figure out how he regained life to his legs, lost them, then regained full strength again.<br /><br />Season 2 is not near as good as this, but if you wanna watch season 3 later on and wanna get what's going on this season, season 1 is a must see.  This ranks right up there with all my favortie shaows over like Oz, Newsradio, Taxi, and Batman the Animated series, so if you found any of those entertaining you will like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I have to say the set is worth owning. There is some 'silliness' in the beginning, where Jack seems to be the only one running around helping people, etc., but the writer put in enough hooks to keep one watching. We're also pulled into each individual life with flashbacks, but not so many that it bogs the story down. It's fast enough that you might miss details, so watch them more than once.

In fact, I haven't done this since I was a child. I remember counting the minutes until the next show on "The fall guy", "CHiPs" or "Automan" began. After I grew up and time seemed scarse each year, I simply lost my interest for such series (although I rented the "Simpsons" seasons a while ago).<br /><br />And then, "Lost" came. As I was zapping through channels, AXN's short preview caught my attention. Being a fan of "Lord of flies", "And then there were none" and other such stories where a bunch of previously unacquainted people have to live together in a remote place, making life possible with what they have at hand, I decided that I would give this new series a try.<br /><br />From the first scenes of the plane crash, to the choice of the characters, the beautiful locations and the unusual things happening along the island (a polar bear in a tropical place!) I was hooked. I not only watched this first season in its entirety, but browsed through the net wanting to know more about everything related to the series.<br /><br />The writing is great, the episode structure is intelligent, mixing what is happening on the island (new discoveries, smoking monsters, antique planes crashed full of heroine, the "Others") to the tales of the lives of the characters previously to the plane crash. What were the reasons for each one of them to be in Sidney traveling to Los Angeles at that moment of their lives? How are they related to each other (because, in a way or another, they are)? The obvious attention production spends with every detail is also remarkable. Add to all that Evengeline Lilly and the show is almost perfect. Of course, there may be lots of inconsistencies, plot-holes and other absurdities in the series, but this time I'm not looking for them, I'm just watching each episode like I was a kid again, and having lots of fun.<br /><br />My only fear is a stalling in the development of the story. But in the first season it did not happen, as the variety of the characters and their relations proved to be a good source of plots to the series. Hope that the second season is as good as this first one. So, a solid five-star it is.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>When I first saw promos for ABC's Lost, I was very skeptical about how the writers were going to carry on a show about people stranded on a tropical island for a few years, let alone only a season.  I thought that there was only so many stories they could do if this was a serious drama.  The show premiered to rave reviews, but I never had the time to watch.  Then one of my friends told me a little bit about the show, and it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.  Oh man, is this ever a good show, and was I ever wrong about problems with stories!  In an inspired move, every episode focuses on a character, and shows scenes from their life in flashback (except for the pilot and season finale episodes, which show scenes of multiple characters).  These flashbacks reveal defining moments in the characters' lives that show why they act the way they do on the island.  With a main cast of 14 people (or castaways), there are a lot of interesting, sad, and dark stories to tell.<br /><br />Minor spoilers below.<br /><br />When we meet the characters in the pilot, we think we know them, but when we see their flashbacks, we get the rug pulled out from under our feet, for no one is who they seem to be.  While about 48 people survived, only 14 are focused upon.  The 14 main castaways are: Jack (Matthew Fox), a heroic doctor, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a shy girl who develops a crush on Jack, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), a British rocker with a drug problem, Hurley (Jorge Garcia), a large man with a large heart, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and his wife Sun (Yujin Kim), a Korean couple who initially isolate themselves from the rest of the group, Claire (Emilie de Ravin), a pregnant Australian woman without a father for her unborn baby, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a low-life who hoards the supplies from the wrecked plane so that he can barter them with the people who need them, Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley), who have just been reunited after Walt's mother died, Boone (Ian Somerhalder) and his sister Shannon (Maggie Grace), who constantly bicker, Sayid (Naveen Andrews), an Iraqi who fought against the US in the Gulf War and is attacked due to racism, and finally Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a mysterious man who doesn't seem to mind being stuck on the island.  Of course, those are the characters that we think we meet in the pilot episodes.  The people that they truly are become revealed over the course of the season.<br /><br />In addition to learning about the castaways' pasts, their present situation is dealt with superbly as well.  In the first few episodes, they run out of food and water, and they have to figure out what to do.  Later on, they discover that they aren't alone on the island when Sayid meets Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a French woman who's been on the island for 16 years and claims that there are "Others" on the island who plot against her.  When mysterious things begin happening to the islanders, they begin to suspect that Rousseau is right.<br /><br />However, there are a fair share of miraculous events that occur that aren't the work of the Others.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, as they are too good to reveal in this review.  There are also plenty of mysteries on the island that keep both the characters and the audience perplexed.  What exactly do the others want?  What is the significance of the black and white rocks?  Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?  Where are they?<br /><br />This was an amazing season of television, and it ended with an amazing season finale that is keeping all of us begging for more.  This is a quality show worth checking out.  I will say that it is slightly overhyped, but Lost deserves a good 95% of the hype that it receives.  See you on the island...</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I've been watching Lost this past TV season. The season finale was last night. I have to say that this show is one of the few TV shows which offers intelligent, detailed storytelling these days. The cast is strong and varied as well. The episodes all offer flashbacks to previous events in the characters' lives, before the airplane crash which left them stranded on a rather strange island in the Pacific, and this has a way of making the characters richer...fuller. Not all of the characters are likeable; all have human flaws and issues which make the whole story more real.<br /><br />The supernatural strangeness of the island also has a way of pulling you in. From the character which shouldn't be able to walk, but does, to the airplane wreckage which is pulled away into the ocean, leaving no traces, to the mysterious numbers which have drawn people to the island, you know that something's not right, but the characters have little time to spend to figure it out, as they are struggling to survive. And struggle they must, for limited resources, for shelter, and against the island's monster and the islands other, mysterious, vicious inhabitants.<br /><br />Now, with the first season over, and few of the mysteries really resolved (though, one of them, being what the island's monster looks like, has been at least partially answered), and I've been left wanting more.<br /><br />It's a long wait until the fall.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Before I begin my review of this show's actual content, let me make one thing perfectly clear: LOST is the greatest sci-fi/drama show I have ever watched. Now, this is saying something, as I am also a huge fan of Star Trek and The X-Files. From the first episode, however, LOST hooked me in with its mysterious plots, emotional drama, and flash-back storytelling method.<br /><br />In a nutshell, LOST tells the story of a group of people who survived a plane crash and now find themselves on a deserted island, with little chance for rescue. Yet, this show is NOT a dramatic version of Survivor. Producer J.J. Abrams makes this clear right from the get-go, as on the first night on the island a dinosaur-sounding monster invades the group's camp and adds a mysteriousness to the entire situation. From there, the survivors come into contact with a polar bear, a French woman who has been broadcasting an SOS on the island for many years, and a metal hatch buried deep in the ground. Obviously, the island is not as "innocent" as it would seem.<br /><br />Besides the X-Files-like plot twists (but LOST actually executes its plot better than the X-Files because it always follows up on all key plot elements), the stories of a selected group of the plane crash survivors add the emotional drama to the show. By flashing-back to their lives before the clash, it is revealed how certain characters wound up on the plane to begin with. Also, the undercurrent beneath every flash-back implies that each "Lostie" is somehow connected to each other, and perhaps they are even "brought" to their mysterious island for a particular reason. I would go into more details about some of the survivors' flashbacks, but too many spoilers would abound if I did. Suffice it to say that you WILL be emotionally "hooked" by each and every one of their stories, and your emotion will be compounded by the surprise endings (almost Twilight Zone-esque) of most of the flashbacks.<br /><br />To conclude, LOST is the perfect blend of emotional drama, intense action, and mind-bending mystery. This first season primarily serves to introduce the important characters (through the ingenious flash-back method) and scratch the surface of the mysteries the island has to offer. If you purchase this produce, I recommend buying the second season right now as well, as you WILL NOT want to wait after this season's cliffhanger ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>To me, "Lost" is a watershed moment in TV history.  When I first saw the promos for the show back last season I wondered how the heck are they going to make a drama on people crashing on an island.  Gilligan's Island aside, this is not a screwball comedy nor is it the 1960's anymore.  I hazzard to say that TV audiences are more sophisticated today althouth shows like "Fear Factor" may belie that conjecture.  I'd not watched many dramas in recent years (not counting fantastic shows like Buffy & The X-files) as I grew weary of the ER-type dramas that go on and on with nothing ever really happening.<br /><br />Lost only goes to prove what can be done with talened writers, directors,and for the most part, no-name actors.  The realy trick behind Lost was giving us one major plot line and then branching that out in dozens of directions.  Suddenly by season's end you realized there was still so much more we did not know about the characters and the island itself.  The skillful blend of drama, mystery, action, fantasy, and romance is something never seen in televison. in my opinion.  The characters are, seemingly, just everyday people and react the way that the average person would in this situation.  They all have their own strenghts and weaknesses...and secrets.<br /><br />It's is these character which are as captivating as the main story itself.  The writers did a brilliant job by devoting an episode or two to each of the main chracters and fleshing out their backgroungs...not entirely...but just enough to make viewers want more.  We see Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) as a surgeon who seems to have it all in life but is unhappy and searching for something more...Kate (Evangeline Lilly) the flight's mysterious prisoner and yes, killer...Sawyer (Josh Holloway) the cocky, sarcastic, greedy rogue whose on his own lifelong quest for revenge and absolution...Hurly (Jorge Garcia) the rotund, carefree lottery winner plagued by a nefarious spate of bad luck...<br /><br />And then there is John Locke.  Terry O'Quinn had been one of my favorite character actors for years..from his roles in "The Stepfather" to playing Howard Hughes in "The Rocketeer" to his stints in the X-Files and "Millennium", I have never seen this man give anything other than a brilliant performance and he is the key to this show.  His almost spiritual connection with nature and his miraculous recovery from paralyzation make him the most intriguing character in the show.  I've a feeling that we're going to learn much more about Locke and it may not all be good.<br /><br />I'd be remiss not to mention the character of Sayid (Naveen Andrews) playing a former Iraqi soldier.  I love the character but am curious why they chose and actor of Indian heritage rather than Arabic...The mysteries of the island abound...the lost aircraft and ships...the strange creatures and sounds, the french woman, the distress signals, etc...it's a dizzying array of plot-twits which the writers and directors have skillfully juggled.<br /><br />In this wasteland of brainless reality TV, "Lost" was like a beacon of light that brought viewers back to TV for a quality show.  Hopefully its success will cause other networks to stand up and take notice at just how good a show can be if you work at it and not take the cheap way out with low-rent reality TV.  I cannot wait until the new season begins.  This is the BEST show on TV today!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>It's really tough to encapsulate what LOST is all about, as the audience hasn't been let in on exactly where the series is headed, but what it reminds me of is an apple. You've got this glossy outer layer that looks appealing and you can peel it off to reveal a soft, pulpy, sweet center. But as you bite into it, you find that there's a core, tough, edged, and in it a set of seeds that will allow you to grow more apple trees ...if you plant them.<br /><br />The glossy outer shell is the cast and what we (the viewers) think we know about them. But as we bite into the series and get a flavor for what's on the inside, we realize that there might be a worm or two. That shiny surface hid some interesting and not-so-nice things. We've got a man who was wheelchair-bound prior to the plane crash who now can walk; a young black boy who seems to be able to make things happen just by thinking about them; a doctor who's battling the past and who is the defacto leader of the group; a beautiful young woman who seems interested in the doctor, but has a past she continues to run from; a Korean couple trying to survive the ugliness of a marriage on the fritz; an overweight lottery winner who finds out that the numbers he won the lottery with are bad luck; and a slew of others.<br /><br />As we eat further into this apple, we get closer to the core, that part you can't eat but contains the seeds of new life. Like the characters, if they can get passed their own cores, they might find the seeds awaiting them. Maybe.<br /><br />The tropical island in which they crashed on seems to be a character in the series, too. It slowly reveals hidden secrets: old plane crashes, ancient shipwrecks, concrete bunkers, a crazy French woman, polar bears, and something that protects the island itself and acts very much like a dinosaur.<br /><br />Sound interesting? You bet it is.<br /><br />Some have said LOST is a combination of Gilligan's Island meets Survivor. That's rather shallow. This series has much more depth than either of those shows. It deals with how our past influences our present and, ultimately, our futures. It makes you think about what you believe the guy standing next to you is really like. And it makes you think about the core of ourselves.<br /><br />I also have to comment on the fact that the producers/directors showed some guts when they killed off a prime player 3/4 of the way through the first season. Most shows would never dream of doing that in the first season. But I was happy to see that they're keeping it "real".<br /><br />I do have to say, though, that I hope they know where they're going with the series. I hope they don't get lost themselves as they continue this great TV drama. And I also hope that they don't revert to some cliche (i.e., they're all dead and are in some sort of purgatory). I guess I'll just have to trust them and keep on watching.<br /><br />And so should you.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>I'm writing this review right after watching the season finale. This is one hell of a good show. I wish I could meet the writers of this series and ask them "Where on earth do you come up with this stuff?" That's some really good $hit they give us every week. At the end of every show, I go "F**k!" because it's so nerve wrecking thinking what's gonna happen next. The intensity is just unbelievable!<br /><br />OK, I guess I should calm down and write this review. As you can see, the excitement really gets to me. When I first heard of this show, I thought it was some lame Survivor kind of rip-of. But right after watching the first few minutes of the show, I knew I couldn't have been more wrong. This show is basically about a group of plane crash survivors. They land on this island that they know nothing of. Every episode, we see how these people survive. We are given glimpses of the person's life before the crash, and how it led them on to the flight which crashed. Most, if not all of the people's stories reveal a side of the people that we do not expect, some more surprising than others. And that's not all, the island itself is a mystery. Weird noises are heard at night, but what is making those sounds? Strange events start to occur which is impossible to explain. The survivors soon find out that they are not alone in the island, there are others but who are they? These are just some of the many things that progresses over time in this show. C'mon, how anyone could resist this show is totally beyond me.<br /><br />First of all, I have to say kudos to the writers. The stories are written in such a way, that it intrigues you, it draws you in. The anticipation to watch the following week's episode is really killing you. I am usually at the edge of my seat watching this show, literally! And I didn't even realize it until someone pointed it out to me. That's how much this show grabs you. Next, this show has a killer cast. Never have I seen a cast which works so well with the show. Their acting never fails to evoke some kind of emotion within me, and that sure doesn't happen much. You find yourself really caring what happens to each of them. Other than those factors, I just think that everything works in perfect symphony for this show, thus the 5-star rating. The lighting, the set, the directing...everything!<br /><br />In short, this is THE show to watch. The DVD set is not even released and I've already pre-ordered it. And I've never pre-ordered anything before. At a time when TV networks are flooded with teen dramas and reality crap, this is a refreshing change. I love this show, it's off to a good start and if these guys can end this series with the same intensity that they started it...this might very well be one of those classic TV shows that people talk about 10, 20 years from now. Keep up the good work Lost!</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Now that I finally got to experience "Lost" for myself I can certainly see what everyone around me is raving about. I didn't watch it when it came out because I'm not really a TV person and following shows is hard for me on weekly basis  so I decided to wait till few season finished to later watch them all in one swoop. For someone who doesn't watch the telly I plowed through this show ferociously and in six days was done with season one.<br /><br />First of all, I simply adore the lost in the woods and deserted island stories, books, films you name it. The drama that unfolds in this series has the same elements that can be found anywhere, rivalry, jealousy, hatred, love, false accusations, hidden secrets and all sorts of emotions take over characters as their time on the island seems to extend into eternity. The cast of characters is very broad but I adore how many main personalities there are because of the myriad of adventures that follow each and the groups they form themselves. One would think that staying calm and friendly would be one way to survive, but hunger, lack of protection from elements and the erratic ways the human behavior can change are no match for what really awaits for them on the island.<br /><br />The island they are stranded on is not your average lush tropical retreat. Not only is the island inhabited by strange creatures and monsters you don't really get to see at first but there is talk of others, dark beings that are either sinister people or something even worse. Best way to watch this is without knowing anything about it so I am not going to divulge any more details, let me just say that there are very few slow moments and most of the time things go from crazy to insane. My favorite characters so far are John Locke played by Terry O'Quinn  and Sayid  played by Naveen Andrews. One never knows if the characters are really pure at heart because there are so many wild twists but man this show rocks, I love it. The moment I finished watching season one I started with season two and few episodes into it I am just as enchanted as I was with the first. The revelations are incredible and the mysteries only seem to grow in size and danger. This is one show that I wish could go on forever, I hope there will be many more seasons to come.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKOMCQTTWPUI.html">A3GKOMCQTTWPUI</a><br/><p>"Lost" became an instant hit, and the series has since rewarded its faithful audience with engaging plotlines, intriguing and realistic characters, and convoluted twists which spark endless speculation. The show focuses on 14 of the original 48 survivors, with the rest of the group being made up of extras and a few recurring characters. The format of each episode focuses on the past of one of the 14 characters (in a "flashback" form), whilst simultaneously depicting events in the "present" time of the island. But of course, the island is no mere setting. The island is the omnipresent 15th character, delivering surprises and danger for the survivors at every turn. By all means, it appears to be a rather sizeable South Pacific tropical paradise, but as the survivors quickly find out, this island is far from normal. Though it feeds its inhabitants, sometimes heals or aids those in need, and keeps<br /><br />its stranded victims mysteriously well-groomed and ruggedly handsome at all times, it also contains terrifying danger and befuddling mysteries. I'd be willing to bet that most other South Pacific islands don't have polar bears, anachronistic artifacts, or large obscure beasts that sound like robotic dinosaurs roaming the inland forests and feeding on the deepest fears of their victims. But when the hope of rescue vanishes quickly, the survivors must learn how to sustain themselves within this supernatural atmosphere.<br /><br />Social roles and reputations are established among the core fourteen, and several character staples are present, though somehow given a more believable, less-caricatured spin. The pseudo-leader feigning bravery to compensate for his own inner demons, the amicable one with a criminal past, the seemingly uncaring jerk with a tragic history, the kid with strange powers and his stubborn father, the washed-up musician, or the wise intuitive elder who somehow understands the behavior of the island and goes with the flow of its will. Just a few examples, although Abrams and his creative team are, by and large, successful in making these character templates not seem derivative. Their personable behavior only makes you more curious to witness their outcome on this lost, and increasingly otherworldly, island.<br /><br />Originally, the concept for this series was formed and hammered out in just a scant few months before its premiere. Its production was incredibly fast; for example, only 3 weeks were allowed to cast nearly 2 dozen people for primary, long term, and recurring roles. By the time the series premiered, the season had only a slim order of 13 episodes for its first season. After the first four episodes garnered enormously high ratings, however, approval was given out to produce another 9 episodes, making 22 total. Filmed during the airing of the other 13, "Lost" was given a very padded out schedule in order to make up for the wait time of the latter 9; the show even went on hiatus for nearly a month in December of 2004. Despite its slightly clumsy beginnings, however, the show continued to pull in high ratings from enraptured audiences and received much critical acclaim for its high-quality storytelling, culminating with both Golden Globe and Emmy awards for Best Drama Series, in addition to several other accolades, nominations, and wins.<br /><br />Constantly challenging, always engaging, "Lost" is an addictive puzzle of a series, and richly rewards the astute adult audience it's aimed at. Though its high ratings and continual popularity could possibly subject it to overexposure, scheduling abuse, or creative burnout on the part of the writers (wherein they ask more questions than they can satisfactorily answer), the potential for this series is still incredible, and I for one am hoping for many more labyrinthine years to come!</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>LOST The Complete First Season is one of the best TV shows (along with Desperate Housewives) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. I had never seen an episode of Lost until I watched the entire DVD set. I was afraid to give it a chance when it was on TV, but after seeing mostly positive reviews from people here on amazon I figured I would give the show a chance. All I can say is I am glad I did. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD set and it shows. The set is a digipak which slides out of the plastic sleeve from the bottom, and opens to hold the 7 discs. Three of the digipak panels contain 2 overlapping (think Lois & Clark: the New Adventures of Superman) discs, and the 7th disc stands alone. People may complain about the overlapping discs, but the packaging looks great and is a space saver on the shelf. I was very pleased with the amazing piture quality and the amazing sound. LOST is presented in its original anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) presentation.

However, I for one had a lot of qualms with season one, which struck me as very discordant.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Abrams and co. had no idea what they were getting into at the start.  What begins as a plane crash on an apparently remote island soon takes on many mysterious tones with a huge ensemble cast not much unlike those old Airport movies from the 70s.  The cast is made up of relative unknowns giving the show the initial feeling of a staged reality show, but the writing has a lot of gaps, and the actors really seem to struggle with their roles in the early going.<br /><br />But, a core group soon emerges, much to the chagrin of the other "Lostaways" such as Arzt, which pretty much carries the action.  Even still it is a pretty big group and doesn't break down easily along the lines of other castaway shows like Gilligan's Island, but I can't help seeing Jack and Kate as the Professor and Mary Ann.<br /><br />The writers, who earned their chops on such shows as Nash Bridges, Alias, Brisco County Jr. and Six Degrees seem to take elements from near and far when it comes to island movies and TV serials.  One can't help but sense the menacing feel of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island or even H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but the threads that develop seem to come more from the 70s, when we were all absorbed with Bermuda triangle theories, alien encounters and supernatural thrillers.  The Island gives them a lush venue to update these themes and keep you going with a number of tantalizing threads.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing stumbles and falters and the situations don't bear up that well under scrutiny.  This show is mostly for effect, not for any deep underlying themes, and seems to be developed pretty much from week to week.  But, take heart, Lostophiles say that the show only gets better with each passing season.  However, I give the first season a B-.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>The following is pretty much the review that I wrote for LOST Season One when Amazon first solicited reviews for the show as it was about to come out on DVD.  I'm going to post most unedited.  But I wanted to add a bit here.  I have now purchased Seasons Three and Four of LOST on Blu-ray and while the show has always looked good on DVD, it looks nothing short of stunning on Blu-ray.  I've been somewhat disappointed with how some shows turn out on Blu-ray versus regular DVD, even when the latter is view on an Up-Conversion DVD player using an HDMI cable.  The difference in quality is astonishing.  In Season Four, for instance, you can count every single one of John Locke's whiskers or Jeff Fahey's chest hairs on Blu-ray.  What you gain in clarity is breathtaking.  In contrast, I am at the moment rewatching Season One of CHUCK on Blu-ray, and I've been extremely disappointed with the image quality.  It looks good, but nowhere near as good as some of my other Blu-ray TV sets, like LOST, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, or PUSHING DAISIES (if ever there was a show made to be watched on Blu-ray, it is DAISIES).<br /><br />My one complaint so far with LOST as with many other Blu-ray sets has been the cost.  This is as clear a case of bilking the public (milking the public) as I've seen in a while.  I'm buying a fair number of Blu-ray sets, but my concern is that it is a media that may not last.  This is partly because the costs of both players and discs are so expensive that sales are not increasing at the rate that they imagined once Blu-ray won the format war.  And with Up-Conversion DVD players, which can cost as little as $50, playing regular DVD players over HDMI cables providing pictures about 95% as good as Blu-ray, many consumers have resisted taking the Blu-ray plunge.  I buy a lot of shows on DVD or Blu-ray, but currently I pick and choose.  Shows I love a lot, like LOST and MAD MEN and PUSHING DAISIES, I buy on Blu-ray.  But most of the others I just get regular DVD (though the show I most want on Blu-ray, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, still is not available in the format).  So, while I will get this and will even pay the exorbitant price to get it, I can't necessarily advise others to do so as well.  Unless the small improvement in visual quality means a lot to you (it does to me), you might just want to stick with your regular DVDs.<br /><br />OK, here is my original review, from May of 2005.<br /><br />It is too early to state for certain just how good LOST is compared to the great shows in television history, but by the highest possible standards its first season has to stand out as one of the great seasons in the history of the medium. Season One of LOST was not merely good but great television, and not merely great television but great narrative storytelling. But the impact of LOST goes completely beyond its aesthetic success. Along with another show on ABC (albeit one that I do not care for), DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, LOST has managed to cause the prodigiously stupid television execs to realize that there is a huge demand for quality scripted television. After years of an endless string of simply awful reality shows, all of the networks suddenly want shows that are written ahead of time and feature casts of actual actors. Although final schedules have not yet been announced, it looks as if the 2005-2006 season is going to have both a dramatic decrease in reality shows and an increase in scripted shows. The stunning success of LOST has played a major role in this sea change.<br /><br />We have in recent years seen genre shows that were huge hits with critics and managed to generate a passionate cult following. Probably no show was more critically praised than BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (with hordes of high brow critics preferring it to more respectable hit series like THE SOPRANOS), but at its peak it managed only a small audience. LOST has generated critical praise almost as strong as BUFFY, a core of fans nearly as passionate, but unlike BUFFY managed absolutely stunning ratings. It is one of the few instances in recent television history where what is arguably the best show on TV also managed among the strongest ratings. In fact, LOST would be considered a cult show based on the number of websites that it has inspired and the passion of the fans, except that the ratings instead make it a mainstream hit.<br /><br />Who would have thought that a series dealing with plane crash survivors on a most unusual island would have been this successful? Before it debuted I remember people joking that it sounded like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND without the humor. But it ended up matching or surpassing the most optimistic expecations, in quality as well as in ratings. The mention of ratings is not gratuitious. So many superb shows have been cancelled in recent years (FIREFLY, WONDERFALLS, DEAD LIKE ME, ANGEL) that there was even a "Save LOST" website started . . . before the show even debuted! Luckily, the ratings have made cancellation seem not only remote but impossible.<br /><br />It is almost impossible to acknowledge everything that LOST does well in the space allotted here. Above all else, it is a superbly written show, not merely on an episode by episode basis, but in the way all of the episodes mesh with one another. The continuity is the best that I have seen in a long time. For instance, the first time we see one character in the show, she is rubbing her wrist. Later, we learn that she had been a prisoner of a U. S. Marshall and had obviously gotten rid of her handcuffs just before we first met her. Almost any detail like that will be dealt with at a later date. But the scripts are just as strong on character development, humor, excitement, and adventure. I do have a tiny bit of fear about Season Two: former BUFFY and ANGEL writer David Fury, who wrote many of the finest scripts of the year, including "Walkabout," which could very well win Fury an Emmy for best written episode of the year, has left LOST to work this summer on the new FOX series THE INSIDE, before joining 24 as a writer and executive producer.<br /><br />My initial fear when the show started was that the central cast was perhaps too large, but it turned out to be unjustified, and the great ensemble cast is unquestionably one of the reasons for the show's success.. Yes, there are a lot of characters, and sometimes I wish some were more central than others, but the depth and power of developing the stories of a dozen characters ended up being both unique and exceptionally entertaining. Jack is the titular lead of the show, although show creator J. J. Abrams has confessed that their original idea was to have Jack assume leadership in the first couple of episodes, and then have him die off, forcing the lovely fugitive Kate become the leader for the castaways. But they quickly realized that Matthew Fox's Jack was too valuable a character to toss aside so cavalierly. If there is a second main character, it is Kate, who is performed by a remarkable newcomer, the excruciatingly beautiful Evangeline Lily, who despite virtually no prior experience (I did recently spot her in a very, very tiny role from the first season episode "Kinetic" on SMALLVILLE, where her only task is to kiss her supposed boyfriend). One of the most consistently fascinating characters is John Locke, played by Terry O'Quinn, a veteran television actor familiar to anyone who has seen shows like ALIAS, THE X-FILES, MILLENIUM, and THE WEST WING. Although he has always performed marvelously, LOST has made him a star. Every one of the major characters has his or her own set of fans. Naveen Andrews, for instance, a Londoner of Indian descent, has been a big hit playing Sayid, the former Iraqi soldier, as has Jorge Garcia as Hurley, the obese lottery winner who is as unlucky for others as he is lucky himself. And while Dominic Monaghan shared in the enormous success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS playing one of the Hobbits, he has achieved more individual success as Charlie, the heroin-addicted bass player for the fictional band Driveshaft (one hit wonders famed for their song "You All Everybody"). So rabid are the show's fans that there are websites dedicated to Driveshaft.<br /><br />Structurally, the narrative shifts between the efforts of the survivors to adapt to and understand the island on which they are marooned and flashbacks that explain the personal history of each character. Some people object to this, wishing instead that they focused exclusively on the events on the island, but I think that this is wrong. If you focused merely on the events on the island, it would be only an adventure story, but through the flashbacks we learn so much about what makes the people tick that the series becomes as much a character study as an adventure. By the end of the season, we get to know the characters so well that we can anticipate how they are going to respond to even the smallest events. We learn very quickly that the island contains a host of mysteries, including invisible monsters whose location and function remain unknown until the end of the season (if we even understand them then), other inhabitants whose intentions seem both sinister and unknown, and a lone insane Frenchwoman named Danielle Rousseau. But there is not much more than we know about the island. Rousseau talks of the Black Rock, but it isn't what we expect when we finally see it. And then there is the metal doorway that Locke discovers in the middle of the jungle. How can it be opened and what lies behind the door? By the end of the season many of the mysteries are explained, but more are left open-ended.<br /><br />LOST clearly has the potential to be one of the great series in the history of television. The producers are highly ambitious, but so far their execution has matched their aspirations. I read an interview with David Fury before the first episode aired in which he said they had a plot line that runs over several years, so their clearly is a well-conceived storyline. I have only one concern with the show, and that is the executive producer and creator J. J. Abrams. Although he has two prior hit shows, FELICITY and ALIAS, he has had some problems with taking his shows to higher levels. What made BUFFY so extraordinary was that each year they managed to do something new and amazing, even if some fans were disappointed by some directions it headed. But ALIAS has started to disappoint some fans by the fact that it hasn't progressed much beyond what it was in the first season. Instead of doing strikingly new things, Abrams just tends to recycle the same general storyline. And there has not been much of a payoff for all the focus on Ramaldi (for nonfans of ALIAS, a Renaissance genius whose artifacts provide much of the narrative force of the show). Abrams clearly is brilliant at conceiving and initiating great shows, but he has not yet demonstrated that he is a great finisher in the way that Joss Whedon has. I'm forever the optimist, and I believe that Abrams either will come to terms with this or the other creators and executive producers will help LOST get to a place that we will all find satisfying.<br /><br />Regardless of the future, this nonetheless is one of the most remarkable rookie seasons any television series has ever enjoyed. I'll end with food for thought. THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and FARSCAPE, to name just a few shows, were much better in their second and third seasons than their first. What if two years from now we are able to say the same of LOST?</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>On a routine flight from Australia to Los Angeles, an Oceanic Airlines flight crashes.  The survivors find themselves on an uncharted island, miles off course.  If anyone is looking for them, they are looking in the wrong place.<br /><br />If it were a matter of simple surviving, these survivors might have had a chance.  But that's not all there is.  A strange creature kills the pilot.  A group finds a radio signal calling for help that's been going for years.  And this group is not alone on the island.<br /><br />Of course, as the group settles in, they get to know each other, and relationships begin to develop.  Other relationships begin to fall apart in the stress of the situation.  And everybody has a story, which is told to us in flashbacks, complimenting the action on the island.<br /><br />I tuned in for the pilot for many reasons.  Survivors on an island always interest me.  And I'm a big fan of ALIAS, also from one of the creators of this show.  I was hooked from the beginning and couldn't wait to tune in each week to see what was going to happen.  With 14 main characters, some only get a scene or two in some episodes, but we might learn about them in the next episode with a series of flashbacks.<br /><br />Everybody seems to have their favorite characters.  Many people tuned in for Dominic Monaghan, fresh off of LORD OF THE RINGS.  Matthew Fox was also a well-known name before hand.  Personally, I was thrilled to see Daniel Dae Kim, who I've been watching show up on various shows since his days on CRUSADE.  And I've also enjoyed seeing Mira Furlan from BABYLON 5 on another show, even if it's only as a guest star.<br /><br />It seems the more we learn about the characters, the more questions that are asked.<br /><br />Some people find that frustrating.  The season finale leaves us with no answers to the questions we've had all season, and the number of questions have only increased.  Personally, I don't expect all the answers until the show is over, so I'm willing to wait out the ride, hoping that Abrams won't give in to pressure to give us answers like he did in ALIAS.  I also hope we get answers before the show ends and it's not dragged out needlessly.<br /><br />So, is the set worth it for fans of the show?  Absolutely!  The show is presented in wide screen, which was what it was shot for.  The surround sound is incredible.  You can hear the bugs in the jungle or the waves on the shore.  Yet the sound effects aren't overwhelming.  They're just right to make you feel like you're there.  There are five commentary tracks with various members of the cast and crew.  And the seventh disc is nothing but bonus material, with documentaries on the creation of the series, casting (with interesting casting videos, sometimes of an actor auditioning for another roll), and creating the pilot.  For fun, there's information on Driveshaft and bloopers.  Plus nineteen minutes of deleted scenes.  The set itself looks nice, but the way the discs are set in the case makes three of them hard to get out.  You have to move out the one in front to get to the one behind.  It's not a big issue, but it is annoying.<br /><br />This shows combines an intriguing story with interesting characters and great writing and acting.  I can't wait until season 2 starts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>Great Gift for those who like this series and didn't get to see all of the first season...looking forward to the second season on DVD to get caught up!!!<br /><br />Great Gift</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this show.  My favorite series of the past few years ("The Shield" and "The Wire") had ended, and I wanted a new show to enjoy and get hooked on.  I knew "Lost" was already several years old by that point, but I figured I could start from the beginning with the DVDs and get caught up quickly.<br /><br />However, this show stinks so bad, I am having a hard time getting the smell out of my DVD player.<br /><br />This show is overwrought melodrama, and is full of manufactured tension and forced dialogue and situations.  The premise is fine (and even interesting), but the dozens of little moments used to fill the time between plot developments are ridiculously melodramatic.  The show doesn't have to be realistic, but there needs to be some verisimilitude -- the actions, dialogue, etc of the characters need to be grounded in reality and naturalism (even in a surreal or fantastical context) or else it looks cartoonish.<br /><br />Watching this show has helped me become a master at physical multi-tasking:  I can now yawn and roll my eyes at the same time.  I never saw the show until August of 2009.  My boss recommended it to me (we were both huge fans of "The Shield" and "The Big Bang Theory", so I was willing to accept his recommendation).  I rented Season 1 of "Lost" from Netflix and somehow managed to watch almost the entire season without wanting to slit my wrists from boredom or having my eyes roll permanently into the back of their sockets.  It wasn't easy to get through the season, that's for sure.  It was quite the endurance contest.  The most notable reaction I had to this show (other than intellectual agony) was when I ran, and I mean RAN, to my computer to delete the rest of the season's discs from my Netflix queue.<br /><br />The premise was interesting, but that's where the fun ended.  I accept the fact that this is a network television show, and for that reason this show will feature an inordinate number of attractive young actors playing stock characters and that there will be an ethnically diverse cast of characters that somehow feels "forced" (Handsome young male lead?  Check.  Add a few impossibly beautiful young women?  Check.  Black guy?  Check.  Asian characters?  Check.  Chubby comic relief?  Check.  Dangerous rebel?  Check.  ....You get the point).  If it seems like the network had a checklist for the stock characters and ethnicities they wanted represented so as to widen the show's appeal, well it did.  That's how network TV works.  That's how network execs think.<br /><br />Next ingredient:  make it eerie but not too complicated.  Don't make it cerebral, but make it LOOK and FEEL like it is cerebral.<br /><br />Make the post-plane crash behavior as unrealistic as possible.  The survivors are at first without a decent supply of food, water, shelter, adequate medical care, etc, but they go about their business like calm sheep, only pausing to stare in wonder whenever they hear a strange animal growl or trees moving.  Even then, they only react when the camera pans to them.  It's kind of a "rolling acknowledgement" - each one of them on the beach hears the sounds at the same time, but their reactions are in "staggered time".  Apparently it is important on a television drama for the camera to capture the startled reactions of each and every character, no matter how much time it takes, whenever something startling occurs.  It looks so hokey and cliche and REHEARSED that you'd swear Steven Spielberg himself had shot it.<br /><br />By the way, the plane wreckage and debris looked totally unrealistic.  It looked like the debris was simply placed on the beach.  I didn't see any tell-tale signs of a large object having a violent crash landing and/or coming to a stop.  A plane crash (even just a downed fuselage and two engines) leaves a HECK of a lot more physical damage to the surrounding area than what we see in "Lost".  But that would be expensive to design and would spoil the beauty of the scenery.<br /><br />Maybe I'm nitpicking.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  But details and verisimilitude are important.  If the network wants me to invest a significant amount of time in that show, then they should invest more time and effort into paying attention to details.  A cool premise will carry a show only so far.  The premise and plot don't have to be absolutely realistic, but the everyday elements of the natural world (Laws of Physics, patterns of human behavior in desperate situations, etc) should be grounded in reality, even within the context of a fantasy show.  Otherwise, this might as well be "Gilligan's Island" or a Saturday morning cartoon. I said that already, but it bears repeating.<br /><br />By the way, at the beginning of the pilot episode where Matthew Fox's character "Jack" awakens in a field of tall grass that completely surrounds him, how did he know which way to run?  How did the dog get out of the carrier he was presumably in?  Isn't it convenient that their luggage arrived with them and intact when the rest of the plane was essentially blown to bits?  How come a grown man got sucked into the engine but nothing else nearby of considerably lighter weight even rustled in the suction breeze?  And why does J.J. Abrams seem to think that using one of the most overused cliches in drama (having a young pregnant woman go into labor or have labor pains at the most inopportune moment) does NOT look downright silly?  He did it here, and he did it again in his "Star Trek" movie.  It's old and tired and it should be beneath him.  But apparently it's not.  Maybe the pregnancy has a dramatic payoff later in the season, maybe it doesn't.  That's not the point.  The point is that it is an overused cliche and stock character to suffer through while we're waiting to see IF there is a payoff. Maybe some of these questions get addressed YEARS later in future seasons, but those are bad elements to hinge a plot line on.  It's like asking someone to listen to a singer's 11 terrible CD's because the last track on the 12th one is supposed to be good enough to make up for the rest.<br /><br />I just don't get it.  I don't see how so many people are so enamored of this show.  It is a cool premise executed in the laziest way imaginable.<br /><br />If "Lost" was the first and only dramatic series I'd ever seen, I'd probably think it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.  But the bar has been set very high recently by shows like "The Wire", for example, and now any other show that doesn't even attempt to match it for quality just looks all the worse for not trying.  Not that "Lost" and "The Wire" are the same type of show.  That's for damn sure.  But "The Wire" has shown how great episodic drama can be.  It is character-driven, not gimmick-driven.  "Lost" is, first and foremost, gimmick-driven.  Americans love "gimmick TV".  No surprise that this show has become successful.  Even the fans who complain that the show moves too slowly and that nothing really ever happens still rave about the show as if it were the best thing ever on TV.  They give it an unconditional pass.  That's too bad.<br /><br />I somehow made it almost all the way through Season One of this show.  I was hoping to enjoy it, but I just couldn't see past all the weaknesses and laziness in the directing, writing, logic, and production design.  This show was a soap opera gone "high-concept", that's all.  When a soap opera aspires to be greater than it is, when it tries to reach the heights of great drama or a great thriller, it usually just comes off looking silly.  That's "Lost" in a nutshell.<br /><br />I have no desire to see any future seasons and I can't recommend this show to any of my friends who insist on a minimum standard of literary or narrative excellence.  This show has often been compared to "Lord of the Flies".  Hardly.  "LOTF" explored man's dark and primitive nature.  "Lost" is too superficial to tackle that theme with any seriousness.<br /><br />The show is abysmally bad.<br /><br />Did you know that the idea for this show was dreamed up by a network exec at ABC?  He thought the premise would make for a cool series, so he hired various folks to write it for him.  The series was greenlit on the basis of the concept alone.  Too bad the so-called "creative talent" behind the show couldn't make it work any better than they did.<br /><br />This show was about as big a mistake as a trouble married couple deciding to have a baby to "save their marriage".<br /><br />The ONLY thing Season 1 is good for is as a drinking game.  Every time you see a scene where someone in either the foreground or background is folding clothes from a piece of luggage, drink a shot.  Actually, it might even help you enjoy the show more.  I'd probably have to be drunk to watch more of this crapfest anyway.<br /><br />This show in some ways disappoints me the same way the Star Wars prequel "The Phantom Menace" did.  As in "Phantom Menace", "Lost" doesn't have nearly enough plot to sustain its running time.  As a result, the show's flaws take center stage when there is nothing else interesting going on on-screen.  Watching this show, you can never forget you are listening to scripted dialogue.  There is almost nothing natural about their conversations.  Every word sounds like it is being spoken for dramatic effect.<br /><br />....  You know what?  It makes my head hurt to even discuss this show.  I'm still not sure if I genuinely hate the show or if I merely resent the writers and directors for being so lazy and for paying so little attention to the small moments.  This show is FULL of small moments.  When they are weak and silly, it paints the whole show with that brush.<br /><br />This show might have worked better as a 2-hour TV movie.  It would have been narratively tighter and more effective, maybe like one of the better "Twilight Zone" episodes.  But it is stretched too thin and can't sustain itself on a moment-to-moment basis without resorting to trying to squeeze a high amount dramatic tension from very minor events.  It just looks silly.  What a waste of a good premise.<br /><br />Funny thing is, this first season won an Emmy for Best Dramatic Series and then in subsequent seasons was criticized for being slow and boring.  I thought Season One was about as slow and boring as a show could get.  I can't really imagine how unbearable the subsequent seasons must have been.<br /><br />Like anyone else, I've been either disinterested in or disappointed by any number of shows over the years.  In those cases, I'd just shrug my shoulders and never tune into them again.  But "Lost" is the first show I've absolutely resented for being as poor as it is, and I will NEVER understand why people are/were so fascinated by it.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />I hear they are making "Lost" action figures now.

The pinneacle of these absurds ocurred at the moment that Michael killed Ana Lucia. Michael, a character we learned to admire due to his love for his missing son. My jaw simply dropped in astonishment... it was absurd, useless, it broke plot coerence, it was a twist just for the sake of twisting, nothing more.

Abrams, the landmark first season of Lost became a critical success and a ratings juggernaut for ABC.  Beginning with a mysterious plane crash, a large group of survivors find themselves stranded on a seemingly deserted island.  As the season unfolds, each character is given a flashback-style glimpse into their past and the events that lead them to boarding the plane, while they each learn that there is something lurking on the island; something strange, and very deadly.  All this leads the survivors to discover that they are not the only ones on the island, and the season ending discovery of a strange metal hatch and what lurks inside will leave you salivating for season two.  Lost's large cast, including Matthew Fox as the resident doctor Jack, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan as heroin raddled fallen rock star Charlie, newcomer Evangeline Lily as the mysterious Kate, Milennium's Terry O'Quinn as survivalist John, and Oz's Harold Perrineau who is here along with his young, disobedient son.  The rest of the cast, including Daniel Dae Kim, Ian Somerhalder, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia among others, do great work, and by the end of this season, one of them will be dead, and there will be more questions than answers.  The storytelling is sharp (including David Fury as a staff writer, who wrote and directed some of the best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel), and with the unique aspect of the show, it's no secret why Lost has become such a runaway hit.  As a previous reviewer stated, superb shows of the last few years such as the X-Files, Buffy, Angel, and Farscape didn't achieve true perfection until their second season, and if Lost manages to fall into the same category, then it's time to prepare for something really special, and now has never been a better time to get Lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7.html">A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7</a><br/><p>In the midst of the season, when we Lost junkies hang on each new episode, repeats are the bane of one's existence (unless of course you have been careless enough to somehow have your life interfere causing you to miss an episode).  Removed from that "what happens next" compulsion, the first season replayed in DVD is even more rewarding.  Yes, you occasionally notice little -- and perhaps important -- things you missed the first time around (Hurley on Korean television for example), but mostly the pleasure comes from seeing just how consistently superb television this is -- the writing, the acting, and most of all the rich imagination and creativity that underpins it all.  Quite simply, this is the best dramatic television has to offer -- with The Sopranos on hiatus and Buffy ended -- and in the DVD versions you get it wonderfully commercial free.</p></br></body></html>

In truth, it tries to emulate "Silence of the Lambs" and "Seven" and a few other films by being a mash-up of those films.  The result is less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />The direction is by-the-numbers and uninspired.  The script is cliche-ridden and needs a few draft revisions to make it a little fresher.<br /><br />MAJOR leaps in logic, geography, and timing.  (So-and-so character is heading back to a certain location, but the person who left long after he did from the same location manages to beat him there too easily..., etc).<br /><br />This film was shot during a very cold Philadelphia winter, and in one dialogue scene shot on an interior staircase in a courthouse, there is visible steam coming from the actors' mouths.  Looks as if the movie crew was granted access to the building during off-hours or a weekend but didn't agree to pay to have the heat turned on.<br /><br />There were a few twists to the genre in this film, but I found out later they were (probably) borrowed from a certain Japanese thriller from a few years ago.  Is there NOTHING original anymore?<br /><br />One thing in particular that made me chuckle:  Fairly early on in the film I was having trouble understanding some of Jamie Foxx's spoken dialog because he tends to swallow his words.  So I watched the rest of the film with the subtitles on.  During a scene where Gerard Butler's character is playing music from his iPod, the subtitle reads "[Jazz playing]".  The music was not Jazz --  it was the song "Eminence Front" by The Who.  But as if that weren't funny enough, a few moments later, after the film has cut away to another location and then returned to the iPod playing, the subtitles then read "[Funk playing]", but it is still the SAME SONG playing!  I didn't know (and I bet The Who's Pete Townshend didn't either) that the first half of the rock song "Eminence Front" is Jazz and the second half is Funk.  Boy, have my music genre identification skills been wrong for a lot of years!!<br /><br />Rent but don't buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I missed Law Abiding Citizen in theaters and have been counting down the days until the DVD release ever since. I'll be the first to admit that this is not a great movie by any means, but for pure entertainment value, this one gets my vote.<br /><br />The acting by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx is above average, even pretty good at times. I feared that both would be just showing up for a paycheck here. Gerard Butler seemed to be having fun and I really enjoyed his character. I also liked how the perception of the two lead characters changed as the movie progressed. You start off favoring Gerard over Jamie, but then it switches and the good guy is now the villain.<br /><br />On the negative side of things. There are a couple of scenes that aren't believable and it reminded me of the SAW series on more than one occasion. The ending felt really rushed, but some things did catch me by surprise. I do wish they would have done a little more of those mini creative traps, like the spiked gun handle full of poison or the controlled cell phone explosion. While this film is very violent, most of it is implied. Don't get me wrong, there is a good amount of gore, but not nearly as much as I expected.<br /><br />Worth a rental or a buy at this cheap price. I watched the regular DVD version, but the Blu-ray is the only way you can see the Unrated Director's Cut, complete with some more blood and a few extra scenes.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...)<br /><br />Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace.  Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially.  Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton.  There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.<br /><br />Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al.  Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes.  If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....Grady Harp, February 10</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>I was worried about this one, based on the "professional" reviews. But it turned out to be compelling, thought-provoking, and just plain entertaining.<br /><br />You know the plot. The critics called this "a nasty piece of work" and so on. Well, there is nastiness. But it's not just the violence (most of which is off-screen and implied). It's the nastiness of the justice system. This is the movie version of "The Death of Common Sense" - the criminal-friendly, evidence-killing justice system that allows murderers and rapists to go free based on technicalities, forcing prosecutors to make deals to gain silly "wins" is the "broken" aspect on display here. Any sane person can readily see the two warring sides of this coin, as shown in the movie - the injustice of the system and the workarounds necessary. By the end of the movie, no-one's worried about Clyde's civil rights anymore - the lesson he intends to teach. (And how he does it is a doozie.)<br /><br />Despite the fact that his agenda spills over into semi-innocent blood, I found myself rooting for Clyde the whole way through. This is what made the critics queasy - they found themselves rooting for him too, despite their criminal-friendly, respect-their-rights-above-all-else sensibilities. (Well, unless they're the victims, in which case we often find they're hiding guns in every corner of their own houses. See Carl Rowan, et al.) Because the "innocent" victims also knew that they had, in some measure, brought this on themselves. Is it unfair? Perhaps; but then again, they were just working within the crazy "progressive" justice system. The question the movie asks is, when do they start respecting the rights of the victims more? (I don't mean the race-driven travesties of the Tawana Brawley or the lacrosse cases.)<br /><br />The anti-Bush, anti-Catholic-church guy who flew his plane into an IRS building (oops, didn't your newspaper give you that information?) is another disturbing example. Although we are repulsed by his final act, reading his screed we can certainly be digusted with a system (in this case the IRS and Mr. Moynihan) that can arbitrarily continually crush a hard-working engineer just trying to get the same breaks that Timothy Geithner and his peers do.<br /><br />These are disturbing questions that should not arise in the minds of "regular" folk like us. It provokes thought and even critique. Thought is not allowed in certain circles, only assent. This movie cracks open the door a little too much for comfort.<br /><br />It was fun, and it was too short.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>Am not a fan of the film's ending, which overall leaves a bad remembrance of what could have been, but the Blu has a nice offering.<br /><br />The picture and sound are outstanding, with plenty of references for both, even including that muddled ending and the fireball effects. The supplements help answer a few questions and include:<br /><br />* A six-minute interview session of some legal "experts" about the law issues seen in the film.<br />* Behind the scenes in black and white, 15 minutes. Interviews/set footage in black and white while the film clips shown are in color. Not quite sure what the contrast reasoning was, but the director kept saying how he wanted this film to be different than the other movies that might be categorized as similar.<br />* VFX snippets, 5 of them at 6:30 minutes. Was disappointed in some of the effects shots they thought were "great" (snow on a sunny clear day - and viewers are supposed to miss that?)...but at least they covered what the original ending was going to be - much better than what was installed.<br />* Disc 2 - Director's Cut - much better version of the film. 10 minutes longer and had a variety of additions, including:<br />++ Longer version of the first meeting with Butler's character regarding the plea (you only see the paper under Foxx's phone in theatrical).<br />++ Joke by defense attorney in court - shows why everyone was looking at him funny in the theatrical.<br />++ Nice vulgarity by the female prosecutor in the execution chamber scene.<br />++ Torture scene much longer.<br />++ More footage of the torture chamber when found by the police.<br />++ Footage of Colm Meaney wanting to head shot Butler in the prison yard gate sequence.<br />++ A bunch of dialogue bits and longer takes - added more edge to the film and gave it a much better R version than shown.<br /><br />Two versions of the same film on two different BDs, almost makes it to where you want to get rid of the disc you will never watch depending on your likes/dislikes. Apparently you cannot get this version on DVD, so between the amount of upset feelers out there over that and the atrocious ending, I can't see giving this higher than a 4-star.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Gerard Butler makes for a very convincing villian in this little hyped thriller, "Law Abiding Citizen". Butler plays a Father whose family is brutally murdered. He goes on a very deliberate rampage against the deal-making District Attorney, played by Jamie Fox, who let one of the murderers off.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the cat and mouse game between the D.A. and the killer, who starts to wipe out every one who was involved with the murder of his family. The twist is that the killer is locked up in jail, arrested for the murder of the killers of his family. How is he killing from a jail cell and who is helping him are the big questions in the film.<br /><br />The movie is basically a locked door mystery. but it is entertaining although somewhat predictable. I was one of the few people who wanted to see this film while it was playing in a theatre, but that time period was only a few weeks. It seems like the movie studio had no faith in this film, which was a mistake in my opinion. I've seen alot worse, Law Abiding Citizen is worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>I rented this film today and enjoyed it...so I will defintely be getting it soon.<br />I found it to be very entertaining, well-paced, suspenseful, graphic in places.<br />Gerard Butler was like the devil in this! And with good reason, but his character<br />gets blinded by revenge. (Good job though!)<br />Jamie Foxx did a satisfactory job in this and the other cast was sufficient.<br />Lots of explosions, violence, and other manner of thrills & chills for those<br />who like that sort of thing...I can't complain about the film overall, but<br />the ending was very unexpected to me. I give it 5 stars for being a great entertaining<br />film that won't bore you and you can follow it all the way through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Actors make good movies and they make bad movies. With any luck, the good outweigh the bad and their careers continue. Gerard Butler return to form after the terrible GAMER, this time as an ordinary citizen with exceptional abilities in LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.<br /><br />Butler stars as Clyde Shelton, a man living in suburban Philadelphia with his wife and daughter whose home is broken into. Attacked and wounded, he is forced to watch as two men kill his family and leave him for dead. But he survives and does what he can to see these two men brought to justice.<br /><br />But justice can be blind. Not enough evidence ties the two men to the crime and one turns against the other in a plea bargain. Assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has a stellar conviction record and wants this one to keep that intact, propelling his career forward. He makes the deal that results in the death penalty for one and a short term for the other, much to the disappointment of Shelton who wants both to suffer.<br /><br />Ten years pass and as the first killer is about to die by lethal injection things go wrong. Rather than the humane system put in place, different chemicals are injected causing him to suffer as he dies while Rice, witness to the execution, watches.<br /><br />The second killer finds his release from prison not what he expected. Captured by Shelton and taken to a remote hiding place, he is systematically dismembered while alive by Shelton who has left clues to these proceedings for the police to find. Arrested, he is taken to jail and soon to be put on trial. But Shelton has other plans.<br /><br />Requesting an audience with Rice, he sets up his own plea deal. Let him go free and no one will be hurt. But as long as he stays in prison, those he holds responsible for letting a guilty man go free will pay the price and justice, in his mind, will be served. Seeing as how he is behind bars, Rice finds his threat hard to take seriously. Until people involved in the original case begin to be murdered.<br /><br />And here is where the true twist in the film begins. How is Shelton orchestrating the murders from a prison cell where he has no contact with the outside world? Who can his accomplice be in carrying out his vendetta against a legal system that short changed him when it came to justice in the deaths of his wife and daughter?<br /><br />The cat and mouse game between Shelton and Rice makes for fascinating viewing as pieces of the puzzle are dropped in place while the body count rises. People are taken out by numerous means while Rice survives, held in place to be the last victim. And when a meeting with a member of the clandestine sector (think CIA) lets Rice know that Shelton was the go to guy when it came to methods of killing people, Rice races against time to find out the answers before he and his family are killed.<br /><br />Like all good mysteries, the clues are placed for all to see but its how you interpret them and solve them as a viewer that makes this movie a delight. By the end of the film, you realize you were given these clues throughout, given the chance to solve the puzzle on your own. If you got them right.<br /><br />Foxx does his usual great job as the beleaguered DA who wants to find justice for all but has gotten caught up in a system that is imperfect where criminals go free or do less time to result in convictions. Butler does a great job as a man determined to expose the system for what it is and find his own justice along the way.<br /><br />The movie takes a hard look at the justice system as we witness the battle between these two characters. And both are sympathetic in their own way. Foxx because he was forced to accept less in order to hold his record and Butler, who may be killing people, but as a man forced to watch his family killed before his own eyes only to see the killer walk away. A portion of you wants to root for his side but at the same time you realize his version of justice is a tad turned upside down.<br /><br />This movie will hold your attention from start to finish. And the conclusion will surprise even the most jaded moviegoer. If you're looking for a good movie, look no further than LAW ABIDING CITIZEN.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is another film that follows the long-standing trend of how ineffective our justice system is and how people find it necessary to take the law into their own hands. The last few years, we've seen this a lot with films like THE BRAVE ONE and DEATH SENTENCE. The problem that these films usually face is they treat it either too realistically, or not realistically enough. In the case of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's starts one way and then falls way too far in the other direction.<br /><br />The opening is very realistic and very brutal with the home invasion sequence and the preliminaries to the action, as Foxx does his legal dealings with the devil and Butler deals with the anger and frustration of watching the real killer of his family get a lesser sentence, and it does show promise for the remainder of the film. But once Butler's plan goes into motion, that's when the film really starts to go off the rails. Butler, who is an actor that I really admire, gets to have a lot of fun with this role, but it's not a role that he should be having fun with. His character turns inexplicably from vengeance-seeking father and husband to evil genius in a very short period of screen time. And Foxx's character is so unbearably cocky and smarmy that it's very difficult to root for him, even when Butler's character has done some really evil stuff. And the fact that Butler's character is so much more than he seems to be... it's just a horrible deus ex machina and it's a really hacky premise. He can't just be a normal angry man; he has to be a former government assassin.<br /><br />If they decided to make Butler the hero of this film and maybe give the film a PUNISHER-like angle where the people that he's killing are truly corrupt and evil, and Foxx's character was maybe someone who was caught in the middle of all this insanity... Well, that is a film that would make for a more entertaining and satisfying watch. Alas, they took another road, and it's a road that starts in a world of plausibility and forks off so far into ridiculousness that the film ultimately implodes on itself.<br /><br />F. Gary Gray isn't known much for his thought-provoking films, and is much more of the fast-paced, blow-stuff-up school. THE NEGOTIATOR with Sam Jackson and Kevin Spacey is as close as he's gotten to making a very watchable film, and unfortunately, Butler and Foxx are not Spacey and Jackson.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film is that it really doesn't even seem to have a point. It's just a good premise turned into a bad film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Gerard Butler ("The Phantom Of The Opera") and Academy Award winner Jaime Foxx ("Collateral") ignite the screen in the latest thriller from F. Gary Gray ("The Italian Job"). The movie makes you ponder how far is too far to get justice for the ones you love, and how clear-cut the line between good & evil is. Riveting from beginning to end. MILD SPOILER ALERT!!! In the end, the lesson is learned. MILD SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie should have shown what happened when Clyde set off the bomb at the end of the movie. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Get ready to root for the criminal... or is he a criminal? Are we?

Either way the movie's ending and just the way Butler's Character just gets out of hand I disliked,but the Idea itself behind the movie that The Justice System favors the Criminal's right before the Victims in most cases speaks volumes and there is truth to that,<br />When you have Liberals running the show,Activist judges and so fourth who want "Rehab" Instead of Minimum Mandatory Life Sentences for Violent Offenders/Repeat offenders. All In All the movie is worth watching as painful as it may seem,not exactly the best thing for Butler to have done.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" stars Gerald Butler ("300") as Clyde Shelton, a genius engineer living in Philadelphia, whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered. The criminals Clarence and Rupert are caught, and the trial begins, but the prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) informs the distraught father that only Rupert will be sentenced to death. Clarence (with whom Nick strikes a deal) will be convicted of third-degree murder, which means in a few years he will be released from the jail.<br /><br />You may call "Law Abiding Citizen" a revenge thriller, but this time the angry protagonist avenges the deaths of his family in the most unpredictable (and brutal) fashion. He is not content with just killing; he intends to bring down the entire legal system of the country. That means Nick and those who are working with him (including Nick's mentor Jonas Cantrell played by Bruce McGill) are not safe ... even after Clyde is arrested.<br /><br />Like his "The Negotiator" F. Gary Gray starts with a great premise, keeps a good pace in the mid-section, and then ends disappointingly, squandering the potential of the intriguing story. I know I shouldn't disclose the ending (don't worry, I won't), but frankly, the last 20 minutes are so impossible (even by the standards of Hollywood movies) that I still cannot believe what I have seen.<br /><br />I like Gerald Butler. I like this kind of "vigilante" film. As for "Law Abiding Citizen," however, four(or maybe five) stars for the first 60 minutes, one star for the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>When the tragic deaths of Clyde Shelton's (Gerald Butler) wife and daughter go unpunished for one and a quick painless death for the other, he decides to take the law into his own hands.

But actually this is one very good film with two MAJOR quality elements here:<br /><br />FIRST<br />The performances are amazing. Both Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are STUNNING. Their characters are complex and all motivational elements were beautifully written. Foxx is no surprise, but Butler did surprise me. I wasn't expecting him to be such a great actor... but he is.<br /><br />SECOND<br />The premise is brilliant: a man has to deal with the fact that the man who murdered his family gets a deal. This is amazing material,<br /><br />Not so great things: unfortunately, as the second half unfolds, the film tries to become a heavy thriller (and gets a little contrived) and somehow tends to forget the amazing premise and drama it started with.<br /><br />Still... this is a very good film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his family is slaughtered by two thugs who break into his home.  Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is the prosecutor who, in order to maintain his high prosecution rate of 96%, strikes a plea bargain that shocks and angers Clyde.  The thug who orchestrated the home invasion, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte), only receives a few years in prison while his partner, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart), is given the death penalty.<br /><br />  Ten years later, Ames is being prepped for lethal injection, which is suppose to be painless.  However, chemicals are switched and his death is horrifyingly gruesome.  Darby is abducted and slowly tortured to death by having his limbs amputated without anesthesia.  Shelton is arrested for the murders and imprisoned.  Somehow he is able to continue killing everyone associated with the case.  Once a law abiding citizen, Shelton is determined to teach Nick that you should never make deals with murderers.<br /><br />  Expertly directed by F. Gary Gray and beautifully filmed in Philadelphia, "Law Abiding Citizen" is the best vigilante justice film I've seen since Charles Bronson starred in "Death Wish."  Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox head a stellar cast that had a great time working together on this film as evidenced by the commentary provided by producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel.<br /><br />  Gerard Butler, superstar of such megahits as "300" and "P.S. I Love You," gives a very convincing performance as a loving family man whose obsession for vengeance drives him to insanity.  Initially, I, along with many others, sympathized with Clyde's plight; I even cheered him on as he killed Ames and Darby.  However, the killing soon got out of hand and Clyde was quickly transformed from hero to villain.<br /><br />  Jamie Foxx ("In Living Color" television series) and Regina Hall ("Scary Movie" franchise) greatly surprised me.  I must admit to having never seen either one of them in a thriller.  Like Gerard Butler, both of them are well rounded performers.  Foxx's character, Nick, began as a type of self centered, materialistic villain who cared more about his success rate than the personal feelings of his clients.  To him, they were only statistics.  However, Nick undergoes a transformation while struggling to prevent Clyde from claiming more victims.  He lives to regret having made deals with the men responsible for slaughtering Clyde's wife and daughter.<br /><br />  Anchor Bay Entertainment has released a wonderful DVD presentation for "Law Abiding Citizen."  It has an anamorphic widescreen presentation of 2:40:1 that looks superb on a high definition television.  Subtitles have been provided for those of us who are deaf and hearing impaired.  There are some interesting special features that are essential viewing.  The most frightening one to me is "The Justice of Law Abiding Citizen."  It actually provides the loop holes (Felony Murder Rule, Exclusionary Rule and the Plea Deal) that made it possible for Darby to testify against Ames who received the death penalty even though it was Darby who committed the actual murders.  Forensic evidence and eyewitness testimony are also discussed in regards to how they can be perverted in order to free a suspect.<br /><br />  Trailers were provided for several movies:  "The Crazies" - a remake of George Romero's classic horror film; "The Men Who Stare at Goats" - a comedy of psychic experimentation starring George Clooney, Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges; Michael Moore's documentary "Capitalism: A Love Story;" and the bloody and erotic "Spartacus: Blood and Sand."<br /><br />  If you enjoy watching vigilante justice films, then I highly recommend watching "Law Abiding Citizen."  It is a gritty, violent, emotional thriller that is quite provocative.  It asks the question:  "How far will you go to avenge the murder of a loved one?"  It makes the viewer wonder how unjust our justice system really is.  One thing is certain, Nick will never again make deals with murderers.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>This is a must-see action thriller that has an excellent story that dares to challenge the way we think about our legal system, but beware it is not intended for the squimish at heart considering its violent content (definately not one for the kids since rape, murder, and mutilation are all part of the package). I would agree with the other reviews, which in escence collectively agrees that this movie starts out strong in the beginning, but... it was almost as if they ran out of time towards the end and had to start chopping footage to get it all worked into their 2-hour package. I also felt it concluded to abruptly, elinating the big build-up that should have carried through from start to finish, hence the 4 Star rating as opposed to 5. Gerald Butler's performance was outstanding and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. As for Jamie Fox, this was a good transitioning role for him since once I got past that he was Jamie Fox (a nice reminder that it is still only a movie), I felt he was very believable in the role. In conclusion, it's definately a winner worth seeing for edge of your seat action/thriller</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>First, let me say the R rating for this film is well deserved.  Give me a few sentences to compose my thoughts and try to avoid potential spoilers this early in the review and I'll explain my reasoning behind that statement.  (I hate when reviewers give away spoilers without warning, especially when they needn't do so, so I really do try to avoid that myself.)<br /><br />I guess I'll start with a quick run-down of the trailers/opening advertisements for this disc.  First up, a trailer for the 2010 version of The Crazies.  The best part of that portion/segment, the haunting Andrews/Jules cover of the song Mad World (also used as a theme in the advertising for the Xbox 360 game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A4MTGS">Gears of War (2-Disc Edition)</a>).  Ok, I know, that's just my opinion, but I do love that version of the song.  Actually, with Timothy Olyphant starring in this new version of The Crazies, I might actually be interested in watching it when it's out later.<br /><br />Next up an ad for the George Clooney/Ewan McGregor film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECMAE">The Men Who Stare At Goats</a>.  I do want to catch that one when I get a chance.<br /><br />Michael Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a> gets the 3rd slot.  Pass on that one for me.<br /><br />And finally, well, no not the feature/main menu yet, there's an ad for the new Starz! series Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  Plenty of sex and blood ooozing from the ad for that one (but no, that's still not why I would say this film deserved the R rating.  It might be why the preview might, but it's not why the film does).<br /><br />Ok, finally we're at the main menu for the disc.  Here's where you may encounter a few spoilers for this film, but given how long it took me to get here, please don't say you weren't warned.  Again, the following thoughts and comments are highly likely to contain spoilers for the film or at least provide several clear clues as to what to expect from the film.  If you don't want to know in advance, then don't continue reading here.<br /><br />Once we're finally at the main menu we get the pleasure of hitting start to begin playing the 109 minute feature film.  It starts off friendly enough.  Daddy/Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is busy working on some electronic item while daughter is busy making bracelets and necklaces.  Mommy is off somewhere else in the house but fusses at daddy to answer the door when someone comes knocking.  Apparently no one told the stars of the film in advance that this was going to be this kind of film and that they shouldn't have answered the door.  (Apparently the family was too cheap to put a peep hole in the door, or have a dog to help protect the family, or other similar things.)  Before you know it daddy is near death while mommy is on the floor dieing in front of him and daughter is about to be severely harmed.  We're spared the actual gore for that event, as we find ourselves seeing hotshot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) talking to a co-worker about their respective careers.<br /><br />We find out that Rice has a stellar conviction rate that he doesn't want to endanger by going to trial on a case that he could potentially lose.  Rather than blow a possible conviction he decides that he's going to plea bargain with one of Shelton's killers.  By making the deal he guarantees that one of the killers will face a death sentence with the other getting a lighter sentence for his cooperation.  Never mind that the killer that is getting the lighter sentence is the worse of the two (and is the one that actually did the killing), the justice system being what it is, Rice takes the bird in the hand and is left to tell Shelton that this is the best he can do.  Shelton is, of course, unhappy with this as he expected justice, but if he got it, well we'd have no movie, would we?<br /><br />10 years later Rice is in attendance when killer #1 (actually, he was killer #2, but who cares, right?) is having his death sentence carried out.  Killer gives a short speech noting that as god as his witness, he didn't do it, and then the system goes to work.  Except, well, from that point on nothing goes as Rice would expect.  The Killer has his sentence carried out, but rather than being a quiet, peaceful death, cruel and unusual punishment is the order of the day.  Someone must have tampered with the equipment, but who could have or would have done such a thing?<br /><br />Soon killer #2 (who was really killer #1) is getting a phone call tipping him off that the police are about to catch him on a third strike that would have him going to jail for a long time.  He starts running away immediately but gets another call that helps point him towards freedom.  Or so he thinks.  It's not long before we find him stretched out on a table about to meet the star of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> films.  THIS WOULD BE THE PART THAT CLEARLY DESERVES THE R-RATING!<br /><br />Rice continues investigating and assumes that Shelton has taken revenge, though Shelton seems to ready to admit his guilt immediately.  Just as Rice is about to take his confession and run with it, Shelton reminds him that Rice has nothing even close to the legal standard that would be required to get a conviction.  Soon enough both men are in court with Rice asking the judge to keep Shelton in jail rather than released on bond.  Soon we're seeing a scene that reminded me of the Kirkland (Al Pacino) character's great blow-up in the film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053UIE">...And Justice For All</a>.<br /><br />I'll stop the summary here, but note that I could note similarities between elements of say the TV series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKO3GW">Prison Break - Season One</a>, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TODCII">Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)</a> and several other films (and books, TV shows, etc.)<br /><br />In the end I though the film was fine, but really nothing special enough to leave me sad at the thought of missing it.  I'm glad that I got to see it, but wouldn't run out to spend a bunch of my disposable income on this one.  Go with on-demand if possible so you can save a little of your movie buying budget.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>Are you ready to suspend your disbelief? You're going to have to because this one is so remarkably out there.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie, as anyone looking for a new thriller may, but don't look for much replay value unless you're into watching the gore over and over - it's a one-trick pony, but it's very captivating and was able to keep me up after work from 2:00am to almost 3:40am with its sufficiently fast pace for my first viewing on my laptop of this suspenseful title.<br /><br />There are a couple of good gotcha moments, complimented with a scene that you can obviously tell what's going to take place. It's a nice, silly mix.<br /><br />Oh, and why do the burglars always go for the candle sticks first? Classic!<br /><br />In its defense, no pun intended, I'm sure this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing. "Law Abiding Citizen" is put together nicely for what it is and everyone gives a fine performance.<br /><br />Though not for the squeamish, If you can't stand the criminal justice system, then you'll love this far-fetched, thriller!</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>What most impressed me about this jaw clenching, intense thriller was its ability to provoke deep questions about morality and the complicated mental jousting that goes on behind the scenes in our legal system. Helping the viewer empathize with a killer is extremely difficult, but this story does just that. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are complicated characters with many layers and realistic depth. We can't help but feel torn as we go on the emotional journey with a loving father who is pulled into a horrible crime and has a different perspective about how we obtain punishment than Foxx's character. The story has interesting peaks and twists in the action scenes to shake up the genre. A very thought provoking action/thriller that is sure to spark some dinner debates over who the real 'bad guy' is between the two characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A22VNXHU6IZ5MT.html">A22VNXHU6IZ5MT</a><br/><p>This is a great thriller.

A law-abiding citizen, he turns to the Justice Department for help, but instead of Justice he gets Nick (Jamie Foxx) a slick Assistant District Attorney whose only motivation in life is maintaining his 96% conviction rate.<br /><br />Nick, seeing holes in Clyde's eyewitness case where there are none, and fearing his numbers might go down, does a deal with Darby, the actual murderer (who gets three years for hacking Clyde's wife and daughter into bloody little pieces) to send Darby's accomplice (who never touched them) to the Death House.<br /><br />Ten years go by, and Darby's accomplice is put to death by lethal injection. Something goes horrifically wrong, and the man dies screaming and writhing before a roomful of witnesses. At the same time, Nick's family gets a FedExed DVD of a man in a mask hacking Darby into, not coincidentally, little bloody pieces. Nick is such a self-absorbed law-and-order ass that he doesn't come home from work when his hysterical wife calls him, much less attends his Elementary School-aged daughter's first Cello recital.<br /><br />Clyde is arrested on suspicion of the deaths of the two miscreants, and is sent to jail without bail to await trial. While Clyde is in jail, people connected with the Darby verdict continue to die spectacularly (my favorite is the judge, who is shot through the head by her own cellphone).<br /><br />So begins LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, an F. Gary Gray film which, despite its action movie veneer, asks serious questions about the nature of justice and the justice system. There is nobody who doesn't agree that the system is a creaking monstrosity that doesn't work right. Just as in LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, overburdened or overly ambitious prosecutors make deals that mock the ideas of punishment and rehabilitation, the death penalty is wrongly sought (leading to acquittals) and applied (leading to miscarriages of justice), and ultimately justice is not done, either upon victims or upon the accused and/or convicted.<br /><br />LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN is about the right of the individual to ensure that justice be done. Neither Clyde nor Nick is particularly likeable here, and neither is entirely right nor wrong. The storyline is highly implausible anyway. But, like many other reviewers, I found myself very disappointed in the ending, where Nick finally outsmarts Clyde. This unsatisfactory ending costs LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN two stars (at least). It would have been far better had Clyde chosen the ending of this story, leaving the chastened Nick to gather lessons from amongst the ashes of his own self-righteousness.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie was a lot better than I had expected. To me, it was like a mix of 'Saw' and 'Max Payne. Gerard Butler does an awesome job as a psychotic man with nothing to lose. Ten years after a home invasion that leaves his wife and daughter dead, Clyde Shelton returns to seek true justice. I love when he dismembers the man who murdered them. When Clyde is sent to jail, people are still dying in mysterious ways, and Nick Rice tries to stop it. When Rice interrogates Clyde, he wants something in return such as his iPod, and a steak. Soon, nobody feels safe leaving their homes, because they don't know where or when Clyde will strike next. Does he have an accomplice? I highly recommend LAW ABIDING CITIZEN!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I actually got Law Abiding Citizen by accident from Netflix. I was supposed to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV2O">2012</a>, but oddly it was Law Abiding Citizen in the 2012 case. They sent me out 2012 when I reported the issue and I watched that first. Oy, what a mistake that was, because 2012 wasn't a Disaster Movie it was a movie disaster! Anyway...<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen was a lot better than 2012. In fact as the movie played out, I thought to myself, "what a great movie." Even as the credits rolled I felt thoroughly entertained by the movie I had just watched. It had a lot of action, suspense, and it kept me guessing right up to the very end.<br /><br />Then as I reflected on the film I thought more about how silly the premise of the movie is and how far-fetched what the antihero (Gerard Butler) pulls off really is. I'd love to go into detail, but I'm struggling to do so without giving away the critical twists and turns of the movie.<br /><br />So let me just say this: with Law Abiding Citizen you get a pretty decent thriller about a guy (Butler) that you don't want to mess with who a couple home-invaders do indeed mess with. The bad guys get caught and Butler allows the DA (Jamie Foxx) to exact this great country's due process on the bad guys...which fails. So Butler sets a plan to take out the bad guys himself and anyone else that was involved in the failure of Due Process of Law.<br /><br />But man, the way this guy chooses to make his point, and the way he ultimately carries it out are where you'll be saying, "Hold on a second there." So check your brain at the door as I did, sit back and enjoy. It's like the small rollercoaster in the amusement park...it's fun while you're riding it, but after you get off you realize it wasn't that great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>This one is a variation on the old-fashioned vengeance theme, with a surviving family man seeking to rub out anyone who had anything to do with his family's demise. That means the entire criminal justice system, which he thinks did him wrong. As this goes on, it appears that he is also a genius at killing other people himself, as he picks them off one by one from prison, using his highly developed skills. Despite several script holes and a huge lack of lgic to the whole thing, the movie does move along at a fast clip. You will be forced to watch one man cut up with ssaws, and another stabbed in the jugular with a T-bone steak bone, as well as a woman's head blown off by an exploding cellphone. If you like that sort of "entertainment," then watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>It's got a few twists and some stomach-turning violence and it's just another revenge flick in the end. And the end is so boring to boot. When a movie starts off with the killing and rape of the hero's loved ones, it really doesn't matter much what's next: the writer has already signified that he's lazy.<br /><br />Add some good actors (Meaney, Butler) and a fair actor trying way too hard (Foxx), saddle them with some insipid dialogue, kill a bunch of people, add a dash of torture porn, throw in some half-baked cries for justice, and bake at 350 for 108 minutes.<br /><br />Remove and let sit and realize you're looking at something that really ain't very tasty.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>An intense thriller that contains more than one nail-biting scene.

This movie asks a lot of moral and ethical questions and answers possibly none of them. Although I wouldn't look at this film for moral fiber, I'd definitely turn to it for a diversion, and for another look at how divisive the justice system is. The most bothersome thing about this movie is the fact that the title isn't hyphenated.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Ten years after his wife and daughter are brutally murdered, returns to extract justice from the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case against their killers.

Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer. This movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes two very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie.

Ten years later, the man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton admits his guilt, issuing a warning to Nick: either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family or key players in the trial will die.<br /><br />The film addresses the weakness of the justice system while providing plenty of action.  I was never convinced that Shelton would be able to engineer the mayhem that he does from behind bars, but a sense of the believable doesn't seem to have been a priority for director F.

You will like this film because Butler has acted very well and some of the action scenes are like a good quality thriller. The story is very lacking and though Jamie Foxx made a great Ray Charles - in this film he made me question his being an actor. He was very average. The whole film revolves around the character of Butler, there are some action scenes, prison scenes, half intelligent dialogs and grit but that's about it. I felt the ending was so so, please watch this film before buying it blindly. Not recommended for a younger audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>What I hate more than a bad movie is one that had a great premise and wastes it.<br /><br />This is a simple plot.  A man, Clyde Shelton, feels that he was denied justice over the death of his wife and daughter and wants to punish those that were responsible.  But what happens is the ADA, Nick Rice, who prosecuted the case with an eye more on his win lose ratio, becomes the hero and victim of the his ambition becomes the villian.  About 10 minutes is used to set up the story but there is no transition to show or justify anything.  All of a sudden the ADA is caring and the victim becomes a psychopath.<br /><br />Beyond that there are key plot points that are simply wrong.<br /><br />It is stated that Clyde bought a number of properties in the area under his own name but transferred title to a dummy Panamanian company.  Therefore, they cannot locate them because of protections by the Panamanian government.  The first part of this is wrong.  If he bought them under his name, they can find the properties as the names of all previous owners remain attached to the properties forever.  This is a simple computer search.  Additionally, if you have the name of the Panamainian shell company, it would be listed on numerous public records including property tax records!<br /><br />Second, Nick gets a list of amounts paid by the dummy corp and then compare them to the sale prices of commercial properties.  By doing this he locates a property next to the prison that Clyde is being held.  This would be impossible.  It is obvious that the writer never purchased a piece of property!  The check you write at closing is not the purchase price of the property but a net amount, purchase price less deposit plus closing costs, etc.  It is never the exact purchase price.<br /><br />Finally, Clyde is suppose to be a genius.  Therefore, if he planted a bomb, he would have put tamper guards which would have made it impossible for them to move the bomb even a few inches let alone many miles accross town.<br /><br />These a the worst plot points.  There are just too many to list.<br /><br />Add to this a mediocre performance by Jamie Foxx and a confused performance by Gerrard Butler and you have movie that is a waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Basically, I am a man of peace. But I do love me a nice, cathartic, revenge fantasy every now and then (helps to get rid of the bad thoughts). After all, it's been a popular meme in cinema, from Tod Browning's silent "Revenge" (1918) to Tarantino's "Kill Bill" saga. Call it what you will-tit for tat, squaring accounts, settling the score, quid pro quo-the desire for reciprocity runs deep in our DNA.<br /><br />That being said, there are different grades of revenge flicks. When I say that I enjoy the odd revenge fantasy, I'm thinking along the lines of film narratives where the antagonist gets their "just desserts", just not necessarily involving bloodletting (but still served up nice and cold). Examples? "Wall Street", "Michael Clayton", "The Politician's Wife", "Dangerous Liaisons" (OK, that involved some bloodletting-but I think you get my point).<br /><br />Then you have revenge films in the "put your brain on hold" category like "Law Abiding Citizen", a star vehicle for Beefcake du Jour, Gerard Butler (who also produced), which has plenty o' bloodletting. Butler is an "ordinary citizen" (uh-huh) named Clyde Shelton (we'll address the "law-abiding" part of the equation shortly). The filmmakers, in their eagerness to plunge the audience headfirst into the squishy viscera of righteous retribution, jump right to it while the opening credits are still warm. Clyde, appearing to be a mild-mannered inventor-tinkerer type, is enjoying a Hallmark evening at home with his lovely wife and adorable little girl (obviously, they're doomed). Enter a trailer-trash variation on Alex and his droogs, a pair of hygienically-challenged home invaders who wreak mayhem on the family, leaving Clyde maimed and his wife and daughter dead.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the trial, where assistant D.A. Nick Rice (a somnambulant Jamie Foxx) is directed by his superiors to negotiate a reduced sentence plea bargain for one of the murderers in exchange for damning testimony against his accomplice (much to Clyde's chagrin). Fast-forward another 10 years; the killer who sang is released from the joint, while his ex-partner sits on Death Row. Rice gets a disturbing visit from Clyde, who has become a somewhat ominous and brooding fellow in the interim. When the freed killer soon turns up murdered, Clyde does everything imaginable to implicate himself as prime suspect, short of making a legally admissible confession, and is soon in jail (where he actually wants to be-for reasons that are so far-fetched that it is hardly worth explaining).<br /><br />From this point forward, the narrative begins to hemorrhage logic from the gaping holes in a clich&eacute;-riddled script, as Clyde turns into a cartoonish Bond villain who is somehow able to hold the entire city of Philadelphia hostage to his whims...from his jail cell. Frankly, what I found profoundly disturbing about the film is that it is loosely dressed up as a polemic about our broken justice system, when in reality it is an almost unbelievably reactionary piece of torture porn, somewhere between "Dirty" Harry Callahan's reimagining of "justice" as a one-man court system and the Gospel according to Jack Bauer. Yes, I would agree that there are problems with our criminal justice system, but I am not so sure that vigilantism, assassinating judges, blowing up federal buildings...well, basically engaging in domestic terrorism is the best message to put out there as to how we might go about reforming it. The biggest "injustice" of all? Hollywood continues to get away with churning out this offal. Oh well, I guess there's no use getting myself all riled up. I could shoot my eye out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>The lines of what makes a good guy and a bad guy are blurred in this ultra-violent/too-much-swearing film, Law Abiding Citizen.<br /><br />Gerard Butler stars as Clyde Shelton who is forced to watch his wife and daughter get murdered in the first 3 minutes of the film. (Forgive me but I thought Butler looked like the brother of Tom Green)<br /><br />Jamie Foxx plays as Nick Rice, the DA who prides himself in his high conviction rate.<br /><br />The murderers were apprehended but the one who did the actual killing makes a deal with Rice to witness against the other guy in order to get a lesser punishment (3 years in jail).<br /><br />Shelton is outraged and plans his revenge.<br /><br />10 years pass, the murderer is out of jail - still as nasty as ever - when he gets a phone call. Turns out to be Shelton who kidnaps him and dismembers him in front of a camera.<br /><br />The police come, arrest Shelton, lock him in jail and thus begins the cat and mouse game.<br /><br />Somehow people involved in the Shelton murder case are getting killed. All evidence points to Clyde...but he's behind bars. Who's his accomplice and how many have to die before Nick is targeted?<br /><br />I found this movie to be overly graphic. I didn't need to see Butler repeatedly jab a steak bone in the neck of a guy. Nor did I need to see what a body looks like without arms, legs or a head.<br /><br />I also hated the language in this film. I felt like I was watching Get Short or some similar film with the number of F words being thrown around like popcorn.<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen tries to tell a morality tale about the flaws of the justice system of The United States, but the moral is lost when the story is too lame.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I did not like this, not a title I'd buy.

Killing or endangering the lives of innocents is unacceptable to me. Sure kill the two responsible for the crime b/c our legal system is too weak, but it should end there. I dont like the movie b/c it's a Richie Rich story of a brainiac father who apparently has access to military grade weaponry. Didn't like the ending either</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this entertaining, if contrived tale of revenge, but I think the ending truly spoils this slick exploitation film. The films starts off with a bang and has us wanting this unlikely anti-hero to succeed in his destructive mission. The acting is good, but I didn't feel the script allowed us to really get into these character's heads as much as I would have liked.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />The film has a rather silly and contrived ending that feels like a cop out or maybe it's just a case of laziness. Here is the ending I would have liked.<br /><br />When Foxx's character finds the bomb at City Hall, he goes back to Butler's cell to find that he is gone. The bomb they found is a decoy and there is a note in Butler's cell for Foxx stating "He Blew It!". Then immediately after reading this note, City Hall is blown sky high with all the officials going with it. The next scene could go two ways, either by having Butler's character escape and letting the justice system know he will be watching..... or having Foxx visiting Butler in an insane asylum with Butler waking from his morbid dream of revenge as he couldn't cope with the loss of his family. He had been there for the past ten years ever since the system let his family's murderers off! Foxx feels guilty and has been spending those ten years and the rest of his legal career righting the wrong he had done to Butler's character. Either ending is surely better than the silly ending used in the film.<br /><br />*****End Of Spoiler*****<br /><br />I'm no screen writer, but why not give the people what they want in a film like this. The anti-hero is set up to be the character we sympathize with and they should have let us have the total package. It's about time we had a non-traditional happy ending in one of these types of films! Regardless, this is a fun guilty pleasure film that will surely give Death Wish fans a treat, but it falls short in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>Well this movie has star power.  But that's not what makes it a good movie.  What makes it a good movie is there is just the precise amount left to the viewer's imagination, and most of the details are presented outright.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler out did themselves, and served up performances that uniquely fit together as properly as I've seen in a long, long time.  I like movies that are almost predictable but not entirely, and I like it when the bad guy is easy enough to hate that you don't mind when he gets what he deserves because they are demonstrated to be heinous criminals beyond rehabilitation - those type of people need justice upon them regardless of where it comes from.  The technical prowess of this film's gadgetry is impressive although not altogether believable.  There is enough graphic violence and gore, but not overdone.  There is about the right amount of cussing.  The movie's message is easy to relate to and the viewer can't help but get caught up in it a little bit.  Now for the reason I can't give this a full 5 stars.  The ending is wrong, and justice isn't served.  This needed to be a series, and not crammed into a single movie, and the ending needed changed.  For the record, just because somebody wears a business suit and carries a briefcase doesn't make them honest, just, have integrity, practice the Golden Rule, be charitable when deserved and/or harsh where deserved, nor does that business suit make them correct.  But one thing this movie drives home more than any other point is that if you don't have a serious resource of money, you can't fight back and the bullies have nothing to fear.  Unless you've fallen a few too many times which has made you eligible for a pneumatic refill and therefore you have no idea how to ferret out reality, truth, and facts (but at least you wouldn't care).  That said, 3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I feel like a total fool for waiting over 7 months to finally give Law Abiding Citizen a viewing.  I had the opportunity to watch it back in January but I kept putting it off until this afternoon.  What a terrible decision on my part!  Law Abiding Citizen is awesome.<br /><br />A man (Gerard Butler's character) answers the door one night and a robber breaks in.  He then ties up Gerard Butler and kills his daughter and wife.  Later, when the robber/murderer is correctly identified, Jamie Foxx (playing the role of a lawyer) allows the bad guy to go free.  This of course, hurts Gerard Butler's feelings; watching the man who murdered his family walk free with no punishment whatsoever.  So what does he do?<br /><br />He gets revenge 10 years later.  Of course he doesn't call it revenge, but whatever.  Without spoiling too much, Gerard Butler eventually finds the man who murdered his family and tortures the living *heck* out of him.  Now the way the torture segment takes place requires viewers to suspend disbelief because it's almost impossible for all the events to fall into place correctly to allow everything concerning the bad guy to go as planned.  I'm of course referring to a certain phone call that encourages the bad guy to run along the rooftops of the buildings and assume he's being led to safety.  This entire segment is hard to believe and you'll know exactly what I mean when you watch the movie.  I don't want to say exactly how everything falls into place, but yeah- you already know it's a movie and not reality anyway.  At least I HOPE so. :)<br /><br />It doesn't end there either.  While locked up in jail, Gerard Butler messes with Jamie Foxx's character by telling him how he's going to be prosecuted.  At first it seems like the character of Gerald Butler is absolutely crazy the way he's able to dictate his own fate, so to speak.  Soon, it's revealed he has an accomplice.  At least I *think* so.  I don't recall actually seeing him.  I just LOVE the way Gerard Butler is able to completely take over the entire FBI, the police department and everybody else, and continue his little rampage of violence all the while being locked up in jail!<br /><br />Anyway, it's important to note that once Gerard Butler is arrested for torturing the man who murdered his family, the movie does NOT turn into a typical lawyer film.  This is most certainly a suspense/action packed movie the way Gerard Butler continues to take out his anger on those who may have been even SLIGHTLY in any way, shape or form connected to his family's murder.  Yes we're dealing with a lunatic here, haha.<br /><br />Overall, I loved it.  Nonstop excitement is in store for you, I can promise you that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H44WVZS59KKT.html">A2H44WVZS59KKT</a><br/><p>This was a much better revenge film than I thought it would be.  Lots of twists and turns that I was not expecting from the Butler character.<br /><br />I like Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill and Josh Stewart, which were all the main reasons that I watched this film.  And I'm glad that I did because most of the actors turned a mediocre plot into a good movie.  Butler was great in his role as the vengeance-driven engineer with a secret past.  Foxx was not so great - wooden, one-dimensional (if he'd been on the top of his game, this would have been a stellar movie).  The others were great in their supporting roles.<br /><br />The ending could have been more fitting to the direction the rest of the film went but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />NOTE:  Lots of violence, rape scene, language, torture.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>Good action great plot it did leave me guessing a couple of times which I liked. I think both characters did a good job it's a movie I would rewatch again.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>This is the kind of movie where you route for the success of the man doing all the killing.  Clyde's wife is raped, and she and his daughter are murdered by two men right in front of him in a home invasion robbery and murder.<br /><br />Nick, the prosecutor (Jamie Foxx), plea-bargains with one of the men to sell out the other in this crime.  The end result is that the man who raped and killed Clyde's wife gets a reduced sentence and is pretty much set free, while the other guy (who didn't do any killing, just robbery) is actually sent to death row.<br /><br />So, what makes you mad about this movie is how our judicial system works.  Nick, the prosecutor is more concerned about winning his case, than he is about actually seeking justice for the man whose family was murdered.<br /><br />So Clyde (Gerard Butler), a rightfully angry man of whom justice just disregarded him, calculates a well orchestrated plan to deliver his own brand of justice and actually go after all the participants of the prosecuting case that wronged him, including Clyde's wife's rapist.  Although, Clyde's main enemy in this revenge is Nick the Prosecutor.<br /><br />So, Clyde studies how law works and learns all the things that it takes for him to maintain his rights in a way that the prosecutor and judge cannot touch him.  And people are dying all around Nick the Prosecutor, where we believe that Nick's death will be last so that he can see Clyde takes his revenge on everyone else first.<br /><br />This movie was great to watch, until you get to the end where the judicial system once again wins to the disappointment of the viewing audience.  When Clyde was about to deliver that final blow to the whole courthouse and the rest of the city's judicial members that represent law and order, it is thwarted by Nick and his assistant.  Clyde dies sitting on his own bomb.  This was so disappointing.  So, the man who had to watch his own family die, is killed by the prosecutor who set his family's murderer free.<br /><br />If I were allowed to write the ending of this movie, I would have had Clyde successfully kill Nick's wife and daughter, and then let Nick the Prosecutor, live with the very kind of outcome that he creates as justice for other victims.  Unfortunately, this movie ended with just what might have been a realistic ending:<br /><br />No justice.  None from the beginning, and none at the end.<br /><br />Although, I don't endorse murder of any kind, I do believe Clyde should have had the right to kill his family's killer. If Nick the Prosecutor had to do anything it took to win his case, he should have at least allowed Clyde the liberty of killing his family's murderer himself.  If Nick the Prosecutor was a fair and decent man, he would have given Clyde all the information needed for Clyde to hunt him down and take his revenge on only him. No one else would have to get hurt. This would be deemed fair by the American majority.  This would be closer to justice.  Don't you think?<br /><br />If Clyde killed Nick's family and let Nick the Prosecutor live on without his family, that would make this a more justified and enjoyable film.  I would definitely want to own it then.<br /><br />I hated the ending here. I was just so disgusted!</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>When I saw this film advertised for theatres, I thought it was an action film.  I don't think it was marketed well.  Law Abiding Citizen goes way beyond action, though it does have some explosive sequences.  It's actually more of a noir thriller, with many plot twists and unexpected diversions.  It had many elements that reminded me of films like Phone Booth, Die Hard With a Vengeance and even Speed.  The trailer made it out as a simple criminal versus a virtuous DA, but it's much deeper than that.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are playing a deadly game against one another, and there is no black and white.  Butler's character is supposedly "the villain," but one that is so easy to sympathize with, even justified in his actions. The film really highlights many of the problems in our criminal justice system, lending the story credibility and realism.  The plot kept me guessing as to just how Butler was accomplishing his objectives.  However, I do think the ending could have been better.  After so much clever cat and mouse, the climax was too simple and didn't live up to what came before.  Overall though, it was an exciting film that kept me paying close attention and on the edge of my seat.  Also, the acting from the two leads was top notch, and even the supporting cast was noticeably superb.<br /><br />The DVD has some well done extras, including featurettes on special effects shots and behind the scenes.  However, the best featurette discusses the law behind the film.  Experts explain the actual statutes that impact the characters in the film and how they are realistically played out in the story.  It added a lot to the film, basing the plot on more than than just getting off on "a technicality."  The extras add to the film experience.  Well worth the money; I'll definitely watch this again.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Clyde Shelton (Butler) is the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in which his wife and daughter are murdered. The killers are soon caught and Nick Rice (Foxx), a hotshot prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over Shelton's objection, Rice strikes a plea bargain with one of the suspects to testify against his accomplice. The story then flashes forward ten years. Shelton begins his revenge by killing the men who murdered his family. His plans are however much larger than that. He quickly is taken into custody and admits his guilt. Now confronted by Rice, he tells him more people will die unless he exposes the corruption in the system! Rice quickly finds himself in a cat and mouse game, where Shelton always seems two steps ahead!<br /><br />This was a good movie. Butler was excellent as always. I am not a fan of Foxx, but he was serviceable in this role. This is a great revenge tale. As a husband and father, I was rooting for Shelton all the way. However, this is not a 4 or 5 star film as some suggest. The revelations at the end of the movie are a little to far fetched and take away from the suspense that was so well put together for most of the movie. Still, it certainly is worth a watch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The film was sharp looking and the sound was good. This is not the type of movie that has a lot of eye candy. Most of the film takes place in dark and dingy settings. SPECIAL FEATURES: Nothing special here. Standard featurette stuff. FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are a fan of the film BLU RAY is the only way to get the UNRATED version. WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>It is a film that starts with home invasion gone bad - really, really bad.  Husband is stabbed to death (but survives - Gerard Butler), wife is raped and killed and so is their little daughter.  One wonders what good can come out of such gruesome violence and how anyone surviving such event can ever regain their humanity again.  What is left to hope for, live for and plan for?<br /><br />However, when a victim of such crime is a former special forces agent trained to make tactical plans and kill wothout thinking twice, it seems that all is fair game. With nothing left to live for, plenty of money and time to plan revenge on people who took away what he loved most ofr did nto careenough to fight for justice, all participants in this story are fair game for serial killer who has lost the last connection of his humanity.<br /><br />Not a very believable scenario, but film is a thriller nevertheless.  If taken likely, it is bearable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" is a thriller with a fairly unique twist in that the bad guy is already in prison when he gets serious about killing people.  The victim of a brutal home invasion, Clyde Shelton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009XN4C">Gerard Butler</a>) has to watch as his wife and daughter are savagely murdered.  Then the American criminal justice system adds insult to injury when Philadelphia assistant district attorney Nick Rice (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">Jamie Foxx</a>) decides to plead the case out, despite the protestations and outrage of Clyde.  The details justifying the plea bargain are rather nebulous, because the main idea is to set up the profound sense of injustice that will send Clyde off the deep end.  Even if Clyde's eye-witness testimony would be suspect in court, it is certainly enough for Nick to make sure that even if the letter of the law dictates that both criminals are equally culpable for the murders that the one Clyde insists did the actual killing is not the one who gets the better deal.  Certainly the D.A. can make the same deal with the other guy.  But the devil is not in the details here, so all that really matters is that Clyde sees Nick shaking hands with the scum of the earth who killed his family.  Once the prologue is ten years past, we get to the execution of the guy who got the short end of the deal and things go horribly wrong.  Then Nick uses a more direct approach to dispatch of the thug who did the actual killing, showing a flair worthy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385496982">Dante</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Jigsaw</a>.<br /><br />I would say that my problem with this 2009 film is that my sympathies are way more with Clyde than with Nick, but to tell the truth I did not mind rooting for Clyde, even though he is admittedly not in the same class as previous guilty pleasure bad guys like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014K5ZA">Richard III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">Hannibal Lecter</a>.  The main selling point of the movie is that you get caught up way more with "what" he is doing and "how" he is doing, especially since you already know the "why."  Each "what" is a fairly sophisticated way of disposing of the people on his hit list , while the "how" has to do with the fact that for most of the movie Clyde is not only in prison, but in solitary confinement.  Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who also wrote the script for the remake of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305657947">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>," certainly knows how to come with elegant crimes, although this time around the goal is to kill people rather than steal paintings, and I like the explanation for how Clyde is able to do all that he does, once we finally get around to the origins of his peculiar set of skills.  Beyond that, Nick does not fit the bill as a worthy hero, not only because he is slow to catch on that people are dying because he is several moves behind in this killer chess game, but also because he fails to see himself as being culpable in any way, shape, or form for the gross injustice that set all of this in motion.  The more Nick stuck to his "principles" and refused to follow Clyde's instructions, the more I was actually hoping for an ironic ending where Nick literally feels Clyde's pain.  Director F. Gary Gray ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000B1OFL">The Italian Job</a>") goes a bit over the top with the big ending, which really runs counter to the feel of the rest of the film, but that is probably what happens when the mandated ending is an attempt to balance the scales before the end credits.  After all, we cannot have somebody bringing down our criminal justice system, can we?  Consequently, "Law Abiding Citizen" is one of those films where the journey is better than the final destination.<br /><br />This last paragraph is only for the eyes of those who have seen the film, so beware: there be spoilers here.  While watching this movie I was bothered by the whole idea that Clyde Shelton has an accomplice who works as the "Mr. Outside" counterpart to his "Mr. Inside," simply because there are really no logical possibilities to who that might be.  A lot of times in movies you can figure out the surprise because there are only a limited number of possible suspects.  So I was pretty much convinced they were going to have to pull one out of left field, and was actually pleased when they avoided doing that.  However, I was less enamored with the convenient mistakes that Clyde made to allow Nick to put two and two together in the final reel.  I also understand why Nick was so slow to catch on to the fact that Clyde has already put everything in place before he made his first demand behind bars.  Of course, the more I think about this film the more flaws I find in it, even if they were not painfully apparent during my first viewing.  However, I find it interesting that most of my thoughts are about the few but key changes Clyde could have done to ensure his plan played out to its intended end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>"Law Abiding Citizen" is full of surprises from the get-go. Director Gary Gray immediately shows the crime in the opening segment. There is no doubt about the killers or what they have done. The husband (played by handsome Gerard Butler) is the living eyewitness to the crime: his wife and daughter are viciously murdered during a house invasion. He is left to die.<br /><br />Then come the opening credits. Ten years later Jamie Foxx (the assistant district attorney) has made a deal for one murderer to turn on the other to get at least one lethal injection, although the actual murderer is the one who turns. Clyde Shelton (Butler) has patiently waited for justice--as he is a law-abiding citizen. Yet the Fox move to put his wins up to 96% riles the moral marrow of Shelton's bones. Where is justice? What kind of legal system do we have? The viewer knows there are deals, dismissals, too much protective rights for criminals and not enough for victims. Justice begins to show her vigilante face. The turncoat dies viciously.<br /><br />So far the movie is believable. Viewers can even identify with the methods of vigilantism. Right is right (even when it is wrong). When the line goes far beyond blur to a reverse perversion, I, a whopping big Butler fan, must cry foul.<br /><br />Then the viewer learns the nature of Butler's work (not to be revealed here). Things make sense now. Law abiding? From whose viewpoint? Can justice be validated under such circumstances? Does Foxx play fair when he makes deals. He justifies his actions--and reasonably well. Granted, he follows the letter of the law, but what about that moral marrow?<br /><br />The question slips from the nature of justice to address the two men: Who is right? Who is wrong? Can a line be drawn in this circumstance? Ultimately, "Law Abiding Citizen" addresses the serious flaws in our justice system. The method may be beyond the Pale and in the realm of fantasy (method not to be revealed here), but this vehicle of thought provokes! It is obvious why the two lead actors chose their roles--to be part of an ongoing discussion of the nature of justice and how it can be obtained in a flawed society run by flawed people.<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen. Even the title is provocative.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Every one is tainted, except the kids. A give no quarter attitude is the ideal. No gray allowed.

A man's wife and child are killed during a home invasion.  Instead of justice, the prosecutor(Jamie Foxx) plea bargains the case because he is not 100% sure he can win and in his quest to raise his stature in his firm he wants to keep a high percentage of wins no matter what.  Gerard is not happy with this and is much more than he seems.  Years later he starts to take his revenge on the system and people he thinks betrayed him.  God concept and story holds up fairly well until the totally outlandish ending.  Gerard Butler is terrific both sympathetic and menacing.  Foxx however was so unlikeable in the role I found myself routing for the bad guy the entire movie.  I don't know if it was the script or Foxx himself who brought nothing to his role.  Some pretty gruesome scenes for those who are faint of heart.  This is a good rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I've always loved revenge movies. Just as romantic comedies are a big favorite of many women (including my wife), I am a sucker for a great revenge flick! Some might say about revenge films the same as I do about rom-coms: they're all the same and 99.5% predictable. However, with F. Gary Gray's latest, "Law Abiding Citizen," he takes the revenge formula and gives it a twist. Rarely do we see in any revenge film, whether it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000541AN">Death Wish</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UV">Eye For An Eye</a>, "The Count of Monte Cristo," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XSWVFQ">Man On Fire [Blu-ray</a>], "Kill Bill," or the more recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUNYO">Taken [Blu-ray</a>], where the protagonist becomes so enraged over his/her loss that even though it's driven them to such an extreme as revenge, it never pushes them over that fine line of punishing those who didn't "have it coming" to them.<br /><br />Well, in "Citizen," we meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) who's a simple family man, soldering away at his home desk as his adorable little daughter is stringing beads together to create a bracelet. With only a minute or two of dialogue between father and daughter, there's a knock at the door and Shelton goes to answer. Instantly the action begins as two robbers break in, incapacitate Shelton then proceed to rape and murder his wife as well as murdering his daughter. A month or two later, hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is trying the murderers in Shelton's family homicide case. Rice regretfully admits to his mentor and boss District Attorney Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill, playing the usual smarmy trait invoked in most of his recent characters) that in order to keep his high conviction rate up to par and climbing, he accepted a deal with the main murderer, I mean, suspect Clarence Darby so that he could get a conviction of Darby's inept accomplice Rupert Ames, thus sending Ames to death row. However, when presenting the deal to Shelton, Rice explains that the only way to get a definite conviction at all is to take the deal with Darby, which would only result in him being given a measly five years in jail (for third degree murder). An emotional Shelton disagrees and begs to try for a conviction on both suspects since he knows Darby was the main perpetrator. Rice says the deal is already done and even though it disgusts Rice, he follows through with the deal, even being coerced into shaking Darby's hand outside of the courthouse, cameras flashing away. Then we see Shelton witness this, almost as terrified and betrayed as when he witnessed his wife being murdered, and that, my friends, is when the movie really kicks into gear. That is what pushes Shelton over the edge to exact a revenge plot that sends the entire city of Philadelphia into a panic.<br /><br />Ten years later, Shelton not only takes revenge on the murderers of his family, he holds everyone accountable - from Darby's attorney all the way up to the mayor (Viola Davis) and the justice system itself. So, of course, that means he holds Rice accountable. The film stretches into an enjoyable cat-and-mouse game between Rice and Shelton, but, unlike those previous films I mentioned, there is no absolute good or evil here. The audience is left to feel that Rice can't necessarily be held accountable since he is "only doing his job," and it's difficult for the audience to hold conviction for Shelton, an innocent man who lost his entire family so violently. So, in order to ease the audience's minds, the writer Kurt Wimmer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BP4K2M">Street Kings (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGGE7C">Ultraviolet [Blu-ray</a>]) sets one particular scene that sets Rice and Shelton apart, assigning a good and an evil. Believe me, you'll know it when you see it. When this scene plays, the audience is left to ask: should a person(s) who unknowingly abetted a known felon be held accountable for the felon's actions? This predicament is explored in all kinds of media, even comic books (i.e., should Batman be held accountable for all the people the Joker has killed when he could have stopped him by killing him?). The answer is different for all of us and the scene with which I'm referring, screams, "No!" And in a lot of cases, they may be right. All I can say is that this movie's scene still didn't convince me to scream the negative in my mind. Even when it's shown that Shelton's past in black-ops helps explain his genius, all the while edging him more to the experienced "psychopath" status, it doesn't take away from the fact that Shelton's wife and daughter are no more innocent than the career-climbing, shallow prosecutor who took a plea bargain from a possible killer who could've easily been convicted in court. Nor should Shelton's wife and daughter's lives be pitted in the same category as their killers, Darby and Ames. While Shelton's methods are at times extreme, there is no measure or limit of pain for someone who has gone through such a loss. And anyone who's gone through such a loss feels he has nothing left to lose. This movie is a testament to that.<br /><br />Still, the main question here (as with all revenge pics) is: Does his unfair loss justify all the death that he's caused? Sadly, I don't think a movie can truly answer this moral ambiguity. I say this because, in a movie most times, we the audience see the truth of the matter that the characters in the film did/do not see. In "Citizen," we see that Darby is the main killer of Shelton's family and therefore most of the audience have already agreed in their minds that he should be punished in some way and not given a plea bargain. But that is not what Rice knows in the film and so he makes the wrong decision which leaves a majority of the audience not liking his character; especially when we find out that he did it just so he could keep his 96% conviction rate to someday climb to gain D.A. status. The true test of morality in a film such as this comes when even the audience doesn't know whether the person under suspicion did the crime or not (case in point, Clint Eastwood's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029F21BA">Mystic River [Blu-ray</a>]). Only then are our morals truly tested.<br /><br />When we know who the real culprit is, most of the audiences' opinions are already formed, leaving the rest of the movie hoping for the "good guy" to prevail and the "bad guy(s)" to face justice. That's why I sometimes enjoy revenge films. They're not always about trying to leave an indelible impression on the audience so that they continue to discuss the film hours after its ending. Mostly, revenge films are just genre action flicks where the good guy and bad guy duke it out. And while "Citizen" desperately attempts to be a morality tale of turning the avenger into a psychopath, and thus making the audience question revenge and whether the world is truly black and white, it doesn't live up to those films which do convey this question/message: "Mystic River," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F1IQN2">Munich (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L212HC">The Prestige [Blu-ray</a>]. This film did a great job at the art of revenge but its ending was something to be desired. I feel like the writer tried too hard to make it into something it wasn't: a thinking-man's revenge thriller. The vengeance that Shelton takes on each of his prey is methodical but also fitting to the responsibility he believes they had in his family's injustice.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed "Law Abiding Citizen." While I loved the beginning and middle - and the pacing was excellent - the very ending was a little too morally self-righteous and unbelievable for me to swallow. Not only is it unbelievable about how Shelton continues his vengeance while still in prison, but what's most unbelievable is how Rice and Shelton come to a head at the end. Those last 15 minutes of the film while a little tense were, nevertheless, a bit droll but also mostly unfitting to a story that gave so much potential in its first 94 minutes. It seemed as if the writer planned on penning a great revenge thriller, but, at last minute, changed his mind and wanted to try to send some deep, affecting message. And while that works for films like "Mystic River" or "Munich" - movies where revenge (although prevalent) takes a backseat to morals and humanity - it just didn't for this film, where gore, violence, catchy one-liners and many different ways of killing someone was at the forefront.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>No book report summaries or opinions about the plot, acting or anything of that ilk.  I am only concerned with the transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />You are provided 2 discs, one has the extended version and the other the theatrical version plus extras.  Since I have this movie on Standard Def and enjoyed it, I thought I might like an extended version on Blu Ray.  There are 10 additional minutes added to the extended version but most of the new or extended scenes, I barely noticed as they really didn't add a whole lot to the movie.  Never the less, they are there and inclusive within the film.<br />On the 1st disc, which is the extended version, there are many previews of other movies and TV shows.  I hated when they do this, I truly do as they just take up valuable room on the disc itself that could go into more extras, cut scenes, less compression in the transfer or any other number of  worthy things.<br /><br />The video transfer is good,  not great, just good.  The standard def version was also good so I don't think you will have an eye popping epiphany of visual delights.  However, there were no artifacts or aliasing and I didn't see any grain to speak of so the transfer to blu ray was pretty decent.<br /><br />The audio transfer to DDHD 5.1 made good use of the front sound stage with some deep bottom end in several parts.  The rear channels were not used very often but some discreet audio to the rears was present, just not too often.<br />This is a fun movie to watch and I am glad to have it now on Blu Ray, however, don't buy it thinking it will be used as a Demo disc to impress yourself or your friends.<br /><br />Now that Amazon has changed their fees in CA to include sales tax, while they are at work on their website, would it be possible that they could separate the standard DVD reviews from the Blu Ray or new versions as they come out.

When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system - from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.<br /><br />The one thing that distinguishes "Law Abiding Citizen" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.<br /><br />That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with "Law Abiding Citizen."</p></br><a href="../users/A3SS6VRWCTB7V.html">A3SS6VRWCTB7V</a><br/><p>Interesting how easily one can side with the victim when it comes to revenge.

But instead of it being a past defendant who gets out of prison, it is just the opposite, a victim who is upset with the way the system treated his attackers.  Overall the movie was ok in my opinion, got a little bored in the middle of it, yet the beginning and end were quite interesting.  Some graphic bloody scenes which I thought were a little too much and could have done without them.  It's a different type of criminal law movie and I would not compare it to say, A Few Goood Men or The Lincoln Lawyer, but if you like movies about courts and the judicial system, then would think you could enjoy it.<br /><br />Peter J.

When the killers are caught, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor is assigned to the case. Against his will, Nick is forced to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years..."<br /><br />This is the setup for Law Abiding Citizen, which at first appears to be another a legal thriller but little by little becomes a revenge film in a similar fashion to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQMAM">The Punisher</a> and the like. Clyde is out for vengeance and it is Nick's job to prove in court that Clyde is guilty, a phrase from the movie "it is not what you know, but what you can prove in court" echoes the conflict between these two characters throughout the film.<br /><br />The movie was quite entertaining and this is basically due to the fact that there are several reveals and twists that help the story move forward, Clyde's quest for vengeance is quite gory at times so parents be warned if watching this with young kids. Acting is quite good but definitely not the best from Jamie Foxx. Gerard Butler's character is written in a way that even though you know he's wrong and he is clearly the bad guy you still feel empathy for his cause, which makes him a very interesting character. Simply put, `Law Abiding Citizen' is what I would call a  popcorn flick, do not expect a work of art but pure entertaining, if you see it like this you will definitely enjoy it and accept its bizarre and bloody death sequences.<br /><br />The edition included in this DVD is the 109 minute theatrical version, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XMGGJM">Law Abiding Citizen [Blu-ray</a>]edition does include both the theatrical and uncut versions if you are interested in it and own a Bluray player. The movie is presented in an anamorphic wide screen frame of 2.40:1. The video quality is average considering this is a DVD, after watching it though I don't think this is a movie that would benefit too much in the Bluray format as it is mostly interiors and prison scenes. The same goes for the sound, a track in Dolby Surround 5.1 sound is included but there aren't really too many sequences that would take advantage of it. Subtitles included are English for the deaf and hearing impaired and Spanish.<br /><br />Several extras are included in this editions and are listed as follows:<br /><br />* An extra audio track with the audio commentary by Producers Lucas Foster and Alan Siegel (the little I could actually check was interesting, they acknowledge some plot holes they had to fill, production notes and the like so if you liked the film I would recommend you listen to it)<br /><br />* The Justice of 'Law Abiding Citizen'  featuring cast and crew and an actual LA prosecutor talking about the legal ramifications of the case the film's about.<br /><br />* Law in Black and White - Behind the Scenes  is a black and white piece behind the scenes.<br /><br />* Preliminary Arguments - The Visual Effects of 'Law Abiding Citizen' highlights some sequences of the film (which I will not describe to avoid spoilers for people who has not watched it) and the FX in them.<br /><br />Also included is The Verdict - Winning Trailer Mash-Up, the theatrical trailer and additional trailers for  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECMAE">The Men Who Stare At Goats</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030Y11XS">Capitalism: A Love Story</a>, and Spartacus: Blood and Sand</p></br><a href="../users/A2UNMXBJSVIXFB.html">A2UNMXBJSVIXFB</a><br/><p>Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't think much of it. It looked like it would've been a decent crime thriller or something of that sort, but, boy, was I wrong. Law Abiding Citizen, in fact, is a pretty good movie filled with heavy amounts of ethical and moral quandaries, metaphorical allusions to how people are responsible for their own actions, and is an eerie testament to the legal system's flaws and shortcomings. I was actually reminded a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo in how a man just loses everything, gets cheated by the system, and in about ten years time amasses a fortune to plan out this giant, masterful revenge plot against all those embedded within that system and those whom he feels have wronged both himself and the rest of society. Well, it's not as epic as the Dumas classic, but if the writers did, indeed, use it as some kind of inspiration, bravo. The thing that fascinates me the most about this film is the tension. Once you see the traumatic event that triggers Butler's character and the way he's unjustly justified through court (in a city that ironically prides itself on "justice"), how can you blame the guy for going off the deep end and putting all this chaos into action? On top of that, I've yet to even mention the predicament of the law versus vigilantism. By now, I'm sure we've all seen some example or another of how operating outside "the system" can also be thoroughly more effective than the papers and red tape of the law, or at least that's the message I get from the ending. However, in the process I feel the movie also loses quite a bit of steam when certain plot points are revealed toward the end. I also feel that there isn't enough "change" to the system itself, so much as it is for just one person. Maybe it's to illustrate the futility of how the system can't be changed and how it continues to suck, or maybe they just wanted us to get the message that revenge isn't all it's cut up to be?<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen is brought to us by Starz / Anchor Bay in 1080p using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (framed at 2.39). This is the first Starz / AB Blu-ray I've ever watched, so I wasn't sure what I was getting. But to tell you the truth, it's not so bad. The film's gritty nature reflects well in the photography, which leads to a darker color palette that more or less is as vibrant as it can be. Black levels, however, are excellent with darkness and shadows being the highlight of the presentation. Contrast is also surprisingly good given the amount of dimly-lit scenes. The only faults I have are with a little loss in texture and detail in some of the closeup shots and a few instances of debris popping up here and there, which is really weird considering most recent films usually have none.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Despite all the dialogue, the movie also is very proficient with its TrueHD 5.1 track. The dialogue is clear and free of any anomalies, and surround usage is fairly immersive during prison and other facility takes. However, the real workout comes in the bigger action sequences and through various parts of Brian Tyler's score. High/low ends are deadly accurate for the cemetery scene, with LFEs exceeding my expectations for explosions. The score is fairly quiet when need be for certain parts of the movie, but when things start getting crazy, I feel it really helps establish a good mood for the fast pace. I wouldn't quite call this a reference disc, though, as a few parts of the movie didn't feel as engaging as I thought they'd be, but this is an excellent first-time listen for me.<br /><br />Extras - 3.0<br /><br />There's a commentary, two main bits about legal terminology and filming, a graphics progression bit, and a bunch of trailers. The legal terminology feature was what I found most interesting. It basically breaks down the logic and reasoning behind the decisions made at the beginning of the movie, as analyzed and explained by two former Philadelphia attorneys, and makes a lot of sense. The filming feature was a short, though unorganized, look at how they shot certain scenes, came up with ideas for the writing, and so on. It was interesting on a few parts, but not as detailed as I expected. I would've liked a more in-depth interview with director F. Gary Gray about the plot.<br /><br />Overall - 4.0<br /><br />The movie makes for some great, great drama, exploitation of the legal system, and "what if" dilemmas. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit of a downer in that it feels "too easy" and kind of loses the overall point of trying evoke change within "the system." But a large majority of the movie is still very good and very tense. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx aren't on screen together a whole lot of the time, but it makes for a cool battle of wits when they do. With excellent A/V presentation and a decent set of extras, Law Abiding Citizen comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Plea bargaining has always been an enigma to me.  Purportedly done for "the greater good" these deals do carry collateral damage and make our justice system less admirable.  Such is the case with LAC.  Initially I was sympathetic to Gerard Butler's character but once he goes on multiple killings, he's nothing more than a psychotic killer and you can't cheer him on.<br />The movie is artfully done and the acting is very good...one of Butler's best and Jamie Foxx's restrained performance is compatible with Butler's rage.<br />The accomplice theory is somewhat explained in a contrived ending but not to the detriment of the entertainment value.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>Saw this by accident--sort of.  I was at my cousin's house in Crisfield, Maryland and she had rented it.  Once I started watching it, I had to find out who did what and how. Although not my kind of movie, I have to admit it was VERY good.  BUT, it is very bloody and includes torture, beheading, and sodomy.  It even flipped my stomach a bit.  If you can handle that shock stuff, read on.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Gerard Butler and his family are confronted by burgulars.  He is tied up and forced to watch his wife sodomized and murdered by this rotten $#@$^& "person".  After that, he carries the daughter away.  Fortunately, they didn't show the details but you do find out he killed her.  Although stabbed and left to die, Gerard lives and is hell-bent on revenge.  He is a master on strategizing.  Even while he is in jail, people are dying brutally, one at a time.  But, is it him?  How can he kill people on the outside?  Does he have an accomplice?<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is a DA and does an acceptible job in the movie but Gerald ain't no dummy.<br /><br />The strategizing is really good and Gerard does one heck of a job in his role.(Nice Bod, too.)<br /><br />BUT--this is a brutal movie.  God only knows what the "uncut" version has that the one I watched didn't have, but I won't be finding out.  Please, do NOT let your children watch it.  If you buy it for yourself, watch it when they are not home and then lock it away somewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>The movie opens with Gerard Butler beaten and tied watching his wife being raped and murdered, and a (thankfully behind closed doors) insinuation that his young daughter has met a similar fate after a home invasion by two thugs.Roll the clock forward to see the broken Butler witness the ADA (Jamie Foxx) cut a deal to virtually free one of the assailants for evidence to bury the other, and explain to the grief stricken Butler, that some justice is better than none.<br />You've seen the trailers, and probably professional reviews, and this looks like a straightforward revenge movie, and it pretty much is, only while trying to be more, and make more social comment, it quickly goes awry.<br />Any sympathy I felt for Butler's character vanished half way through the movie when he begins systematically killing anyone and everyone he can to get back at ADA Foxx, and bring down the flawed legal system. Your initial horror and sympathy begins to wane when you watch him tie up and torture someone to death, the end result making him as psychotic and unbalanced as the men who killed his family. And who knows, maybe that's the message of the movie, that grief and revenge can tip you over the edge? Or is the message that the legal system doesn't work? Whichever it is, it would have been better to channel those ideas into just making a movie, and not being a "clever" director by telling us what's wrong with the World. Most of us already know thanks.<br />At least most of the movie is feasible, even if it's unlikely. 10 years have passed since the trial, time enough for Butler to set his master-plan into action. The situations and schemes are believable, especially when we find out (of course) that Butler was a former CIA/FBI agency whatever, whose specialty was making people dead, even unreachable people.<br />It's a pretty good taut thriller, predictable, but very watchable with some top notch acting all round. Perhaps 3 stars is a little mean, it just could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie is very good and enjoyable. The sad fact is that our justice system is not perfect, as evinced by this film - the guy that did the worst gets off with a short jail sentence and the guy who didn't actually kill anyone got a death sentence, but this is what happens when lawyers become more concerned with their records than actually serving justice. This should be a clear message to any lawyers watching the film - DO THE RIGHT THING OR THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN.<br /><br />At first, I was rooting for the Law-Abiding Citizen. The way he dealt with the man who violated and killed his wife and daughters.... bravo! I do wish the torture scene could have been more drawn-out. No, not the torture/cutting itself, but showing him at various stages through his slow death - legless, then armless, etc, begging for his life, the LAC talking to him scolding him, berating him. The movie would have benefited from that, because him doing that to his wife and daughter's murderers was justified.<br /><br />I laughed at the part where the daughter gets the DVD and watches it after her mom tells her not to. THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT LISTENING TO YOUR PARENTS, or even checking the address on the envelope. You should know better than to open mail that does not have your name on it, tsk tsk.<br /><br />I felt disappointed when he started going after innocent people, like the lawyer's assistant and the like, because at that point, I was no longer rooting for him. He just totally lost it, and the movie started to feel more unreal/unbelievable, at first I was prepared to give it 5 stars, then it dropped to a three, however, the ending was very good (in a thought-provoking sense), and brought the overall rating back to a 4. If you like thrillers, this is a good movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>What do you get when you take the disturbed genius from Seven, the sadistically brutal revenge from Man on Fire, the attack and subsequent vigilante justice from the awesome Death Wish Collection, and the structure crashing desire for anarchy from Fight Club? The product is the immensely enjoyable action thriller Law Abiding Citizen.<br /><br />When wealthy engineer Gerard Butler sees his family murdered as he lay helpless on the ground, anguish and pain rule his life. His lawyer, assistant DA Jamie Foxx, is a slick winner known for an extraordinarily high conviction percentage. Against his wishes, Foxx brokers a deal in exchange for testimony from one of the criminals. Predictably, the scumbag goes free early, and Butler is beside himself with disbelief when he sees his lawyer talking to the rat. Rather than go all "Time to Kill" on everyone, Butler decides to let the pot simmer deep inside. Fast forward ten years, and Foxx - now one step away from being the DA - must deal with a rich and vengeful Butler who has boiled over with rage at his misgivings with the U.S. legal system.<br /><br />This is one of those movies perfect for viewers who shut their brains off, or for those who must question everything. For the former, there is nonstop action, plotting, and awesome revenge that rivals the best vigilante justice ever seen. Butler is perfectly calculating, displaying what a resourceful person can do with no other true goal in life but to exact revenge and pain upon those who have caused harm. For the latter, it's an introspective look at crime, prosecution, and justice. Regardless of aspects that may be a little difficult to believe - but not quite Armageddon unbelievable - it definitely causes a viewer to evaluate the justice system flaws...while enjoying the Butler's wisecracks and richly deserved revenge that every family member who has suffered through something like the actions of this movie's killers.<br /><br />From top to bottom this is a very entertaining movie. It's not all explosions and shock scenes, nor is it a snoozefest. With great directing and acting, a concept with which most people can support, and a clever ending that is fair considering the protagonist dichotomy, it's easy to root for each side of justice, and each character's goal. And if that is possible, then the point being made in this film is successful. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This is undoubtedly one of the best "revenge films" even though the revenger insists that he is not seeking revenge; he only wants society to learn to abide by the law.<br /><br />  The revenge plot - the result of ten years of meticulous planning - is excellent, the acting is superb, and so too are all of the gimmicks. There is not an unsuspenseful and undramatic moment. Two men push their way into the home of a brilliant government employee (Gerard Butler) in Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, and one of them repeatedly stabs his wife and kills his child. The prosecutor (Jamie Foxx) insists that he must make a deal with the killer because he is afraid that he might otherwise loose his case. The killer agreed to testify against his accomplice if he only has to serve five years in jail. Butler demands that Foxx not do this especially because the man who will serve the relatively small jail sentence is the actual killer. Foxx refuses. Ten years later the accomplices is executed, but not as all expected. Butler changed the ingredients used to execute the man and he died a very violent and painful death. And this was only the first of Butler's many revenge murders. He captures the actual killer who invaded his home and violently kills him over a long period of time with painful injections of chemicals and by cutting up his body into twenty-five pieces while he was conscious.<br /><br /> Foxx finds learns from a man who worked with Butler that Butler is a brilliant man who the government used to kill people from a distance so that no one could prove who did the murder. He has the skill to anticipate how people will act, and he used that skill in developing the methods of murder. He never did anything he did not think out before hand. Thus, the chances of Foxx defeating him were very slim.<br /><br /> Butler allows himself to be arrested. He kills his cell mate and is placed in solitary confinement. "He is in jail because he wants to be in jail. Don't think that he killed his cell mate for no reason," the man who worked with Butler warns Foxx. "You can't stop him unless you put a bullet in his head." While in solitary confinement, he murders many more people. He kills the lawyer who represented the man who murdered his family and he kills the judge. Then he blows up the cars of the lawyers and staff who worked at the District Attorney's Office, except for Foxx and his boss, the DA. Then he kills the DA and the police who are guarding him. "Everyone," Butler tells Foxx, "must be accountable for their actions. I'm going to bring the whole f...g system down. It's going to be biblical." Foxx and others wonder if he has an accomplice. The mayor closes down Philadelphia to protect its inhabitants and has armed guards placed on the streets.<br /><br /> Viewers will sit in suspense watching all of this and how it is done. They will wonder if Foxx can find out if there is an accomplice and, if not, how does Butler commit the murders from solitary confinement, and can Foxx stop him, and will Foxx learn what Butler wants to teach him, and will Foxx resort to non-legal methods to stop him.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>How far would you go in order to fix a justice system that is so broken it would allow some evil to go relatively unpunished? That question is the driving force behind the newest action thriller from director F. Gary Gray ("Four Brothers"), "Law Abiding Citizen", starring Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />"Law Abiding Citizen" is the story of a family man named Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) whose entire life is torn apart when his wife and young daughter are brutally murdered in front of him. Seeking justice through the legal system, Clyde is shocked when he learns that up-and-coming Philadelphia prosecutor, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has cut a deal with one of the killers in order to get a confession and heftier sentence for the other offender. Ten years pass by, and mysteriously the two killers are murdered and Clyde is more than happy to confess to their grisly deaths. However, their deaths were only the beginning as Clyde issues an ultimatum that will shake Philadelphia and its arrogant prosecutor to their core.<br /><br />When the premise of a movie is an attempt to right the wrongs of the legal system, what are the chances that the movie remains realistic? By my estimation, the likelihood of such an absurdly sounding concept for a movie succeeding is slim to none. Surprisingly, this twisted morality tale written by Kurt Wimmer ("Equilibrium") never becomes an exercise in absurdity, although there are a few moments where one does begin to wonder if it might.<br /><br />Assisting in keeping the film on track is the fact that the story moves along at a brisk pace. Thus, the audience is never really allowed time to fully contemplate the semi-ridiculous nature of the premise. I mean are we really going to believe that one man can change the legal system, seriously? Besides that the characters are very well written, effectively gaining your interest from the very beginning. The two leads alone provide some very entertaining verbal sparring sessions throughout the duration. If the characters hadn't been handled in such a captivating and true-to-life manner then I doubt the story could have succeeded in remaining grounded in some semblance of reality.<br /><br />Of course, what would an action thriller be without great action sequences? Well, it would be rather boring, obviously. The action set pieces in this film are so elaborately designed, with great attention to detail, that you can't help but be impressed by the sheer creativity on display. The ingenuity within these scenes made the movie even more engaging for me. Had the action been handled in a lazy manner, resulting in a run-of-the-mill series of explosions or gunfights, the movie would have quickly begun to lose its appeal. After all, who wants to see the same old crap over and over again? Certainly not me, but that's what so many of these action movies tend to throw at us, but thankfully "Law Abiding Citizen" does not fall prey to this particular pratfall.<br /><br />Bringing the mayhem to life is Hollywood's current reigning "It" guy, Gerard Butler ("300"). With his character of Clyde Shelton, Gerard could have easily made the mistake of going overboard with the anger and aggression. If that had happened then Clyde would have become more of an insulting caricature of a man consumed by his hatred and grief; instead, he remains relatively low-key throughout, thus keeping him relatable. It's a testament to Gerard's acting ability that despite all the carnage his character has wrought, you still sympathize with the man and in a twisted way, root for him. That is a rare feat in movies, and one I'm surprised they achieved here.<br /><br />On the other side of the mayhem, is actor Jamie Foxx ("Collateral") as hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice. Jamie plays Rice with the appropriate blend of arrogance, caring, and determination. Jamie continues to deliver solid performances as an actor, and just like Gerard Butler's character, there are times you may find yourself surprised you're sympathizing with this man. Even though Nick's choices set many of the movie's events into motion, the story gives you ample time to understand his mindset, and as a result you find yourself rooting for him as well.<br /><br />I found it very strange that this movie was able to make me root for both of the lead characters throughout most of the film; especially with them being on opposing sides. It's not often when I see a movie that would leave me satisfied no matter the outcome, but "Law Abiding Citizen" manages to be one such movie.<br /><br />Featuring great performances, elaborately staged action set pieces, and a fast-moving, gritty storyline, "Law Abiding Citizen" is a taut and intense thrill ride that will have you riveted from start to finish.<br /><br />"Law Abiding Citizen" is rated R for violence and language</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>Law Abiding Citizen is about a mild-mannered family man, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion. Shelton's lawyer, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), is a hotshot Philadelphia prosecutor with a 96% conviction rate. He tells Shelton that the evidence is too weak for a conviction and arranges a plea bargain with one of the killers, Clarence Darby, in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Rice keeps his winning streak and Darby, the real killer, walks after serving a light sentence while his partner is sentenced to death by lethal injection. Feeling betrayed by the broken and corrupt criminal justice system, Shelton becomes a man obsessed. He lets himself get captured and uses his brilliant mind to orchestrate a series of vengeful acts from his jail cell (sort of like the Joker in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight</a>) in order to teach the world a lesson about justice, a lesson taught in blood and dead bodies.<br /><br />Without giving away any major plot points not already divulged by the DVD box art or Amazon's editorial review (which has some wrong info), Law Abiding Citizen is just utterly ridiculous and strains credulity, even when one generously suspends disbelief. The problem is that it's written by Kurt Wimmer, who after the cult hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRRAE4">Equilibrium</a>, went on to make the super terrible and idiotic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGGE7C">Ultraviolet</a>. With flimsy character development and nonsensical plot devices, this far-fetched thriller handles story progression with the subtlety and grace of a sledgehammer. The setup within the first 5 minutes is an absurd and simple-minded way to justify the rest of the movie. Shelton, a brilliant inventor with a dozen patents, is at home with his daughter tinkering away when a loud and urgent pounding comes from the front door. He opens the door, two men rush in, bound and gag him and proceed to brutalize his wife. How can someone be so stupid? Being the talented engineer, you'd think he'd have some sort of advanced video security system, or at least think to look through the peephole before opening up the door. There is no explanation for the motivation behind the brutal and sadistic crime, how the investigation was bungled, or why Shelton was left alive. All this is glossed over.<br /><br />After the brief trial, 10 years go by in one camera pan, yet no one has visibly aged a day. Now Shelton sets his devious plans in motion, first exacting his revenge on the two killers, then on all those involved in the case. What doesn't follow is why Shelton devotes a decade to plotting this huge elaborate scheme, spending his entire life savings, setting up a shell company and convoluted finances when he could've simply offed the guilty parties over the years through covert means. Not enough development (actually, none) is shown on how this soft-spoken engineer becomes this obsessed madman bent on thinking he can change the system. There are enough plot holes and faults of logic for a herd of elephants to fall through. His evolution from peaceful family man with no history of violence to cold, calculating serial killer capable of gross mutilation, torture, and assassination is unconvincing. (You'll see two very graphic acts of murder committed by Shelton, one involving a power saw and another involving a spork). Instead, we just skip ahead 10 years and he's already a hardened sadist and unflinching murderer in his own right. The revelation at the end into his methods is ludicrous and too outlandish. It's all very Batman-ish. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br /><br />Fans of MacGyver will get a kick out of seeing Bruce McGill (Jack) as Nick Rice's mentor, but otherwise, none of the characters except he and the young female research attorney are likable. This film ask us to make any emotional investment in the one-dimensional characters, so we don't care if they lived or died. I can only recommend this as a rental, or if you are particularly fond of Foxx, Butler, or director F. Gary Gray. It can be entertaining on a boring evening, but don't expect too much out of this far-fetched thriller. A thought-provoking drama, it is not. 3.5/5 at best.<br /><br />On a final note, this DVD gets points for sporting an environmentally-friendlier case design from Eco-box that uses less plastic. It's lighter and supposedly recyclable. Outside is a slip-on paper dust jacket.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>LAW ABIDING CITIZEN<br /><br />STARRING: Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, Leslie Bibb, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Regina Hall, Michael Irby and Viola Davis<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Kurt Wimmer<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: F. Gary Gray<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 16 October 2009<br /><br />I don't know exactly what I was expecting Law Abiding Citizen to be like; but I know I wasn't expecting Saw meets The Punisher! It's a thriller more than an action or horror picture, but it embodies similar elements of both these genres.<br /><br />You need to ensure that when you take your seat, you are completely ready, because when the movie starts, it starts! I'm not sure whether it was due to editing for time or if it was the filmmaker's direct intention, but we get the wind knocked out of us from the get-go. While I was not a fan of this method for this particular film, I can see how most will appreciate it a great deal.<br /><br />We meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and his family for about three seconds before they are attacked by two intruders. Clyde witnesses his wife and daughter being butchered and brutalized in front of his very eyes, before being left for dead himself. I'll admit it was very shocking, but we don't even get to know the characters at all before they are slain; so for the rest of the film we have no sense of who they were. Two or three minutes more with them would have been sufficient for me.<br /><br />We move forward and learn Clyde has survived and that the assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), has been appointed to his case. Nick is rushed and impatient with Clyde when he does not agree to the plea-bargain that Nick has been ordered by the DA to make; one of the killers will testify against his partner for a lessoned prison sentence. Nick believes this deal is better than no deal, as due to a loop-hole, both killers could walk. Nick informs him that it's too late to negotiate; the deal has gone through and that's just the way the system works.  Clyde is devastated but there is nothing he can do. Or is there?<br /><br />10 years go by and Nick has had a successful career and now has a daughter of his own. We have no idea what Clyde has been up to; until the execution of one of the killers goes horribly wrong. When the other killer winds up brutally murdered, all evidence points directly to Clyde.<br /><br />It's clear that Clyde expected to be arrested because after these two sadistic, well planned killings (which I will not describe in detail), we know he is smarter than anyone else in the film.<br /><br />Once arrested, he outsmarts Nick in a very well written and acted scene and that's just the first of many similar amazing moments. More people start dying; all linked to Clyde's case. But Clyde is locked up. Can he really be responsible? Yes he can. We learn along with everyone else in the film, that Clyde is not your every day guy.<br /><br />He has a past similar to that of Rambo. In one particular scene, Nick interviews someone that Clyde worked with in the past. The man flat out tells Nick, "If he wants you dead... you're dead."<br /><br />On top of all that, Clyde's spent the last decade familiarizing himself with the law and the supposed justice system. Eventually he is in a place to bargain with the city and Nick is forced to act as a liaison between Clyde and Philadelphia. Clyde gets under Nick's skin by asking for ridiculous favors in exchange for some self-incriminating information. He is exposing how corrupt the system actually is.<br /><br />One of the great things about a film like Law Abiding Citizen is that you are entertained visually by the action sequences, but at the same time this is a film that really makes you think. You can't help but ask yourself what you would do if you were in Clyde's shoes and this happened to you.<br /><br />I didn't feel like Jamie Foxx really brought his full potential to this film like I have seen him do in others. On the other hand, he's such an extraordinary actor that perhaps this role was just too simple for him.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is an amazing actor. He has a wide range of roles he can play. From his barbarian of a character in 300 to his romantic side in P.S., I Love You; Butler has shown us his vast range of talent.  In this film you believe him in every scene and he and Foxx make a good match for each other.<br /><br />Some of the things Clyde pulls off are a little far-fetched; but the film was beautifully written and directed, and is full of twists and turns that you will never see coming. The movie races forward like a bullet tearing through flesh and we are along for the ride, loving every minute of it.</p></br></body></html>

Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive.<br /><br />Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee, and Helen Hunt stars as Kelly, Chuck's fiancee.  On Christmas Eve, Chuck is scheduled to fly to the Far East on FedEx business, but while in flight, the plane encounters a terrible storm and they are forced to deviate from their original flight plan.  This course change takes them over 400 miles off course.  Even with the coruse change, the storm is still raging, and soon, the plane, damaged greatly by the effects of the storm, plunges into the Pacific Ocean.  Chuck is the only survivor.<br /><br />For the next four years, Chuck is forced to struggle to survive on a deserted island far away from any shipping lanes or air routes.  He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.  Naming the volleyball "Wilson", it becomes a companion for Chuck, who uses it to converse with and vent frustration.  Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.  With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.  After drifting for over 500 miles, Chuck is finally picked up by a ship and returned to civilization.<br /><br />Upon returning home, he realizes that much of his former life has changed.  He is told that his fellow FedEx employees held a funeral for him when they thought he was dead, and his former fiancee Kelly is now married to another man and has a child of her own.  Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be together after so much had happened to both of them.<br /><br />The ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.  It shows Chuck standing in a crossroads trying to decide which direction to go.  He is also probably trying to decide which direction to take with his life as well.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.  The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.  Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.  It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.  I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.  Other symbolic things in the movie included Chuck casually lighting a lighter and remembering his struggles trying to make fire, and picking up a crab leg and then immediately putting it back down after eating them for so long.<br /><br />I give this movie my absolute highest recommendation.  Tom Hanks is excellent and the story is terrific.  Watch and see how one man's courage and will to live conquer all obstacles.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>After reading a few negative reviews of this film, I became convinced that some people need help in figuring out certain things, like BEING STUCK ON A DESERTED ISLAND FOR FOUR YEARS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LONG, MEANDERING, AND IT JUST PLAIN ....!  Anyway, I quite liked "Cast Away", despite a slightly slow third act.  Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee who happens to get stuck on an island, all by himself and with barely anything to survive with.  What surprises me about the film is it's usage of elements such as a musical score (virtually nonexistent for 2/3 of the film), sound effects (the "score" for most of the film), and even photography that have to explain a lot in a film like this.  Even though it is a good film with some good performances, it is marred by a slow third act, but is definitely a commendable effort.  The DVD boasts a few documentaries on the island itself, survival techniques, and one on Wilson, the volleyball.  It also includes a 45-minute interview with Tom Hanks on not just "Cast Away", but on some of his previous efforts (including the upcoming HBO miniseries "Band of Brothers").  Plus, there's some visual effect sequences broken down for your amusement, and the trailers, TV ads, and a nicely hidden Easter Egg that may answer one of the movie's more intruging questions.  It's a nice presentation for a good (but not great) movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks is a great actor...i really enjoy some movies with him, like the brilliant FORREST GUMP...CAST AWAY is another jewel in Tom's career...It's a really nice film, with a soberb interpretation from Hanks....REALLY GOOD!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Cast Away (2000)<br />Drama, 143 minutes<br />Directed by Robert Zemeckis<br />Starring Tom Hanks<br /><br />Tom Hanks was probably the biggest box office draw for around 10 years, starting with Philadelphia in 1993. Like Meryl Streep, his performances haven't always won the awards they deserved. We expect excellence from Hanks and Streep, and it's never easy to add an Oscar after you have already won twice. Cast Away sees Hanks give one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The opening part of the film introduces us to the life of Chuck Noland (Hanks). He works for FedEx and is obsessed with time. Everything has to happen according to schedule or he considers himself a failure. Noland is in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), but his life is too busy for him to make her his main priority. They have to exchange Christmas gifts in the car on their way to the airport because he doesn't make time for anything more significant. This is a common theme in the lives of too many people. We rush around, earning as much money as we can, barely slowing down long enough to spend time with the people we love. You don't miss it until it's gone.<br /><br />Noland's plane crashes and he's the sole survivor. He manages to swim ashore and finds himself alone on an island. This isn't a new idea, but the execution is excellent. Noland is used to a comfortable life and has to learn how to survive in his new surroundings. Where will he live? What will he eat? Will he need to protect himself? What if he's ill or in pain? How will he remain sane? How will he escape and make his way back to civilization?<br /><br />I enjoy Cast Away because it's such a peaceful movie. All we hear are natural sounds while Noland is trapped on the island. There isn't even any musical score during this extended sequence. It helps us realize what it is like to be completely alone. How would we adapt and survive? Would we have the mental strength to seek escape? It's an examination of how human beings think, and that always appeals to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Cast Away is a good movie. I'm scared to go in an airplanes for the fact that it can crash. And you never know where the airplane will crash. Specially if it crashes in the water. I don't know how to swim. But either way this movie was interesting on all the way's he came up with to stay alive for four years.  But once he was found and went back home it is real sad that his long time girl friend, Kelly, was now married and they had a child. Kelly is the one thing that kept him alive for four years. Now that he is back you can see in Kelly eyes that she wishes she could leave her husband for her true love. But it wasn't going to happen. In the end it seemed he was going to find love in another woman.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: He sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore. From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows you in this movie to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A fantastic movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>One can make a case that Cast Away was Robert Zemeckis' last great film. After the underrated Contact, he focused attention on making a story in which for a good chunk of the movie, there's no dialogue or score. Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well. It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.<br /><br />Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee obsessed with time and making sure packages are delivered in a speedy manner. With a girlfriend, Kelly, he's planning on marrying, life seems alright until a late Christmas delivery has to be made and while en route, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Entirely alone on an empty island, the once time-obsessed Chuck now has too much of it and has to learn how to survive.<br /><br />Cast Away on my first viewing when it first came out was one of those movies that I liked but didn't necessarily love outright. But now and then, there's that desire to re-watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up. The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions. And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly. Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.<br /><br />If there's some scenes that bring the film down slightly are the non-island scenes where he's about to leave and when he returns home. It's necessary to show his life and daily activities before he gets stranded but you still feel slight cutting down was in order. The post-island scenes are also polarizing since they do feel different and almost alien-feeling to the island but with the film at a relatively healthy 2 h 15 minutes sans credit, it feels like it does take awhile before we get to the ending though I like how it leaves on a slightly ambiguous note.<br /><br />With a terrifying plane crash sequence, a compelling middle section though slightly inferior bookends, the film is good though because the film is better that doesn't make it amazing but considering what it could've been, I'm glad it's this way.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Cast Away with Tom Hanks is the story of survival after a plane crash and the evential survival skills facing our hero in this movie. It puts the TV reality series "Survivor" to shame. Excellent film with its story line and the eventual rescue in the end. Not to be missed by the Tom's many fans! I enjoyed it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I had not watched this movie since it was released to DVD some years ago,so I decided to watch it again in my home theater. I must say I did not remember this film being this good! It is truely an amazing film that has the viewer running through a gambit of emotions. This movie runs close to 2 1/2 hours, but it moves along quicky. The DVD transfer and extras for the 2 disc set are excellent and worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P121GNV5QYIN.html">A3P121GNV5QYIN</a><br/><p>6 years after the masterpiece that was Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite to bring another masterpiece to the big screen.<br /><br />Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a FedEx deliverer who after a plane crash, fines himself both lost and alone on a tropical island. With either no or very little hope of getting home, Chunk must learn how to survive on his own, including doing his own dental work yuck and somewhat having someone to talk to in the form of Wilson, a vollyball.<br /><br />The film is 143 minutes long and about 80 minutes of it are just spent with Hanks on the island. Helen Hunt was good as Hanks's girlfriend it's just too bad she wasn't on screen long enough but she gave a good performance none the less. But this film belongs to Hanks, who earned his fifth Oscar nomination with his very superb performance and I can't wait for what Hanks and Zemeckis come up with next.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>An extremely dedicated FedEx man finds his whole reason for being, totally interrupted in a matter of minutes. With one of the best and most believable crash sequences ever put on film, were gone the love-of-his-life and his career. In no particular order. Tom Hank's characters always seem to pull the audience in, making us care about what happens to them. The sounds of being stranded on a desert island, waves hitting the sand, give that sense of realism and feeling all alone. Great effort from the sound effects crew. And after too many years in isolation, he pretty much loses it with the loss of his one companion "Wilson".<br /><br />I guess the one complaint expressed by many, not myself, was the even bigger disappointment he suffered after returning to civilization. Extremely touching, with the falling rain a symbol of the many years of tears and separation. But there is also the positive side. An ending with the hope of a new beginning.<br /><br />A film I can watch over-and-over again. Once again, a brilliant collaboration for actor Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe is, without a doubt, very good in "Gladiator", but Tom Hanks in "Cast Away" is superb. It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.<br /><br />This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.<br /><br />Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.<br /><br />The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared. Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away. It is here that the picture falters somewhat, as there is no happy ending and the film ends somewhat unresolved. Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>This film wasn't too bad, I worried how Tom Hanks would do at such a role but this is also the man who made himself fit into the role as Forrest Gump so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. And he did well in this role as well. A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island. I always worried there would be a threatening person or creature on the island that would eventually attack him but I guess they thought that Tom Hanks being alone on the island was more dramatic, and I could see that. This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well. And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending. It's just an ending, that signifies a new beginning for Hank's character. A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.<br /><br />Overall I really did like this film. It's not the sort of film I always watch but Tom Hanks made it work to be an interesting film, and for most of the time a quiet one- and it's not easy for a film to be both interesting AND quiet so yes good job Cast Away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This is a film for which I have very mixed feelings. I didn't care much for it when it first came out but through DVD have surely learned to appreciate it.<br /><br />The plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained. My biggest problem has to do with the long scenes between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt at the return of the movie, they're just frustrating as closure for the characters couldn't ever exist. To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie.<br /><br />Still, a great an unique experience which somehow I find myself repeating on a regular basis.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...that wasn't very hard to make. But in its' "simplicity" to me it manages to be as complete as it could have been, and that way being some kind of a simple "masterpiece". Confused? If so I apologize, but the movie I'm trying to write a "worthy" review of here being as moving and as brilliant as it is for being a movie with very limited dialogue and "events". Most of the movie taking place at a distant island far from the civilized world, where Hanks' character spends four years after a plane he's on crashes into the sea.<br /><br />The silence and the loneliness he feels is brilliant described the way he builds up a relationship with a soccer ball that he paints a face with his blood on. What keeps him alive is the hope of seeing the love of his life again, and finally he takes the risk of setting out to the open ocean not wanting to die alone on that island. Four years as mentioned.<br /><br />The movie is no lost-island-adventure-movie, not at all. It's a "modern" drama (though timeless I believe) without pirates and treasures. It seems to focuse on being as realistic as possible, and this way it makes it easy to imagine this mans' desperate situation.<br /><br />Not wanting to give too much away here for those of you who haven't seen the movie, "Cast Away" has perhaps the sadest ending ever in the "movie-history". Ok, I'm a guy, but the ending here made it almost hard to breathe -and I doubt I'm the only guy who've felt that way seeing it.<br /><br />So where some find "Cast Away" disturbingly boring others will find it moving and beautiful. As I did. Because of the fantastic acting (as usual by Tom Hanks, also by Helen Hunt playing his girlfriend), the way we get involved in the lives of the lead characters here -I'd say; Highly recommended!<br /><br />"Cast Away" is a one-of-a-kind-movie, and this way it stays with you for a while.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>With CAST AWAY, I think Tom Hanks reached a pinnacle of perfection in his role as Chuck Noland, the FedEx exec who gets stranded on a remote Pacific island.  Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.  The performance is a brave one; Hanks had to undergo a considerable physical transformation and took a whole year to do that.  Working again with his Gump director Robert Zemeckis, Hanks is required to work solo for about an hour of the movie, with very little dialogue.  It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.  Wilson the Volleyball is a wonderful addition as Tom's only "companion" on the island and when Wilson is lost at sea, Hanks' remorse is nearly devastating to him and the viewer.  The movie's third section is a little depressing in that Hanks' life has changed so much and his loss once again of Kelly (a sturdy but underused Helen Hunt) is heartbreaking.  The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.  Hanks should have won the Oscar for Cast Away, losing it to an over-rated Russell Crowe.  But he sure doesn't have anything to be ashamed about.  He joins Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie) for the Oscar robberies of recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>&quot;Cast Away&quot; reunites once again the awarded team Zemeckis / Hanks, and once again they made a good film. There are several remarkable aspects in &quot;Cast Away&quot;: overall the cinematography is excellent, the photography is quite realistic and Tom Hank's characterization is also great.<br /><br /> Robert Zemeckis and William Broyles (screenwriter) showed a lot of creativity by including the lovable character &quot;Wilson&quot;, definitely a character to remember. &quot;Cast Away&quot; sometimes feels and looks so realistic that you really feel trapped in a lonely island with Tom Hanks. You will suffer along Chuck Noland (Hanks) loneliness and desperation.<br /><br /> Technically &quot;Cast Away&quot; is almost flawless, like all the movies directed by Robert Zemeckis, and overall the story is very good and realistic. However the movie also has weak spots: Helen Hunt is misused in a very lackluster role to Helen's standards. The first half hour of the movie elapses with few highlights, and the last half hour is kinda disappointing.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a worthy movie. Specially for Tom Hanks' fans or Robert Zemeckis' fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>Cast Away is the second movie Robert Zemeckis made in 2000, and it's by far his best one. The director is bringing out a lot of worthy films at the moment, and choosing to work with Tom Hanks an awful lot is the right answer to success. So, what makes Cast Away worth seeing? From the trailer, it looks like a guy gets stranded on an island, yes? Well, the movie has a deeper meaning to it - it's about not abandoning what you believe in and never giving up on hope. We've probably all heard that meaning before, but since it is only one actor playing all of it out by himself, it seems somehow more complex and detailed. Tom Hanks' performance is absolutely brilliant; his most memorable yet playing a character that has morals everyone should follow. Helen Hunt isn't in this movie much, but when Hanks and her pucker up, it's one of the most magical moments in the movie. Cast Away is adventurous, daring, sickening and beautiful, I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Not quite what I expected. Yes, the film wants to be about more than Robinson Crusoe, thus the emotional/relationship drama is given much more space than expected ... but that's not we went to see. Whether the symbolism of the title works on more than one level is clever, but the fact that it wasn't emphasized in the trailers seems to say that the producers knew that the moviegoing public wasn't too interested in that aspect either.<p>The first half of the movie works, and we identify with Hanks' character, and begin to ask ourselves how we would have fared, and all the comforts we take for granted ... but before we can witness more of his transformation from hapless modern man to wizened hunter-gatherer, he is rescued.<p>Then the second part of the movie begins ... but do we really care?<p>Spectacular environmental effects, and sense of isolation and aloneness ... if only there were more.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>&quot;Cast Away&quot; is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so-so film. In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy. <p>Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express employee who's obsessed with time. We inhabit Noland's go-go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time - no mean feat with Russians. <p>We meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).<p>All of this changes when Noland hops a Federal Express plane for a business trip to the South Pacific. The flight gets lost, then the plane is forced to ditch in the Pacific. After fighting to escape the burning, sinking plane, and struggling to survive in typhoon-racked seas, Noland finds himself stranded on a deserted, hardscrapple island. He instinctively reaches for his pager...and it's dead.<p>Suddenly, the man who is ruled by the clock has nothing but time. Hanks' transformation from helpless castaway to hardened survivor (and back to a civilized man after he's rescued) is alternately funny, sad, triumphant, and downbeat. He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.<p>The sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of &quot;Cast Away,&quot; and taken alone, they're brilliant. Unfortunately, the bookends of the castaway story - the time before Noland is stranded and after he is rescued - don't even begin to approach the power of the island sequences. <p>For starters, once Noland's rescued, he wants above all to see his old girlfriend; unfortunately, in the intervening years, she has written him off for dead (as she should have), and she's married with kids. Director Robert Zemeckis - no stranger to schmaltzy relationships - toys with the audience briefly by suggesting they might get back together, but the mere idea of it is beyond silly, and thankfully, it's never consummated. The two characters are not the same two people who existed before Nolan was lost, after all. <p>But the mere idea of these two reuniting is so silly to begin with that Zemeckis is foolish for even entertaining it. Better to have cut that one off at the root, and had Noland start his journey of rediscovery. I also wish that Hunt would have been given more of a character to work with; she's basically stuck in a &quot;loving housewife&quot; mode, but we don't know what makes her tick, and I didn't see many sparks between her and Hanks.<p>Like all Zemeckis' movies, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style; after all, how do you do &quot;Back To The Future&quot; camera moves on a desert island? Zemeckis compensates by adding other sensory stimulation - namely, sound - to the largely static camera shots to give us a kinetic sense of place. <p>Overall, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes. It's too bad that these pieces didn't make a better whole.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe was, without a doubt, very good in &quot;Gladiator&quot;, but Tom Hanks in &quot;Cast Away&quot; is superb.

It's far from it!  Survival is only a small part of the story of Chuck Noland, who ends up on a deserted island in the Pacific after a plane crash.  There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.  Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.  As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot - on the plane as it goes down, on the raft as it bobs in the waves, on the island alone.  It's the realism that's led to the PG-13 rating, and not offensive content.  Admittedly there are a few items of content that are morally questionable, such as a few incidents of blasphemy, a crude sexual joke, and the contemplation of suicide.  Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though-out his stay on the island there's a real absence of religious faith as fatalism replaces providence (while burying a crash victim, Chuck concludes an "empty" ceremony with the words "So.  That's it.")  But on the whole this movie is morally inoffensive, and its PG-13 rating is mainly due to frightening scenes, such as the airplane crash and later a floating dead body, and several injuries including the scraping of skin on coral, a splinter in his hand, and the removal of a tooth.  But even these scenes are more frightening because of the emotional sense of pain than graphic images.  Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening. Hitchcock would have been proud.<p>But even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie. The survival story is framed by the story of Chuck's life in America.  As a result, the movie is like a play with three Acts.  Act 1 introduces us to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx systems engineer whose professional life is ruled by the clock.  "We live and we die by time.  Let us not commit the sin of turning our back on time."  His personal life, including his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) is dominated by time, and it is exactly for this reason that Chuck ends up on the doomed plane which crashes into the Pacific in a storm.<p>Acts 2 shows Chuck cast away on the island.  The clock, as it were, has stopped.  His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).  The island is no utopian tropical paradise, and consequently Chuck doesn't succeed with everything right away.  As he seeks to obtain the basic elements needed for human survival - food, water, shelter, fire, and companionship - there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.  There is little dialogue, but a few floating FedEx packages supply him with "Wilson" the volleyball, who becomes his companion.  It's somewhat corny, but Wilson becomes a device for Chuck to express his thoughts and hold imaginary conversations.  Time has stopped on the timepiece Kelly gave him, but it is her photo on the clock that inspires Chuck to stay alive.<p>Act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.  His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.  As his colleague says: "Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life."  But coming back to life isn't so easy when you return to a world after five years where time hasn't stopped.  If surviving as a castaway on an island was difficult, Chuck discovers that it's just as difficult to be alive in the changed world to which he has returned.  Back at home, he's still a castaway.  Just as on the island, where "I stayed alive.  I kept breathing", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring.  A magnificent story-line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.  I was grateful that the story didn't degenerate into a feel-good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live-in relationship).  The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.  There is a note of hope in the end, but it is not shoved down your throat, with Chuck left at the cross-roads of decision: "Where are you headed?  Well, I was just about to figure that out."  If there is a criticism, it would perhaps be that we don't get to spend as much time with the changed Chuck in Act 3 as we would like -  he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.  But for viewers whose lives are also governed by the clock, what we do see is already enough to motivate us to spend our few years on earth under the clock wisely.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks. <p>This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning. <p>The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.<p>Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>Last night's bargain-rack movie was "Cast Away" and starred Tom Hanks. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade. I've always liked camping. I guess it's just a little adventure in  that you're out in the open and don't really know what's going to happen. Plus, it's coping with natural conditions. Well, that's just a micro-adventure, of course. If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give "Cast Away" a viewing.<br /><br />Tom Hanks played a globe-trotting, overly busy FedEx employee. He joined his fiance in Memphis at Christmas and promised to be back on New Year's Eve, after a quick trip to the Far East. Well, the FedEx plane went down somewhere in the Western Pacific. Hanks managed to escape and with a small inflatable raft made it to an unknown, apparently uninhabited island. His only possessions were that which he had on him and about a half-dozen FedEx packages which beached along with him plus a dead FedEx employee who was killed in the plane wreck and floated ashore. Well, it was immediately back to The Stone Age for Hanks with no food, no tools no shelter and few clothes. Of course, there were the FedEx packages, which had such useful items as a pair of figure skates, a volleyball and a big collection of VHS tapes. The skates became his only tool and the volleyball, with a face fashioned out of a blood smear, became his only companion He called the ball Wilson, after the brand name.<br /><br />The movie depicted Hanks' struggle to cope with his environment and find enough foodstuffs to survive. He ended up living on coconuts, small crustaceans and the few fish he could catch. Ultimately, he got a fire started, Boy Scout Style. This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted. Ultimately, he built a raft out of wood scraps tied together mostly by vines and the VHS tapes. He managed to get it out beyond the surf zone with him then floating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization. Everyone had given up on his survival. He had been given a funeral. They even buried a casket containing some of his belongings. His fiance was married and had about a three-year-old daughter.<br /><br />This was just a stunningly good movie. Essentially, it's a one-man show with just a bit of minor support at the beginning and end. There is no question in my mind that Hanks should have had the Best Actor Academy Award no matter what the competition was, His performance was just stunning. The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect. Essentially, there was almost no action. It was just a one-man struggle against nature. There were no wild animals, not even birds. No disasters, other than the plane crash. No musical score to accompany the movie. None of the essentials, yet it was a stunningly good movie.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt star in this 2000 Robert Zemeckis drama.<br />A man gets stranded on an island with love giving him hope to go on.<br />This is a good film and one of my favorites with Tom. This dvd set<br />has good picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future.  Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.<br /><br />The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen.  All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it "slow) plot & character development.<br /><br />What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart.  The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!).  It speaks volumes that, within 90, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.<br /><br />Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away.  It has a little something for everyone.  Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end.  All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>I don't belittle the film by saying it is nice. It is a nice, a good, nice, film as few can make better than the talented Tom Hanks, Now, I am not saying that Tom Hanks is personally a nice guy, I don't know him. I am saying that as John Wayne, with a big assist from John Ford, created John Wayne who played John Wayne roles superbly, so Tom Hanks has created Tom Hanks, the character who can play a variety of nice guys in diverse situations.The film has been described in detail so I am left with, happily, simply the task of voicing my opinion that one comes away from the film knowing that a star has, with the help of Helen Hunt with not much to do but doing that very well, wrought his spell once more and left me, at any rate, with a good feeling as I got up out of my chair to take the DVD out of the machine and put it into its case to contribute to our resident's library with the assurance that other old timers will get the same pleasure out of it as I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Excellent movie, it should have won best picture, and it should have won Hanks another Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks has to carry this film pretty much on his own and he does an admirable job. A FedEx employee used to an insanely, fast-paced life, he has to adjust to the danger and abject isolation of life alone on a desert island when his plane goes down in bad weather (an excellent sequence). Meanwhile his family have given him up for dead and moved on with their lives.<br /><br />"Cast Away" turns many of the romantic notions - of being stranded on a desert island and then being rescued and reunited with his family - on their head.<br /><br />It is ultimately a sad film that offers no easy resolution.<br /><br />The film-makers should be commended for making such an off-beat and thoughtful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A very good movie, Cast Away, brings to the screen the story of a Fed-Ex employee who is stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific Ocean following a plane crash. Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties.<br /><br />Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!<br /><br />In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Russell Crowe is, without a doubt, very good in "Gladiator", but Tom Hanks in "Cast Away" is superb. It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.<br /><br />This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.<br /><br />Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.<br /><br />The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared. Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away. It is here that the picture falters somewhat, as there is no happy ending and the film ends somewhat unresolved. Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Though this story may be tried and true, it's Hank's acting that give this film the punch that it has.<p>Without giving it away, Hanks trials and tribulations while on the island really showcase how he's grown as an actor.<p>Very entertaining!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks is back and this time he on a deserted island.

Perfect film for Tom Hanks fans!</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>Tom Hanks is simply amazing.  Director Robert Zemeckis(Forrest Gump) and Hanks have combined again and succeeded again.  <p>The film opens with Hanks, a Federal Express employee, in Russia drilling the Fed Ex employees there about better time management.  His job for Fed Ex apparently takes him all over the place and leaves little time for his girlfriend played by Helen Hunt.  Another assignment takes him off and while trying to avoid a storm the plane crashes.  This is where the movie really gets going.  Hanks lands on an island and finds himself completely alone.  This turns out to be quite a compelling character study as he tackles the most basic of needs while trying to keep hope.  Four years pass and Hanks is still there and he finally decides to leave.  Unfortunatly as the previews showed us he makes it and then...<p>Since Zemeckis decided to let the audience know ahead of time that Hanks is saved the only real suspense is whether or not he will get Hunt back.  This does not really matter because the film is good one way or another.  Hanks is brilliant.  Very few actors could tackle a project like this and still keep it interesting and engaging, especially for as long as he does in this film.  The island is definatly the best part of this movie and the rest is not as compelling.  However it is a fantastic character study and one of the best films of the year.</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>This is one of the best films of loss, personal journey and redemption I've ever seen!<br /><br />Tom Hanks clearly deserved the Oscar for best actor of 2000 that year.  Faced with the challange of having to act through most of the movie with only himself, a volleyball and the brutalities of nature, he pulled it off miraculously.<br /><br />From the moment he is stranded on that deserted island, you're there with him, feeling every pain and every frustration he feels.  You feel every joy and every sense of excitement when he finally cracks that coconut open and when he finally creates a roaring fire.  How good that cooked crab must taste!<br /><br />When Hanks develops his personal relationship with his volleyball, Wilson, suspension of disbelief is not necessary.  You buy all of it, because you only need to image for a moment the madness and the yearning to talk to someone (or something) one must have to endure to survive on an island for four years.</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>I did not want to see this movie. Even though it stars Tom Hanks, quite frankly, it sounded boring as all get-out. And maybe it could have been, with any other actor.<p>Who else but Tom Hanks can create and sustain a deep and personal relationship with a volleyball upon which he has drawn a face? Who else but Tom Hanks can nearly drown on a crude hand-built raft in high waves, looking for that same volleyball, calling its name and sobbing uncontrollably? Who else but Tom Hanks can have you sobbing with him?<p>I won't review the plot here, since so many other reviewers have done so--and done it well. What I want to concentrate upon is Hanks' truly extraordinary acting ability. As we watch him change from cocky Fed-Ex manager extraordinaire to severely shaken plane crash survivor, to a marooned castaway on a desert island, we are drawn to him simply by the look on his face. Hanks moves from fear to frustration to anger to illness to vulnerability to joy to fear again...all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.<p>There are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above-mentioned grief over Wilson the volleyball is one; the tooth-pulling scene is another; his joy over catching a fish...there are just no words to accurately convey how brilliant this film really is. My advice: see it for yourself. It's an experience you won't soon forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>This was a film I wanted to see only because of Tom Hanks, not because a remake of Robinson Crusoe had any particular appeal. What a surprise! This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. It makes The Perfect Storm look precisely like the little boat in a box of water that it was (not to mention paper-thin characters and way too much nonsensical machismo.) The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality. (The only other &quot;wreck&quot; sequence I've seen that was comparable was the train wreck in The Fugitive.)<p>I cannot conceive of any other actor pulling off what Hanks does in this film. He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays. And in this case, one cannot help but watch in awe as he invests his formidable skills in this Fedex employee who miraculously survives not only a horrifying plane crash but also a life of total isolation on an unpopulated little island.<p>What's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity. But this film has it all: utterly believable characters, a fine script, and more action than most bash-em-up, shoot-em-ups could ever manage on their best days. To see a man we come to care about deeply beat the odds and survive makes for the most rewarding viewing. There's not a single predictable moment, nor a single stock character to be found anywhere in this film.<p>Absolutely stunning and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie is a tour de force for Tom Hanks and has some very compelling moments.  In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.  The scenes before and after this segment are poorly written and unconvincing and if anyone but Tom Hanks was saying some of these lines, we'd never believe them.  The island scenes were well-done, but I was left with a vaguely unsatisfied feeling at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>I'm really not a huge fan of the big budget hollywood movie, but I have to say that Castaway was very well done.  The most likely reason is the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis who continues to create quality motion pictures time after time.  Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex higher-up who gets stranded on a desolate island after his plane crashes.  There is little dialogue during Hanks' time on the island, but it is not needed as Zemeckis tells his story through the camera.  It becomes quite interesting to see the de-evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills.  Castaway is chock full of memorable moments and will stick to your ribs, it is a movie you will not soon forget.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>I won't recap the plot of the movie, since this has already been done so many times. I want to comment on what seems to have been missed by virtually everyone who has seen the movie.<br /><br />There are TWO things that keep Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) going while on the deserted island: First, and most obviously, he is devoted to his fianc&eacute;. This gives him someone to hold onto in his heart as a reason to survive - and hope. His need for human companionship is demonstrated, of course, in his turning a volleyball - with his own blood as a marking pen - into a pal and fellow castaway with whom he can commiserate. But the other thing that is of no less importance to his will to survive is the Fed Ex package that he does NOT open. He is determined to do his job and deliver this package (though perhaps a bit late). It is this devotion to duty that ultimately leads him to his fateful encounter at the end of the movie. Thus, Zemeckis shows that by staying true to his inner voice, maintaining hope in impossible circumstances and seeing it through to the bitter end -- even though he could not possibly have known that this would lead him to happiness -- he winds up finding his true destiny after all.<br /><br />I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The major achievement of this very interesting dramatic premise about the riddled question what if I be in your place? is a smart invitation (in form of modern fable) in order to make us reflect about these quotidian details we seem to overlook, but that acquire relevant importance specially in unimaginable situations, where we will somehow the steps of Robinson Crusoe, and the titanic efforts to remain in the sanity mental mind where the extreme and total solitude will undoubtedly a revealing experience, specially for all of those persons who think: "This nightmare definitively has nothing to do with me"<br /><br />Are you really sure not only to survive but also to keep your mind in stable conditions under this edge situation?<br /><br />The final sequence is possibly one of the most standing out you will ever see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Whats so great about this film is that one actor can carry the whole thing on his shoulders and make you give a damn.  Hanks is a wonderfully talented actor who proves that here with what I believe to be his finest performance to date.  As Fed-X employee Chuck, Hanks is stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash and is left to fend for himself woth no one to keep him company but a ball named Wilson for four years.  Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive.  Hanks proves that he is one of our generations finest leading men and this film goes down as one of my favorites for that very reason.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR.html">A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR</a><br/><p>Having seen a great Federal Express commercial during the Superbowl which was a take off on this movie, I decided I would finally see it. Tom Hanks plays a Fed Ex supervisor who is on a plane when it goes down. This movie is well known as a tale of survival when Hanks washes up on an uninhabited tropical island. But unlike Gilligan's Island, it is not comedic. Rather, it takes a great will to survive as well as an ability to hang on to the edge of sanity to keep going and ultimately be rescued.<p>I'm sure I'm giving nothing away by revealing that he is ultimately rescued and there begins the second part of the dvd; life after being marooned for four years. To me, this was the most interesting part of the movie. In the movie, symbolically, as well as literally, he finds himself at a crossroad as he contemplates getting on with his life after so many changes have occured. Just imagine, you are isolated for four years and then you have to pick up and go on in a world that did not stop and wait for you. That's quite an intriguing situation.I reccommend this dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Cast Away is something rare and special in Hollywood. It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it. Usually, those types of films are hollow and eye candy. That's okay too, you know. This film shows that they can also be the exact opposite. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a fed-ex worker who goes on a flight for a delivery and the plane crashes into the sea. Chuck drifts(on an inflatible boat)to a remote island. Chuck ends up spending four years on that island. His only companion is a volleyball named Wilson. Chuck wonders about his girlfriend back home, who's played by Helen Hunt. Hanks' performance is a one man showstopper. He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer. He deserves all of the attention and respect. He deserved the Oscar instead of Russell Crowe. Crowe wasn't anything stand-outish. If Hanks hadn't of won twice already, he would've won this too. Helen Hunt is usually good, but she is given way less to do here to really review. Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho. This movie defied all odds. It was one man on a deserted island for the majority of the film. Tons of film were without dialogue and music. Very risky and brave. Director Robert Zemeckis pulled it off brilliantly. He always does. This is a great, up-lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this. This is a Hollywood classic. Do yourself a favor and forget about &quot;Survivor&quot;. This film is the way it should be. A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>The most simplistic elements of life are taken for granted everyday of our lives. We turn on the lights without a second thought; we light matches without a moment's hesitation. Water coming out of the faucet is a given, something we know we can always depend on to be there. &quot;Cast Away&quot; takes all of those securities and hides them away, leaving us with an incredible and harrowing story of survival and determination. <p>Taking its time in getting to what the movie is all about, the story first begins with the frenzied life of Fed-Ex systems engineer Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whose number-one rule of life is making sure that everything goes according to schedule. This leaves him little time for his understanding girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), whom he returns to see in Memphis for Christmas. Circumstances intervene, and he finds himself rearranging his schedule in order to make a trip across the Pacific for business. But not before exchanging gifts, one of which is an engagement ring, the other an &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;<p>After a near-10-minute plane crash sequence that raises the intensity, the true Zemeckis style kicks into gear, as Chuck is left in a rubber life raft in stormy seas, the only light source coming from sudden flashes of lightning. At daylight, he finds himself on an island, not another soul in sight and only the sound of crashing waves and wind in the trees for company. Instincts drive him to signal for help at first, and as the days move on, he silently realizes his situation. <p>The story becomes more intriguing with the transition of time during his stay on the island: he learns the secrets of creating life's little commodities. Resorting to stick-rubbing for the creation of fire and collection condensation from leaves for nourishment, the only visible objects that tie his present life to reality are a Fed-Ex box, his battered life-raft, and a volleyball with a blood-painted face whom he calls Wilson. But as Chuck becomes more attached to life on the island, he cannot shake his desire to once again return home to his love, whose picture he repeatedly paints on the wall. <p>Let's be honest: this is probably the best deserted island movie to date, possibly ever made. &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was less engrossing because there was a family on the island, not a single person. Being alone on the island allows the story to explore the inner human strength and spirit, as well as new methods of companionship. <p>Other techniques bring the movie to a full-force magnitude that keeps us engrossed with what goes on. During the entire island sequence, from the time he arrives to the time he is plucked from the sea, there is a complete absence of music. This leaving out of the musical score gives an added focus to his situation as well as reflecting on his solitude and loneliness. The nature surrounding Chuck is beautifully captured and photographed, and under Zemeckis's helm, the setting is ominous and brooding without becoming too overpowering. <p>Hanks gives, without a doubt, the best performance to date of his career, topping his work in &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; His acting, along with the aforementioned techniques, puts us right there with him as he begins to learns the small things in life can be quite complicated. Even his silence is our key to understanding his realizations about the potential danger he faces, and his comprehension of what seems to him an inescapable situation. At the movie's end, I felt compelled to inquire why Russell Crowe received the Best Actor Oscar for his work in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; when the performance by Hanks is much more involving. <p>But, like any good movie, there are flaws. Luckily, this movie escaped fairly unscathed, until the ending, however. At movie's end, it loses the same luster it had before, and the return to reality and the emotional challenges he will face are less intriguing or involving as those presented in the midsection of the story. And the silence experienced for so long seems shaken in a bad way once everything begins to round itself out. <p>Nonetheless, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a compelling tale spun from the director of &quot;Contact,&quot; who tells the story the way it needs to be told. Hanks brings his best screenwork to the movie, while the entire effect of the movie is one of sheer awe and enamoration. Did you ever wish you were on a deserted island with someone else? You may just think twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>This movie was very good. Man deserted on island. He survives for years and finally goes back home. One thing though is that I just don't understand the ending.

The beginning and middle are the best and satisfying parts, the last hour is a bit of a letdown and the ending is left open so the viewer can ponder what road this man has decided to embark on. Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance. Helen Hunt is miscast and so is Chris Noth. Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>OK, while going to the dentist is probably not on most people's top-10 list of things to do, whenever I have a trip to the dentist on the calendar, I like to watch "Cast Away" the night before.  I am especially likely to do that if I have a major dental event the next day...you know, like a root canal, getting a crown, or even cavities that need to be filled.<br /><br />This film is almost entirely a solo effort by Tom Hanks, and he does a fantastic job of being a time-obsessed FedEx exec who spends his time flying around the world trouble-shooting and instructing FedEx centers about how to be more efficient and time-conscious, until tragedy strikes.  The time flies by for me each time I watch this film as Hanks works to find ways to survive alone on a small south Pacific island where he washes ashore.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely top-notch.  The storyline is great, and the combination of acting, story, and music rates a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />Again, if you dread going to the dentist, watch this film and you'll be grateful that you can.  Now, I didn't say happy that you can go to the dentist, but you will be grateful.  Why do I say this?  Well, I'll give you a two-word clue, "ice skate."<br /><br />5 stars all the way!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Everyone that I know either loves this movie or hates it.  They either find it completely engrossing or mind-numbingly boring.  I'm kind of in the middle.  I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.  It has to, since he is the only person on screen for nearly the entire running length.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED-EX systems engineer who finds himself stranded on an island for four years after the plain he is on crashes into the ocean during a terrible storm.  He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.<br /><br />For me, it is hard to really build a film based solely on a man's solitary survival.  There is not a whole lot you can do, and while the film's execution of Chuck's adventures are startlingly engaging, when the film ended I felt as if it was just beginning.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.  Yes, his escapades on the island are necessary to establish growth and that survival instinct (and the way that Zemeckis films the island itself perfectly establishes to `gravity' of the whole experience) but when all is said and done, this is about how this experience CHANGES a person, and I feel like we only witnessed to very beginning of that change.<br /><br />Alas, I still really like this movie.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Tom Hanks is not an actor I am usually drawn to.  I find a lot of his work highly overrated and even gimmicky and amateurish (his two Oscar wins themselves are disgusting) but here he transcends gimmick (I mean, this is a gimmicky character) and develops a REAL man.  He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.  This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.  I think that Hanks' performance is also a reason why I hate the ending of the film.  He was doing such a riveting job that I really wanted him to sink his teeth into Chuck's `afterlife' SOOOOO much (no, he doesn't die...by afterlife I meant `life after his rescue').<br /><br />If I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.<br /><br />Anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.  It has been mentioned (and I agree) that this film lacks a tad of the emotional punch (emotional `human' punch) that it tries to convey, but I feel that that punch would have been achieved had Chuck's story continued.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>Robert Zemeckis is an extraordinarily compelling filmmaker, and he knows when to keep things seemingly simple.  Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale; from the moment he is in the plane until he is rescued, this is one magnetically charged movie, and in ways you might not expect.  The plane crash itself jolts your senses; it is that kind of big-screen sequence in which you lose all sense of time and place and are in the movie; Cast Away remains that way throughout the entire sequence on the island.  The ocean waves themselves become characters, and their incessant pounding on the surf takes on a horrific quality, even in its natural beauty. But as sure-footed as this movie is when Tom is &quot;cast away&quot;, it is disheartening to report that the final half hour or so, featuring an uninteresting Helen Hunt, robs us of the very buildup we've been mesmerized by for over 90 minutes.  And the bookend plot device simply does not give us what we want after having endured so much.  Still, you will not likely see a more creatively charged big-budget movie this season, nor a performance as riveting at Hanks'.  The device of Wilson the volleyball as Hanks' only &quot;friend&quot; is brilliantly executed, with an emotional payoff as surprising as it is deftly handled.</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>how does the academy do that?  ok gladiator was good fun and watchable maybe twice  but what i just saw on my dvd was a masterpiece!  tom hanks only gets better with every film, from big to the green mile and now this! for me this wiped out all the other competition.it was action packed then a great adventure, and finally an emotionally draining good drama!  act 2 was possibly the best segue in many many years!  kudos to a fine director, as usual mr. zemekis thank you sir and of course  tom hanks for beautifully putting me as well as my family through a compelling and convincing array of all emotions  we all loved wilson too! the audio especially the dts-ex was incredible as was the clarity of the film itself-the island, waters, sunsets fairly burst with color  and the 2nd disc is so packed with extras you may be there all day!  get it enjoy it it will be recognized as the classic it is.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>If you know what the title of my review means, then you've seen the movie.  And you know it is good:  adventure, action, escape, burdens, lost loves, and survival under harsh circumstances.  This is a mix of Robinson Caruso and The Count of Monte Cristo (while Dante is in prison).<br /><br />Federal Express manager Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is shipwrecked for four years.  This story related to his life before, during, and after.  And believe it or not, at the very end, I'll bet you will be wondering about the next chapter as well.<br /><br />Cast Away is a movie investment... you'll want to see it about every third year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.  You don't just watch this movie; you really have to devote an entire night to it; it's just that powerful and moving.  At almost two and a half hours in length, it is uncommonly long in and of itself (but it does not feel long to the enthralled viewer); figure in all of the incredible special features included in the 2-disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.  Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it; most importantly, it manages, after several cathartic moments, to leave one with a sense of hope and a strange kind of joy.  Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.  There really isn't a lot of dialogue during the time on the island; long drawn-out moments focus on Hanks' expression, body language, and emotion.  When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.  <p>Don't think that this is just another Robinson Crusoe remake.  Chuck Noland (Hanks) is an obsessive, deeply committed system engineer for FedEx.  Everything for him must be planned and executed according to the limits of time, and so he is truly a duck out of water when his plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and leaves him stranded all alone on a deserted island.  Time is meaningless for him here, but he has a picture of the woman he loves with him to help him go on living when it would be so easy to just give up.  He learns to survive on his own in the tropical environment, but not without much pain and battles with hopelessness.  When the situation threatens to overwhelm him, the character of Wilson comes along.  Wilson is a volleyball, but he has a face framed with Chuck's own blood and becomes the personification of the world of people he longs to return to.  After four years on the island, Wilson is a true companion whom Chuck talks to, argues with, but dearly loves as a very real friend.  The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.  It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.  You might expect this type of film to end with a long-overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.  Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet; having seemingly lost everyone and everything he cared for four years earlier, his miraculous return becomes another tale of great loss.  This movie is a real tear-jerker; just when you think it's time to rejoice, you are met with more poignant heartbreak.  Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart-warming message.<p>I love Wilson; he is such a great character that, volleyball or not, I think he should have been nominated for a best supporting actor award.  Amazingly, he really slipped into the movie by accident, yet much of this movie's power is conveyed through him.  The inclusion of a featurette on the life and death of Wilson on the second DVD is a testament to his importance to this story.  This second DVD is filled with an incredible selection of bonus features: features on the making of the film, its special effects, and a look at the beautiful and bonafide island paradise location of the filming; there is an interview of Tom Hanks by Charlie Rose, a survivalist documentary, and a movie-length commentary as well.  You can't ask more from a movie than Cast Away gives you, and you can't ask for more from a DVD than this two-disc special edition delivers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>Ever since 1992s &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, Tom Hanks has been on a roll.  His films have been critically acclaimed as well as hugely successful, ranging from modest (That Thing You Do! &amp; The Green Mile) to Box Office Kings (Forrest Gump &amp; Saving Private Ryan).  How does he do it?<p>Well with Cast Away, Mr. King Midas strikes Gold again, with a simple tale of a man who crash lands on an island and must survive it's hardships for four years.  Sounds simple, huh?  And you might think a movie, even with Hanks in it, about one person on an island for most of the time may seem boring.  Not a chance.  Cast Away breaks down the human being in us all and lets us discover who we truly are inside, by watching Chuck Noland (NO LAND) discover for himself what it takes to sustain his own life and well being.  The love for a woman he left behind, that he looks at with a picture in a pocket watch she gave him when last they were together.  There are layers and layers of depth to this piece that is so compelling, if you're not emotional by the end, check yourself for a pulse.  <p>Those that love this film have already fallen in love with Wilson, a vollyball with a bloodpainted face, drawn by Chuck, to have as a companion.  Sounds nuts, you say?  Try being alone for four years and see how long it takes you to make up a friend to talk to.  Wilson represents Chuck's hopes and determination in himself.  He needs Wilson to be there.  I have never gottan more choked up over a vollyball in my entire life, but when you watch that one scene on the raft, well, your heart just breaks...and I know it's crazy because Wilson is not a real person...or is he?<p>Anyone who scoffs at the ending are really too busy to take the time to get the point of what Cast Away is all about.  I am so tired of these cute little endings where the guy gets the girl in the end, when in reality, we all know it doesn't always work out that way.  But you take from Cast Away what you bring to it, and that's what the ending is about.  Which direction to take now?  Not sure.  But at least &quot;Tomorrow the sun will rise&quot;.<p>The DVD extras are FANTASTIC.  So many featurettes that don't feel like featurettes..they feel like short documentaries..and there's even one all about Wilson!  But my favorite is the Charlie Rose interview with Hanks, who is such a delight..it's truly a great interview.  I really wish he could've participated in the audio commentary, but he's so busy.  One mistake I noticed..the details on the back of the case state that Cast Away is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which is incorrect..it's only 1.85:1.  But with tons of trailers and interviews and featurettes, it really makes little difference to me.<p>Grab this movie on DVD, and get ready for an experience you'll never forget.  And Mr. Hanks?  May your streak of hits never end!</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>"Cast Away" being Passed over by the Oscar's is one of the Biggest Travesty's in Film History. The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences. Tom Hanks gives the Powerhouse Performance we All Expected him to and Robert Zemeckis uses All of his Skills to pull off this Monumental Achievement. Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.<p>Unless you yourself have been Cast Away on an Island for 3 years, you'll know the films story, so I'll keep my Plot Synopsis short. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee whose plane goes down in a storm and he is washed up on the shore of a remote Island... Which becomes his home for 4 Long Years. "Cast Away" chronicles his Survival, his battles with Starvation, Loneliness and Madness, and finally his Eventual Rescue.<p>There was never a Doubt in the Cinema-going Publics minds that Hanks could pull this role off, his On-Screen Transformation is Truly Something to Behold. The whole film Rests on his sole performance, which made him the Obvious (and Only) choice, I doubt the film would have been given the Green Light had he not been involved. He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143-minute running time feel like an even hour. The Supporting cast have Precious-little time to make an Impression, and not One of them Waste that time. Helen Hunt goes through quite a Transformation too as Chuck's Fianc&eacute;, but hers is shown mainly through Facial expression and Body Language. Like Hanks, she Convincingly Conveys to us what She's been through as well, which is a Hell of a lot. Nick Searcy is a Standout as Stan, a Friend of Chucks. His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real. They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.<p>The Screenplay is a Brilliant one, getting Maximum Emotion Impact out of a Situation that Is a tough one to film, but with Zemeckis behind the camera, the filming is in Wonderful Hands. Zemeckis uses Startling Camerawork and Brilliant use of Sounds and Silence to create this Landmark film, in my opinion; he is one of the Best Directors Working Today. "Cast Away" only Solidifies that Statement.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>After seeing this film my first thought at the end of the movie was, &quot;thats it&quot;. I thought it could have been a little longer to tell a better story. I'm not sure if it was the lack of dialog in the movie, or if my expectations were to high, but I was a little disappointed. I thought it could of been much better. Now, I'm not saying the movie is bad, its far from it, I'm just saying I was hoping for more. Tom Hanks gives an oscar worthy presentation once again, and its basically just him throughout the whole movie. I think that if film makers weren't constricted to how long they could make a movie, I think this would have been twice as long, that way they could of told a much better, in depth story. It felt like they cut corners in certain parts of the film, particularly with the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9.html">A2BT7IC8PT1ZC9</a><br/><p>Another movie Tom Hanks should have gotten an oscar for!

It may not outshine Back to the Future, and Forrest Gump, but it was really good.  The plot moves a little slow, but not to the point where you fall asleep in the theater.  Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance, as well as Helen Hunt even though she only takes up about 30 minutes of screen time.  The movie, mostly was almpost without sound.  It was really different and I though that was really bold of Zemeckis.  Tom Hanks grew more and more insane as the movie progresses, and he makes friends with the most iconic of all sports equipment, Wilson the Volleyball.  The film was great and it really made you believe you were stranded with Tom's character, Chuck.  It is a great film all around.  See it.</p></br><a href="../users/AOYTQFRLD8VLP.html">AOYTQFRLD8VLP</a><br/><p>The symbolic ending of this movie finds Tom Hanks at the dusty crossroads of a small town in Texas after returning to his job as a FedEx worker.<br /> Four years prior to this, he survived a plane crash that left him stranded in the South Pacific and presumed dead by family, friends, and colleagues.<br /> The years spent on that primitive isle are realistically boring and lonely for him. Viewers watch as a soccer ball with his bloody imprints becomes his best friend, his hair grows long, wild, and sun-bleached, and he grows mentally ill.<br /> By the time he is able to build a raft and finally free himself from his island prison, we realize how much Wilson has come to mean to him, and how Wilson has come to symbolize the human contact that Chuck so desperately craves.<br /> We feel sad that his wife, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, didn't pay attention to her gut instincts about whether or not her husband had survived, and instead listened to friends who told her to move on with her life.<br /> This film reminds me a little of &quot;Forever Young&quot;, except that the ending leaves us hanging regarding the ultimate fate of the hero. But we know that at least now that he is back in civilization, his destiny is back in his own hands, and we wish him all the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>This tired retelling of the Robinson Crusoe story is not only dull, it's also distinctly ordinary.  Whilst Zemeckis touched his audience with 'Forrest Gump' and scared them all with 'What Lies Beneath', this is a film that seems to have been released purely to show us all Tom Hanks' formidable acting skills.  In the film Hanks plays Chuck, who is separated from his wife after his plane crashes and he, the only survivor, is forced to eke out an existence on a tropical island for four years, forging a friendship with a ball called Wilson.<p>Whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.  We see Chuck light a fire, smash a coconut and fish.  This makes up the majority of the movie, with themes such as madness being explained away with a frankly bizarre 'friendship' with a ball.  In this lies the movie's main failure - it's not particularly bad but it is particularly dull.  Devoid of any other characters - save Helen Hunt as his wife in a role so minimal it even rivals Laura Dern's in 'Jurassic Park III' - we're forced to concentrate on the same things over and over.<p>Still, the airplane crash is stunningly done and the ending is thankfully a little less contemporary than would be expected.  Yet compared alongside, Zemeckis' other film that year - 'What Lies Beneath' - this is nothing.  Just another stepping stone in Tom Hanks career as he garners yet more award nominations.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>This movie is about 20 minutes too long.  It drags, is uneven, and really goes nowhere.  The one unique thing about it that I'll say is that when Hanks is first marooned on the island, there is never any musical score, thus giving you the feeling of his isolation.  Very good and very haunting.  Otherwise, there is no real explanation why he would stay on the island so long without trying to escape.  An ok film, but not one that you'd want to watch again anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>AMERICAN SWEETHEARTS was directed by Joe Roth (Angels In The Outfield, Streets Of Gold) and co-written by one of the stars themselves - Billy Crystal (Monster, Inc., When Harry Met Sally, Analyze This). For me it was a great treat watching Billy. Billy has this sarcastic criticism about the Entertainment Industry - and life overall - that is so close to things I have said about people, places and things that I often wonder if he is following me recording my thoughts! He is hysterical!<p>Now - as far as the film goes....it has a pretty big cast - John Cussack (16 Candles, Say Anything, The Grifters) and Cathrine Zeta Jones (The Mask Of Zorro, the new Chicago, The Haunting) do a great job as the `Hollywood Couple' gone wrong. Except for the public eye and the personalities on camera - off camera they are `oil and water'. Cathrine character is support by the hysterically funny and often underrated Hank Azaria (The Birdcage, Godzilla, Anastasia) as her Cuban lover. He is a scene-stealer! Here's another talent that needs o be given a chance. Through it all, Billy Crystal's character, the publicist (who also has a sidekick - cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich). Quite a cast, right?<p>Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see); Christopher Walkin (Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, Mouse Hunt) There is comedy, slapstick, farce and more. A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!<p>Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines - like - `...oh look, there's the buffet..." and many many, more! Stanley Tucci (A Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Pelican Brief, Road To Perdition) gives a fantastic performance as the typical Hollywood Producer gone panicked.<p>The DVD extras include the usual trailer and previews and there is also a special section with deleted scenes where there is a limited on camera commentary with director Jo Roth. The bad part is that it is the only commentary on the DVD. It would have been nice to have the commentary on the whole feature film - this was a big disappointment to me. Overall I loved the movie.

CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list; director Robert Zemeckis and headliner Tom Hanks deliver an absorbing, intense story about one man's refusal to be involuntarily exiled for the remainder of his days.<br /><br />Oh, the things we take for granted.  Running water.  Hot food.  A roof over our heads.  Imagine your predicament should you suddenly find yourself with none of these things--imagine your predicament if you had virtually no survival skills.  Such is the fate of Tom Hanks' character (a retentive, nondescript FedEx midmanager); one minute he's on a flight over the Pacific; the next he's on a secluded beach.  And thus both the character and the audience embark on a journey of discovery, as neither the cast away nor those viewing this film know how the survivor will be able to. . .survive.<br /><br />Accordingly, the conflict of the plot stubbornly yields to a series of victories--the audience and the character are simultaneously elated:  elated when that first coconut is opened; when that first fire is started; when--after four long, solitary years--a durable raft is built that will transport its lone passenger beyond the unforgiving barrier reef.  And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection--literally in the middle of nowhere.  For the viewers realize, as does the character, that following four years of rugged survival under harsh conditions, any subsequent obstacles or decisions are gravy.  Pure gravy.<br /><br />Tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.  He's believable, compelling, empathetic--funny.  This is easily one of his signature roles; and CAST AWAY is a signature celebration of the indomitable human spirit.<br />--D.

A puzzled look.<br /><br />Four years stranded on an island can leave us with much more than sand in our skin.<br /><br />Four years can change our priorities.<br /><br />The everyday commodities can mean nothing compared to the safety of knowing when we will drink a glass of ice water.<br /><br />The necessity to relate to other people acquires a worthy value when, drowned in the deepest solitude, we start to talk to a volleyball.<br /><br />And those are some of the hard lessons Chuck Noland learns.<br /><br />Cast Away is a rather optimistic vision of how an ordinary man, obsessed with the clock, is forced to let go of the notion of time, physically and emotionally.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is Chuck, a Fedex systems analyst; expert in problem-solving, in connecting people; for him, every minute counts, time is worth everything. A clock is crucial to the success of every task<br /><br />And while his busy agenda keeps him in places like Russia, Asia or Paris, in Memphis his girlfriend Kelly waits for him.<br /><br />One Christmas eve, Chuck has to go away again, leaving Kelly with the words "I'll be right back" floating in the air.<br /><br />Life can be full of such ironies.<br /><br />So, instead of coming back, Chuck's plane crashes and leaves him stranded on a desert island for four years.<br /><br />Four years where surviving is the challenge. Learn to fish, to open a coconut, find a shelter, lit a fire, fight nature.<br /><br />And then after overcoming all obstacles, what matters is live. So Chuck starts a rebirthing: talks to a volleyball, which he calls Wilson, and it's a sort of conscience to confide all his fears, frustrations and desires.<br /><br />Finally, all the conditions are given for the survivor to return to civilization.<br /><br />To a world that moved on, where time didn't stop, a world out of sync with Chuck.<br /><br />Cast Away is brilliant showing us how irreversible is the past and how marked we are with our experiences.<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis displays Chuck's life changes with a clean and simple technique. Overwhelming and busy at first, slow and full of silences during his isolation, reflexive and enigmatic at the end.<br /><br />Hanks proves his effectiveness carrying the entire movie in his shoulders. Frenetic and exhausting when we meet him, he transmits his busy way of life. And he is equally persuasive and convincing when he goes to that exceptional situation, sympathetic and also worthy of compassion.<br /><br />Chucks' spiritual changes are as obvious as his physical changes. He disconnects from reality and after four years, he loses that spark that shines in our eyes, result from our everyday contact with others.<br /><br />And once his hope to return to his loved ones is given to him, how difficult is to find that you don't fit anymore in that life. What can one do?<br /><br />Smile and look the possibilities the road offers you.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>I watched this film again in anticipation of Hanks in The DaVinci Code. And I was amazed at how much I reacted this movie after 2 years. Unlike others, I don't like to give away the film. Details can sometimes make it so the film doesn't need to be seen. I prefer to express the emotion in this movie.<br /><br />At the time this film was released, everyone compared it to Hanks performance in Forest Gump. And I did also. But now, after watching it again, I see the similarities and the differences.<br /><br />Gump was a series of vignettes. A `slower' person haphazardly thrown into historical situations. Castaway, in a quick capsulation, is the end of a man's life due to being stranded on an uncharted island after a plane crash, the loss of the love of his life, and in the final minutes, realizing he has a whole new life to begin. A life with more possibilties than his previous one.<br /><br />Chuck Noland of FedEx, unknowing leaves his life behind when he boards a a plane. The plane goes down and he survives on an island well out of the shipping lanes and travelled waters. The fact that he survives is a miracle. Hanks is superb in the transformation of personalities that surface. At first, he is the civilized clot who has no idea what to do. Then he realizes the hopelessness of his situation (punctuated by a panaramic view of his tiny island from a summit), and succumbs to this hopelessness of his situation with a suicide attempt. When the attempt fails, he accepts his doom as lost soul. Until he is able to create fire. And then, he assumes the role of a survivor. The key is a Volleyball (whom he dubs Wilson due to it's maker) marked by his own bloodly hand. This connection of blood, creates the alterego Hanks imprints upon Wilson. While it appears he is going insane, this is the key to his surviving, as well as his love for his fiance, played by Helen Hunt. His transformation from dweeb to survivor (the scenes with his impacted tooth are wrenching), are a parellel to real life, telling the viewer to never give up, no matter what the odds.<br /><br />It is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me. The realization of both he and Hunt, that their lives had moved on, was at the least, powerfully emotional.<br /><br />While this film recieved mixed reviews when it came out, it has to be viewed again. In today's atmosphere, with the horrors of the world, this movie is about the individual, and not the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Cast Away reteams director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for their first film together since the Award winning Forrest Gump.  The film tells the story of a Federal Express employee, Chuck,  who is stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific.  He is forced to use his wits to survive.  The survival scenes are sandwiched in between Chuck's life in Memphis pre and post island.  The pre-island scenes show Chuck as a time obsessed man, whose main goal is to make certain packages arrive on time.  He shows off his tyrannical devotion to time in the movie's opening scenes where he is training people at a new depot in Moscow.  Back home for Christmas, we meet his girlfriend, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt.  On Christmas day he is called off again and he promises Kelly he'll be home for New Year's Eve and at the airport they exchange gifts.  Kelly gives Chuck a pocket watch and amongst his gifts is an engagement ring.  On this flight, the plane encounters turbulence and goes down.  The crash is a fiery spectacle that shows off Mr. Zemeckis' skill as a director.  Chuck is the lone survivor and he washes up on the island.  Armed with only a few items (ice skates, videotapes) from Fed Ex packages, he forced to adapt to live on the album.  His lone companion is a volleyball he names Wilson (the ball's maker).  Wilson is really an extension of Chuck himself as his &quot;face&quot; was created a bloody palm print of Chuck's own hand.  It is on the island where we see the acting skills that make Mr. Hanks the best in the business.  Through his struggles to make fire, eat, drink and eventually build a boat to leave the island.  He literally all by himself, with only Wilson to interact with.  Mr. Hanks' draws our sympathy and we share in his frustrations.  We feel his desperation and the scene where he kicks Wilson out of a cave and then desperately searches for him in the dark is utterly heartbreaking.  After four years Chuck leaves the island and is rescued at sea.  Upon his return to Memphis, he finds that he was of course left for dead and even buried.  Kelly has married and has a child.  In a tearful reunion, Kelly declares she still loves him, but they both know their relationship can't work.  Cast Away suffers in the scenes off the island as they filled with movie cliches and are stiff.  The scenes on the island are worth watching to see this generation's greatest actor shine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>When Tom Hanks cuts his hands while trying to start a fire, he screams and puts his hand up towards the camera as if to say "see I cut my hand just so you know what is going on", very cheesy moment.<br /><br />Other things that took away from the film are: how coincidental that one of the boxes was a ball. He uses this ball to explain key things in the plot since there is no other way to explain it. How convenient one of the boxes contained ice skates, he later used for cutting coconuts. Also the VHS tapes supplied rope for his raft.<br /><br />Other than this, a very entertaining film. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />p.s. why is that top reviewers have like 9 paragraphs explaining every detail of the film? DO we need 200 reviews that are identical?</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>I thought that this movie was terrible.  Why?  Well, the movie went nowhere, told us nothing, and was nothing but one guy talking to a volleyball.  Sound exciting?  I mean, even if you like Tom Hanks it wouldn't bring up the quality of the movie.  The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the &quot;undelivered package,&quot; which really means nothing held it together.  Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they &quot;like&quot; it will show it to you for free.  It is not worth the money, and I saw it in theatres!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Chuck Noland is a man who lives by the clock. Working for Federal Express he accounts for every second of his life and lives for efficiency. His Xmas 1995 dinner is interrupted when work calls him away to supervise a flight to Malaysia. He promises his girlfriend Kelly that he'll be right back. He doesn't realize he's making a promise he can't keep.<br /><br />While passing over the Pacific his plane enters a storm and ditches into the ocean, very violently. Chuck is the only survivor of the flight and manages to escape into the water with a life raft, but loses the radio transmitter in the process. When morning breaks he discovers that he has washed-up on an uninhabited island. Rescue does not come, and Chuck must figure out how to survive while torturing himself with memories of Kelly.<br /><br />In an annoying cop-out, the film then jumps to Four Years Later where Chuck has reverted to a cave-man appearance. He's not a happy man, but his outlook changes when a steel section of a port-a-john washes up on the beach. Using a analemma he has etched onto a cave wall, Chuck is STILL keeping track of time and plans an escape from the island using the sheet of steel as a sail for his rickety raft to freedom.<br /><br />Cast Away (not Castaway) has lovely sound design and photography (why Zemeckis chose to shoot it in 1.85:1 is rather odd though, as many shots seem uncomfortably tight), and really immerses you in the threatening silence of the island. It actually reminds me a lot of the video game Myst in that respect. But the film is book-ended by boredom. The only part I ever really watch is the middle section on the island. Skipping over Chuck's 4-year transformation from mailman to caveman was bad enough, but once he eventually makes his escape from the island the movie skips over the 4-weeks of his reintroduction to society, which is yet another cop-out.<br /><br />Zemeckis attempts far too much ambiguity with Cast Away. It's usually a sign of a writer/director attempting to cover-up failings with mystery, but Cast Away is a better script than that and it comes across as just being pretentious. The middle section of the film is intriguing. The non-island scenes haven't got a leg to stand on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HS9F7J51E9CB.html">A1HS9F7J51E9CB</a><br/><p>The moneymen must have been biting their fingernails over this one.  They know Tom Hanks can carry a movie, but can Tom Hanks BE the movie? I'd say the answer is "yes," in a quiet sort of way.<p>Chuck Noland (TH) is a fast-talking, time-obsessed workaholic with just enough charm to keep him from being totally obnoxious.  He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.  Chuck barely has time to court the lovely Helen Hunt (her talents totally wasted in this vapid role).  He exchanges Christmas presents with her in the car at the airport before he takes off on his fateful voyage.<p>The plane crashes into the sea near an atoll/island.  The crash is frighteningly horrific and terrifying.  All hands are lost except Chuck who is thrown free of the wreckage and driving propellers, and he struggles onto shore.  Up until this time, the movie is full of movement, sound, voices and has a rather brittle frenetic feel.  Now all is silence.  Chuck slowly gets his bearings and we are shown scenes of him trying to cope with his new situation.  FedEx cargo has washed ashore with him, and he opens boxes containing ice skates, a courtier gown and a volley ball that he names "Wilson" after its maker.  He is clumsy and has accidents, but we cannot help but admire his perseverance.  After grueling attempts, he finally gets a fire started and dances around it in pure Tarzan style congratulating himself to the heavens above.  A pause---and it is four years later.  The audience gasps "Four years!"  The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.  From an open-faced, slightly pudgy all-American boy, he has been transformed into a gaunt, sinewy, bearded predator with wary shifting eyes.<p>With great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.  He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.  After great suffering and privitation, he is rescued and flung back into civilization.<p>He reunites with his now-married girlfriend who announces he "is the love of her life."  Does she realize the man standing before her is an entirely different person than the one who left her?  Maybe.  She goes unwillingly back to her family.  Chuck is clearly uncomfortable in almost all social situations and drives to the desolate west, stopping at a crossroads wondering what direction to take.<p>Tom Hanks is marvelous in his role. (It seems I forever say the same thing, because he is always "marvelous in his role.")  The film could have cut out maybe twenty minutes and not suffered a loss.  What is amazing is how he keeps your total attention and interest whether he is building a raft or talking to a volleyball.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I am not a big Tom Hanks fan nor one of outdoor type adventure movies but have to say that cast away is quite a great film.  When I first saw it I could not remember the last time a movie had me glued to the tv so strong that I could not wait to see what was going to happen next.  It does remind me a little of "The Edge", with anthony hopkins but more interesting.  A film that should keep your attention well from the start to end and then some.  It's not a sci-fiction, war or animated type picture but a tense drama that keeps you in suspense.  For sure a Tom Hanks classic.<br /><br />Peter J.

The fact that the film starts off with so much human activity and communication which leads into Tom Hanks on an island by himself with hardly any voices being heard at all makes this a really great story.<br /><br />On an island by yourself having to do whatever it takes to survive can be a serious struggle, and that's what the film is about- trying to find ways to survive.  I love everything about this movie.  I would love to see it again.  I recommend this film to just about everyone.  Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie.  It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I can't offer enough superlatives as to how good this film is.  This collaboration between director Robert Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks is, in my mind, virtually flawless and a totally compelling viewing experience.  Those naysayers who would dismiss this film should recognize what a challenge this film is.  Zemeckis(and Hanks) are asking us to follow a story that asks us to follow the transformation of a man whose whole life revolves around punctuality and now finds himself with all the time in the world.  Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.  The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count "Wilson" the volleyball, are just masterful.  Hanks uses his consummate skills as an actor to pull us in and never lets go.  Though this film was a box office success it received something of a lukewarm critical response.  I would hope that in years to come when the careers of Hanks(and Zemeckis) are evaluated that "Cast Away" is recognized for the great film that it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>While watching CAST AWAY, a quote from another movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, kept coming to mind; "I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying." That quote sums up CAST AWAY. It is a movie about surviving and making choices.<p>Tom Hanks plays Chuck, a Fed-Ex trouble-shooter who is so constrained by time that he plans dates with his girlfriend months in advance. Chuck get called on an emergency assignment and his plane ends up crashing into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, but is abandoned on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re-education in living.<p>This is a Tom Hanks movie, make no doubt about it. He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it. However, if CAST AWAY was simply a Tom Hanks film and nothing more, it would have sunk faster than the drowning plane in the movie.<p>CAST AWAY is unlike any other film I have ever seen. Most people are sick of their existance in life and go to movies to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film. This is a film that was made to make people think. The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life? What do you most revere? What makes a friend? How strong is love? These are all questions that CAST AWAY forces one to examine. But the most important question of all is whether to get busy living or get busy dying.</p></br></body></html>

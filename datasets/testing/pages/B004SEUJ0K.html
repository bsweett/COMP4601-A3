The plot is a bit far-fetched - Jean Grey being an all-powerful super mutant - but it does up the ante (including one memorable death scene). My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer - it seems as if the film is rushed in only 100 minutes. Otherwise, if you liked the first two, you'll love this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I understand why people dislike this movie but I think the intention was to entertain people I thought that X Men The Last Stand was a good movie just not as good as the last 2 movies. The cast is returns they introduce Beast played by none other than Kelsey Grammer & another guy was Juggernaut played by Vinne Jones could Vinne Jones not be in any movies there are so many d**n characters here it's hard to remember who play who. Plot is Scott or Cyclops is still emo over Jean Grey's death he gets a telepathic & is going to see her well he's killed by her Jean is later found by our heroes & taken to the Mansion but she escapes goes to her old house. Professor X tracks her there & runs into Magneto (SARCASIM) wasn't expecting that. Jean is The Phenoix she kills the Professor. There's a sub plot a cure has been found for mutants to make them normal this is why Magneto needs Jean Grey to start a war & kill this kid cause he has the ability to produce this cure. Wolverine realises what he must do to stop Phenoix.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>As this movie opens, things are looking up for mutants.  A new President (Josef Sommer) is so sympathetic to their concerns that he has created a Department of Mutant Affairs, helmed by one of their own--former X-Man Dr. Hank "Beast" McCoy (Kelsey Grammar).  At Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the mansion has been repaired after the commando incursion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BWVCM">X2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>, and students of all sizes scurry through the halls at class-change time.  Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules.  But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want.  And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government.  Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake.  But Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers.  Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability.  Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called "The Brotherhood."  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.<br /><br />This splendid climax to the X-Men trilogy is worth every cent of its cost, from the sensitive portrayals of inner conflict suffered by Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, and Jean to the thunderous John Powell score (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBFTCS">X-Men:  The Last Stand (Original Motion Picture)</a>) to the introduction of imaginative new mutant characters (including Ben Foster as Worthington's son/namesake, Angel, with his gorgeous 20-foot wingspan) to the stunning special effects.  (I'm only disappointed that Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler didn't make a return appearance.)  Note: If you didn't see it in the theater, DO NOT stop the player until after the credits have rolled.  You'll see a short scene that hints of more to come--and if it's as good as this, I can't wait!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This outing for our mutant friends is disappointing on so many levels. The film makers have clearly lost track of just what it is that made the first two movies so great. One of the great things that Bryan Singer did with those movies was to, ironically, humanize the mutants.<br /><br />Yes, they have amazing powers, but the movies worked best when they treated the use of those powers as just routine. Ice Man blowing on Wolverine's soda to chill it. Magneto simulating the kinetic ball toy on his desktop. These things were done with hardly any fanfare. But it's a far cry from this movie where, every single time Storm decides to use her power, they do a zoom-in to her eyes to remind you they turn white when she exerts herself.<br /><br />We know they're mutants. We know they're super-human. We need to also feel they're human. If the audience can't connect with the heroes, there's no point.<br /><br />**Warning - Minor Spoilers**<br /><br />Add to that the fact that they decided to kill off too many of the big names--and largely without real reason within the story--and the movie not only disappoints, but ends up offending fans of those characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When the development plagued Superman Returns finally got off the ground thanks to X-Men and Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer, the reins had to be passed to Brett Ratner, director of Rush Hour films and Red Dragon. Many people gave a sigh of disappointment since Ratner is less a director than more a "session player" that musicians use in the studio. What made the previous films work was that not only were they great comic book movies, they were just simply great movies with action scenes as well as some deeper issues and meanings. X-Men 3 became what the series shouldn't have been: a blockbuster and nothing more.<br /><br />The main inspiration for the film is the "Dark Phoenix" saga, arguably one of the most-well known and best sagas in Marvel's history. Jean Grey has been brought back to life after her death in X2 only she seems...changed. She seems a bit more uninhibited and carries a bit of a mean streak. Meanwhile, scientists at Worthington Labs have developed a cure of the mutant gene and are planning to allow willing mutants to take it and be "normal". Of course this infuriates Magneto and he establishes the Brotherhood, a group of mutants who are going to stop the cure no matter how.<br /><br />One complaint that's always been in the X-Men films is the sheer number of characters. Unlike the comics where you can actually do an arc on one character alone, here they jampack it with a whole bunch of characters that it's kind of overwhelming. In addition to X2's cast (besides sorely-missed Nightcrawler), we have Juggernaut, Callisto, Quill, Angel, Beast, Multiple Man and Kitty Pryde. Hell, I think they even added in Psylocke and some others not even mentioned. It ends up making an already big cast bloated. Not to mention certain characters react differently than before and an off-screen death is just inexcusable.<br /><br />The anticipated notions of an X-Men movie tend to be scenes exclusively related to a character. Whether it's fight scenes like Wolverine vs Lady Deathstrike or the Nightcrawler attack on the White House, it's also geeky to see a scene of fights and mayhem. This film certainly has it from a small-but-cool cameo of a Sentinel to a big fight involving a house and the epic finale, it's certainly great to see things in a bigger proportion. Only problem is the scenes don't have an emotional resonance, it's just "time to see some computer-y stuff".<br /><br />If you manage to be a fan of this, is this worth buying? Depends if you want special features. All we have are alternate endings, deleted scenes and pat-on-the-back commentaries. If you're looking for some in-depth stuff, you'd best look to the eventual double-dip.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"The Last Stand" is the first in the "X-Men" series to truly embrace its pulpy comic book roots. It's a fun action picture that sets up its pins and knocks them down without pretending each demise needs its own aria to accompany it. This development may disgust the purists who devoured comic books like every other kid, then decided in their twenties to reimagine those mindless hours as advanced lessons in sociopolitical ethics.<br /><br />Not that director Brett Ratner, taking over for Brian Singer, completely drops the hot-button issues at play in "X2." He merely dials down the portentious weight of them. Xavier(Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) are still at odds. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) still marches to his own drum. Storm (Halle Berry) still has nothing to do. Rogue (Anna Paquin)is still weird. And the U.S. government is still looking for an answer to the mutant question, and this time it presents a pretty interesting one: Using the DNA of a boy called Leech (Cameron Bright) to eradicate the mutant gene completely. Though "the cure" is optional, Magneto, now a fugitive, sees it as an entryway to a final solution, and intends to stop the production entirely.<br /><br />Shoehorned into this storyline is the resurrection of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) as the Dark Phoenix, whose telekinetic powers dwarfs the skills of anyone else, including Xavier, who locked the Phoenix away in Jean's mind when she was a girl. The disaster at the end of "X2" - in which Jean sacrificed her own life to save the X-Men jet - cocooned Jean in the water but destroyed the mental barriers (How? Who knows?). Cyclops (Scott Marsden)revives her. But it's not the same girl who went into that water.<br /><br />Besides Jean, "The Last Stand" slips a few jokers into its deck. One death is unforeseen, as is one betrayal, and one of the X-Men is hot for the cure. Ratner mostly pulls off the large action sequences, including the 30-minute finale at Alcatraz that begins with Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate bridge and ends with a showdown between two lovers.<br /><br />Unlike Singer, who allows his movies to be edited within an inch of their life, Ratner lets his camera breathe a little. The special f/x aren't as glossy and the lighting isn't as dramatic - the movie looks more like a lush, inky Spielberg picture than the study in primary colors of "X-Men" and "X2"  The screenplay by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn may lack eloquence, but it also isn't so stilted - no Nightcrawler reciting the Lord's Prayer. "The Last Stand" explores the mutants without subjecting them to low-level Shakespeare. Even Kelsey Grammer, who could have turned mutant government official Beast into a Professor Xavier clone, delivers a zestful, light performance. If Frasier can relax, so can you.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>....And the summer movie season is off!!!  X-Men: The Last Stand is the first REAL blockbuster of the year and a great action film!  The third installment of this X-Men franchise brings us the appearance of new characters, old ones and a the transformation of Jean Grey into the Phoenix, all in one movie.<br /><br />The plot involves humans discovering a "cure" for those who wish to be rid of their mutant powers and blend into society.  While both sets of mutants, led by Professor Xavier and Magneto, respectively, do not agree with a cure, the two take different view points on how to deal with the situation.  Magneto decides it is time for the mutants to stand up to the unevolved humans who are trying to erradicate anyone with mutant powers.  Xavier's X-Men knows it is up to them to stop their evil counterparts from going to war with humanity.<br /><br />This film marks a huge change in the franchise.  There is the death of THREE major characters, major characters lose their powers to the "cure" and there are changes in leadership at Xavier's school.  Magneto's Brotherhood is also affected, left in shambles by the end of the movie.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the film, I do have some small complaints.  I'd liked to have seen the director do more with Angel.  He was pretty much left with nothing to do.  To be honest, I would loved to have seen the Phoenix hang around for another film.  The Phoenix is such an interesting and complex character, I think we could have benefited from another appearance in the franchise.<br /><br />As for compliments, I really enjoyed Kelsey Grammer as Beast. I really hope we see more of him in the next film. I think the director did a good job of keeping the story fast moving and giving the fans a lot of action.  And the ending pretty much shows us that things are not over.  I, for one, am looking forward to the revamped mutants and the next challenge they will face.  Worth your money and highly recommended!<br /><br />(I just edited my review to encourage movie fans to stay until the end of the credits.  I just found out there is a secret scene at the end of the credits!)</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Everyone probably knows the plot from the trailer or TV advertisements (I have a synopsis at the end of this for those that are interested in reading about it). Comic book fans can rejoice as Angel and Beast have finally been introduced into the X-Men films.<br /><br />How has Brett Ratner done with the third "X-Men" film? Well the good news for those who had their doubts about Ratner is that he didn't screw it up. The main story points were written before he came on board while Singer was still attached to the project so, in many respects, this is an extension of Singer's first two films. The screenplay manages to pack quite a bit of action and resolution into it considering the film runs under two hours. Ratner does a great job setting up the action scenes and even does a solid job during the quieter character moments.<br /><br />The visual effects are stunning particularly a sequence involving Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge. There were a few scenes where the visuals weren't 100% convincing (those involving Angel)but on the whole the production is top notch. While Ratner focuses on the action and humor at the expense of the drama at times, he's crafted a fine film that holds up well when compared to the first two installments directed by Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Some fans of the comic book or animated series will probably object to the liberities taken with the storyline and characters but many of the important themes that were handled in the comic book receive their due here. Kelsey Grammer is terrific as Beast even though he probably could have used a bit more screen time and James Marsden although he's used effectively could probably have had his role pumped up a bit as well. While Famke Janssen does a marvelous job in her dual role I felt that she also was under utilized a bit.<br /><br />Synposis:<br />Still grieving over the loss of Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen)Cyclops (James Marsden)has shirked his duties teaching the kids at "mutant high". Wolverine (Hugh Jackman)steps in but expresses his concern to Cyclops and suggest he needs to "move on". Hearing Jean's voice in his head Cyclops leaves the school. A pharmaceutical company has developed a cure for the mutations a medication that will suppress the mutant gene permanently. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is for it while others such as Wolverine, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Storm (Halle Berry) are against it. Magneto rallies more mutants to his cause in hopes of destroying the vaccine which he sees as humanity's attempt to eradicate mutants and make them like everyone else. The X-Men augmented by Beast (Kelsey Grammer perfectly cast), Kitty (Ellen Page) and Colossus(Daniel Cudmore) and Magneto end up butting heads against each other as he's concerned about the threat to humanity from Magneto and his hoard. There's a mutant in town that could help Magneto succeed--Phoenix the most powerful mutant on the face of the Earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>We watched the first "X-Men" film in the afternoon, "X-Men United" last night, and then went to the midnight showing for "X-Men: The Last Stand," where there was some serious cinematic discussions going on touching on everything from Rosebud in "Citizen Kane" to "Platoon."  But once they showed the trailer for "Superman Returns" the crowd immediately got back into the appropriate literary frame of reference for the proceedings.<br /><br />For those expecting to see the Phoenix saga from the "X-Men" comic books played out it is quickly made clear that is not going to happen.  We begin two decades ago, when Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) visit the home of young Jean Grey, where we learn this little girl is the only Level 5 mutant on the planet (No, the idea of levels is not explored further, but my best guess would be that Professor X, Magneto, Storm and Callisto are Level 4s, and no clue about the rest, although I would think Wolverine is just an upgraded 2 because his healing powers are natural but the claws are not).  Phoenix is now the unconscious side of the powers of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and after years of being controlled by Xavier's mental blocks, the beast is out.  That is something Logan (Hugh Jackman) can relate to, but he does not like the idea that the professor has been messing with the mind of the woman he loves.<br /><br />The other element from the past prologue is young Warren Worthington III, trying to hide from his father that he is starting to have wings grow out of his back.  Father and son are ashamed, but what matters is that daddy (Michael Murphy) has enough money to do something about it.  Then we pick up the narrative in the not too distant future where relationships between humans and mutants has apparently improved to the point that Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer) is Secretary of Mutant Affairs in the cabinet of the president (Josef Sommer).  Meanwhile, a distraught Scott Summers (James Marsden), hearing Jean's voice in his head goes back to Alkali Lake to exorcise his pain, only to find out what we all know: the woman he loves is not dead.  She is just different.  Big time.<br /><br />However, that is not the big problem, because Worthington announces that he has found a mutant, Leech (Cameron Bright), who can "cure" mutants.  A magic formula has been created and if you do not want to be a mutant, your wish can come true.  But for Magneto, who still bears the number tattooed on his arm in a Nazi concentration camp knows full well, the government can always decide to cure mutants in the name of national self interest.  Besides, he does not think mutants need a cure, and he rallies an army to his banner to join him alongside Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) (part of the fun is seeing who shows up).  Meanwhile, Storm (Halley Balle) has to take a bigger leadership role with the X-Men, where Rogue (Anna Paquin), who cannot touch another living soul because she can kill them absorbing their powers, is desperate enough  to take the cure.<br /><br />My primary cryptic complaints about the film are as follows.  First, we did not realize that the first X-Men to die in the film had actually died.  Only one of the deaths really had emotional resonance, mainly because I am a big "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" fan so it was really "been there, done that" for the final death.  But part of the problem is that we expect the dead to come back in these movies (Gandalf came back, Electra came back, hands up if you think we will see Dumbledore again).  Second, making Bobby Drake young enough for Iceman to be part of the next generation of X-Men with Rogue, Colossus and Shadowcat sets up an implied love triangle that rubs against the grain because the two things we know about Kitty is she walks through walls and loves Peter.  At least they did not cross the line in this film with that regard but they skate pretty close to it (literally).  Third, where was the Phoenix effect?  They set up the whole thing at the end of the second movie as we see the shape of the Phoenix beneath the waters of Alkali Lake and I waited for Jean Grey to go full-blown Phoenix, but she just stays on the cusp.<br /><br />However, there are more things I liked about the film.  The second scene at the home of Jean Grey is the most memorable in the movie, I liked the fact that the American military are better prepared for an assault by Magneto and his, and any scene in which Stewart and McKellen have a conversation makes you think they are still doing.  The script makes good use of Kitty and her powers (she has the single best fight movie in the film), and Wolverine and the Beast bickering is fun.  The key thing is that you have to go with the movie and not let your expectations be colored by the comic books you have read, because those will just prove to be false paths.  I was convinced that in the end Magneto was going to be leading the X-Men in an effort to stop Phoenix, and that Jean was going to regain control long enough to use the cure on herself, but all of that was from what I have read (and what Chris Claremont and John Bryne wanted to have be the original ending of the Dark Phoenix saga).  This could be the last X-Men movie simply because of the relatively high body count, but on the other hand the roster of merry mutants has been evolving to such a high degree since Claremont and Dave Cockrum brought them back with the international flair that you kill one of the X-Men and you have a half-dozen to take their place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I was shocked at how ridiculous this movie was. I loved the 2nd one and thought this would be the icing on the cake, but I was actually left speechless at the end. I could find nothing to say since I was so shocked at how stupid this movie was. It was a garbled mess and felt pointless. I truly was hoping to love it but instead I got the complete opposite.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The government develops a cure for the mutant gene, which divides the mutant community with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on one side and Magneto (Ian McKellan) on the other, each backed by their respective armies.  What's good about it?  There are tons of mutants expertly realized through spectacular special effects.  It's great fun to see Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), and others in action.  What's bad about it?  There are tons of mutants, which means that none of the characters are well-developed.  The script is a complete mess, killing off important, classic, well-established characters in off-handed ways as if they were red-shirted security men on "Star Trek."  So it's fun to watch, but a deeply disappointing finale to an otherwise good series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>After seeing the first two films in the "X-Men" series, I was wary to see the latest installment. The first film was alright, and the second was just average. So, my hopes for this third installment in the franchise were far from optimistic.<br /><br />But, after viewing the film, I was pleasently surprised. "X-Men: The Last Stand" is, without a doubt, the best "X-Men" film so far. It has a great combination of action, visual effects, acting and storytelling that bring the series to a fantastic, probable conclusion, although it does hint at the possibility of future films in the franchise!<br /><br />While the film does have its faults, and it doesn't strictly adhere to the comic book, it is a fantastic film that belongs in anyone's collection of comic-book films!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>You wouldn't miss that Bryan Singer is gone, maybe even a good move, as X3 is 3 times what X2 was, with Brett Ratner (Red Draqon) amping up the action, character arcs (many of which come to a surprising end, quite literally) and just pounding action sequence after action sequence onto the big screen, which is exactly where X3 should be seen, in all its widescreen glory. Explaining any second of this movie would just spoil the surprises in store and tear-jerkers, of which there are many, like the number of mutants on display, including Beast and the New, and deeply unsettling, Dr. Jean Grey, now the dark Phoenix, who will blow you away... and everything else she comes in contact with. X3 is where the summer blockbusters begin. Finally we have something worth getting in queue for again. What are you waiting for? Leave your home this weekend and GO!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a "cure" is found that makes all mutants human.<br /><br />Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such  is the view of the mutant self proclaimed leader Magneto. Magneto fears that the "cure" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in this one. New mutants are hatched and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in the movie). Special effects are 5-star.<br /><br />There is no need to see X1 or X2 in order to fully understand and be thoroughly entertained by X3. Hugh Jackman is back in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all back too. And Famke Janssen is back as Phoenix as you've never seen her.<br /><br />Beast is in this one too actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammer! Now there's a real mutation!<br /><br />All in all a very entertaining hour and 45 minutes. X fans won't miss it. You shouldn't either if you're into the action genre.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Many reviewers have already posted excellent reviews below, so I don't think I need to write down the entire story of the third `X-Men' film. The so-so story about the `cure' is interesting at first, but it is terribly oversimplified. And the return of Jean Grey (or Phoenix) is not a big surprise if you have seen the ending of the second `X-men' film very carefully. I only add to say that the two storylines, both of which I heard can be seen in the original comic in separate episodes, do not merge well.<br /><br />In other words, so many life-changing things happen to the characters, but the fast-paced film fails to be emotional when it should be most. Cyclops is reduced to Character # 1; Rogue is almost forgotten; and Jean Grey, Magneto, and other characters are all buried in the flood of eye-popping special effects.<br /><br />Many new characters are introduced, but except for Kelsey Grammer's perfect Dr. Hank McCoy, they are mostly forgettable, or treated as if disposable. They are all only the pixels among the costly CGI, and perhaps director Brett Ratner, who mercilessly Hollywoodnized Jackie Chan and his stunts in 'Rush Hour' series, thought the same way as Magneto, who coldly says they are just 'pawns' of the chess game.<br /><br />I admit the excellence of the visual effects. It is made as a big-budget summer blockbuster film, and it really is. But what made the first and second `X-Men' films different is missing here. You don't share the sadness of these characters, and you don't understand the complicated feelings that these characters expressed. Still you may be amazed by the special effects, but these amazing effects can be seen somewhere else, like `Fantastic Four.'</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>The year's third-biggest movie is going to kick off the fourth-quarter DVD-selling season.<br /><br />20th Century Fox is expected to announce Friday that "X-Men: The Last Stand," which grossed $233 million at the box office, will arrive on DVD on October 3 in two extras-laden editions.<br /><br />The highlight of the third "X-Men" movie's DVD debut: three alternative endings, each with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner.

It is his first original Marvel Comics book in five years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>The FDA has found a "cure" to the common "disease" shared by mutants. It is up to Magneto's Brotherhood to stop the drug from being used to eradicate the population of mutants. The drug will allegedly be used on a voluntary basis only so the X-Men would like to help keep the peace. The Brotherhood is more skeptical and anticipates it being used with malicious intent. It is war the ensues.<br /><br />Well at least war was what the trailer and previews lead you to believe. My thoughts on the movie ahead of time were simple: the plot will be severely lacking, but with a mutant war I will be able to sit there in my geeky glory and try to pick out which mutants I recognize from the TV series and the old comic books. That which was delivered fell well short of that which was promised/expected.<br /><br />The actual "war" scene was only cool because Wolverine and Beast went crazy. Their choreographed fight scenes were fun to watch. Beyond that, there was nothing. The "war" scene lasted only a few minutes and it consisted of Magneto and Pyro sending Juggernaut into the building and unleashing an infantry of lesser mutants against the opposition while they stood back lobbed exploding cars.<br /><br />Before I go on with my analysis, I really need the answer to a question. Are they making another X-Men movie? There has been speculation in both directions. Yes, there will be a fourth installment; we're not done yet. No, the X-Men group movies are over, make way for solo stories (it was called The LAST Stand for a reason...).<br /><br />If there will be no fourth movie, then I think the ending and much of the story throughout X-Men 3 was incredibly pointless. You will have to ask me separately for my more pointed spoiler complaints.<br /><br />They took such care in introducing Warren Worthington A/K/A Archangel, yet he was very under-used and remained entirely excluded from the action.<br /><br />There was talk about a reduced budget for X-Men 3, and yet we see so much time and money wasted on a prolonged scene where Magneto uproots half of the Golden Gate Bridge and flies it across the water... Just take a boat. Or rewrite the script to Worthington labs is on the mainland so they can walk.<br /><br />Why did they get our geek hopes up with a teaser fight scene with a Sentinal...only to dash said hopes because it was just a fight simulation in the Danger Room?<br /><br />The fun of the books and TV show for me is that they were basically like a Street Fighter video game where each cut scene would pit two mutants with comparable powers against each other and they would fight. The movies really try to add a real world element that takes the fun away. The creators have hundreds of mutants at their disposal and they opt against introducing so many of them. The story could write itself if someone would just do a little research into characters.<br /><br />The movie was decent enough. I can say that I have seen it and participate in the angst-filled discussions going forward. That is about all I took away from X-Men 3: The Last Stand.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>This review is fraught with spoilers because there's no way to express all of my viewpoints without really engaging some of the happenings of the movie.  You have been warned.<br /><br />I have never expected to like any of the X-men movies. The first X-men surprised me with how willing it was to take the time to develop so many different characters, and X2 had enough good action and follow-up character development to make it surprisingly good as well. With the mixed reviews of this one, I figured I wouldn't like it at all. I liked some of it; it exceeded my expectations. But it's still highly flawed and I don't like the direction it took.<br /><br />The key problem with this movie is that it makes the ultimate transition away from what the mutant's powers MEAN to focusing more on what they DO. That means while the writers and Ratner were more than willing to figure out interesting battles, they lost track of a lot of motifs and arcs that could fully encompass the general trend of the movies and make it very good. The driving force behind the franchise has always been the tension between mutants and humans and what to do with that tension, but this one seemed much more willing to give that (and any actual drama) second tier to just hurrying up and getting through all the events that it seems must take place. Unfortunately for Ratner, removing the drama and the point makes the events not matter, which means ultimately a very poor cinema experience.<br /><br />For example, most of the mutants introduced are no longer introduced by how important they are to the main circle and how they help range the debate and understand this new world everyone's entering... mostly they're just introduced as a contrivance to get the plot moving along. I'm definitely not the only one who thinks Angel could have been cut completely from the movie and not changed much. Leech and Phoenix also suffer this fractured character arch, most especially represented by the completely anticlimactic and unnecessarily random ending: The driving force of involving Leech is that he can suck powers away. The driving force of involving Phoenix is that she has an excess of power. Well look at that, don't those two make a great opposites cancel out! Unfortunately, I think the writers decided not to go that route because it would be too obvious... or worse, they didn't even think of it. Whatever the case, they missed a precise and organized denouement to the proceeds, ultimately causing both threads to be mostly spectators to the events as they unfold instead of their supposed function of indicators. In fact, now that I think about it, nothing in explaining who Phoenix is explains why she'd join Magneto like that anyway.<br /><br />This complete lack of functionality is further proof of the loss of focus on what the powers mean. I mean, come on... She's a phoenix, literally. Rise from the grave, more power, passionate... the openness to symbolism and the effect on the human/mutant debate is almost limitless.... did Ratner care? No, he seemed more interested in presenting situation after situation which ultimately proves that we're not even going to pretend Wolverine can die at this point.<br /><br />In fact, for a movie willing to kill off very iconic characters (though, maybe, not really...), it seems unwilling to really understand what killing off those characters will ultimately mean to the remaining mutant characters. Deaths are dealt with with a quick moment of silence and then a discussion of what to do next. There is no grief, or fear, or guilt or anything. What it really feels like Ratner says to his production during these scenes is, "All right, the audience already knows what this means to the characters and stuff, no need to linger... let's move on to the next scene." Not only does that suck the drama right out of the proceeds, it also pretty much destroys its pacing.<br /><br />Luckily for it, the movie has some pretty strong moments spattered here and there despite itself. The race between Juggernaut and Kitty was excellent, and for some reason I really started digging the enmity between Pyro and Bobby (even if it did feel like a cheap Star Wars rip-off from time to time). I also loved the imagery around the protesters and the people waiting for the cure, because during that time the movie alludes to famous protests from around the world.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie was just overstuffed and under-functional. Even the dialog represents that, with Wolverine officially sounding like he's trying to be James Bond, all of the good lines taken straight from different works, some rather redundant lines like "And that's why the pawns go first," and so on. I have no doubt in my mind that subsequent X-men will lose further sight of what makes the franchise good, and they're beginning their full decent here. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>X-Men 3 is very cool. this movie is bursting with non-stop action. although it is inaccurate from the cartoon's content, I still enjoyed it. I thought Kelsey Grammer was the perfect person to play Hank "Beast" McCoy as he is just as intelligent. they ought to have more characters from the cartoon series, such as Sabretooth and Toad, on a possible 4th movie. the movie had a bit of nudity in it, and that was when Mystique was hit with a "cure" dart and turned into a normal woman, but there was no frontal nudity involved.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I just recently got back from seeing X-Men: The Last Stand, the film which brings to a close the X-Men film trilogy.<br /><br />I am sad to report that, while the film does bring to a close to many storylines within the trilogy, it does not do so terribly well. The previous film (X2 - X-Men United) did set the bar high, , but it did so not through the use of special effects, but instead by taking the time to build up the characters, making us involved in their struggles and losses on a personal level.<br /><br />X3, at a running time of 104 minutes, feels much shorter and compressed than X2 at 133 minutes. That missing 30 minutes makes all the difference. Characters die in this movie, while a few new ones are introduced...but its hard for us to be invested in things, either way, because any caring on the part of the characters seems to have been excised out of the story.<br /><br />What is our story, this time out? Without spoiling things, I can say that a pharmaceutical company has developed a "cure" for "mutancy". This causes consternation, to say the least, amongst the mutant population, which splits along the Xavier/Magneto lines, with Magneto wanting the so-called cure destroyed. Many of the X-Men (Xavier's crowd) are still mourning the loss of Jean Grey...and when Cyclops finds her again, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Seem like two independent storylines to you? Well, they are forced together, nearly midway through the film. One storyline is about the conformancy vs. not fitting in, and choice vs. force. The other is solely about power vs. responsibility. Well, if you're going to blend two different themes together, then you should take the time to do it right. Making a straight-out action flick, in which the characters barely have a moment to mourn the death of one of their two fallen comrades, is not the way to do it.<br /><br />So, colour me disappointed. It's not a bad movie...it's just not the best it could have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>Imagine removing the slow burn between action scenes of the first movie, ramping up the action scenes of the second movie, and throwing the result (together with a dozen more mutants) into one film. That's what you have with XMTLS. Fans who cheered in the theater during the second film when Wolverine killed the guy in the kitchen will get more than their fill of claw-slashing action.<br /><br />XMTLS is an incredible film and easily the best of the series. While it's true they probably tried to put too much into one short film (this is the shortest of the three for some reason with the largest cast), Ratner and company do an admirable job of pulling it off for the most part. While rumors abound this is the last one due to contract problems with certain "Stormy" stars, this film proves if nothing else that the X-Men universe can survive without the whole cast. There are enough heroes waiting in the wings to get treatments that we can afford to lose anyone not willing to return.<br /><br />The film pulls off some key moments in powerful ways. The problem is that it tries to pull off TOO MANY key moments and therefore loses the impact of most of them. Yes, we finally get to see the Danger Room. Yes, The Angel finally makes an appearance (for about ten minutes of film time). Yes, The Beast is every bit as cool in the movies as he is in the comics (Grammar does an amazing job of perfectly portraying Hank McCoy's intellect while pulling off some amazing fighting moves). And hey, they've thrown in Juggernaut, Colossus, Sprite, Psylocke, Madrox the Multiple Man, Arclight, Marrow, and Spike. And Iceman finally "ices up"!<br /><br />What did they do wrong? In adding so many characters, there's not enough screen time for them. Rogue uses her powers ONCE early in the film when she could have been used in a great way during the climactic battle scene at the end. The death of a MAJOR character ten minutes into the film is only alluded to rather than shown (which is a rip since we've stuck with this person through two other films). Speaking of deaths, this film pulls out all the stops. The Xavier Institute's backyard goes from scenic to a graveyard in ONE FILM! Shouldn't we have spaced these out a little?<br /><br />Still, despite giving too much in too little time (this could have easily gone over the two hour mark without making anyone upset), this is the best film of the series. Hugh Jackman adds a depth to the character of Wolverine with one scene that truly shows how he's grown from the previous two installments. Storm becomes a central player to the team finally. And we see the Colossus/Wolverine "Fastball Special" from the comics. Ratner even throws in a little curve of his own after the credits finish rolling to show there could still be life in the franchise if anyone's interested. I'd say we definitely all are! Cut down the cast a little (for heaven's sake, lose Magneto! The "Mutants are superior to Homo Sapiens" routine has gotten too old and the guy's more of an irritation than a menace now), add some faces to give us more fun (Gambit could appear to add some spice to the Rogue/Iceman/Sprite love triangle), lengthen the movie (by at least a half hour to give us a breather between explosions), and keep giving Wolverine people to slash and we'll all be happy! A highly recommended movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the last decade one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative sources of income. That genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is most commonly referred to as. Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the `Spider-Man' movies, `Batman' reboot and the `Blade' trilogy. In the midst of all of those, one franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters and onto an entire team of heroes. This set of movies is none other than the `X-Men' franchise.<br /><br />After two highly successful trips to the box office with "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United", both with Bryan Singer at the helm, the third film "X-Men: The Last Stand" would feature a new director. For the third entry in the series, director Brett Ratner ("Red Dragon") took over for Bryan Singer, who left the series to direct "Superman Returns". The decision to have Brett Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the supposed final chapter in the popular superhero trilogy, caused many a fan to become uneasy. This was caused in part by the fact that Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest `Superman' movie; however, before much progress could be made he dropped out of the film. So, with a new director onboard that had little to no obvious experience in dealing with elaborate visual effects (not to mention the fact that he couldn't handle one hero let alone a team), and the success of a franchise on the line, one question remained. "Could this latest chapter in the `X-Men' series hope to succeed when it seemed that so many factors were working against it?"<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" begins with the creation of a new `cure' for the mutant gene, allowing those born with powers to choose whether they wanted to remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings. This `cure' quickly becomes the focus for the mutant race, and serves as the potential catalyst to spark an all-out war that has been brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) `Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. With mutantkind divided as to which side to choose, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the final battle is about to begin!<br /><br />Screenwriter Zak Penn ("xXx: State of the Union"), taking over for departing writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (who also jumped ship to work on "Superman Returns"), chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the `cure' for mutants. Granted the cure story arc was interesting and provided some very captivating moments between key characters as some felt the cure was a blessing, while others felt it was just another way for humans to oppress the mutants even further. With that being said, I don't feel that this storyline would have been able to sustain the film throughout its entire duration. With that in mind I feel confident in stating that the film greatly benefited from the intermixing of the incredibly popular Phoenix story arc from the comic books. The Phoenix plotline, just as it did in the comics, provided some very intense moments within the story, along with numerous opportunities for the characters to explore how they feel about Jean's miraculous resurrection and her newly unleashed awesome power. This proved especially true for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he now finds the woman he loves may be a threat to everything else he holds dear.<br /><br />Many detractors of this film felt that the movie lacked in substance, and that the film would have been better served had it focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Phoenix. I agree that the film probably would have been even better had it dealt even more, if not solely on Jean's manifestation into the Phoenix. However I must disagree with the first sentiment about the lack of substance. This film was the final act (or at least it appears to be) in a trilogy, meaning that in some way it ties into events that occurred in the previous two films. Therefore, this film is intended more as a means of tying up any and all remaining loose ends left over from its predecessors, while at the same time expanding somewhat on what had been laid out prior to this entry. In the case of "X-Men: The Last Stand", the film's story was focused on exploring what happened to Jean in the closing moments of "X2", unleashing the war that had been brewing between the two opposing sides of the mutant race, and introducing us to the concept of a cure for mutants. If you ask me, those three aspects of the story provided plenty of substance for this film to draw from, and it did so in a satisfying way that didn't come off as overly bloated and complicated like some third film's in a trilogy have of late (for example, "The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End").<br /><br />The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was still as great as ever; except for a couple of exceptions. Actresses Halle Berry and Anna Paquin appeared to struggle with their characters for some reason in this film. Both of their performances varied between good to being just flat and disinterested in nature. I will say that aside from her performance in "X2", Halle has been inconsistent with her interpretation of the X-Man known as Storm; however, by this point one would have hoped that she would have figured the character out by now. As for Anna Paquin, I don't really know what the problem was; perhaps it was her character's arc in this film and her insecurity about being a mutant becoming more apparent given the newly discovered cure. Whatever the case may be, she clearly struggled to find a groove in her surprisingly small amount of screen time, given that the character was much more involved in the previous two films, and in the end she delivered what could possibly be classified as the most uninspired performance in the film. Like I said, aside from these two, the remainder of the returning cast members continued to deliver solid performances, even when relegated to little more than a cameo appearance (I'm referring to James Marsden's character Cyclops).<br /><br />Joining the returning members, the film featured several newcomers to the series, such as Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel), all of whom fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the very first movie. Now, I for one never would have picked Kelsey Grammer (TV's "Fraiser") to embody the X-Man known as the Beast. Sure he could handle the intellectual dialogue and would sound genuine in doing so, but I wouldn't have thought of him as being all that physical of an actor. However, there he was in some of the fight sequences right in there with the other X-Men, and holding his own without any trouble at all. It's just one more example of how some of the casting choices in Hollywood never cease to amaze me in how spot on they are, despite all appearances to the contrary. Next we have soccer player turned actor Vinnie Jones ("Gone in 60 Seconds") offering up his portrayal of the powerhouse mutant known as Juggernaut. Juggernaut pretty much did in this film exactly what the character is known for in the comics, essentially decimate anything and everything in his path. The only major difference between the two mediums is that there was no mention ever made to the character being the half-brother to Charles Xavier. Aside from that Vinnie's performance was as good as expected for an actor playing a character that isn't known for being all that much of a thinker or having any real depth to him.<br /><br />Last but not least, we have actor Ben Foster as the mutant known as Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Angel. The only thing you can say about Ben, other than the fact that he pretty much knocks every performance out of the park, is that he is a true chameleon when it comes to his appearance and presentation from role to role. In one movie he'll have long black hair and an extremely bad attitude ("Hostage"), then he'll have scraggly red hair, a plethora of piercings, and a heart of gold ("The Punisher"), or he will be a clean cut, blonde heir to a massive fortune as he is in this film. It's amazing to me to see just how diverse Ben has proven to be in various movies, and each performance is always unique from the one before it. This is one actor who I believe will go down as one of the best and most talented of his generation.<br /><br />The action scenes in this film are the most intense out of all the `X-Men' movies. Everything is so exciting and fast-paced that you feel like you have to see the movie more than once to fully take it all in. Going hand-in-hand with the action, the special effects work is also the best out of the franchise. Not that the visuals in the first two movies were anything to look down upon. In this film there is one sequence alone, involving the Golden Gate Bridge, that is worth the price of purchasing this movie.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" isn't a perfect movie by any means; however, it completely ties up all loose ends while still delivering to us a pulse-pounding battle that had been teased at for the last two films. Despite all the bad press this film has received among some fans, critics and so on, I personally found this installment to be just as entertaining as the first film, and a fitting end to the series.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>As one that doesn't have the knowledge of the characters via the comic book, I think that I look at each X-Men film with a less-biased eye.  That having been said, I find the third installment to be the most entertaining of the lot - and that's some praise from one that thought the second film was excellent.<br /><br />This time out, there are so many characters (mutant and human) that it was obvious that some of the returning characters, like Anna Paquin (Rogue) and James Marsden (Cyclops) would have less screen time.  It is also obvious that Jackman, Berry, and McKellan are the stars, with Stewart doing nothing more than a "death scene" cameo.  As others have stated, Kelsey Grammer steals the show as "Beast," with Vinnie Jones running a close second as "Juggernaut".<br /><br />It's also good to see stage, screen, and television Michael Murphy in the role of Warren Worthington II, creator of the "cure" for the mutant gene.<br /><br />The dialogue is equal to the second and superior to the first.  Special effects are outstanding, especially of Magneto shifting The Golden Gate Bridge and Dark Phoenix's (Famke Janssen) assault on Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.<br /><br />The action is crisp and each actor does get his/her "moment," no matter how brief.<br /><br />There are a few complaints: the absence of Jim Cummings' marvelous "Nightcrawler" and the beautiful Rebecca Romijn's early departure from the story line.  Both actors deserved better than this, after their impressive turns in the first two films.<br /><br />Also, the inevitable battle between "Ice Man" (Shawn Ashmore) and "Pyro" (Aaron Stafford) was a bit of a letdown, lasting less than a minute, in my estimate.<br /><br />That withstanding, if in fact this is the last in the series (save a Wolverine franchise), it still delivers and all that had a hand in its production have much for which they can be proud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1 & 2) takes over the successful comic book franchise in the highly anticipated summer blockbuster "X-Men: The Last Stand". As tensions between humans and mutants continue to escalate, a "cure" for mutations grips an already unsettled mutant population. Now, opposing mutant leaders Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) clash for the ultimate battle that will ensure the future of all mutants. "X-Men: The Last Stand" is an entertaining action-packed summer joyride that became one of the highest grossing films of 2006. The 108-minute Sci-Fi adventure lacks the strong emotive mood and rich character development of the first two films. The latest chapter in the "X-Men" series has a few emotionally touching moments, cool eye-popping visual effects, terrific action sequences and an appealing cast including Emmy winner Kelsey Grammer as the intelligent blue-haired Beast. Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen deliver their share of memorable moments.<br /><br />Complete the trilogy with "X-Men: The Last Stand". The latest blockbuster sequel is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is somewhat weaker than previous X-Men DVDs but it is still a pretty sharp and brightly colored transfer. It's Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks are the real highlights in this release and provide a top notch home theater experience. The DVD features two decent audio commentaries with director Brett Ratner and film crew, trailers, deleted and extended scenes and three alternate endings with optional audio commentary. Overall, "X-Men: The Last Stand" scores a worthy "B".</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Superhero movies tend to work best if done as a trilogy.  Unfortunately, studios don't view superhero movies that way and see a particular character or characters as being a franchise:  if they can get characters on the screen more than in just three movies then the better it is for them.  This seems to be the approach that was taken with X-MEN: THE LAST STAND.  The series was originally envisioned as being a trilogy with one or two spin-offs.  That approach seems to have been thrown out.  Granted some of that might have to do with the series and film's original director, Bryan Singer, leaving and taking the majority of the production crew with him to make SUPERMAN RETURNS.  After Singer's departure, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND was in production limbo for awhile until Brett Ratner was given the reigns.  In a strange bit of irony, Ratner was originally supposed to direct the first two X-Men films and left and was supposed to direct SUPERMAN RETURNS and left there, too. In both instances, Singer took over the helm.  Despite the change-up in direction and production, there really isn't an excuse for X-MEN: THE LAST STAND being the somewhat lackluster film that it came to be.<br /><br />The story itself is full of promise.  The federal government develops a vaccine that can cure mutants of their disease.  Many mutants are excited by the prospect of living life as a normal human.  However, many other mutants aren't very keen on the idea.  Neither Professor X (Patrick Stewart) or Magneto (Ian McKellen) support the vaccine.  Both mutant leaders believe that mutants should embrace their talents and gifts. However, the two leaders strongly differ on their approach.  Professor X preaches tolerance while Magneto sees the creation of the vaccine as a declaration of war upon all mutants.  The mutants led by Magneto begin the war against humanity in full force, while the X-Men find themselves in the middle: protecting the humans and preaching Professor X's message of tolerance and unity.<br /><br />The movie builds up to a huge climatic battle between Magneto's mutants and the X-Men and humans on Alcratraz.  Unfortunately, this battle doesn't live up to the expectations it has built.  There are some very cool parts of the battle, e.g. the scenes with Beast (Kelsey Grammer).  However, the battle is rather anti-climatic.  Everything in the film leads up to that battle and then nothing really happens.  That is a major let down.<br /><br />The best part about X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is seeing different mutants on screen.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is back as is Storm (Halle Berry).  Professor X and Magneto are here, too.  In fact many of the mutants from the first two movies have returned (well Toad and Sabertooth and Nightcrawler are mysteriously absent, though Nightcrawler's absence is explained in the video game based on the movie). However, other than those four most of the mutants play much smaller roles.  Rogue is hardly on the screen; Cyclops is destroyed with only about a minute of screen time; Angel's introduction is huge, but he's not really seen.  I realize that part of this is because there are so many superheroes and not all of them can be seen in each film.  However, part of it is because the studio is setting things up for sequels to come.  In some way, they are following the lead of the comic books:  some characters are written off to make room for new ones, but if need be you can always bring someone back from the dead.  That makes for interesting, though frustrating reading, but doesn't translate well on the big screen.<br /><br />Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is a mediocre comic book movie.  The movie introduces some great new characters and contains some very interesting battle sequences.  However, the film fails to live up to the climatic expectations that it promises.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>** ?<br /><br />Two brief prologues; the first explaining how Jean Grey came to Charles Xavier's school twenty years ago, the second showing a young boy, seven or eight, trying to hide his wings from his father by cutting, grating and shaving them off begin "X-Men: The Last Stand". Then the action picks up at the dam, where "2" ended. Scott, a.k.a. Cyclops (James Marsden) is taking the death of Jean (Famke Janssen) very badly and decides to ride off on his motorcycle. Soon, he finds himself at the lake and the dam and is surprised when Jean appears and walks towards him. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) picks this up as well and sends Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the location. There, they find an unconscious Jean and only Scott's signature glasses. They return to the school and Xavier puts Jean under, trying to control her bad, reckless second persona, Phoenix. Meanwhile, Beast (Kelsey Grammer), the Secretary of Mutant Affairs, learns Worthington Pharmaceutical has created a cure for the Mutant gene, news which instantly divides both the Mutant and Human communities. Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) fears it will be used as a weapon against the Mutants and is determined to destroy it, but first, he has to release Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has been captured by the government. Along the way, we meet new characters as the story leads to a dramatic confrontation on Alcatraz Island, where Worthington Pharmaceutical is based, and storing the source of their cure.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" is pretty much the definition of a `summer movie'. A "sequel", based on a "comic book", filled with lots of "special effects" and "action"; these are the buzz words you are likely to find reprinted in the newspaper ads, touting the merits of the film. "Last Stand" has a surprising amount of story as well, but the story doesn't help develop the characters, new or old, or some of the relationships. If you haven't seen the previous two films, you might be lost.<br /><br />As the story begins working through its machinations, certain characters stand out, others fade into the background for large stretches of time. The new characters are given particularly short shrift. We quickly meet a new man who can turn himself into metal and seems to be very strong, but I didn't ever hear his "X-Men" name. At one point, Wolverine says "Hey, Tin Man?", but I suspect this was his sarcastic persona at work. The character seems to be around to simply provide strength. Another new student, a girl, who makes Rogue (Anna Paquin) jealous because her boyfriend, Bobby, aka, Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), shows an interest in her, can walk through walls and allow things to pass through her. Again, didn't catch her name. Magneto picks up a more interesting lot, including Juggernaut (a buffed up Vinnie Jones), who can run through anything, picking up incredible speed, and a guy who can replicate himself multiple times. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do a good job of creating all of these characters in a memorable way. I honestly couldn't remember many of their names and had to look them up on imdb.com.<br /><br />Also, the filmmakers make some strange choices regarding plotting. They introduce a particular story line and then the action cuts abruptly to another character or part of the story. You would naturally assume to return to the first story in the next scene, but more often than not, the filmmakers visit another storyline, then another, sometimes providing lengthy vacations from the first scene, before returning. At this point, you may have even forgotten the first scene. For instance, we visit an ominous government caravan transporting Mystique under heavy security. She has a funny exchange with one of the guards inside the large windowless truck. Then the action cuts to something else, and then something else again. Later, we join Magneto and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) addressing a crowd of Mutants. The villain soon learns one of the Mutants can sense where other Mutants are. "Can you locate someone for me?" Oh, right, he has to help Mystique escape. Three scenes later, we see an exterior shot of the mysterious caravan and Magneto standing in the middle of the country road.<br /><br />As the story begins unfolding, the filmmakers capture our attention with the sheer spectacle of everything; lots of action and special effects. But we don't learn anything about the characters, making it merely an exercise. As Wolverine and Storm run around (oddly, Storm is the only `good' Mutant never referred to by her human name) we see them in action, remarks are made to help establish something about their characters, but we never learn the meanings behind the remarks. As we meet the new characters, we don't learn about them either. Why is Angel (Ben Foster), Worthington's son, trying to cut off his wings in the prologue, but as a young man he seems very reluctant to take the cure his father has developed? In the first two films, director Bryan Singer provided these answers, or at least clues to them. Brett Ratner is more interested in blowing things up and using an incredible arsenal of special effects.<br /><br />Also, this is the first time I have ever felt that a villain was, well, sort of stupid. There is a rich tradition of super villains concocting outlandish plans for world domination and, yes, they tend to do stupid things. For instance, how often have villains stopped to tell James Bond their entire plan, only to give him the opportunity to free one of his hands? Hey, Blofeld! That's all it takes. One hand. But Magneto's plan in "Last Stand" has a fatal flaw. After he learns Worthington Pharmaceuticals has the source for their cure on Alcatraz Island, he decides to retrieve it and destroy it. Okay, check. No problem, so far. He'll just take a ferry or some ship to get there, right? Wrong. He decides to uproot the Golden Gate Bridge and move it to provide a walkway to the Island. An impressive sequence, providing a lot of work for Special Effects wizards, but how does this make sense? Through these actions, Magneto has provided both the X-Men and the military with an easier way to get to the Island and hamper his efforts.<br /><br />"Last Stand" is fun, mindless entertainment. But it could've been so much better. It is definitely not at the level of the previous two entries.<br /><br />Now that Bryan Singer has "Superman Returns" out of his system, hopefully he will return to helm "X-Men 4: The Next to Last Stand". Oh, trust me. There will be a sequel, despite all the statements from the actors about "Last Stand" ending the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Dispite what the critics say, 'The Last Stand' is not that hard to understand.  The humans have created a cure thanks to a young mutant with the ability to cause other mutants powers to be null and void in his presence and they intend to hold this out to the public for their use.  For any mutant who wants a normal life, here is your chance to get it.  The only problem is that Magneto and his band of baddies decides to wage war on the humans in protest.  It's at this point the humans decide to use this cure as a weapon against mutantkind which results in an all out war.  In the meantime, Jean Grey (Famke) who was assumed dead has come back to life in the form of Phoenix, her alter ego and has joined forces with Magneto.  The X-Men must fight to save the world from Magneto while battling there emotional ties to Jean (especially Wolverine)  Also, we have some mutants (Beast and Rogue primarily) who may even welcome the cure, and Rogue who has concerns about her relationship with Bobby (Iceman) beings that she can't touch him, and when he starts showing interest in Shadowcat, Rogue strongly conciders taking the cure for herself.  With the inclusion of mutants like Jugernut, Shadowcat, Angel and Beast you'd think it may get confusing, but the film flows nicely and explains everything very well.  It may not be the best of the bunch (X2 was by far the best) it still holds your interest and delivers solid hollywood entertainment, and Miss Famke delivers the best acting in the bunch as the very tempermental Phoenix.  I do have to say they went out of there way to make sure a fourth was damn near impossible, but even at that, they ended on a great note despite what the critics have to say about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>When it was announced that Brett Ratner would be directing X3, there was a massive outcry from the comic book nerds saying he would RUIN the X-Men franchise. Well, those nerds can eat their words now because Ratner's X-Men is so fantastic that it doesn't even compare to Singer's films. Singer did a pretty good job. But Ratner's film IS X-Men. He presents these characters the way they were always meant to be. What's great about this film? Story, acting, action, special effects, you name it. Ratner gets it done right. I actually teared up in a scene near the end. This movie is just perfect.<br /><br />I heard this will be the last X-Men film. That's a shame because this franchise is better than ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I liked X-Men, really liked X2: X-Men United, but I loved X-Men: The Last Stand. I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, but the new director did a pretty good job of maintaining the flow and feel of the last two films. The special effects are amazing and the film is well casted. Even Halle Berry redeems herself here for her less than average performances of Storm in the last two movies. The new mutants are all interesting, but old favorites like Wolverine and Magneto are still the focus. Jean Grey gets much more screen time, as Wolverine did in X2 (when it was about his backstory), but characters like Cyclops are still given nothing to do. Everybody in my sold out theater seemed to love it just as much as I did. The end credits may be long, but if you stay you will get a surprising 15 second scene that will leave you wondering...is this really the end of the X-Men franchise?</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I couldn't figure out why this so called "Collector's Edition" only had one disc.  Special editions usually have two discs, right?  Was it a typo?  No.<br /><br />The ONLY difference between this edition and the regular edition (that is $8 cheaper!) is that there will be a reprinted comic and a special "collectible" comic included.  So collectible that it will be included in the hundreds of thousands of these DVDs produced.  No extra features, no additional content beyong what is in the regular DVD.  The studio is obviously saving all that for another special edition to be released in 6 months (like X-Men 1.5).<br /><br />Unless you're a huge fan of comics, get the regular release and save the money for Superman Returns on November 28th.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>WARNING!  Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />I may be among the few who liked this one better than the previous two.  It probably was never going to be possible to create an X-Men finale that was going to please everyone.  I'll confess that there were a number of things in the three-film sequence that I didn't care for.  But give the team an "A" for effort in at least trying to do something interesting and compelling.  My complaint with the first film was that it was so safe and tame.  It didn't try to take the X-Men saga anywhere new or interesting.  THE LAST STAND did.  For the record, my complaint with the series is that it managed to make Rogue an unessential and uninteresting member of the team.  Of all the incarnations of Rogue, this one was the least powerful and the least complex.  Anna Paquin did a fine job given the script they provided, but she should have been far more empowered than she was.<br /><br />Most movies based on the comics suffer from a failure of nerve.  The writers want to play it safe, don't want to offend, and refuse to take risks.  THE LAST STAND takes a world of risks and leaves the X-Men universe shaken from top to bottom.  I loved that!  I didn't think all the gambles paid off.  The Phoenix story was not as interesting as it has been in the past.  Part of the problem with the Phoenix is that they tried to incorporate it with too many other arcs, including the "cure" of the mutant gene.<br /><br />Most of all, this film, unlike the previous two, really made me care how the story ended.  In the previous two, one figured everyone would be alive at the end, so in a way precisely what happened wouldn't matter all that much.  But in this one once Mystique had been "cured" and Scott and Xavier killed, there was a great sense of danger.  Not every one was going to emerge OK in this one.  Who would have imagined that the film would have ended with Xavier, Scott, and Jean dead, and Mystique, Magneto, and Rogue stripped of their powers?<br /><br />I loved the fact that they included some of the X-Men neglected in the previous films.  Kelsey Grammer was excellent as Hank McCoy, but I thought Ellen Page was perfect as Kitty Pryde, who has always been one of my favorite X-Men, mainly because her power of being able to pass through solid objects (or having solid objects pass through her) made her fascinating because employing it required so much strategy.  The sequence where she and Juggernaut engage one another was a lot of fun.  Vinnie Jones was almost unrecognizable, by the way, as Juggernaut.  Sidenote:  Many X-Men fans are bothered by the fact that traditionally Juggernaut is not a mutant.  Therefore, in the scene where his powers are stripped temporarily by the mutant who robs other mutants of their ability, he should have been unaffected.  But on narrative grounds I can understand why they altered this in the film.<br /><br />I can understand why so many fans of the comic disliked the final movie in the trilogy.  It was a sharp departure from most of the various versions of the X-Men saga found in so many of the comics and cartoon shows.  But I was ecstatic to see them try something really different and risky.  They didn't take the safe route.  And I personally found the story far more interesting than the first two films precisely for that reason.  Yeah, I wish Rogue had been conceived differently in the trilogy and I wish the Phoenix story had been handled better, but I realize that because there have been so many permutations of the X-Men, everyone is going to contruct their own private version.  This isn't quite the version I would have come up with had I the ability to cherry pick the elements I like, but this one managed the most important task:  it made the story interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>At long last, we have the third, and possibly final, installment of Fox's X-Men movie franchise, and it's been no easy road getting here.  There were a lot of behind-the-scenes troubles that plagued the film which led to many online fansites predicting the worst.  After seeing it, I can say that despite the backstage drama, this ended up being a pretty good movie.  It's no classic, but it's good for what it is.  And while it's not the best superhero film ever (that honor either goes to Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2), or even the best of the series (X2: X-Men United), it's nowhere near bad.<br />After Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) death at the end of the last film, the atomosphere at the X-Mansion hasn't been the same.  Everyone misses her, but no one as much as Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Mardsen), her husband, who can barely pull himself together.  Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has even resorted to having Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) substitute teach for him.  Meanwhile, Magneto (Ian McKellan) is still at large along with Pyro (Aaron Stanford), his new lieutenant and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), who has recently been incarcerated.  The new president (Josef Sommer) is much more tolerant of mutants, going so far as to appoint Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammer) as Secretary of Mutant Affairs, but he can't ignore the threat Magneto poses, and when a drug company develops a "cure" for mutation, he sees it as an answer to Magneto's terrorism.<br />Unfortunately, shortly after the X-Men learn of the cure, which completely catches them off-guard, Prof. X receives a psychic disturbance from Alkali Lake, the place where Jean died saving the rest of the team.  As it would appear, Jean was able to save herself, but in doing so, she unleashed a part of her subconscious mind that Xavier worked very hard to suppress.  Jean is a Level 5 mutant, meaning that she is off-the-charts powerful, and Xavier recognized that if he didn't find a way to keep some of her more "animal" emotions in check, she could very likely destroy everyone on Earth.  When Xavier and the X-Men try to bring Jean back to the mansion with them, Magneto shows up with some of his new recruits, including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is an unstoppable brute and Callisto (Dania Ramirez), a speedy girl who can also sense other mutants.  After a huge struggle against the nearly omnipotent Jean, now known as the Phoenix, Magneto's Brotherhood acquires Phoenix in order to use her against the humans in their campaign to "exterminate" mutantkind.<br />Now, the X-Men have to deal with the Phoenix, the Brotherhood, and the lure of the cure.  While many mutants are appalled at the idea that they are a "disease", there are some who want to give up their gifts, either because they see them as a curse, or to end their persecution at the hands of humans.  Rogue (Anna Paquin), for one, wants nothing more than to lose her powers.  She can't ever touch another human without harming them; her touch sucks the lifeforce out of others.  If the other person is a mutant, she temporarily acquires their powers, while she puts humans into comas.  Fearing that her boyfriend Bobby Drake/Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) may be straying from her to be with Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat (Ellen Page), who he can actually kiss, she begins to wonder what life would be like as a human.<br />Eventually, the movie culminates in a huge battle on Alcatraz Island, which is definitely the most epic sequence in the entire series.  While it is very good, there are a few times when I had to roll my eyes (though there were moments like that throughout the film).  The ending of the movie seemed to wrap up most of the events and themes of the series, making an effective trilogy (though I can't urge you enough to wait until the end of the credits to see a scene that reopens the franchise for a fourth film, which many insiders say is a possibility should The Last Stand do well in theaters).<br />This film is directed by Brett Ratner as opposed to Bryan Singer who directed the first two.  This was the source of all the controversy.  Due to some complications between Fox and Singer, he left the project to direct Superman Returns for Warner Brothers.  Fox then forced Ratner (who was not the first replacement) to get this film into theaters before Superman as a kind of "screw you" to Singer and Warner Brothers.  This, along with a few pre-release photos of Grammer as Beast and Jones as Juggernaut caused a lot of fans to be skeptical of what the final project could be.  Fortunately, in my opinion, the movie turned out well for everything that was standing in its way.  It had problems (as I said, there was some dialogue that merited some eye rolls) including a somewhat poor explanation for the Phoenix.  Cyclops is underused, but that is no different from Signer's installments.  Unfortunately, he has always been glossed over, which is sad, seeing as how he is a really great character in the comics.  Finally, there are just way too many characters.  Many of them get very little to do, and this goes for both new and returning charactesr.  Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster) does very little, Rogue doesn't even participate in the final fight, and many of the new Brotherhood mutants have one moment to shine then are forgotten.  But all in all, the movie worked pretty well.  The one thing I never understood is that Joss Whedon, the man who wrote the cure storyline in the comics and expressed a lot of interest for writing, and after Singer left, directing, was never even consdiered by Fox.  Oh well, everything turned out well in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>....love it and i hope you will too..<br /><br />The audience broke out in applause at least 10 times, though i must say X Men 3 the Last Stand does not follow any of the original storyline BY Marvel, but for those who are not the die hard fans it won't make a difference but hey I TAKE WHAT I CAN GET FROM THE MOVIE...<br /><br />I was so happy that they finally gave Ms. Berry something to do for a change even though there was no nightcrawler.

Like the first two movies, canon is altered, making Jean Grey's Phoenix force a dark part of her subconscious rather than a separate entity like in the comic series.

He even gets something like a performance out of Halle Berry, which is more than Singer ever managed. Shame about the terrible CGI make-up effects that make the `younger' Patrick Stewart look like a Final Fantasy character in the prologue though.<br /><br />Although some found the film a little too short, after looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, I'm not really sure if it is that possible to extend the movie without going the Spiderman 2.1 route and filming new scenes - most of them are alternate bet-hedging versions of scenes in the film (like the Rogue cured/not cured variations). But it's pretty rare to see a blockbuster people would actually like to be longer these days!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"X-Men: The Last Stand" introduces some provocative ideas and leaves us almost convinced that this will be the last X-Men movie for a long time. Mutants and humans are living in relative harmony, with Dr. Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammar), aka Beast, serving as Secretary of Mutant Affairs to a sympathetic U.S. President. The peace is shattered when a pharmaceutical company announces that it can produce a "cure" for the mutant-X gene, allowing Mutants to become normal homo sapiens if they so choose. The Mutant community is divided over whether this is a good thing, and assurances are given that the "cure" is entirely voluntary. Meanwhile, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) is discovered alive but no longer able to suppress the violence of her powers. Magneto (Ian McKellan) uses the "cure" controversy to incite Mutants against humans and plans to destroy the source of the drug.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" incorporates some elements from the X-Men comic that we haven't' seen before in the movies, such as the Danger Room and the Dark Phoenix storyline. New characters are Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Angel (Ben Foster), and Beast. Beast comes off pretty well. He, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and Magneto are the most developed characters, leaving the others to come and go in the periphery. There is too little of Mystique (Rebecca Romijn), as always. The debate over whether or not Mutants should take the "cure" is interesting. But the film's view of using the "cure" as a weapon is morally confused. Perhaps that is deliberate, but it's unsatisfying. I rate "X3" the same as the previous films in terms of story, characters, and action. But this film's themes are a little more contentious.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): There are 24 deleted scenes available with optional commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. There are 2 trailers for X3, Trailer A (1 ? min) and Trailer B (2 ? min), along with trailers for other films. There are 2 audio commentaries. The first audio commentary by director Brett Ratner and writers Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn is conversational and often joking. It takes us through the story with some technical details and comments on structure. The 2nd audio commentary by producers Avi Arad, Lauren Shuler Donner, and Ralph Winter is more informative, addressing visual effects, locations, tone, story, actors, elements from the comic books, and other technical issues. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I have seen all the movies that have been put out by Marvel over the last 6 years or so and was never a big fan of the X-Men films though the first 2 were passable.  This movie has way too many characters in it!  Some of the characters are pathetic looking such as the Juggernaut and The Beast (who looks and sounds like they dyed a gorilla costume from the Planet of the Apes movies).  They waited to the last installment to introduce The Beast and the Angel who were original X-Men in the comics (X-Men was never a popular title until they changed the line-up adding Wolverine and Storm along with others).<br /><br />There is just too much going on for the viewer to grasp the entire plot unless you were intricately familiar with the comic stories.  The scene where Magneto rips and moves a large section of the Golden Gate Bridge was ridiculous.  The movie seemed to also rip off the humans being disolved into a sand-like substance by The Phoenix from the War of the Worlds movie (sans the clothes that remain after they disolve).<br /><br />The last scene of the movie sets it up for a sequel though I don't know if my head can stand another two hours of overdone special effects with too many characters (as much as the Fantastic Four was panned it was a lot easier to watch with only four heroes and one villian to focus on)!</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>A fitting end (so it would appear) to a very good series.  Last Stand lacks some of the fun the first two X-Men movies, but it's still a top-notch comic book film.  As with the previous two, Last Stand is among the best of the Marvel comics books-to-movies.  In this series, though, it's the weakest of the three.<br /><br />Could there be more X-Men movies?  Sure.  But with Magneto (and Rogue) made human (non-mutant), Professor X, Jean Grey and Scott Summers dead, it would be a pretty bad idea to make a 4th movie, unless the remaining X-Men were teamed with other heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, etc.)<br /><br />It was well-acted and scripted.  Parents, if you're concerned about language, there was some mild cursing.  Otherwise, kids will like it alot.  It will probably disappoint the hardcore comic book fans.<br /><br />Last Stand is definitely worth the price of theater admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>To say that seing "X-Men: The Last Stand" was never-racking for a giant fan of the first two chapters in the mutant saga was putting it lightly.  The departure of cerebral director Bryan Singer for the sledgehammer simplicity of Brett Ratner did not bode well for the franchises' future.  Thrown in the fact that the writers of "X2" left with Singer and Zak Penn (Inspector Gadget) and Simon Kinberg (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) replaced them, and the thematic weight, intelligence and character development that made the first two "X-Men" movies so satisfying looked as if it was going to be severely handicapped.  Sadly, that is just what happened.<br /><br />"The Last Stand" did start off with promising premise:  A pharmaceutical company run by a mutant-phobe (Michael Murphy) creates a way to suppress the mutant genes in all the world's mutants.  Marketed as a benevolent cure, the X-Men (Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier, Halle Berry as Storm and newcomer Kelsey Grammar doing unexpectedly great work as the warmly intellectual Beast) and all their fellow mutants have to grapple with the ethical implications and consequences that the cure presents.  What would a person, mutant or otherwise, do if they had the power to remove genetic differences they had with an accepted norm and avoid the possible persecution that comes with beng an outsider?  However, the nefarious Magneto (an ever-superb Ian McKellen) sees the cure as a way to subdue and eradicate the mutant population.  The X-Men, caught in the middle between the humans and Magneto's growing army of disaffected and threatened Mutants, have to step up and fight in a desparate end-game.<br /><br />But the promise and potential of the premise is wasted.  The question of the cure is raised, but it is never plumbed for thematic richness, and in the end, it is simply used as a weapon to deliver visceral, shallow thrills.  Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg do their plot no favors by throwing in the saga of Jean Grey as the ressurected Phoenix (Famke Jansen), and way too many new characters.  None of the story's nourishing sub-plots or supporting characters are germinated or allowed to mature, and the emotional impact of the movie is blunted by the overdose of too much mutant mayhem, plot and chaos.  Even the deaths of three major characters inspire only indifference.  The action may be incredibly and visually impressive (no sequence moreso than Magneto's rerouting of the Golden Gate Bridge) but Ratner, Penn and Kinberg do not understand that action holds weight only when the audience can give a damn about the figures involved.  Ratner and co. squandered much of the goodwill leftover from Bryan Singer, and even though a ton of money will be made off of the "Last Stand," audiences will hesitate a long time before even considering seeing an "X4."</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Brett Ratner (Rush Hour 1-3) keeps true to the look of the other films and he can handle action and big special effects. Still, he's a lot more careless than Bryan Singer. He goes for a no one is safe approach and kills off some main characters. He also wanted to introduce new mutants, which is why he killed off some people and why Night Crawler is no where to be seen. Kelsey Grammer is at least a good addition to the cast as Beast and same with Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. Vinnie Jones isn't a bad Juddernaught as well. He's the best new villain, but all the other villains that Ratner introduced though are undeveloped and just wear leather and look like porn stars lol. So half of them I didn't even know if they were from the comics or not since we don't even get their names.<br /><br />  While there's no going back with how bad it is with what they did with Cyclops. James Marsden was punished for choosing to be in Superman Returns but they all punished fans as well. While Famke Janssen who was excellent in X-2 is just wasted here with a blank stare and barely any lines as Dark Phoenix. Halle Berry who always demanded that Storm had more to do since...she's an Oscar winner got her wish though. Cyclops gets pushed back as leader just so we get more of her. Meanwhile someone needs to crush her ego by reminding her that she was in CatWoman. She was never even right for the part of Storm. It's Jenssen who actually deserved more to do as Jean Grey.<br /><br />  As a last film the movie doesn't work as well since it hints to things to come in the credits. Which is why it bugs me when some fans say, hey there's still origin movies coming out. I just want to know what happens next. We already have a good idea to what happened with Wolverine before the X-men movies. Same with Magneto who also has an origin movie coming out. I'm not sure how they could clean up the mess that Ratner made with this film with a part 4 but I'd still like to Singer come back and try. He at least loves and respects the characters enough not to kill them off.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>After having seen the midnight showing in my town, and having mulled over in my mind what I thought about the film, I have this to say one simple statement.  I liked it.<br /><br />Yes, many purist fans will shirk at the lack of depth in some of the new characters introduced; however, all in all the film did what so many films fail to do these days, entertain throughout.<br /><br />Just to give a little initial background plot, as you probably know by now a lot of the focus is on Jean and the Phoenix.  Well, actually a ton of the movie focuses on this, and not giving anything away, but basically all the climactic events deal with Jean/The Phoenix.  Intriguingly enough though, she's given a very small role at least as far as speaking goes.<br /><br />Instead, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) take the lead roles, as they advance their characters slightly in depth, but heavily in status.  Don't worry though if if you want and expected fresh faces, because the filmmakers also leave plenty of time for looking at, but not learning about, the newcomers.  Also to mention, the youngest X-Men Rogue, Bobby (Iceman), and Kitty have somewhat of a sub-plot love triangle.<br /><br />Back to the plot though, because all those characters center on the story that a supposed-cure has been released for mutant hood.  This is obviously a very divisive issue, as it widens Magneto and Xavier separation even more, while threatening the already fragile make-up of the X-men themselves.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the movie did have some flaws, as it seemed to want to provide too much in too short a time, while having to glaze over any kind of legitimate character development, (except for some for the Phoenix).  Still, if you were a fan of the old ones, or just like good, entertaining superhero-type films, then you're sure to like X3.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>I saw the first X-Men movie, missed the second one, and just saw this one.  I'm not a huge fan of the comic books so any complaints that others have about the weak characters doesn't apply to me.  I still think Halle Berry is a pretty flat actress so the fact that Storm had such a huge role in this movie was a big drawback for me.  But other than that, I thought it was good. It was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through, which is all I was looking for.  If you're a huge fan of the whole X-Men franchise, I've heard from friends who are Marvel devotees that this one was a disappointment.  However, if you're just looking for a night in with a good movie I think you'll be pleasantly entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>ok, i first want to say that even before i went to see the movie i knew it wasen't going to be as good as the first two X-men movies but walking in i was fairly surprised. the film in my opinion, wasent half bad. Ratner actually gives his best film. i do agree that the plot should have been more developed and some of the story lines were ignored but from what Ratner did, he actually does a nice job. the world of the mutants is under attack again when a major pharmacutical company anounces a 'cure' for the mutant gene. supressing it perminantly. this causes a split in the mutant world, for some like Rouge it would mean living a normal life but for some it means that the humans want to snub out the mutants for good. and the one person who belives this is Magneto. gathering an army to storm the place were they make the cure and once again its up to Xavier, Wolverine, and the others to stop him. since this is supposidly the last in the series, there are many deaths and some of the characters are left open for spin-offs. all in all, not as good as the first two but still an enjoyable ride. i also loved that Kitty was given a bigger role then the first two. thats why i liked it a little bit more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>A cure has been found for the "disease" of having mutative genes and this cure is offered to any mutant desirous of being normal. Very quickly, this becomes a hot-button issue for non-mutants and mutants alike as the all-important question surfaces: does being a mutant constitute being diseased? Magneto, not only a mutant advocate but one who believes that mutants are the superior life form on earth, vehemently wants nothing of the cure and, in fact, seeks to annihilate the root of the cure - that being a little boy named Jimmy (Leech), himself a mutant who nullifies other mutants' powers. Magneto also continues to gather his power base, from which to wage his ongoing war against the "lesser" humanity. Simultaneous to these events, Jean Grey returns, but oh so terribly altered. She is now styled the (Dark) Phoenix and her psychic and telekinetic powers have increased exponentially and are controlled by an amoral persona. The ever beleaguered X-Men find themselves at a crossroad. Due to a catastrophic tragedy, the Xavier School for Gifted Students is in dire jeopardy of closing. Further, The X-Men are divided with the issue of the cure. Some, like Storm, believe there is nothing wrong with being a mutant. Some, like Rogue, just wants to fit in. But in the end, the X-Men must once more band together and protect humanity from Magneto's assaults.<br /><br />X-Men - The Last Stand pulls no punches. Key characters bite the big one in this possibly final installment, raising the angst level (as if it needed it) to new heights. X-Men has always been the comic book standard bearer for social issues and racial dynamics and this second sequel begs the question: what qualifies as humanity? And in comic book reality, with the supposition that mutants are real, as a "normal", how does one differentiate between persecution and self-preservation? Weighty matters for those who want to delve a little deeper. Me, I watch X-Men for the cool special effects.<br /><br />And what of the special effects? They are expertly awesome. The movie screen seems to show something impossible every 2 minutes and yet, these scenes are conveyed with fantastic realism. If a man could fly, if a woman could control the weather, if a man could manipulate metal - well, this is how it would look.<br /><br />I so enjoyed this movie, from start to finish. The principal actors have had 2 prior films to get to know their roles and by this third outing, they embody their characters with easy conviction. The movie's focus is again firmly on Wolverine and why not, as he's got his own film lined up? But Prof. Xavier, Storm, Magneto and Jean Grey are also given decent camera time. Secondary roles of import are Hank McCoy (the Beast), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat). The cast of X-Men, the Brotherhood and other mutants is so large that short thrift is given to many characters. I wish more time had been devoted to Angel, Colossus, Mystique and Rogue. And I thought Multiple Man was a good guy? And where's Nightcrawler?<br /><br />Things to look for:  Magneto's awesome levitation of a massive bridge; the erudite Beast finally unleashed; that old staple, the Colossus/Wolverine fastball; Iceman vs. Pyro; and my personal favorite, Kitty Pryde takes on the unstoppable Juggernaut.<br /><br />Here's hoping that there's a fourth X-Men and that Gambit and/or Longshot are in it.<br /><br />Helpful hint: stick around until after the closing credits, there's more movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>This latest installment of the X-men saga made me feel like I was getting in after the movie had already started.  A vital ingredient was missing--a central character whose development was key to the plot.  There were a lot of characters but we really didn't spend much time with any one of them.<br /><br />The result was a somewhat flat action film.  Yes, there was a struggle that needed to be resolved but it really was not amplified enough.  The ongoing metaphor of mutants as the marginalized citizens of our society still worked.  The action scenes were fine, we just were not made to care a lot about how things resolved.  Too bad--many talented actors put time into this movie.  With a little script tweaking it could have suceeded!</p></br><a href="../users/A9LNWA25IM2DX.html">A9LNWA25IM2DX</a><br/><p>I am not going to talk about the movie as the star I am giving it is to the DVD release of this film.<br /><br />Yeah, two different version are released, the regular and the so called 'Stan Lee's edition'<br /><br />My problem? Both editions contain a single DVD. This movie was released in region 4 in Mexico weeks before it hit the shelves in the US in a far superior 2 DVD boxed set. Yeah, you read correctly, the first DVD contains the movie in the same edition as this one with the deleted scenes and the second DVD is loaded with interviews, trailers, animatics, documentaries (including Brett Rattner's diaries and the 'Evolution of the trilogy') and extra features. The bonus disc is already produced and finished yet not released in the US.<br /><br />Get ready to buy within a couple months the 'X3.5' or whatever crappy name they give to this movie on a 2 disc edition.<br /><br />Since I have a multiregion DVD player I am going to get the region 4 edition and then edit my review here. Thought fans of the movie and the comics should be aware of this before buying to decide which edition is better for them to collect.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>Although, lets be honest, it couldn't have been any worse now, could it?<br /><br />But let's not focus on the negative.<br /><br />Here's why it's a better film:<br /><br />- It has a better plot<br /><br />- It actually puts the mutants through some pain for a change (after two films of seeing them dance rings around humanity, they, like the characters from the truly awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1MTZE">The Complete Matrix Trilogy (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions) [HD DVD</a>], never really seemed to be in any great peril. Not so with this film. A weapon that can definitively rob them of their mutant natures levels the playing field).<br /><br />- It injects some moral ambiguity into the plot; you can tell that Ian McKellen (himself a legendary gay activist in the UK) relishes the chance to explore the concept of a cure for a condition (read 'orientation') that can mold one's identity whilst simultaneously making them a societal outcast in some quarters. Kudos to McKellen's performance - I actually found myself rooting for Magneto's brotherwood to prevail.<br /><br />Brett Ratner clearly feels less affection for the characters than Bryan Singer and in this case, that's no bad thing. I don't mind a director loving his characters as long he's not prepared to let that get in the way of the plot - something that Singer always did. I'll be honest, I wrote off the X-Men films after seeing the first two, but this one actually caused me to go out and hire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO1Q">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a> the night after I saw this on television.<br /><br />Also major props to Ellen Page. She really is a talented young thing.<br /><br />Its not the greatest film ever made, but it is a road-sign to better things.<br /><br />Now can we have some proper "Sentinels" in number four, please?</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>When I sat down to watch this movie, I wasn't expecting much.  Reviews from this movie release turned me off from seeing it even though I enjoyed the first two installments.  To my surprise, this was actually a very good movie...as far as superheroes go.  Sure, I was stunned by Professor X's and Cyclops early departure, especially since it comes at the hands Gray/Phoenix.  I was surprise that Wolverwine doesn't exhibit any guilt.  If he hadn't set Phoenix loose in the first place, none of this would have happened.  Berry's Storm as usual was boring, Rogue, I always thought was a boring mutant.  Honestly, I thought the boy was going to be the answer to curing Phoenix, since no one's powers work around him, but it doesn't seem that answer occured to anyone.  So we bring Gray back just to kill her again.  I love the explanation to how she returned: "I don't know".  Alrighty then.  Why not just have her say "because the screenwriters said so"?  Still, this was an entertaining installment BUT it definitely needs to end here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>This movie was ok, it was good overall, I mean the twist and people in the characters that was affected, blew me away, but then again Im not a heavy die hard X-men fan, but i do like 'em.  I will say this movie was good, kept my attention and i was like jaw dropping, and in awe when certain things happen (dont want to give it away) I thought this was a good movie, but as for one part of the movie, i was like "What the blue heeba buh jeeba is going on?" lol but it kept me wanting MORE!! It was like "Oh my, what's next?"  Great film in that aspect, but I recommend this!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'X-men,' I thought reading reviews, would be like a high-tech sci-fi "Calvin Ball".  That is I thought the evolution of the movie's rules and causality would change by whim.  Instead, we get a "rock/ paper/ scissors" approach.  Each superhero has their own connecting powers, like one has fire and another has ice.  In this installment, the mutants find there is a cure for their powers, which some make into a crusade, others a curse.  There is a societal divide; one that breaks out with signs and protestors, but, unfortunately, like real life, it is too often resolved with violence.  (Will this be the fate of stem cell research, and was this something they had in mind for the movie's theme?)  Anyway, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Phoenix (Famke Jensen) have a consequential love affair that has global--or at least environmental--consequences.  The visual effects throughout are stunning and Storm (played skillfully by Halle Berry) and others give us capable performances for the plot's urgency.  Stately figures like Magneto (Ian McKlellen) and Sir Henry (Kelsey Grammer) give some weightiness to the story's edge.  Interesting and eye-popping, 'X-Men- The Last Stand' is impressive--even for a "newbie" like me.  Storm leaves us with words to live by at slain Professor X's funeral, "We live in an age of darkness--a world full of hate, fear, and intolerance. In every age there are those who try to fight it." In 'X-Men- The Last Stand' they do it in style.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Learning how to keep an audience enthralled is one of the essential curves for good cinema. For me, it's all about the characters. Always has been, always will be. And on many levels, this third installment in the X-Men movie series succeeds.<br /><br />After having watched Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) die in the second film, I felt that the series directors, screenwriters, producers, etc., were beginning to understand what audiences need. But then we have Dr. Grey return in X-Men: The Last Stand. The emptiness of her passing was now miraculously refilled as we learn that Jean is not in control of her faculties. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had previously held Jean's mind in check by separating her destructive side from her more controllable one. Jean was (is) a level five mutant, one with unlimited power. But with that power comes a fractured mind. Something called "The Phoenix" (uh-boy, not that name again) lives inside Jean's head and refuses to be reigned in. A path of destruction and death reels before Jean as The Phoenix part of her mind takes control.<br /><br />Against this we have the discovery (by humans, of course) of a "cure" for the mutant gene. This cure lives (naturally) inside the body of a little mutant boy who's kept out of harms way at a new facility that rests on old Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.<br /><br />Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees this as a threat to everything he stands for. It's only a matter of time, he believes, until the government makes it mandatory for all mutants to be "cured" of their "disease".<br /><br />A personal, social, governmental, and worldwide movement begins on three fronts. First is Magneto's group of mutants who want this "cure" threat destroyed before it falls into the wrong hands. Secondly, we have the government who says that the vaccinations are strictly voluntary and want to protect the child/cure. And in-between them we have the X-Men. Battling amongst themselves as much as any external threats, we begin to see the extreme price the X-Men are willing to pay in order for peace.<br /><br />New mutants abound in this third film. First, we have something called "The Beast" (Kelsey Grammer), a blue cowardly lion with anger management issues that acts as a Presidential aide between mutants and humans. I don't know why, but I half expected to see Lilith from Cheers come stomping in and pull him out of a scene by his ear. Go figure. Secondly, we have The Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), a bulky ...um ...guy who gets rolling and can't be stopped. And finally, we see Angel (Ben Foster), a winged boy whose inability to accept the "cure" ends up saving someone very close to him.<br /><br />Although this film is subtitled "The Last Stand", I seriously doubt if it'll be "The Last Film." An end scene with a "cured" Magneto opens up an entirely new miasma of questions: Does the cure really work? Or is Magneto immune? Will mutants need to be re-vaccinated every so often? I feel pretty confident that X-Men movie aficionados haven't seen the last of Wolverine or Storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>The Last Stand is decisively the weakest film in the X-Men `Trilogy'. Director Bryan Singer was replaced by Brett Ratner, who, like Singer, never made a sci-fi film before; but while Singer took a restrained and dramatic approach to the genre, Ratner behaves more like a child with a new toy and plays the high-budget special effects to excess. Dramatically, The Last Stand is not as convincing as the first two parts; it does continue the action/soap opera combination that characterized the first two films - as well as the X-Men comics - but the romantic side, namely the love interest between Wolverine and Jean Grey, fails to deliver. Hugh Jackman gives a performance that is hardly as strong as in the first two films, and other than Ian McKellen - clearly the best actor in the whole trilogy - who does as breathtaking a job as he always does - there are no characters here that are very interesting by their own right.<br /><br />That's another major problem the film suffers from - there are way too many new characters, and very few of them are interesting enough, even if most of them are well-cast. That same problem was apparent in the first film, which introduces all the main characters in a very short span of time; what made the second installment the best one was that it focused mainly on a tight group of main characters, leaving more room for drama. Iceman, Juggernaut (a wasted performance by the fantastic Vinnie Jones), Callisto, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Pyro and the rest are half-baked characters, mainly in it for the action scenes; Angel - who was marketed as one of the lead characters - has a remarkably small side bit. The only new character that really made a mark was Hank McCoy AKA Beast - played, in a bit of casting genius, by Kelsey Grammer.<br /><br />But all complaints and grievances taken into account, although the film is not very strong dramatically, and has serious pacing problems with scenes that drag out with not enough action to balance them - when the action does come it's spectacular. The final battle of the film is the most impressive action scene in the trilogy, thirty minutes of beautifully shot and choreographed mayhem and destruction. It's a credit to Ratner that he took very bold decisions of letting a large number of main characters die, making a sequel - although possible - very unlikely; and he really let go and went all the way with the carnage, making this final scene a feast to the eyes. This is where the large number of new characters finally makes itself worthwhile, and for any fan of sci-fi and high-effect action this scene is a pleasure.<br /><br />The Last Stand is not as good a film as the first two X-Men's, but it's a very well made action film. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love it. If it's drama you're after, you'll be less impressed, but there's still McKellen, always a pleasure to observe, who plays a stronger part here than in X2. A worthy conclusion to the X-Men trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>X3 was one of the movies I was looking forward to seeing this year and I was somewhat pleased.  There were many ups, but some downs that almost ruined the movie.<br /><br />So the pros.  The acting was nicely done, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and others did an above and beyond performance given the stigma of bad acting in Marvel pictures (ie: Fantastic Four).  I was very pleased with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine as he assumed command during critical parts of the movie.<br /><br />As to the plot, the movie started out somewhat slow as events built up, then sped up dramatically and ended just as quickly.  It almost seemed as though the entire movie was being built up for this one final 15-minute showdown.  It was somwhat disapointing.  The plot also killed more main characters than a Quentin Terrentino movie as main heroes were almost being picked off from beginning to end, one by one.<br /><br />Lastly on the plot... I don't think X3 was meant as the finishing movie for the X-Men franchise.  The ending (like many trilogies try to do) sets you up for a sequel as Magneeto's ending has a cliffhanger and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS to see another one with another main character.  I think Stan Lee is setting us up for a sequel... and I was disapointed with how it was done.<br /><br />One of the other things I wish the director did was allow more time for character developement.  There were two characters I never caught the name of... until I read reviews online.  The two characters being Calypso and that girl that walked through walls... forgot her name again.  Also, there was no clarification on Wolverine's past.  Granted I watched the series, read the comics etc, etc and I know a little, but I think it would've been nice for the general audience.<br /><br />Then there's the consistency errors.  Any fans of the series knows that Juggarnut is technically NOT a mutant but apperantly he was taken down because his "powers" were leeched.  I was pleased, however, to see the producers remembered that Hank (Beast) likes to read upsidedown and to include the Danger Room.<br /><br />Pertaining to the visuals... nothing but impressive and the display of mutant powers was incredible.  I have officially dubbed Storm as the Sith Lord of the X-Men world... watch how she deals with her nemisis in the showdown to see what I mean.  They also showed the true form of Iceman, which was also nice and even Pyro's weapons.  For fans, this'll defintely make things more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The one real thing I wish was they had more Angel sequences since he was one of the first characters introduced in the introduction... and of course... I WANT GAMBIT!!  I don't care if Stan Lee says he's a shallow character, Gambit is awesome.<br /><br />All in all, an 85% and a solid movie to boot.  One worthy of my movie collection when it comes out on DVD.  The general audience, families and fanboys alike will enjoy this film if they STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>Never before have I waited with so much breathless anticipation for a film to be so utterly disappointed.  The premise of "X-3" held so much promise and yet failed to deliver anything of substance beyond some impressive looking, yet still somehow bland, battle sequences.  Without giving away details, the death of certain important characters pass by producing a lack of emotional response from an audience that should more properly be devastated, not merely thinking "Gee . . . what a bummer."<br /><br />The manner in which the Dark Phoenix was presented was mind numbingly bad.  Astonishingly bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  (Did I mention it was bad?)  Instead of the soul tortured Jean returning and unleashing her demonic powers, we have Famke Jannsen with contact lensed googly eyes while it looks like she's being poked from behind with a cattle prod.  Yeah, there's some intense drama for you.<br /><br />The only real "fun" in the movie (if it can be called that) is watching the increasingly insane behavior of Magneto.  Ian McKellen almost realizes there's no way to play this but waaaaay over the top . . . and thank God, for him.<br /><br />As Beast, Kelsey Grammer makes a brilliant debut to the X-series, however not even he can charm his way through some of the most inane dialogue written - even for a comic book movie.  Still, Grammer's Beast is wicked cool!<br /><br />The dialogue throughout seems to have been written by high school fans and shows remarkably little respect for the intelligence of either the films characters, or the audience cajoled into watching this mess.  One perfect example of this occurs when, as preparing to battle Magneto and his enormous forces, Iceman tells Wolverine something like "But there's only a handful of us against all of them" to which Wolverine responds "I'm not going to lie to you. We are outnumbered."  Oh, really?<br /><br />Jackman is always fun and his Wolverine remains probably the coolest character to make the transition from comic book to screen, but he figures too prominently here - and even he can't save this mess.<br /><br />Its runtime of just over 90 minutes doesn't help either - everything blurs together too quickly with little time for development, which means little empathy from the audience.  See it if you have to, but be forewarned, X-III falls flat like a badly, took-quick cooked souffl&eacute;.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>X-Men has delivered the first time, then again, and again!  This time out they push the envelope even further, and keep you glued to your seat watching enthusiastically wondering what is going to happen next!  I loved the previous 2 X-Men movies, and bought them up quick.  I guarantee I will be buying the third for my collection as well.  The effects are top-notch, and this movie was full of emotions.  It had action, intrigue, sorrow, romance, suspense, everything a moviegoer could want.  I won't ruin the ending for you, but can say that a few important questions get answered in this movie, and it is very powerful all the way to the end.  If you are a comic book fan or an action movie fan, buying this movie is a no-brainer.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Fans gasped when it was announced that X-MEN and X2 director Bryan Singer was leaving X-MEN III to make SUPERMAN RETURNS - and he was taking his crew with him. Singer told 20th Century Fox that, if they would wait until he completed SUPERMAN RETURNS, he would make X-MEN III as well. Fox decided to go ahead without Singer, bringing numerous directors on to the project before settling on Brett Ratner. This worried fans ever more, as they realized that Ratner's previous films included RUSH HOUR, MONEY TALKS, and THE FAMILY MAN. What many fans forgot is that Ratner also directed the superb RED DRAGON. Personally, I was optimistic. Ratner's work on both RUSH HOUR movies and on RED DRAGON had impressed me, and I thought that he could do a nice job on the film.<br /><br />I was right - sort of. Ratner does a fine job, but he tends to favor shots that are either very close or very far away. Because of this, he creates a sort of claustrophobic feeling which hung with me throughout the film. Also, he can't wring great performances out of the actors like Bryan Singer can. On the plus side, Ratner does create some stunning visuals (with lots of help from the special effects team) - namely a sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge. Though Ratner is potentially a very good director, he is nowhere near as talented as Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Three other new additions to the crew are screenwriters Simon Kinberg (MR. & MRS. SMITH) and Zak Penn (BEHIND ENEMY LINES, ELEKTRA) and composer John Powell (THE BOURNE IDENTITY). The script is good, though it feels like the events in the film are rather rushed. Perhaps editors Mark Goldblatt, Mark Helfrich, and Julia Wong - taking over for John Ottman - are to blame for this. I also noticed that some of Wolverine's lines seemed forced; they didn't seem natural like those from the previous films. I must say that the ending, however, is very clever. Very clever indeed.<br /><br />Then we come to the matter of the soundtrack. John Powell's music fluctuated between being grand and atrocious. It's a sweeping score, but it seems a little too over-the-top. It's not as good as John Ottman's score for X2 or Michael Kamen's score for X-MEN, but it will suffice.<br /><br />The cast seemed far less stellar this time. At her request, Halle Berry's part was expanded. Though I've always thought that Storm was an interesting character - and Berry did very well as her in the first two films - her performance seems rather weak in this film. Hugh Jackman is still excellent as Wolverine, but even his performance isn't as wonderful as it was in the previous films. Then we have Ian McKellen, who is just outstanding as Magneto. He shines in each and every one of his scenes. Famke Janssen is great, although she doesn't get many lines. Also great is Kelsey Grammer as Hank McCoy (a.k.a. Beast), Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, and especially Vinnie Jones (LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, SNATCH.) as Juggernaut. Juggernaut is a hulking character whose special ability is plowing through everything and everyone with no difficulty whatsoever. Jones turns Juggernaut into an extremely amusing character. His scenes are the most fun of any in the film.<br /><br />As both a comic book fan and an avid moviegoer, I enjoyed this film very much. However, the comic fan within me wishes that we'd learnt the origins of Hank McCoy (which I've also found very interesting) and seen Gambit, one of the major X-Men characters from the comics (LOST's Josh Holloway, a perfect choice, was offered the part but turned it down). Though it does seem rushed and a little short (it clocks in at 106 minutes, compared to X2's 133 minutes), I had a ball throughout the movie. I'd have liked to see Joss Whedon or Matthew Vaughn as director (both of whom were attached to the project at one time), but Brett Ratner did a good job. X-MEN: THE LAST STAND isn't up to par with Bryan Singer's X-MEN and X2, but it's a fine film nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In the last 5 years one genre has returned from almost certain death to become one of Hollywood's most lucrative source for movie material, that genre is that of the superhero, or comic book genre as it is commonly referred to.  Several franchises have been successfully established within this revived genre, some standouts would be the 'Spiderman' movies, "Fantastic Four", "Batman Begins", and the 'Blade' trilogy.  One franchise has stood out from all the others by taking the focus of the comic book film away from being only on a few key characters, instead focused on an entire team of heroes.  This set of movies is of course the 'X-Men' franchise.  After 2 highly successful trips to the box office with "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United" (both with Bryan Singer at the helm), Fox Studios decided to return to the world of mutants to wrap up their superhero trilogy.  With this decision made the execs at Fox immediately began working on deals with the cast and with director Bryan Singer; the entire cast returned for this supposed 'final' installment into the 'X-Men' franchise, but sadly director Bryan Singer was enticed to jump ship and head to Warner Brothers to direct another little-known superhero movie called "Superman Returns".  With the cast signed and the director M.I.A., Fox scrambled to find a replacement, leaving many to be skeptical about the quality of the film's script, because Bryan Singer had directed the first two movies and suddenly jumped ship, is it possible that the reason for this change of heart was because of a poorly written script?  The answer would, in the end, turn out to be no.  The reason Singer left the series he had started was simply that he had always wanted to direct a 'Superman' movie, and he had an opportunity that he couldn't pass up.  So to replace Singer, Fox chose veteran director Brett Ratner ("Rush Hour 1 & 2" and "Red Dragon").  The decision to have Ratner at the helm of such a high profile movie that was to serve as the final chapter in an incredible trilogy, caused many to be uneasy, especially since Ratner had at one point been picked by Warner Brothers to direct the newest 'Superman' movie, but in the end the movie was released and Ratner quickly showed all the nay-sayers that he was the right replacement for the job.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" begins with the creation of a new 'cure' for mutancy, allowing those beings with powers to choose whether they wanted to keep their powers and remain mutants or take the cure and become normal human beings.  This 'cure' quickly becomes a focus for the mutant race, and becomes central to the war that is brewing between Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellan) 'Brotherhood of Mutants' and Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men.  With mutants being divided as to how to choose regarding the topic of the cure, the battle lines are quickly being drawn, and the war is about to begin!<br /><br />Brett Ratner chose wisely (in my opinion) to not focus on a story dealing solely with the 'cure' for mutants, but mixing it with the ramifications of the resolution to "X2: X-Men United" when Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) became the 'Phoenix'.  This provided some very intense moments for the cast especially for Hugh Jackman's character Wolverine, as he is being forced to choose whether to fight against the woman he loves, possessed as she is by the Phoenix, or allow her to destroy the only people he's ever been able to call friends and family, the X-Men.  The cast, as they have been in the previous installments, was amazing, even the newcomers Kelsey Grammer (Beast), Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut) and Ben Foster (Angel) fit right in, as if they'd been members of the cast since the first movie.  The action, I would have to say, is the most intense out of all the 'X-Men' movies, it is so intense and fast-paced that you actually have to see everything more than once to fully take it all in.  The special effects work is by far the best out of the franchise as well, not that the first 2 movies were anything to sneeze at, but the moving of the Golden Gate Bridge alone is worth the price of admission.  Many critics, and even some fans, felt that the movie lacked in story, and that the film should have focused solely on Jean Grey becoming the Dark Phoenix, as I said before I disagree with this sentiment on the grounds that there have been two previous films to establish all the backstory needed, making more room for bigger and more explosive action than you had seen prior.  Generally speaking a trilogy's third part serves as a tying up of all the loose ends that had been left over from previous installments and to really up the stakes for the main characters, and in this "X-Men: The Last Stand" succeeds in a most impressive way!  Could there have been more story, sure there's always room for more, but it doesn't hurt the movie by not having the extra exposition, in fact it made the movie feel tighter because it was simply building off of the previous two and not really looking to expand the story all that much, but really just trying to wrap things up, which is the point of a final part in a trilogy.  But no matter what I say or any other critics say about this movie, in the end it's all about what you think of the movie, agree or disagree, it's your opinion that matters on whether you like the movie or not, we're just here to help by providing our feedback.  So, sit back, relax, and enjoy this 'final' installment in the 'X-Men' movie franchise.<br /><br />"X-Men: The Last Stand" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Never a fan of the comic book hero outings, this viewer watched X-MEN - THE LAST STAND with a bit of mental prejudice: action heroes capable of destroying everything in sight at the glance of a weird eye or the motion of a hand have just never seemed entertaining.  But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.<br /><br />Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc.  But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!).  So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects.  It is rather entertaining...for a while.

There's a wealth of charactors, we tried to fit "Angel" into three movies and as you know this is the first time we got him in!" ..... So as you can see ... dont worry there will be many more X-Men films for you to enjoy in the future!<br /><br />So as a whole this was a really fun ride that with held by far the best special-effects of the series BUT, I cant lie and tell you that this movie is great or even as good as the first film (it is better than the 2nd..) because it really isnt, the story line is actually quite basic, the acting as I am sure you guessed is most definatly up to par and the direction overall is decent if not better, "The Last Stand" is truly a smart, fun and cool way to start off you movie watching summer!<br /><br />P.S. By the way I just saw the numbers for what the film made on its opening weekend - it made a huge amount of just over 120,000,000$ dollars! that puts it on pace to easily pass all the other suppossed summer Box Office Hits such as, Mission Impossible 3, The Da Vinci Code, Over the Hedge & Poseidon!<br /><br />Overall: B</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>I *really* liked X-Men 2. I wasn't such a fan of the first movie, but I did appreciate that the writers and producers couldn't cram ALL of the characterisation and development of the characters into one two-and-a-bit hour movie - and it was a pretty decent first effort, as franchise sci-fi goes.<br /><br />This movie, on the other hand, is just pretty flat, all things considered. And, even though it weighs in at a hefty running time and contains a number of potentially very entertaining plot elements, it's still just... well, just plain flat.<br /><br />The problem occurs with the script: Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn's screenplay contains surprisingly little dialogue; most of the movie feels like a segue from one special effects sequence to another. In an age where it's so obvious on a movie screen as to what's real and what's not, one would have thought that the writers might have focused a little more on the characters that have kept Marvel fans loyal for the last almost-fifty years. Alas no, and what we're sadly left with is a thin and perfunctory sort of movie, where the characters, at least via their characterisation, come across as two-dimensional and wooden.<br /><br />Acting's pretty average - Ian McKellen in Magneto's more powerful scenes looks like he's suffering from 'Mommie Dearest' syndrome, Patrick Stewart isn't given enough to do, and Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry do great jobs at looking either A. Angry or B. Blank. The one high point on the acting front for me was Kelsey Grammer in the role of Beast - during the penultimate battle scenes he comes across as a whole and likeable sort of character, compared to Jackman's incessant grunting or Berry's woeful whining.<br /><br />And that was another big problem - with a credited cast of many, many people, why did this movie become the Hugh and Halle Show??<br /><br />All in all, this was a big disappointment. It will appeal to the rabid fanboy element, but for fans of action and science fiction, it's nowhere near the fleshed-out fullness of, say, 'Batman Begins' or 'Episode III'.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>I've watched it a few times now. Great plot, fantastic effects, but so far I have counted over 20 continuity errors, some major, some minor.<br /><br />Here's some samples: When Magneto and the doc are confronting Phoenix and it all hits the fan, the sliding doors are open. Next cut they are closed, and for the remainder of the scene. Yet when Wolfy is crawling along the ceiling towards the doors, they are open, close, open, closed.  Really sloppy editing there!<br /><br />When Magneto moves the bridge, it's the middle of the day. When the bridge hits land, minutes later, it's night.  All the vehicles were abandoned (except one) and tossed around like crazy, especially when Magneto clears the path through the cars.  Yet whenever we see the same section of bridge in distance shots..... 1) all the cars are in nice, neat rows. 2) All the car's headlights lights are on.  Neither is possible in the context of the movie, even ignoring the fact that day became night in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />Logan gets two gut injuries from the horn tossin' dude.  He heals. So does his t-shirt - because in the next scene, the holes are missing.<br /><br />When Logan is getting abused by Magneto at Alcatraz, he switches position between cuts. While lying down. While pinned.<br /><br />The section of bridge broken away would not span the gap from the mainland to the island.<br /><br />Those are my favorites.  Can you find the rest?</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: The supposed final installment in the X-Men trilogy opened to some amazing numbers, but the overall experience was less than spectacular. Sure it was entertaining with some amazing visual effects, but it was just very plain and did not exceed or offer anything new. The movie never felt like it was going anywhere, I never felt a sense of progression or a sense of accomplishment by the time it ended. We all know the story, Magneto continues to lead an army of mutants against humanity to prevent them from mass producing a cure to the mutant gene. The objective is to infilitrate Alcatraz Island and kill the boy who they are harvesting the ingrediants from that are necessary to making the vaccine. The movie is a short 1 hour and 45 minutes, and the pacing is incredibly horrible. We open with a flashback where Xavier and Magneto go to recruit Jean Grey to the school. Here we see the very creepy and digitally altered faces of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen so that they seem young since it is a flashback. The digital age reversal was obvious and was the only CGI work that I found awkward. The rest of the movie tries to create character relations between Jean Gray and Wolverine, but fails miserably. The whole film is incredibly hallow and empty, there is no substance to it. That is one noticeable difference that we see from Brett Ratner taking the director's chair. 20th Century Fox didn't want to wait for Bryan Singer since he was doing Superman, so they wen't along with the production and hired Ratner. Why couldn't they wait is beyond me, it wouldn't have affected box office performance, Memorial Day Weekend is an overrated movie weekend in my opinion. So, with no interesting character relations we are left with a very disorganized and melodramatic action movie. The visual effects and the make-up in the film were astounding, and so was John Powell's score. I thought that John Powell did a much better job with the music than John Ottman did. One huge thing that I caught in the movie that really bothered me was that there was a huge continuity error. It happened right after Magneto detached the Golden Gate Bridge and put it on Alcatraz. Right before he places the bridge down it is broad daylight. However, instantaneously we switch from day to night. There was no time transition or cutaway to signal a passage of time. It really bothered me that they let something like that slip into such a high profile film as this. So, instead of being an intelligent film about the intolerance of mankind, we now get a shallow and simplemined action film.<br /><br />ACTING: All the parts were overacted to a point where it became painful to listen to some lines. Some of the dialogue was delivered so poorly, and there were a few one-liners that lacked the punch they needed. Ian McKellen is the only strength of the film with Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart delivering good performances as well. The rest of the cast was just plain bad. Vinny Jones as Juggernaut was rediculous, and so was Kelsey Grammer as Beast. How Halle Berry won an Oscar still baffles me since she cannot act to save her life. Famke Janssen noticeably overacts as well, I mean how is she supposed to play two people if she is hardly able to handle just one. I blame the script for the acting problems given the poor dialogue.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: What kind of "Last Stand" was this? They left the end so wide open for another installment. Also, if you stay and watch the credits there is a bonus scene afterwards that also leaves the movie even wider open for another installment. They are already working on spin-offs of Wolverine and Magneto, so I really can't see Fox stopping with the main X-Men series since it's proven to be such a huge moneymaker. I really think this movie could have been so much better than it was. I don't know if Brett Ratner is the one to blame given the poor structure of the movie overall. His direction and vision was consistant and uniquely different from that of Singer's, but the movie falls short of being anything more than a bland summer action fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>The third act of this tragedy or drama is this time bringing the fight within the mutant community. The President of the USA, with his Secretary to Mutant Affairs who is not even informed, let alone associated, to the President's decisions on such a matter, has paid for the invention or devising of a special genetic vaccine to "cure" the mutants of their mutant-ness. This gives the opportunity to the bad mutants to gather some groups and even crowds and to start some terrorist action against this cure in the name that mutant-ness is not a disease. The final battle in order to destroy the research center that devised the "cure" and the scientist who is behind the discovery is spectacular with a bridge rotated in order to tie up San Francisco to Alcatraz by way of the Golden Gate Bridge. This time the battle will bring the bad mutants down once and for all. The leader of them, a certain Magneto, will be injected four doses of the "cure", the winged son of the President of the USA will save the scientist, and Wolverine, the man with metal bones and claws on his hands will get rid of the too famous Jean who had gone wild and evil after her resurrection from the water catastrophe in the previous film. Then peace and safety are finally assured and men and mutants can live happily together thereafter and have many children. Such films are definitely naive as for the meaning but they are saved by the special effects and are entertaining after all. We could of course compare this trilogy with the Aliens first three films, or with the Terminator trilogy, or the two Star Wars trilogies. We would always find somewhere the belief that the future is not so grim as it may look and that good will always get over evil. Then the differences are in the surviving or winning models. From the Genesis or Ragnarok model of Terminator, to the bi-partisan peace of this X-Men trilogy, to the never ending resurrection of the Aliens in the Aliens series, to the democratic victory of the two Star Wars trilogies, we can write volumes on the persistence and return of such ideological, supposedly religious or philosophical models, but the best novel ever written on that subject remains Stephen King's The Stand.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I'll be truthful; I didn't like this film very much. Of course, it had a lot to live up to, of course, with the previous two films high standard. The film opens well, with strangely disturbing versions of Xavier and Magneto visiting a young Jean. It also goes straight into to the action, the two main plots of the story soon becoming apparent. Both however, come second place to special effects in this film.<br /><br />At just over 1 and 30 minutes, it would be almost impossible to cram a finale worthy of the trilogy without missing out some things. I just don't see why it had to be the emotion. With the cure side of the story, it seems we never get an insight into the characters worries and feelings towards it. If it had been 2 and a half hour, it would have been able to develop all of the characters, and the back stories would have been more relevant to certain characters.  The phoenix part is also extremely disappointing, we aren't ever told why Phoenix does what she does and who is in control. You can only go so far as to blame Brett Ratner, he does a good job with the battle scenes but always seems to want to rush anything involving a character's emotion. I can imagine him on set hurrying along the actors as they try to get into character for the harrowing scenes. So if newcomer Ratner isn't the problem, what is?<br /><br />As for the script goes. It's as if the writers truly want this to be the last film, killing off characters early to make way for new ones. Rogue is put on the back seat, even though the central theme of the cure should have her at the forefront. The final battle is also inexplicable, with both sides not really sure what they should be doing. It does allow for one of the great moments of the trilogy (Kitty and Juggernauts chase through - and I mean through - the facility). Still on the script, don't forget the corny lines ("I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!") and terrible ending which seems to forget the events of the rest of the film. Vinnie Jones and Halle Berry are both below par in the acting stakes even thought they didn't have much to work with. I don't want this to be the last stand as I think the saga deserves better than this. The previous films had intelligence and emotion, compared to explosions and annoyances.<br /><br />Overall, it was worth seeing on the big screen, and I'm glad that I saw it. It is an "O-Kay" film. But again, you'll be a little disappointed as an X-Men fan. Maybe X4 will prosper without many of the main characters, well, one can only hope.<br /><br />If you do choose to watch this make sure you stay after the credits for the final scene. It seems as though most viewers wasn't able to catch the final scene entirely.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Why do certain directors think that spending your entire budget on special effects will make an instant hit movie? Or giving in to your star so she gets a bigger role, and still gives an uninspired performance? Rumour has it, Halle Berry was refusing to come back and play Storm, because she didn't have a lot of screen time in the first two movies. So we get more of her, and a lot less of Mystique, who could have had a big storyline, but that was dropped.<br /><br />Also Cyclops (James Marsden) made the mistake of signing on to be in Superman Returns as well, and his role is greatly reduced, to a couple of scenes, and a gravestone. He gets killed by the love of his life (boy, that must have sucked), and guess what? His death happens off screen.<br /><br />And what was the sense in bringing back Famke Jansen? She doesn't do much apart from stand around and look menacing, but I suppose being brought back from the dead will do that to anyone. How exactly did she manage to come back? The character is really underdeveloped. She stands around in the background for most of the movie, until she decides to "annihilate" something or someone, just for the special effect.<br /><br />The special effects were alright, trying to make up for what was a serious lack of plot. The special effects used in the beginning of the film, where we see what happens 20 years earlier (which bore no relation to the rest of the film at all), was wasted. They attempted to make Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen 20 years younger. They amazingly failed on Patrick - he looked no different whatsoever. And Ian was given brown hair. And their faces were obviously edited and smoothed out compared to the other actors in the scene. How much money is thrown at these kinda ageing things per second?<br /><br />Then there was the obvious referencing other movies. (Or stealing scenes if you prefer.) When the film properly starts, it's nearly a direct steal from the Terminator films. The scene between IceMan and FireGuy towards the end? Did anyone else notice it was the same as the two wands clashing between Harry & Voldemort? Then at the end, it looked very similar to the final scene in Carrie, with Famke as Carrie. The bullet stopping scenes is referencing Matrix Reloaded? Or one of those films.<br /><br />And the point in Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut is? The guy cannot act. When will people start realising this! The 'fat' suit he was wearing was meant to make him look like a big muscle man, but he ended up looking like a sumo wrestler gone wrong.<br /><br />Anna Paquin's role as Rogue is greatly reduced, to practically being non-existent. Wasn't she the main part of the first film? Was it worth her time turning up for filming? Did she use her mutant powers once during the film? No.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in this film, and had to keep pausing it as I couldn't remember what happened in the first two movies. But I remember really liking the first one. But this seemed like CGI/action scene one after the other. And Xavier is killed. I kept expecting him to make another appearance, to come back. Well, if they brought back Famke Jansen ...!!!<br /><br />Hopefully, this is the last, disappointing finale to the X-Men trilogy. Although, judging by the ending, they're hoping for another. Zzz. Lets hope not! If you're going to name the movie "The Last Stand" don't imply that something else is going to happen at the end!<br /><br />This film should never have been made. If it wasn't for Wolverine, I probably would have given this film less stars. If Mystique had stayed and been given a bigger role, the film would have got more stars. I understand this review had been one big rant. But watch the movie and you'll understand why it should have never been made.<br /><br />Actually don't watch the movie. Read the one/two star reviews for it. Surely that should be enough to convince you.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>This was pretty good film.<br /><br />It is easy to see alot of work went into it....BUT... something just does not "click".<br /><br />...and I don't know exactly what it is.<br /><br />It almost feels like everybody is walking thru the scenes as visualized in the storyboards, but in a "mechanical" sort of way if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Unlike some DVDs you eiher want to buy and add to your collection, or at least talk/think about afterwards...

While I throughly enjoyed this movie (after the first X-Men movie came out, I pre-judged it thinking it would be horrid, not the case at all) I do think that this movie missed its potential.<br /><br />I liked the addition of all the new characters, but I believe it may have prevented some of the story development.  After watching "Last Stand" I would really like to see a 4th X-Men movie, but believe there will only be spin-off movies (Wolverine, Magneto).  Plus some fairly major characters die so I think they'd be forced to do a pre-quel.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good movie that you should definately see, especially if you saw the first two.  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I liked the first 2 movies in the series, and this one competently carries the franchise forward.  Many of the same guys return for a final fight to preserve mutants from extinction.  The addition of the Beast played by Kelsey Grammer was a nice addition as well.  The plot moves along nicely and is not overwhelming with action.  My biggest complaint was there was not a good villian or foil for Wolverine.  In the first movie he had Sabertooth and in the second he had Deathstrike and Mystique.  In this one he deals a bit with Juggernaut, but I would have liked to see more Wolverine humor.  Regardless, it is well worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In the first two "X-Men" films, perceptive viewers could easily detect the "pro-gay rights" subtext that ran through the storyline about a race of superpower "mutants" let loose on the world and the debate over their place in society.  The latest installment, "X-Men: The Last Stand" takes the issue a step further by proposing a complex moral dilemma: should the "mutants" be encouraged to partake of a supposed "cure" for their condition or should they be proud of who they are and not change merely to placate a society made uncomfortable by their presence?<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though "The Last Stand" raises this intriguing ethical issue, it really doesn't do anything all that interesting with it.  The main problem is that the screenplay simply fails to come up with a character commensurate with the movie's theme.  In fact, there are so many mutants running around that none of them is ever able to grab the center of the movie's attention or the focus of the audience.  Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Iceman, Rogue etc. all have their individual moments but they are soon crushed under the weight of overblown actions scenes and over-the-top special effects.  Only Ian Holm's evil Magneto has a chance to break through all the pyrotechnics and create some impact as a character.<br /><br />I loved the original "X-Men" when it came out in 2003 precisely because it felt so bold and daring in its willingness to explore social issues along with all the CGI effects, stunt work and explosions that are par for the action film genre.  But the two follow-up editions have not lived up to those expectations.  I'm sorry to say that, despite all the technical fireworks of the grand finale, the "X-Men" series ends not with a bang but with a whimper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Acting-------------5 out of 10, Does anyone really care????<br /><br />Directing----------6 out of 10, Ratner loves his special effects<br /><br />Location/Scenery---6 out fo 10, Always had a soft spot for Xavier's school<br /><br />Action rating------8 out of 10, And lots of it.........<br /><br />Quality------------6 out of 10, Maybe it's just me, but it felt a bit rushed<br /><br />Violence-----------High, Bloodless, but alot of people and mutants die<br /><br />Blood/Gore--------Low, Wolverine and his claws cause most if it<br /><br />Nudity------------Low, Would have been none if not for Mystique<br /><br />Sex---------------None<br /><br />Language----------Medium, I lost count how many times the B-bomb was used<br /><br />Overall-----------Fine for whole family<br /><br />Total Score-31 out fo 50, Grade B-<br /><br />Where the first two went for plot, acting, character development and mind messing, the third installment is pretty much just special effects and lots and lots of action. Now, I'm not saying thats a bad thing, but I must say I was a little spoiled by the first two, specifically the last half hour of X-men 2, that was incredible film-making. We get alot of new characters, but not alot of background info on them, no real inter-action by any of them, and thats a shame, some of them could have been real cool to expand on. One reviewer said there was to much Halle Berry, um, no such thing my friend, she is still drop-dead gorgeous and one of the better actors in this trilogy. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is still cool as ever, and Magneto and Xavier are still a blast to watch.<br /><br />Now, the best part....As you may recall we lost Jean Grey at the end of 2, but good news, she's back, BIG TIME!!!! Problem is, she is sooooo powerfull she can't separate good from evil, and the battle scenes she has at the end are simply fantastic, if they decide to do a fourth, it would be wise to find a way to bring her back, definitely the coolest of all the X-men. Also, as mentioned earlier, there are tons of special effects, and most of them work, expertly shot with exceptional lighting really brings you head-on into the action, and Ratner uses it too perfection. Here's hoping for a fourth, but how about a little more character development. please?</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>***This Entire Review Is A Spoiler***<br /><br />When you change directors, you invariably change direction.  That is the source of all the problems that X3 had.  Bryan Singer had a specific vision for the series, which is impossible for Brett Ratner, to reproduce.  When Singer jumped ship to do "Superman Returns," this film and franchise was doomed.  As always, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />This film focuses on two threads: Magneto's War and Phoenix.  In order to make this film work, they had to eliminate the deadwood, viz. Professor X (whose sole purpose in the first two films was not to lead, but to get captured) and Cyclops (who, in order to highlight Wolverine as field commander, was written as a wienerschnitzel).  As I watched the two deaths, I realized that 20 Century Fox was taking a cue from TV Fox's "24."  Sudden deaths make for an exciting story, because you don't know who is going to go next, but at times--as happens in "24"--the unpredictably can itself become too predictable.<br /><br />So with the leader and the field commander gone, the questions is--will Halley Barry want to come back as the next field commander, and will Kelsey Grammer want to dawn the blue fir again?  Or maybe the oblique reference to transferring the consciousness into the body of another being means they can have Professor X back, but with a less-expensive actor?<br /><br />Phoenix was mostly a prop, and as I saw her rather disturbing black-eyed, wild-haired psychic whirlwind sequences, I kept thinking about the previews for the Omen remake.  The Phoenix Seduction and Tragedy only works if you like Cyclops.  By writing Cyclops they way they did, Singer painted Ratner into a corner.  And, once again, the fans (i.e. the people who pay YOUR bills) were hurt the worst.<br /><br />The film is at its best--and most intelligent--when it focuses on Magneto's War.  It is a metaphor for racism (Mystiques reference to her "slave name" is smouched from Malcolm X), prejudice, and the Holocaust. The question of the anti-mutant of course, reminds us of the nature/nurture discussion and the hot issue of curing homosexuality.  Of course this is propaganda, but so was Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and Ray Bardberry.  The real question is with this is "Are you thinking, or merely being entertained?"<br /><br />In regards to the mutant cure, I am glad that they brought out how mutations affect people differently.  Mutants who could pass off for normal, such as Wolverine and Story hated the cure, but Rogue and Beast understood why a person would want to de-mutant themselves.<br /><br />There is a third thread--the subplots, all of which go by too quickly.  The Angle subplot--you got to love that introduction!--is not a subplot, but more of a book-end.  When we last saw Iceman, he was willing to work around Rogue's "problem," but now he seems to have turned on a dime.  This makes him seem less heroic, and after Rogue is "cured," what is going to happen to Sprite-Shadowcat-Kitty Pryde? And speaking of Kitty Pryde, where is Colossus's heart? And if Leech's anti-mutant is only mimicked, not replicated, will Rogue go back to her poison touch? And if Mystique goes back to being a mutant, why revenge will she wreck on Magneto?  Heh-heh-heh!<br /><br />Another sub-sub plot was the crowd sizes at the cur clinics.  Apparently there are a lot of mutants--low-level class one and two mutants.  This of course raises a deeper question--if so many people are mutants (factoring out the wannabes), it seems like they would represent a substantial voting block.  This would explain why Beast had such a high office, and why you could never have a Project Wideawake.<br /><br />Despite these problems, Brett Ratner did a marvelous job in keeping with the feel of the first two movies.  I thought the film worked well, and would welcome Rater to come back and do a film four.<br /><br />PS--so will the next film be a part four, or will it be a reboot?</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"X-Men: The Last Stand" is lots of fun, if you don't think too much about it. The effects are pretty-well done -- bridges coming off their moorings, guys shooting lasers from their eyeballs, people disintegrating or running through walls, etc.<br /><br />The basic story is this: a "cure" has been found for the mutations that gave rise to the X-Men. Evil villain Magneto (Ian McKellen) is trying to destroy the cure and raise a mutant army to do goodness knows what. Good guy Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) doesn't want the cure destroyed, for equally unclear reasons. The ensuing face-off is completely confusing and pointless, although very fun to watch. Lots of people, cars and houses getting levitated with mind control; lots of flaming, flying cars and lots of general mayhem. In the midst of this, characters are still trying to come to terms with their "talents" and wondering whether to take the cure and become normal. Scattered love interests add fiery arcs to this celestial fireball of a movie.<br /><br />"X Men III" is great if you just want to have a good time and not think too much about plot consistency and plausibility -- like why superheros need to walk "en masse" to the their targets (rather than fly teleport or whatever) or why the government doesn't just "cure" all the bad guys rather than transport them overland in vulnerable trucks, etc.<br /><br />But the mutants are fun -- one guy has porcupine quills, another shoots darts from his hands -- and Juggernaut (my fave) -- rolls through just about anything. Though I still can't get my mind around Kelsey Grammer's "Beast" who looks more like a big blue Furby than anything dangerous. Check your inner critic at the door and have a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A26O0T192IBKY1.html">A26O0T192IBKY1</a><br/><p>Sheesh! Did enough people get shamelessly killed off in this one? Although Cyclops is only "presumed" dead since they didn't find a body, even though he's hardly had any airtime in the last movie either accept for being brainwashed or wussying on about Jean being "presumedly" dead. As for Prof. X's bit at the end, since his body was destroyed, he must've downloaded his consciousness into a comatose body in the facility where Dr. MacTaggert was working at. Jean could of course probably come back too since she's been resurrected more times than Jason, Freddy Kreuger, and Jesus combined!<br /><br />They did a pretty good deal with the extended mutant cast. Although they didn't explain how Beast was in human form in X2, and now he's fully-furry. Callisto got way too many powers from her comic counterpart. Psylocke was dumbed down alot as far as her powers too. Nice to see Multiple Man. Shadowcat finally gets some decent airtime, although it would've been cool to see Jubilee too. Angel was fair, even if he is one of the more boring X-Men. And Juggernaut just rocked! Don't care if he's not really a mutant, that was just gold! It would've been nice if they bothered saying whether Toad or Sabertooth were still alive or not from the first flick, or where the hell Nightcrawler was.<br /><br />For the original cast, they brought this whole darker side to Prof. X that actually made Magneto's side look like the fair one. Magneto was a cold prick though after what happened to Mystique("That's my slave name!"), and him being turned human would've been an act worse than death for him, which might've only been temporary on high-class mutants. Iceman finally ices up, although I don't remember his clothes being visible before when he did that. Rouge pretty much wussed out at the last minute, which I don't know why she's at the Xavier Institute since she's human now. Cyclops just was a whiney bitch as usual. They just couldn't write anything interesting for him after the first movie. Jean's version of the Phoenix's is more like something out of a Stephen King novel. I half-expected to see the 666 sign on her forehead. And...Mystique's a brunette? Say what?<br /><br />Even though alot of reports had come in claiming that this is the last X-flick, they left a big enough room for more. I saw in an interview with the director Brett Ratner about why he doesn't want to do an X4. He said "because there's never been a good Part 4 of a movie franchise". Uh...hello. Star Wars: Episode Iv-A New Hope ring any bells? Plus, Star Trek 4 which was the best of the classic Trek movies. Hell, even Rocky IV wasn't too bad!</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>This film was doomed as soon as James Mardesen signed on to be Louis Lane's husband in "Superman Returns," which forced writers to kill him of.<br /><br />Folks also really need to stop blaming Bret Ratner for Cyclops' death. Are you stupid? do you even know what a director does? He has no choice when it comes to story! The film makers had no choice but to kill cyclops off because the actor that plays him was off with the original director making "Superman Returns." So if you want to blame someone for why cyclops dies in x3, blame Bryan Singer! He's the one who chose to not finish what he started! Blame actor James Mardesen, who signed on for the most worthless role in his life, playing Louis Lane's husband in a movie that was a complete downer! Bryan Singer really screwed up going for that superman movie instead on finishing his X-Men trilogy. If you listen to the audio commentary, the producers say, we had to limit cyclops' role because James was off making superman returns and was barely around to film. There you go! Stop blaming Bret Ratner for God's sake because all it shows is your ignorance!!<br /><br />I know what you are thinking. They should have hired another actor but it's not that easy. There are contractual obligations and if they wanted to use another actor they would have to pay James Mardesen thousands of dollars, which a movie studio never wants to do because they constantly want to save money and not go over budget. For example, when they killed Michael Bein off in "Alien 3" they had to pay him thousands of dollars! He made more money off dying off screen in "Alien 3" than his whole performance in "Aliens"! X3 has that "Alien 3" curse on it, where it's a good movie but there was so much standing in its way that it's not what fans expected.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities of this film are Kelsey Grammar as beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. What a waste. I wish i could magically transport their performances into x1 or x2 but not even they could make this film very watchable. Halle Berry and Hugh were great too but that ordeal with Cyclops is like a thorn to my side and i can't get over it.<br /><br />what i hate more than what happened to Cyclops that didn't involve hollywood politics is what they did to rogue. Having her character take the cure goes against everything the x men stand for and with that i can tell you these screenplay writers don't have a clue and are blasphemous when it comes to x men. the x men are all about accepting yourself as you are and learning to control your powers!!! even in the audio commentery the writers say that the ending where she doesn't take the cure is for Rogue fans, so wouldn't they have put that in the film!!? their reasoning was because "it sucks that she can't get with nobody." what a bunch of morons. this was like watching someone piss on a church and it hurt me, more than the death of cyclops.<br /><br />Also the ending is ridiculous so magento who is the equivelant of osama bin laden is just sitting in the park playing chess and no one takes notice even though he was terrorizing the whole country and hundreds of soldiers died on alcatraz!? So, the cure still exists and everyone is happy? so jean come back only to...die again? this film was pointless. blame the screenwriters and the producers but not bret ratner.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>X-Men III with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and all the others fill out this cast in a non stop action fest.  The special effects we've seen before in other films but it still stands as a solid action film.  It's something I'd watch again. Without Bryan Singer, it's still a good film.<br /><br />The film starts with the senator Worthington has a cure for mutants.  It all begins from there as there is a dividing line between humans and the serum to suppress the mutant genes, permanently.  Hugh Jackman gets most of the lines in this one.  We get to see the demise of three characters, whom I am not going to say here, but it's going to be hard to bring them back for sequels.  I only wish that there's a way to bring them back in flashback scenes or holographic programs.  The scene in the beginning took place in a Star Trek Next Generation style holo deck.  I don't know if this was done in the comic but it does lift a few Trek concepts.<br /><br />Kelsey Grammar does a superb job of the Beast.  He has a small amount of time on the screen and chews up the scenery.  Back in the 70's the Beast was the wild card member. He wasn't always that Blue Haired Wolfman.  I wish that the characters that made brief appearances had something more to do.  Colossus should have had more to do than throw Wolverine into battle.  Juggernaut had much more cunning and intelligence in the comics.  He was wearing sculpted muscles in this one.<br /><br />I was hoping that we'd get some of the comics script into the film.  In the original version, Phoenix was shot by a laser cannon unknown to Scott (Cyclops) Summers. The comics version had them in on alien planet giant arena fighting for their lives.  With CGI, it would have been possible to reproduce the environment in the comic.  I was hoping Chris Claremont would have had a hand in the script.<br /><br />The comic insert was a good addition.  They should have added the DVD ROM of the first 500 issues as a selling point.  I was disappointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.  I love the Jack Kirby ones but they have been reprinted endlessly in best of collections.<br /><br />The good thing I do have to say about the film is that it can be seen repeatedly.  There are a lot of comic elements that make this film a keeper.  The conflict between Xavier and Magneto is much deeper.  It's not a conventional battle because they were best friends at one time and had great respect for one another.<br /><br />From what I've read the next film is going to be a solo Wolverine film.  I'd like to see the origin of Wolverine portrayed in the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>While I thought the second Xmen was not as good as the first, I found this one to match the standard of the first and even surpass it in some ways.  THe ending, I admit, is somewhat feel-good, but the death of some of the principal characters - one at her own request - make this something special, in the realm of truly excellent hard science fiction.  As such, while bringing out notions about American society with a theme of race and inclusiveness underneath, there is trajedy in these deaths.  Once again, the acting is simply spectacular, and the characters continue to evolve.  That makes this series outstanding, with a beginning and a potential end.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm, even for fans of the comic.  I recognize many of the episodes of this from comics that are 25 years old, but changed into its own art.  You can view all three as a whole, and they completely entertained me on several successive nights.  With Spiderman, these are the best comic book films ever made, not campy and grotesquely silly, but extending the medium to express some genuinely important thoughts about the human condition.  But then, that is Marvel as its best, right down to the hilarious cameos of Stan Lee in each film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>X-Men The Last Stand is a good Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are pretty interesting.<br /><br />And I can see how Ian McKellen can go around saying that this is a movie he personally relates to.<br /><br />Even though I really like Sci-Fi,  and I have seen the previous X-Men movies,  I am really not an expert on X-Men.<br /><br />Basically, the Mutants are fighting for their right to remain Mutants. A "cure" has been discovered and they don't want<br /><br />to be forced to take the Cure.<br /><br />But the only character I could sympathize with was Angel, played by Ben Foster. This was really the only character in the<br /><br />movie that had any emotional depth.<br /><br />Even in a sci-fi movie, I like to have some sense of who the characters are.<br /><br />The scenes where the Mutants are fighting are pretty good, and with good special effects.<br /><br />And Of course, there is always Hugh Jackman - who is so good looking whatever role he is playing.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>The kill off two main vital characters from the last two films, cram in too many new characters, rely on CGI effects too much, and leave it with a dumb ending. I do not know weather to give it 2 or 2.5 stars, because it is watchable, but not something that I would really like to watch again. I would not recomend this unless you are a diehard fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>If given more time, this movie would have been better than the final result, but the final result is still really good. I understood the plot and what the film was trying to tell us through symbolism the way an X-Men story should. Some characters do "die" in this movie, but in the world of the X-Men, they are always brought back. Characters have died in the comics and came back, and the small clip at the end of the credits of this movie proves that dead doesn't always mean dead.<br /><br />I thought they made good use of the special effects of the film. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie was watching Angel fly over the bridge. The special effects really came in use at the exciting battle scene towards the end of the movie. You hear about the war coming in the previous two movies and now it is finally hear and it makes for a good watch that isn't boring.<br /><br />The acting is also as great as in the other films as well. There are some powerful scenes such as when Logan and Storm are crying over one of their friends who had died. Overall, if you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get the DVD. No; it isn't the best in the series, but if you love the X-Men movies and are like me, then you will probably like this as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>When watching the third X Men movie, one cannot help but wonder if Bryan Singer was involved in the movie.Brett Ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that Singer defined.<br /><br /> The movie is loaded with great action sequences,new characters,plot twists and and resolutions.Unfortunately at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements(The Phoenix,and the off-screen death of a beloved X-Men)and characters(Angel,Beast,Juggernaught,Rogue).<br /><br />  The endings leaves the door open for this not to be the "Last" stand of the cinimatic adventure of the X-Men.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A cure has been discovered to help mutants be normal if they chose it, unfortunately it has made Magneto (Ian Mckellen) furious as hell as he recruits some of his deadly mutants to put a stop to it. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom thought she was left for dead in the previous picture has been resurrected but filled with dark powers as the powerful and evil Dark Phoenix as she joins up with Magneto to enslave humanity once and for all, but can Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) along with the X-Men (Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Shawn Ashmore, James Marsden) with three new members Kitty Pryd (Ellen Page), Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and Angel (Ben Foster) stop the war from happening?<br /><br />This is the final installment of the popular "X-Men" trilogy, the film is kind of weak compared to the awesome first two installments. But there is plenty of good action sequences, some humor, more wolverine action, emotion, and new mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) as the director of "Rush Hour" Brett Ratner takes over Bryan Singer's spot for director to take this final installment to a new direction. It's a weak but very good end to a great Marvel comic movie series until a few character spin-offs come along like "Wolverine" and "Magneto".<br /><br />This DVD has great picture & sound with some good extras like two audio commentaries and deleted scenes.<br /><br />It's still worth owning if you loved the first two movies or comic based movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>I did enjoyed this movie. It still delivered with all the themes of the X-men comic book. Basically, the plot of the movie is a very simple and direct one. When a medical company comes out with a cure that can supress the mutant gene peramently in mutants. It divides the mutant population. Some mutants want the cure, while others join up with Magneto to try and  stop the company from making it. While others team up with the X-men to try and help them stop Magneto. There's also a subplot to this film. When Jean Grey is found alive, the X-men discover that Jean Grey has become very powerful and dangerous to herself and to her teamates. The X-men are face with a tough decision, on how to stop her. All in all, this is a great movie. (However, I did find this movie hard to watch. Due to the fact, there was some graphic scenes. So, if you have children. I would advise that you don't let them watch this movie).</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie for what it was.  I also enjoyed the first two movies as well.  They seemed to depend a lot more on characterization and the human/mutant discriminations.  This one seems to go more for the slam bam action more than story.  The mutant battle at the end of the movie is great.  This movie kills off several major characters, makes some major changes to others, as well as introducing us to new major characters Beast, Angel and Juggernaut.  To quickly sum it up, Jena Grey returns from the dead as Phoenix, a not so nice but very powerful mutant.  Professor X and Magneto are at odds as to what to do with her.  Meanwhile a mutant boy who can take away the mutant ability is used to create a cure for mutants.  Some see this as a savior, others look at it like genocide.  Thats when the real battles start.  Enjoyable action film with great special effects.  Though this wraps up the overall X-Men trilogy nicely, there was a slight tease at the end of more possibilities.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Like many have already pointed out, this one falls short of the first two films, having seen the original years ago, I just today rewatched it & for the first time saw X2 & X3, & felt that X2 was on par with the first film, I never really kept up with the comics, but really did like the second film as a sequel, but I was really disappointed with this third film, as many have pointed out, the themes of the other two seem to get lost here, for instance Cyclops, who is by far a fun character with awesome powers gets shafted in the first 10 minutes, of course I knew why, the actor James Marsedan went with Bryan Singer to do "Superman Returns" which I hate to admit was probably a smart move seeing that X3 fails as a sequel, also Patrick Stewart's Xavier is killed off, which really sucked, imagine Yoda being killed off in "Star Wars" Ep III", then Rebecca Romajn as Mystique is done away with, the only saving grace here is seeing her real nakedness breifly, & the one thing that always irks me is when fashion idiots think they should make over the actors, both Halle Berry & Famke Jansen get unattractive makeovers, & speaking of Jansen, was it necessary to bring her back?, & I won't even get started on Anna Paquin's Roque being shafted here, in the first film she was an integral part of the story, here she is just in the background, at least she didn't get a screwy makeover, only Hugh Jackman & Ian McKellan are the same as before, but they both just didn't seem to be into it this time around, Jackman had just done "Van Helsing" & seemed bored with "Wolverine" & McKellan had just scored with "LOTR" so he looked bored in his role too, also as one reviewer noted, there are shades of "Matrix" & "Terminator", I could go on & on, but clearly this one failed to grab me like the first two did, I call it laziness on the part of the writers & studios!</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>The mutants are back in the dark spectaular third movie X-Men: The Last Stand, A cure is discovered to remove mutation from them, while the X-Men search for a lost friend, Magneto leads a mutant uprising against the humans because of this cure and the X-Men must battle his army to stop his violent actions.

This film, while it raises interesting philosophical questions falls well short of my expectations.<br /><br />Its not that the story is a bad story it just promised too much and delivered too little.  The special effects are great but there are plot holes in the movie that are big enough to drive a train through.<br /><br />The acting is all over the map<br /><br />Hugh Jackman<br /><br />....  Logan/Wolverine<br /><br />Halle Berry<br /><br />....  Ororo Munroe/Storm<br /><br />Ian McKellen<br /><br />....  Eric Lensherr/Magneto<br /><br />These three perform well especially Mckellen who always manages to snatch an acting victory from the jaws of defeat.  The rest of the cast is hardly given any screen time at all.<br /><br />Even though its been 4 years since the last one came out the story feels half baked.  They needed more time to nail it all down.  At times it felt like there were 2 or 3 separate storylines.<br /><br />Overall-I hope everyone connected with this project counts their blessings and just go their separate ways.  This movie is not exactly a high note but it is a good place to end it.  I really wanted to like this movie like I did X2.  I never could quite manage it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>There may currently be a calm, but there is a storm coming.  The conflict between human and mutant is about to heat up.  The spark that will set things off is a new mutant who cancels other mutants.  He has been used to develop a cure to being a mutant.  It is being offered in a voluntary fashion but there are those who believe it will be forced on mutants and Magneto is their leader.  As an added spark, Jean Grey has been found alive.<br /><br />The cure may be offered to volunteers but authorities have developed cure weapons to use against mutants.  The spark has been put to the tinder.  Magneto's Brotherhood wants to rise and eliminate the so-called cure so that it may not be used against unwilling mutants.  Jean Grey has risen as the most powerful of all mutants and she is on Magneto's side.  It is now time for he X-Men to take a stand and defend freedom, liberty, and the cause of mutants.<br /><br />This is an interesting film.  Not only do characters die, but we see new sides to old ones.  Xavier reveals his dark side while Magneto shows his good side.  Jean rises as a force of pure fury.  New mutants become part of the story, some more so than others.  In the end we have the feeling of a trilogy ended but there are also new beginnings and plenty of possibilities for more movies.

Least `camp' factor. Deadly serious. Consistently dark, and with nobody taking easy ways out. Those who needed to die died. It doesn't end fuzzy-wuzzy, but hopeful.<br /><br />Better than Spiderman; more complex, less navel-gazing, yet possibly more profound. Underneath the vexing question: what constitutes `illness' or `disease'? What does it mean to be different, and especially if there's a whole lot of you? This isn't Spiderman agonizing over his authenticity of being or something like that, but a whole group of people whose identity as individuals and a community are under threat. Do they have the right to defend themselves. How far are they allowed to go? How far is the rest of the world allowed to go? This isn't about right and wrong but questions that have no definite answer.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com.

Some, who know only a little or nothing at all of the X-men mythos, will enjoy it.  Some, who have read or seen all of the comics, will hate it.  And some will be like me, stuck in the middle.<br /><br />As a movie, X-men 3 is a pretty good way to end the *movie* series.  It ties up a lot of plot-lines, has some good twists, great Fx and a pretty decent story about love and mutants.  Its exciting to watch, visually stunning in parts and actually and surprisingly keeps the style and tone of the first two admirably well.<br /><br />On the other hand, as a story set in a mythos that is dozens upon dozens of years in the making, X-Men 3 falls flat on its face.  I  loved the first two, even though the mythos was messed around a bit, because it was a movie and you have to make some concessions.  Bryan Singer did an admirable job trying to tie together years upon years of story and create something that is true to the source and entertaining to those who have no idea who Wolverine is, as an example.  Unfortunately, X3 throws the mythos out of the window and simply does things it shouldn't do.  I can't talk about most of these things because I don't believe in spoilers.<br /><br />I will say, Rogue was totally under-used and spent most of the movie standing in line.  Storm was finally used in a decent way.  The major deaths in the film were insipid (as was the after-the-credits "revelation" that really ruined anything the movie had going for it).  Bret Rattner apparently has seen the Juggernaut video and there is a scene that is a nice and hillarious homage to that video.  But unfortunately, practically everything the first two films stood for was thrown out of the window.<br /><br />So, I'm torn.  On one hand, the movie was pretty decent as a *movie*.  Unfortunately, a portion of my soul died when I saw it last night and shook my head at the way Ratner handled the story.  If you know nothing about the X-men mythos, enjoy.  If you have read every single comic book, be prepared for a let down.  If you're like me, go in with an open mind, knowing that it won't be exactly as it should and maybe you won't be disappointed.  Maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>With Bryan Singer and his writing team moving on to the Superman franchise, Marvel and Fox scrambled to get the third, and for now final, X-Men film out as quick as possible, with director Brett Ratner getting to direct the installment.  Now make no mistake, Ratner is a hack director at best, and his best talents are displayed in the many action scenes throughout the film, many of which are nicely done.  The story picks up a while after X2, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) training a young group of mutants including Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Shadowcat (Ellen Paige), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) while Cyclops (James Marsden) is still mourning the death of Jean (Famke Janssen).  In the meantime, a cure for mutants is announced, prompting Magneto (Ian McKellen) to organize his Brotherhood as Jean returns from the dead to make short work of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and anyone else in her way.  For the most part, X-Men: The Last Stand is solid enough to stand out on it's own, but it really misses the touch that Singer and his crew had on the characters.  The dark tone is still here, but the characterization injected in the previous two films gets the second tier treatment here.  Many characters, mainly Cyclops and Rogue, are almost completely ignored to make way for new characters like Beast (Kelsey Grammer, perfectly cast) and Angel (Ben Foster, who plays a much lesser role than you would think), while new villains are introduced including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones, yes, Vinnie Jones in a fake looking muscle suit and all) and Multiple Man (Eric Dane), while Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) get a backseat.  There's loads of in-references that longtime X-fans will get (the Days of Futures Past nod is a nice touch, and Stan Lee and Chris Claremont make cameos), but to believe that this is the last X-Men film is just silly.  It could have been better (and longer, the film is over way too quick), but it could have been a lot worse too, so maybe we should count our blessings.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Scientists have discovered a "cure" for the mutant gene.  Now, all mutants can choose to become a "normal" human.  Division rises amongst the mutant community.  Some see this as an opportunity to be something they always wanted to be.  Others, like Magneto (McKellan) see this as an attempt at racial cleansing.  While Professor X (Stewart) sits on the sidelines, Magneto rallies the troops to rise up against the cure and those who are pushing it.  The X-Men must stop Magneto before he causes too much damage, but a former ally has been raised from the ashes of her former self, and she may be the deciding factor in this war.<br /><br />This X-Men movie is the best yet.  Filled with action and an always timely storyline, it does not disappoint.  Story-wise, characters die, return from the dead, lose their powers, and are changed significantly before all is said and done.  This shake-up introduces doubt into who will survive the final battle, and ratchets up the stakes.  Director Brett Ratner is taking over the reins from Bryan Singer, who left this franchise for another ("Superman").  He proves that he is up to the challenge.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie.

Dozens of new X-men with different talents are introduced, and part of the fun is just seeing what will happen there next. Relationship-wise, this movie focuses on Wolverine and Jean, who is now the only class 5 mutant known, even more powerful than Magneto. I note one reviewer here who said he wasn't happy with Patrick Stewart getting killed--but he should have stayed through the end of the credits--there's one final brief scene where we learn that isn't final. The climactic scene with the Golden Gate Bridge has to be the best special effects scene of the year. My only criticism, which is small (and the reason I rate it four stars instead of five) is that I think they made too much of Jean's mental instability. I don't see why a super powerful X man (or woman, in this case) would automatically be mentally unstable and need to be psychologically conditioned and controlled as Stewart was doing with Jean so that they wouldn't go crazy and cause harm. But all in all a fun movie and worth seeing on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>From the variety of all comic books adapted to the big screen, the X-Men are the greatest, at least when it comes to the social and moral topics discussed in their history. It's a comic about tolerance, rejection, prejudice, evolution, segregation, discrimination and the perennial search for acceptance.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer brilliantly accomplished to expose all the complex paradoxes, problems and personal issues the mutants were suffering because of the fear the "normal" human beings felt for them. Now, in Brett Ratner's hands, X-3 doesn't stop to examine so many moral dilemmas and jumps straight into action. His execution is more crude and superficial, but more exciting.<br /><br />Once again we find the mutants in the middle of a conflict: just when it seemed they were feeling accepted in the world, a millionaire discovers a vaccine capable of remove the X gene. Some mutants take the news with joy. Others, of course, aren't as pleased.<br /><br />On one side, Professor Xavier and his pupils try to discuss the subject in a civilized and rational way. On the other side, Magneto sees this discovery as a new threat to extinguish all mutants from the planet and convinced with this idea he decides to gather an army that will fight those who want to anihilate the mutants. A confrontation between the X Men and Magneto's army is unavoidable.<br /><br />X-3 is definitely more action-packed than its predecessors, but it also lacks the character development the first two movies carefully outlined to make us care about these people and their conflicts.<br /><br />But balancing with a sure hand the action sequences, Ratner has created a very entertaining ending to this trilogy, making risky decisions like killing main characters and overwhelming us with so many new mutants that we don't have enough time to get to know them as well as the old characters.<br /><br />A word of advice: stay until the very end of the credits. There's a small scene that will make you wonder if indeed this is the X Men last battle. I guess only time will decide that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>I liked X-Men, hated X-2.  In my review for X-2 I say I missed good mutants fighting bad mutants.  Be careful what you wish for.  There are so many mutants, and half of them are just green or blue or tattoed.  I knew Magneto, Mystique, Juggernaut, and Multipleman on the Brotherhood side.  The rest of the mutants I have no clue what their names are.  But theres Spike haired man and tattoed women and  wierd haired mutant.  The action is great but why, why kill off a main character off screen!  The only main character that I felt sorry for was Proffesor X.  The only new villains added should have been Juggernaut and Pyro.  And Juggernaut is awesome.  He brings back memories of the best villain(besides Ian Mckellan)in the X-Men franchise.  Yep, its Toad.  Overall not much of a story but good action sequences.  I was expecting more but when Singer left you knew X-Men wasn't going to be the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>After the beginning of the sage of "X-Men" beginning with the 2000 original and going all the way up to a much grander scale with "X-Men United", the third in what is sometimes referred to as the trilogy of X-Men films entitled "The Last Stand" brings the epic saga to a glorious close. I am very much clueless as to why this movie seems to be getting far more negative reviews than it's predecessors. While far from perfect, "The Last Stand" is true to it's title: It is a grand finale to the current X-Men movie saga. Yet I just can't imagine how they can make a fourth one after the events that take place here unless they are doing Wolverine or Magneto spin-off movies.<br /><br /> Some time after Charles Xavier's X-Men and his archenemy Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants united against a common foe hell-bent on wiping out the mutant race, the two camps are suddenly torn apart in an acrimonious division between the mutant race as non-mutant or `normal' humans devise a medical substance that works as a `cure' for mutant powers and suppresses the genes that cause the mutant powers to manifest. The so-called cure divides the mutant community into several camps but the prominent ones are the X-Men lead by Charles Xavier who work to bridge the divide between mutants and non-mutants, the second is of the scientists devising the `cure', and the third and most vicious is Magneto's camp who views the `cure' as a tactic to commit genocide against the mutant community and he and his army aim to destroy this cure and will destroy anyone who stands in his way, even if it's a mutant. So the battle begins and the battle lines are now drawn. Xavier, The X-Men and their allies believe in tolerance and bridging the divide between the mutants and human beings but Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants believes that mutants are the superior race on earth and aims to establish mutant control over non-mutants.<br /><br /> The so-called cure devised on a research facility on Alcatraz Island was made in reaction to the news of an enormously powerful mutant with the ability to wipe out entire cities with one fell swoop. Jean Grey, who was thought to have actually died after sacrificing herself to save the others from a large flood, mysteriously returns to life but with a far greater power that manifest in the subconscious parts of her mind. This power sees Grey revived as the Phoenix. Yet these enormous news powers that have manifested in her, have made her a monstrously powerful mutant whose powers endanger everyone around her, both ally and enemy alike, mutant and non-mutant alike, as well as the entire planet.<br /><br /> So the battle lines are drawn and the war begins between the three camps, the non-mutants protecting this `cure', the X-Men aiming to end the enmity between the races, and Magneto's Brotherhood organization's goals of mutant superiority. It is indeed the war to end all wars as so it is said. Who will turn out victorious when it is over?<br /><br /> I am absolutely proud to have seen this movie. A major reason for this is that the whole idea of a `cure' for mutants reminds me of the bigoted beliefs in `curing' homosexual and bisexuality in human beings and the horrific consequences of these bigoted beliefs. While too complex to jam into this review, watching "The Last Stand" really reminded me vividly of the gay rights movement occurring across the United States with one camp being those who've made their inner peace with their orientation and the other being the camp that views homosexuality as a `disease' which is completely and totally absurd. Such behavior is documented in almost every species of animals including dogs, cats, as well as our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Though there's much more about this that cannot be squashed into this review, "The Last Stand" story plot I felt has a lot of parallels to the battle against homophobia and intolerance against not just gays, lesbians and bisexuals, but also others because of their differences. There is no need for a `cure' for this orientation.<br /><br /> The movies problems though are similar to it's predecessors. Rogue is just another false-angst-ridden teen who's reduced from a dynamite comic character to just a wooden stock character who has almost no role in the events. In fact, Rogue felt more like an cameo extra rather than a main character. I really like this character and the complex background but after seeing some improvement in "X2" over its 2000 predecessor, I was disappointed. I think they should do a Rogue spin-off movie to make up for this. My biggest disappointment was the small role of Mystique after her front-row seat in the last movie. After being a major staple in the last two, Mystique is almost completely absent after about 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />Storm though is an improvement and has far better roles in this than before. The movie also somewhat tones down some of the emotional weight in favor of tons of action and a dazzling array of special effect. The emotional part is definitely there throughout but in many areas, it gets lost amidst the heavy amounts of action battle sequences and special effects in many parts of the movie. Who knows what may come next but after seeing this, I don't see how they could make another one without the characters who were so much a staple throughout this saga unless it's a total reboot of the film series similar to how "Batman Begins" rebooted the Batman movie franchise after the disaster of "Batman and Robin" a decade ago.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>I don't really like the theme of X-men of comparing these people with special abilities to Jews in Nazi Germany as they are different.<br /><br />Having said that, this story is probably the best one of the lot. The acting was good. The story flowed quite well. The action scenes were interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AVV9LV9UXT6F.html">A2AVV9LV9UXT6F</a><br/><p>Citizen Kane this is not, but it's still a very entertaining, action packed, thrill ride with great special effects, decent characters, and a pretty good story.  I notice that most of the negative reviews are from comics fans who can't stand how their favorite characters were treated in this movie.  Well, this is the movie, not the comic series.  And this manages to be a very entertaining film.  It has its flaws, such as Storm inexplicably losing the accent she had for the first two movies, and the occasional bit of cheesy dialogue, but it's good entertainment, and people who are not dead set on having the comic characters exactly represented on screen will not find much to complain about.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>The main storyline focuses on Dr. Jean Gray, and her transformation into the Dark Phoenix which is quite interesting. Kelsey Grammer also appears as Dr. Hank McCoy, the Beast! I always loved this character from the vintage years of X-Men and Grammer is perfect casting. Beast and the Dark Phoenix make this one worth your time, but don't expect too much -- The Final Stand is just not quite as dramatically satisfying as the first 2 films in the series. This one is a fairly conventional allegory about tolerance with some excellent sci-fi elements and good performances from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halley Berry as Storm.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>Brett Ratner does a good job of delivering an action packed third entry into the comic series with the X-MEN III The Last Stand. I really don't understand the stupid bellyaching against the movie. The special effects were great, the acting was good, and the dialogue while nothing sophisticated fit the movie perfectly.<br /><br />The plot is similar to the other movies, the X-MEN do battle against Magneto's mutants and himself once again. The twist here is that an anti-mutant gene or antidote is being made from one mutant. This will turn the mutants human. Of course the moral tale is brought here once again for the mutants being a "disease".<br /><br />Ratner like Singer does a good job of setting up the action and tension as well as one director can having directed the profitably successful "Rush Hour" movies Ratner really didn't disappoint whatsoever with the exception of perhaps giving a deeper profile of the Sentinels.<br /><br />The Dark Phoenix, Jean Grey's alter ego comes to life and destroys everyone in her path, Magneto seizes the opportunity but even he doesn't realize the dangerous powers she has.<br /><br />It was also great seeing the other new X-MEN in here including Kitty Pryde , Beast, Archangel and other mutants like Juggernaut. Famke Jansen is very good here and sexy as always, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine again knows hot to hit the mark as Wolverine and Ian Ian McKellen in his last stint as Magneto is terrific<br /><br />This is a good old smashmouth action comic book film like the last one and I have to say if this is the last movie that I was pretty satisfied with the work everything did on the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>A lot of people did not seem to like this picture as much as the other two.  Allow me to be a dissenter.  This actually was my favorite of the three.<br /><br />For those who have not read my other reviews on the X-Men movies, the theme of the series is fighting prejudice.  The bad guy mutants are ready to wage war with the humans who persecute them.  The good guy mutants try to live peaceably with humans and even protect them from the bad guys.  This one reverses the plot from the original movie:  instead of mutants trying to change humans into mutants, there is a new drug humans devised to change mutants into humans.<br /><br />This movie has a parallel theme, which is the matter of choice.  As a minister, I'm familiar with the debate over predestination and free will.  In the story, there are humans who think mutants need to be cured, mutants who oppose this cure, and mutants who believe they don't need to be cured but will allow each individual to make up their mind of whether they want to change.<br /><br />One reason I like this movie is it introduces two of my favorite X-Men comic characters that were so far absent:  The Beast, one of the original X-Men (played superbly by Kelsey Grammer), and the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is a mutant in the movie though not in the comics.  Another original X-Man that makes his movie debut is the Angel.<br /><br />I found the ending of the first movie to be effectively symbolic, and there is an allusion to it in the ending of this movie.  I enjoyed several of the little tangent stories.  I didn't mind the fact that Storm got more attention than usual (and the Wolverine always dominated the stories), but many of the other characters have adequate development.  The movie does seem to close up the trilogy, but I would be happy for a spin-off or a new trilogy or something like that.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is so far bye the best X-Men movie they made.

Will this revelation finally bring peace or will full-out war break out?<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn (three of the most GORGEOUS women out there!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world!<br /><br />My only question is what happened to Kurt Wagner from X2-X-Men?  He was great!<br /><br />In short, X-Men-The Last Stand is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>X-Men: The Last Stand is the second sequel to X-Men, and unlike the first sequel it falls far short of the original.  I could spend a lot of time getting into why Brett Ratner is as much to blame for the this as Joel Shumacher was for the near fall of the cinematic Batman.  We may very well be one sequel away from a screenplay riddled with puns and fight scenes choreographed like a Broadway show or Disney on ice.  Don't hold me to it...all I'm saying is that this disappointing garbage is a few more steps in that direction.<br /><br />X3 (because us American's love for our blockbuster movies to have the shortest colloquialisms possible) mimics the Dark Phoenix saga by legendary comic writer Chris Claremont, and it mixes that arc with a newer story I'm not so familiar with. I'm assuming this is where the idea of the mutant cure comes from.  In short, there is a cure available and it might mean the end of mutants, so we might be tempted to ask ourselves some important questions and a better filmmaker like Bryan Singer may have made these questions far more clear and allowed the answers to cut more deeply.  We've developed differently our whole lives, so how much would we really enjoy being like everyone else on Earth?  What does Mystique, a shape-shifter who prefers to walk around blue and scaley as opposed to adjusting her appearance like we know she can, really think of this opportunity?  What about everyone else and how can a director address this with such a large cast?  Ratner is not up to the task of making these observations interesting...he does however know how to direct straight action and make a highly commercial film.  He did his job.<br /><br />Singer on the other hand brought a tremendous amount of emotion and soul to his films, and he did this without being remotely heavy-handed.  As a bonus he could also deliver straight action, but in his films we actually cared about the characters.  In the second X-Men film we got to see Pyro blast some cops in front of Bobby Drake's house and then we got to see Bobby fly away with the other mutants, but instead of seeing some more explosions and loud jet engines, we see Bobby briefly glance at his family who just betrayed him...and we connect.  Here in X3, I honestly just wanted to see the fire guy fight the ice dude.  I wasn't buying into the characters anymore and the all-too-often clunky dialogue didn't help either.  All the characters that were carried over from the other films are almost just empty shells of themselves from the previous movies, so I felt as if I had to think back to when I gave a damn.<br /><br />But it's not all bad.  Jean Grey's return from death in X2 as the ultra-powerful mutant Phoenix is fun to watch and the film doesn't pull punches to work toward a definitive end to the series (another reason an additional sequel could be dangerous). I'm not a real fan of the comic, but I'm familiar with it enough to know that hardcore fans have countless concerns for how there favorite characters are portrayed.  It's not a horrible movie in comparison to some movies of it's ilk.  The real disdain for me lies in how X3 betrays the depth of the first two films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Well I have been told this follows the comic book storyline. To bad. It is worth seeing but it lacks any of the fun that I saw in the first two movies. There is no lighthearted times in this movie. Usually in a trilogy the second movie is dark and the third movie starts that way but has a happy ending. There is no happy ending here, just a feeling of emptiness and loss. Is the action, effects, and story good? Yes they are in fact. So as I said before if you have caught the previous ones you will want to see it. However; this is not a standalone movie and won't make much sense without seeing the previous movies. Fans of the first two movies may be disappointed in the deaths of three key characters. If they had not killed off these characters and had a happier ending I think I know I would have enjoyed it more. And by the way the alternate endings are a joke. They are minor scene changes that were deleted, not a change to the ending itself. I was extremely disappointed that the alternate endings as they call them didn't have different outcomes. Preferably one that didn't kill off the characters. My guess is they had so many people disppointed in the movie they felt the only way to sell the DVD was to make people think they had alternate endings. I repeat there are no alternate endings on this DVD. It is just a ploy. So if you saw this at the theater and were disappointed, do not buy the DVD. It doesn't get any better.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>ok 1st let me thank the makers of this flick for adding in some of the unused mutants i mentioned  in my earlier reviews on x-men 1 and 2.there are still a  number of them left out but they did use some cool ones like the sentinal,dark phoenix,juggernaut and angel,the beast and collossus.there are still a long list of unused mutants however.mostly from the future or simply overlooked.they dont have to stop just because there are 3 parts.theres the whole story about which x-man would betray them in the furure.id also like to mention killspree and halloween jack.both awesome characters.this movie is what the  1st 2 have been leading up to.a breakdown in the system and an all out war between mutants and bad mutants and the humans.like a 3 way dance.the visual effects are awesome!its my favorite of the 3.any true x-men fan knows the story is way longer.i could see at least 2 more great movies in the set.the one i mentioned above and the one where magneto rips out wolverines admantium skeleton.there are a lot of old faces too like pyro,ice man,wolverine,rogue,jean grey and magneto .its a great movie and you should own it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>I love the Xmen comic books and I have to say the characters are really finely done in all three sequels.

Well for my taste anyway.<br />Cyclops dies stoopidly. Jean Grey dies by Wolvie - why couldnt he just stuck the "cure" needle in her and turned her "normal human" instead of impaling her on his claws??? Arrgh!!!<br />The "other", low level mutants are depicted as disgusting transgressions of natural law and dont do much for likability of the mutant "cause".<br />Blah.<br />Who cares.<br />Good fun.

The plot is a bit far-fetched - Jean Grey being an all-powerful super mutant - but it does up the ante (including one memorable death scene). My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer - it seems as if the film is rushed in only 100 minutes. Otherwise, if you liked the first two, you'll love this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>A new "cure" has been discovered by scientists and one very special mutant boy with powers to take mutant powers away, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is shocked about the announcement of this new cure for mutations as he wants a peaceful sollutions to the cure. However the mutant community is very upset over this including Magneto (Ian Mckellen) the most who now hates humans more then anything now, Cyclops (James Marsden) feels bad about losing the love of his life Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) died in that water wave but it seems that she has been reborn as Phoenix who has superior powers to her original but she turns out to be dark and dangerous. Magneto decides to declair war against humans while some mutants do like the idea of a cure especially troubled Rogue (Anna Paquin) who wants to be cured of her dangerous powers. It's up to the X-Men like Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Huge Jackman), and new member Beast (Kelsey Grammer) to stop this war before humanity is doomed including mutant-kind.<br /><br />A very weak finale to the major Marvel based movie trilogy! it's quite complex but does have an interesting concept about curing people who are different then any normal human being, replacing Bryan Singer with Brett Ratner is kind of a dumb move. The film unlike the first two are rushed but does introduce some more mutants like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), Angel (Ben Foster) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) but the problem is that the story is prepostorous and the humor goes way too far unlike in the first two. The film does kill off some members of the X-Men but i ain't gonna tell you who for the film isn't as bad as fans proclaimed, it deserves another look since it's a very exciting finale of the series.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray gives off stunning picture and sound quality high theater-esque that will rocket your system on high with some fantastic extras like audio commentaries, Trailers, deleted scenes, Featurettes, a documentary on the trilogy, Still and video galleries, Vignettes and Blogs, and animatics.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>This would be a good movie IF it were not called X-Men.

Jean Grey is barely used, Storm looks weak and undecisive, and Scott, why did they even have him there? THe movie left too many things unexplained, changed the X-men Universe and forgot to give some depth to the characters. This is just an action film and only that. Only Wolverine saves the day and the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the X-men comic books since I was a kid.  Apparently, they became something else after I stopped reading comics in my mid-teens.  The first couple of these movies were pretty fun and this one provides the big battle Magneto has been aiming at for quite awhile.<br /><br />What I don't like about this movie is the sheer number of mutants.  I mean, there are so many of them by what definition could they be mutations?  And since all their powers seem more or less unique, what in the world could be happening genetically (which is more about conserving useful traits)?<br /><br />Anyway, the mutants go to war because the government has come up with a "cure" that suppresses the mutant's mutantness.  And while some mutants want to take this cure, others feel that it is wrong to cure any of them because it is tantamount to admitting that being a mutant means something is wrong with you.  We see this in real life with a movement working against the notion that it would be a blessing to provide them with hearing.  There are other aspects that the X-Men movies allude to none to subtly that I will not comment on except to note that we all know it is there.<br /><br />The big scenes are all quite spectacular and there are lots and lots and lots of mutants with some cool and some silly powers.  This whole cure thing has some odd effects and it isn't only the tangential characters that get whacked in this one.<br /><br />So, enjoy!  But don't expect to get too much in the way of character development.  And you might want to throw a rubber brick at the screen for some of the plot twists chosen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>It was worth the price of the ticket to see Kelsey Grammar portray the Beast, the blue-skinned, fur covered X-Men with a several advanced degrees. It was a perfect piece of casting. Most of the cast from the previous X-Men film are in Last Stand, one notable exception is NightCrawler (my personal favorite) and a few old favorites were added: Angel, Colossus, Kitty Pryde.<br /><br />The special effects were great, this time around the audience gets to see characters like Magneto, Storm and Jean Grey really go "all out" with their powers. Hugh Jackman puts in another great performance as Wolverine as well.<br /><br />Some X-Men fans will be upset over the various plot lines taken from comics and jumbled into this film but Last Stand will entertain most X-Men fans and non-fans alike.</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>I watched the previous two movies in the "X-men" series, but I almost didn't watch this one. The reason is simple: pretty much all the reviews I read said it was awful. I should have known better than to pay too much attention to them!<br /><br />I ended up going to watch "X-Men - The Last Stand" this morning, because my sister wanted to see it. I had a very welcomed surprise. This movie is probably the best in the series, at least so far. Of course, you shouldn't expect too much: this is a movie designed merely for entertainment purposes, and it is quite far from being a classic or anything similar to that. That having been said, it engages the audience easily, and it entertains.<br /><br />This movie doesn't pretend to be more than what it is: a blockbuster with lots of action and not too much character development. However, that is all right in my book, at least in some of the films I watch. Yes, "X-Men - The Last Stand" could have been better, but it is nonetheless a film you will probably like, specially if you are already a fan of the series.<br /><br />The inspiration for the plot is taken from the "X-men" comics, even though the story has been substantially modified. In a nutshell, a cure to treat mutations has been found, and mutants react differently to that discovery. The Brotherhood, a group of mutants whose leader is Magneto (Ian McKellen), plans to destroy the cure. The X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), think that every mutant should be able to choose without pressures whether to remain one or not. In Prof. Charles Xavier's words "Since the dawn of existence, there have always been moments when the course of history shifted. Such a turning point is upon us now" (...) "I do not know if victory is possible. I only know that great sacrifice will be required. And because the fate of many will depend on a few, we must make the last stand".<br /><br />There is also a secondary plot: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), an X-Men that died in the second film of the series in order to save her teammates, is reborn, but as someone different, more powerful, and much more dangerous. Jean is now her alterego, Phoenix, a force that cannot be controlled, and that might well wreak havoc on the world. But is there any way of saving her? And will Professor Xavier, Scott (James Marsden), Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Hally Berry) find it, before it is too late?<br /><br />On the whole, I think that you will like this film a lot, if you are already a fan of the series. It is more of the same, only a little better. In case you haven't watched the previous movies, give them a try before watching "X-Men - The Last Stand", because then you will understand better what is happening in this film. Of course, recommended :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS1: Don't leave the cinema as soon as the movie finishes, as there is a little and very surprising scene just after the credits finish rolling up. You will have to wait a few extra minutes, but believe me, it is worth it!<br /><br />PS2: There are new additions to the X-men, the most noteworthy being Beast, that is Dr. Hank Mcoy (played by Kelsey Grammer).</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>You would be hard pressed to find a bigger X-men fan. I think the X-men is the richest of all the comic book superhero collections, when it comes to stories, characters and possibilities. Spiderman's the coolest, but X-men has numerous characters that deal with real issues that coincide with issues of the world... like mutantism/racism, fear of the unknown and stereotyping.<br /><br />So, now we have X-men: THE LAST STAND. What? Last stand?<br /><br />The first two X-men movies were outstanding, yet only scratching the surface of the stories that are to be told in the comic book series and its possibilities. The third and supposedly, FINAL film, couldn't possibly do the series justice if it ended the series now. I mean, what about APOCALYPSE, JUGGERNAUT, BLACK TOM, ERIC THE RED, the FOUR HORSEMEN, GAUNTLET, the HELLFIRE CLUB, STRYFE and the Mutant Liberation Front and of course the Sentinels.<br /><br />So, what did the creators of X-MEN: THE LAST STAND do? I'm still not sure. They took, what was the PHOENIX SAGA, or when Jean Grey returns from the dead as an even more powerful Mutant than she was, struggling to control her powers. They took the Phoenix Saga, rewrote it, and hit the fast forward button.<br /><br />Ultimately, we do get to see the Sentinels... for about 15 seconds. Their eyes shining through fog and one of their heads dropping to the ground... only to turn out being a simulator. Then we do get to meet JUGGERNAUT... again, seemingly just thrown in and not given any meaningful air time. We get to meet a bunch of random Mutants, seemingly created by the writers. None of which are of any note. Oh, and of course we get to see ANGEL in some brief scenes... dives out a window and flies away and then appears in the final scene briefly. Colossus, vaguely used. Again, all these cool characters... just basically given a reference and not explored.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot about the introduction of BEAST, played by Kelsey Grammar. He does a great job, but again, just a, "Here's Beast, shows over folks."<br /><br />So, why are they in such a hurry to END THE MOST SUCCESSFUL comic book TRILOGY of all time? They are so intent on ONLY HAVING 3 FILMS that they sped through years of X-MEN history and needless to say put together a hyperactive, crammed too tight, scatter-brained, sloppy and disappointing film.<br /><br />What WAS a story that EXCEEDED all boundaries and had no limits, earth, space & beyond, became a story that could be capped off with a not-so-huge battle on a small island... and done. A disappointing end to what could have been a much richer and much more entertaining series.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>With the new X-MEN finally comes the climax to the great philosophical and physical war between Charles Xavier and Magneto (both portrayed superbly by Star Trek's Patrick Steward and LOTR's Sir Ian McKellen). The original X-men movie is single-handedly responsible for proving that a decent MARVEL superhero movie could be made, effectively paving the way for SPIDER-MAN, which raised the bar even higher for the genre. In X-MEN: the LAST STAND, the mutants of Xaiver's school are back and growing in number as more comic characters are included in the third installment of the film series. Notable are the additions of KELSEY GRAMMER as the cerebral blue-furred BEAST a.k.a. Dr. Hank Mcoy . The BEAST was one of the 60's comic book original X-Men, along with the winged mutant THE ANGEL, played by Ben Foster (6 Feet Under). Vinnie Jones  is  the unstoppable fighting machine Juggernaut(who does not appear to be related to Prof. X in this incarnation). Other mutants returning for extended appearences are Kitty Pryde a.k.a. SHADOWCAT who can pass thru walls, more of the steel-skinned Colossus, more from the traitorous PYRO. Oscar-winner Anna Paquin returns as ROGUE,struggling with her relations & mutant powers. Shawn Ashmore again plays Bobby Drake a.k.a ICEMAN, throwing comic fans a frosty treat appearing briefly in ice-form. Rebecca Romijn is back in her glorious blue nakedness as the evil Mystique and Aaron Stanford as the disgruntled PYRO. James Marsden returns (briefly) as a grief-stricken Cyclops, even his lost-lady-love returns with Famke Janssen again as Jean Grey and more(read story summary below). Of course, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, Jackman is still a perfect Wolverine. Oscar winner Halle Berry is back as the weather-controlling STORM, who finally flies in this one, sort of an homage to their former director's new project (read on.).<br /><br />Along with all the new mutants, another addition is the director himself, losing Bryan Singer to this summers SUPERMAN RETURNS, X-MEN 3 is directed by BRETT RATNER (RUSH HOUR 1&2) Brett Ratner is still keeping with the recurring theme of mutants still struggling with acceptance, their powers and whether or not they even want those powers.<br /><br />I think the plot is more interesting than the previous two....here's the story (plot spoilers ahead):<br />A  potential "cure" is discovered and processed to treat -- and ultimately eliminate -- genetic mutations, once and for all. . Mutants have a choice: retain their abilities, inspite of it isolating them, or give up their powers becoming human. Prof. X, advocate of tolerance between human and mutantkind, and the leader of the Brotherhood, Magneto, Xavier's fallen-friend who believes that bring mankind to their knees is the only path to peace, finally have the battle we've waited 2 movies to see. The X-Men vs. the brotherhood vs. humankind. They must also face their former teammate, Jean Grey's unleasing the Dark Phoenix, her super-powered alter-ego (I mean "super-powered" like change the script kind of power)danger to the entire planet.<br /><br />This is a good effort, especially with the nortoriously unlucky number "3" following the name. It has a lot of the mutant characters we've been waiting for, it even has the long overdue pairing of Colossus and Wolverine in battle together. As well as more effective use of Wolverine in combat scenes, which the other movies do more sparingly than you mght expect. The music in this one is distractly melodramatic at times thought. Also, stay after the credits for a little treat.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>...and the Storm/Wolverine show burst onto the scene.  Yeah, yeah, I know that Wolverine is quite possibly the most famous X-man out there, but this is supposed to be the "X-Men."  Rumor has it that Halle Berry was throwing fits over having such a small role in the other films and refused to do this installment unless her character was given a bigger piece of the pie.  Unfortunately, director Brett Ratner gave in to her request, leaving us with an another uninspired performance by Berry.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) returns as Phoenix, dispatches some major characters and, guess what, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellan) is still trying to raise that blasted army of mutants.  Oh, and the feds seem to have created a "cure" for mutants by way of Leech, played by that freaky little boy that always plays the freaky little boy (Cameron Bright).  The plan is that mutants can "voluntarily" take the antidote and be "cured" of their mutation.  Naturally, Magneto takes this as a threat and rounds up Pyro, Mystique, Callisto, Multiple Man, Juggernaut, and others to recruit a mutant army to storm the island where the cure is being manufactured (that island being Alcatraz).<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful for the most part, but Ratner seems to have depended too heavily on these effects to move the story along.  Where the first two films actually tried to deal with the discrimination of mutants, this flick tosses all intelligence aside and goes into full-yet somehow boring-action mode.<br /><br />As stated before, Storm is given a huge amount of screen time.  She becomes the unofficial leader of the X-men and has somehow lost that weird accent she had in the first two flicks.  She is very annoying to watch as the film develops.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is also given a large amount of time onscreen, but haven't we seen plenty of him in the first two flicks?  Colossus showed up, but he was nothing more than a hood ornament.  Iceman  (Shawn Ashmore) does develop a little better than he did in X-2, but he doesn't get much screen time.  Rogue (Anna Paquin) is almost non-existent in this film.  Her little love triangle with Iceman and Kitty Pryde never really develops.<br /><br />Mentioning Pryde, there are a couple of new additions to the X-men in this flick.  Kelsey Grammar does a wonderful job with the minute role he has as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast.  Ben Foster flaps on and off the screen in a brief role (it could almost qualify as a cameo) as Angel.  The villains include the aforementioned Multiple Man, Shadowkat, a number of needless little thugs and Vinnie Jones who almost single-handedly saved this flick as Juggernaut.<br /><br />The language in this film was senseless.  I have no problem with fowl language in films where necessary, but it seems as if most of the cursing in this film was thrown in just to give the characters a little more of an edge.  The "B" word was tossed around non-chalantly, even used for humor's sake.  I just believe that the language could have been patched up a little more.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Okay, I've covered the flick fairly well, now let me get to a couple of really bad gripes I had with this flick.<br /><br />First of all, two major characters are killed off very quickly:  Professor X and Cyclops.  Professor X is given a little bit of respect and his death was pretty decent, but it was as if poor Cyclops never even existed once he was offed.  Rumors are that James Marsden was written out of the script quickly when it was found out that he was part of the new "Superman Returns" flick.  I hope he does well.  Cyclops was treated horribly this time around.<br /><br />Also, there was absolutely no explanation given for the absence of Nightcrawler in this flick.  Fans of the comic might know that he became a priest for a time, but we weren't even told that.<br /><br />One last thing, did Rebecca Romjin do anything to tick off the folks at Marvel?  Her character, Mystique, was critical to the development of both of the other films in this series.  She was one of the best villains in the lot.  Full of intrigue, sly wit, and even a little heart, Mystique is tossed off unceremoniously in this third go-round.  Granted, they try to make her a little important by having her help the feds, but she's wasted in this installment.<br /><br />In all, this is the worst of the "X-Men" flicks so far.  Hopefully this signals the end of the story, though even that is in question if you watch through to the end of the credits.  I'm almost positive that there'll be a "Wolverine" movie soon, but, to be honest, I've grown somewhat tired of the character.  Hopefully, if there is another "X" movie, Storm will get offed as early and unceremoniously as Cyclops.</p></br></body></html>

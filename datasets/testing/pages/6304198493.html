It had been out for some time by the time I'd finally seen it. My ex was shocked beyond belief I'd never watched it, so he sat me down and made me watch it. He & I are still friends so even to this day, I still thank him for introducing me to this amazing movie. Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the plot. Even if this isn't the usual kind of movie you'd tend to grab off the rack, just do it. You won't be disappointed. It's captivating and smart and the ending is awesome. No matter how many times I watch it, I still adore it. Kevin Spacey is amazing, but then again, he always is in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his work in this movie.  Everything this man touches turns to gold, as far as I am concerned.  This movie is definitely one of the new modern classics ... definitely within the top 50 movies of all times.  Worth the price of admission 20 times over!  Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>Now and then, someone asks you what your favorite movie of all time is.  The Usual Suspects is on my short list.<br /><br />The first time I watched it, I was a bit confused by it.  Then came that ending, that final shot.  It was an "oh my god" moment.  I am rarely surprised by "surprise endings".  They are usually telegraphed early on.  But this one completely had me.<br /><br />It is one of those movies you enjoy more the second and third and fourth time around, always picking up things you missed before.<br /><br />It has a great villain.  That is very important to a story.  There is no hero, which, come to think of it, is odd.  But the villain is nearly of the magnitude of Tolkein's character Sauron.  How about a Kaiser Soze action figure?  No, that would ruin the ending, wouldn't it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>There is much to recommend "The Usual Suspects" for.  The film is surehandedly directed by first-timer Bryan Singer.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  The script, that won an Oscar, keeps you guessing until the very end.  What I'm not certain of is whether this film meets the status as a modern day classic.  It is certainly one of the more ambitious films in recent memory.  In my mind, though, it may be a little to slick for it's own good and it wraps things up a little too tidy.  That said, this film has a rabid partisan following that is understandable and I recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and let them judge it for themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>What earns a film the characterisation "classic"? First and foremost a great script. Check, then. The "Usual Suspects" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether. A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called "Keyser Sose", and the story being told in retrospect by "Verbal" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.<br />  As you try to make sense out of what "verbal" says (while the "facts" keep constantly changing and "verbal" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is "who is Keyser Sose"? And, exactly because "Keyser" could be any of a number of "suspects", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.<br />  And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the "Usual suspects" or a true fan of cinema.<br />  But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of "Verbal" is sharply inspiring.<br />  But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.<br />  The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can "exist". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over "Sose" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is.<br />  The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's "right hand" the enigmatic "Mr. Kobayashi" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.<br />  Mindblowing film. Puts the "C" into classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel. <p>Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<p>The story is told in flashback by "Verbal" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As "Verbal" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<p>Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of "Verbal" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. <p>Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>I was blown away by this film the first time that I watched it. Never before had I seen such a compellingly written crime story that becomes something more: a series of psychological mind games - the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind is <p>wow<p>It is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail. The story, so much as can be told, is that a ship caught on fire outside San Pedro, California, and only two people survived: a Hungarian with burns covering over half of his body and Roger "Verbal" Kint, a cripple from New York. The events are told via flashback, Kint describing how he hooked up with hardened criminals such as Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fenster, and his friend Dean Keaton, an ex-cop and ex-con just wanting to play it straight. As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.<p>This is not a movie for everyone. If in a crime story you need somebody getting whacked every minute and guns and explosives constantly, you might be a bit bored. Sure, there are all those things, but the emphasis of the movie is on its story and most of the film is dialogue. If you resent having your mind challenged and messed with, please do not apply. If you do not want to pay close attention to every scene to try to find out what's happening, some of the enjoyment might be lost. However, the beauty of The Usual Suspects is that nearly every loose end is tied up, except for one: What happened to Keyser Soze?<p>Excellent camerawork and sound help one get into the film. But more compelling is the acting. Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons. Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role. Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly. Kevin Pollak plays Hockney, a pyrotechnic who is worried about himself only. Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot. Kevin Spacey gives his most complex and mesmerizing role as Verbal, whose brilliance is in that he seems boring and ordinary, when, in fact, he is not. Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.<p>The extensive extras include deleted scenes (none of which really add anything to the story) a gag reel (the Keyser Soze rap song was hilarious) extensive documentaries and comentaries. Although they go through the processes of making an independent film, the director and screenwriter offer only a few insights into their craft. Alas, the film speaks louder than they could.<p>This film is genius, pure and simple. It is one of those "questioning reality" movies without the laws of physics being broken and machines trying to kill humanity off. This comes highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It contains one surprise after another. I could never guess what's happening next, especially the ending.<br /><br />If you like a different story with unexpected turns. This is a MUST-SEE.<br /><br />The ony trouble is after you watch it once, the second time is not as suspenseful any more because you already know what's happening.<br /><br />No wonder it got 2 Ocars in 1996. One was given to  Christopher McQuarrie for best screenplay. The other was given to Kevin Spacey for best supporing actor.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>I remember after watching Pulp Fiction, it became hard for me to find new films during those days that excited me. I mean "Pulp" was so unique and original that I was so stunned when I first watched it. I couldn't believe my eyes, it was funny, violent and it wasn't meaningless either because at the end of each story there is a message of redemption. Now it brings me to "Usual Suspects." I didn't really know what to expect when I first watched it because it looked like it was going to be some prison movie. But I was wrong. The plot just kept twisting and turning which kept me on the edge of my seat. It was suspenseful and mysterious, the whole bit with Keyser Soze, it's gold! And the ending is what made this movie. The film truly has THE BEST ENDING in any movie ever made. I'm not gonna ruin it for those who haven't seen it.<br /><br />So I desperately urge all of you who haven't seen it to go out to either rent it or buy it. Buying it is good because this one is a keeper; I have a copy of it myself. It's always fun to watch it with someone who hasn't seen it just to see their reaction. And of course, great performances on behalf of Kevin Spacey (who's career skyrocketed after his role as Verbal Kint) and Benicio Del Toro (whose talent was recognized after his useless role as Fenster where he basically took a guy who only had like two lines in the whole movie and actually was able to turn him into a character that people care about after watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I was rather frustrated with the large number of F words in this movie, as I don't understand why this word is used even once. But, I having already watched Pulp Fiction and Scarface, do know that it could've been worse. On the other hand, I am obligated to give this movie 5 stars because of the excellent but somewhat confusing plot (at least the first time you watch it), the unpredicatable ending, the great shootouts, the neat humor, and the mystery of Keiser Soze. This movie will definitely be a lot better to understand the more times you see it. If you rewatch it, you can tell many things that you hadn't beforehand. Well, anyway, now for the plot. The movie opens with Gabriel Bryn's character getting shot, and the boat he's on gets set to fire. But then, we go back in time with these 5 criminals played by Gabriel Bryne, Stephen Baldwin, the comic but very hard to understand Benicio Del Torro, the marvelous Kevin Pollack, and of course Kevin Spacey whose character is crippled. These criminals are interviewed in prison but never get convicted. You watch them as they hold up cars and so forth. And then comes the scene where the messenger of someone who's either a myth or real called Keiser Soze who arrives. This man tells them that Mr. Soze wants them to hijack a boat and retrieve the cocaine on it. The criminals refuse but he informs them that Mr. Soze knows all of their criminal records. When they try to take this messenger out later, he says that Mr. Soze will kill their love ones if they refuse. You then find out that Soze (which you always don't know if he exists or not) is a madman who killed his own wife and children and killed many other men , women and children. The group of criminals have to now kill many bodyguards and cuban men to retrieve this cocaine. What happens next is amazing and very unpredictable. I won't give away anything else but, besides the bad words, you're in for a treat.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>But if you're spending more on this dvd version because of the extras, save your money and just get the film alone. The movie is still excellent;a modern classic. But the extras are weak and, sadly, in some cases, contrived. Even the gag reel falls flat because of lousy editing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>The Usual Suspects is a very effective movie for several reasons.  One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.  However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending; it works regardless.  In fact, I don't think the ending is all that great, for reasons I will mention later.<p>The story centers around a supposed drug bust gone bad.  Roughly 90 million dollars worth of narcotics were on a ship and a group of notorious criminals were assembled to get the money.  The very beginning of the film shows that things got out of hand and the boat actually exploded, with practically all people in the vicinity being killed.<p>The criminals were chosen by a character named Keyser Sose (so-say) who is so renowned for his criminal actions that the mere mention of his name brings panic and fear.  We see a flashback of his cold blooded nature: when thieves took over his house and threatened his family, he walked in calmly, shot his family first, and then shot the bad guys.  The implication is that he will kill instantly and without remorse.  He is almost mythical, no one has ever seen him and lived to tell it, and some don't even believe in his existence.  All five criminals (played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Torro, and Stephen Baldwin) have done something to hurt Sose in the past, and so this is their chance to redeem themselves.  The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.<p>After the explosion, only Verbal (Spacey) is left.  He is brought in for questioning, given immunity for his information, and on his way out the door, answers a few more questions for Agent Kujay (Chazz Palminteri), where he talks about the whole situation.  We only see what happened through Verbal's eyes.  In this way, the movie is like the classic Rashomon or the more recent and much less effective Basic, where we see information through the eyes of one very closely involved.  How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.<p>The ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.  In that sense, it almost cheats a little, because it's easy to fool someone when you don't give them a chance to solve the riddle.  Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>go into this film with absolutely NO knowledge of the plot, and if you must know some of the plot, only know the smallest portion of plot details. Knowing there is a surprise ending will take away from the rest of the film as you try to study the characters and plot lines. Here is all you need to know: five crooks team up to pull off a heist. The rest should be left for your mind to filter as you watch this film. You will not be let down. ENJOY!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>I can't think of a much better film than the Usual Suspects. It combines incredible acting talent, riveting script, and direction that is remininsce of the classic thrillers of the 40's and 50's. Bryan Singer does a terrific job as the director, and Christopher McQuarrie's script is something all hopeful screenplay writers aspire to accomplish. The script won the Oscar, as well as Kevin Spacey, for Best Supporting Actor.<p>Kevin Spacey is a crippled ex-con who is brought into the police station after a boat full of 90 million dollars of drugs is blown up, along with several people. He then proceeds to tell the police what happened the past several weeks. A group of felons, including Spacey, is brought together for a lineup one night after a cop truck is hijacked, with all of it's illegal guns aboard missing. With no evidence, the police let them go. But the five men hatch a scheme to get even with the cops, resulting in a payoff for them, and a big ... for the cops. This scene is terrific, with the men taking money from a police &quot;Taxi&quot; service, and many officers indicted on transporting criminals in their squad cars for profit. This scheme shows how well the five work together, and sets up the rest of the movie. <p>Spacy then tells the cops that they went to California to lay low for awhile, until a much bigger caper appealed to them. I won't go into further details, but let me tell you that the intermix of scenes of Spacey's narrative and the story he tells is perfectly done. And you have to see the mind-blowing ending. The Usual Suspects is a great film, and I have high hopes that you'll enjoy it to. As for the DVD release, it comes with director's commentary and full/screen/wide options, but it only has Dolby Digital 2.0, so you won't get the full digital sound. Other than that, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>This is an an entertaining, well acted and directed movie except the twist at the end tells you that everything you have seen is a concoction of one of the characters.  This reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock's "Stage Fright" in which the story related in flashback form by Richard Todd to Jane Wyman turns out to be a lie.  This left audiences dissatistifed because they don't like being lied to since they tend to accept the device of the flashback as being the truth.<br /><br />But "The Ususal Suspects" somehow gets away with it, probably because it is simply a better picture than "Stage Fright."</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>The Usual Suspects is a film noir movie set in modern times. I adore film noir movies, and one of the first things you learn about this genre is NOT TO READ PLOT DETAILS! I will not give away ANY plot details in this review. If you get even the inkling of what happens in the plot, it tends to make you "wait" through the entire movie for that particular twist or turn to happen. It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds. That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching. The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled. In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way. Where most movies can get boring after a viewing or two, I've seen many of my film noir movies quite a large number of times.<br /><br />The beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved - Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, and many others. Every one of these actors does a fantastic job. There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story. Again, I don't want to give away the details of the plot for you to "watch for". Once you've seen the movie, there will undoubtedly be moments that stand out for you. But don't stop there. Go back and watch it again. Suddenly you'll realize the meaning in the way someone looks at someone else - the way someone reacts to a specific line of dialogue. It's simply brilliant.<br /><br />There are a number of heavily accented characters here which means the first time through you might not really realize what someone is saying. They do that on purpose. Those people *have* accented voices. It means you don't really understand what's going on in some scenes. Again, when you re-watch, you start to sink deeper into the environment. You realize what certain words mean. You realize the context of the situation. It is a multi-layered adventure and each time you take a look, something else unfolds for you.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for owning. This isn't a one-time-watch film. It's something you see multiple times, share with family and friends, and then discuss afterwards. Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>"Round up the usual suspects."  And so they do - and ending up in the lineup are career criminals Michael McManus, Fred Fenster and Todd Hockney (Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro and Kevin Pollack), ex-cop gone bad gone good again Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and small-time con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey).<br /><br />Wait a minute ... five criminals in one lineup?  There's something wrong here, right?  Right ...<br /><br />In "The Usual Suspects," not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts.  Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it.  The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri).  And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - "the devil," Keyser S&ouml;ze.<br /><br />You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time.  Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur).  You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance.  You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser S&ouml;ze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor.  And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first) ... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around.<br /><br />Among a cast of tremendous actors (to name just two, Gabriel Byrne in one of his best performances and Benicio del Toro, deserving much more than just an "also starring" mentioning in the opening credits), Kevin Spacey's star shines brightest.  To this day it is a mystery to me how he came to be awarded the Academy Award for Best *Supporting* Actor - the only things the man supports (in fact carries, almost single-handedly) in this movie are Bryan Singer's directing and Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay, and that alone makes him the movie's lead character.  But regardless of its title, the award was more than justified, and so was the one for McQuarrie's screenplay.  With infinite trust in the audience's ability to pick up on little gestures, looks and inflections of his voice, Kevin Spacey displays all the many aspects of his character at the same time; and even the tenth time around, his performance still holds as true as the first time you watch the movie.  Almost expressionless he tells his tale, always seeming to give away just about as much as he has to, and only raising his voice for a pointed (and exquisitely timed) expletive upon first being confronted with the name Keyser S&ouml;ze, and for a wailing "Why me??" as agent Kujan tries to convince him that his own archenemy, Keaton, has been behind their failed enterprise all along and purposely let him (Kint) live to tell their story.<br /><br />This is one of those movies which have you quote their many memorable one-liners forever.  (Just look at how many reviewers on this site alone are quoting the one about "the devil's greatest trick.")  To the extent that it cites other works, those citations pay homage, they don't merely copy - right down to the name of the movie's production company (Blue Parrot/Bad Hat); like the title containing a reference to "Casablanca," the prototype of all films noir (or those made in Hollywood at least).  It is one of the best modern examples of the genre and has long since become a cult classic - it's a must in every decent collection.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000640SA">Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A.

Watch the extra features content and you'll see why the combination was so trying for Singer and how one of the best scenes in the film wasn't purposely filmed but pieced together from the few moments when the cast stopped acting like children.  And then there's the controversy with Benicio Del Toro's interpretation of Fred Fenster, which nearly leads to a rebellion by the rest of the cast.<br /><br />As for the film, almost everything has been said.  This is Pulp Fiction taken to the meta-fictional level; it's aware of its own structure.  Somehow, the film gets away with telling more often than showing the audience the story.  Since information and misinformation are both mixed and hidden in the film, the viewer experiences the rare treat of actual surprise at the film's conclusion.  This is one of those films that, after you have seen it a few times, you feel proud to show it to someone who's never seen it or heard about it.

Its got some comedy, some drama, even alittle action (not much, but this is a suspense crime film).  Its truely one of the best crime films ever made, worthy of quite a few oscar noms at least, and i agree with it winning for screenplay and supporting actor.  9 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an unusual, well-crafted, if ultimately mystifying movie.  Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar for his supporting role as the narrative force behind the drama.  A plot as thick as New England molasses unfolds in flashbacks and present day, and with Spacey telling the story, what's truth and what is fiction?  There are some interesting twists throughout the movie, and of course, the final one is a doozie, although if you watch the film closely, you can see it coming.<br /><br />Along with Spacey, director Bryan Singer gets good performances from Pete Postelthwaite as a conniving attorney; Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro as members of the gang; and a good performance from Gabriel Byrne, the supposed mastermind of the gang.<br /><br />The identity of Kayser Solce is key to the film, and it's revelation forms the big surprise at the end.<br /><br />Well done, but not the classic others feel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Kevin Spacey is amazing throughout the entire film. His performance earned him the 1995 Academy Award for best supporting actor (although he had the most lines out of anybody). Although an independent film, word-of-mouth made the movie a box-office success, and is listed as #15 on the top movies of all time list. The R rating is due to some violence, but mostly the extreme profanity, and although the extremety of it occurs mostly in the first 30 minutes, the rest of the movie still carries a substantial amount of strong language. There is no sexuality, though. Fun and thought-provoking, the movie delivers the most incredible and creative ending that I have ever seen. I give it five stars out of five.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>I consider this movie to be one of the greatest thrillers of the 90's.

That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening. Who knows, maybe this film has no superior.<p>A lot is made of the film's ending. Not for a moment am I going to let slip what exactly that is. I would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. While not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece ALL the way through, the ending will blow you away.<p>The cast is, in a word, flawless. Kevin Spacey has, as far as I am concerned, never been better. He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars. But he is not alone. Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.<p>By all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending EVER in a film made anywhere in the world. I mean that. Just who is Kasier Soseh?</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>A movie not geared for morons!  What a rare find.

Spacey won an Oscar for his unnerving portrayal of Verbal Kint, a man at once physically vulnerable and intellectually devious, but the entire cast--Byrne, Pollak, Baldwin, and a hilariously indecipherable Del Toro--bring their gallery of quirky deviants to vivid life. Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie push the mystery past the tidy, clich&eacute;d conclusion into a most unexpected realm, making these "Suspects" anything but usual.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This is the unique story of 5 criminals and an anonymous crime lord. This movie is a masterpiece with an amazing ironic climax.  A few may say the movie is wierd or complicated, but they just didn't understand the thing.  The Usual Suspects is not your usual film, and will probably need a second viewing in order to fill in the gaps in your mind as well as the questions that hit you time after time. This story is great because the plot does nothing but puzzle you for the entire duration of the movie, then in the last 2 minutes most of your questions are answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking &quot;what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again because there was something I didn't quite understand&quot;. No matter how many times you watch it, you always seem to pickup something you didn't quite understand or catch the last time. The scenes don't get boring, the action doesn't just jump in at the opening scene, the films is filled with those catchy film dialogues that are nothing but great, and the climatic twist will leave most of you banging your heads with frustration because you had no idea what was coming to you. The well-chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction. This movie is ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and most importantly, cool. This film is a classic that we can compare all other movies to.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Sometimes what happens with a film is that one thing tends to define it without acknowledgeing the rest of it. Many people remember Usual Suspects but most of them will usually just go "yeah that ending rocked!" without saying anything about the rest of them movie. Well before the X-Men and upcoming Superman, Bryan Singer made this film, a film that is better than that one little scene at the end by itself.<br /><br />Verbal Kint is telling a story about how a boat got attacked and near 30 people were dead. In his story we meet 5 criminals who are called in about a robbery. There in lock up they meet, and decide to team up and take on some jobs. Verbal, McManus, Finster, Keaton and Hockney do some small jobs until a lawyer comes up to them and mentions a difficult job and the one wanting it done is Keyzer Soze, a legendary killer if there ever was one. So the question is who is it and does he even exist.<br /><br />Usual Suspects was one of those kind of slow burner films where it didn't make much money but it did garner 2 Oscars, one for Kevin Spacey and one for Screenplay. Then the greatness kicked in where everyone saw how good it was and it became one of the 90's best films. Most of that was probably due to word of mouth about the twist ending which is as shocking as it is familiar so it's actually been parodied a number of times, including Scary Movie and even Dr Doolittle.<br /><br />What makes the film work is not only the direction, score and the acting but it's a very sharply written story. Extra attention needs to be paid and in many scenes required repeated viewing to make sense of it. While the ending to some might cheapen the film, it works given the context. It's also very fascinating to watch the film; even though the film might have a leisurely pace, it never gets boring or makes you getting antsy.<br /><br />Currently #16 on IMDB's list, it's one of those films where people will outright hate it because they didn't get it or praise it for its complex narrative. I'm the latter and it's a film that definately deserves a buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>SPOILER:  Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of my generation, IMHO, and his performance in this movie is no less than overwhelming.  He masterfully pulls off a gimp role, only to be masking an evil mastermind.  And the stories he yarns while under interrogation are very creative diversions from the ego maniac cop.  The final scene where he walks away is the best part of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>"Who is  Keyser Soze?"<br /><br />Christopher McQuarrie won a well-deserved Best Original Screenplay Oscar for this stylish, mesmerizing gangster thriller, which demands multiple viewings.<br /><br />Directed by Bryan Singer, the story, told in flashback, tells of five criminals who meet in a New York police line-up, then form a gang to pull off multiple robberies.  They soon discover, however, that they are being manipulated by Keyser Soze, a much-feared, legendary master criminal who each has unknowingly wronged.<br /><br />Gabriel Byrne, Best Supporting Actor winner Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak and Benicio Del Toro are the crooks, while Chazz Palminteri is the cop who has to figure out what happened when all but Spacey died while pulling their last job.

Forget the bombast of "Superman Returns",or his upcoming "Valkyrie"... this stands as a film noir classic. Kevin Spacey,Benicio Del Toro,Stephen Baldwin,and Gabriel Byrne are an excellent ensemble cast in this thriller.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects",unlike most thrillers,is more psychological than action packed. Gabriel Byrne stars as a reformed cop while Kevin Spacey is the con man Verbal Kint. There are mind games galore. Who IS Keyser Soze? That's up to the viewer to find out.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects" keeps you guessing. It's a delicious dish of red herrings. And... who is the arch-criminal,Keyser Soze?</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>The final climactic moment in The Usual Suspects is the vehicle by which this movie is mostly either worshipped or despised bitterly. Depending on how you see it, we either feel cheated about such a bizarre, seemingly impossible ending, or amazed at the curve ball thrown at us, under our noses the entire time. We may even wonder if this ending is proper etiquette, or "fair game, for a suspense to employ. Some may have seen it coming, but to those who didn't, it makes for one great surprise.<br /><br />As odd as it may sound, I don't think that you can judge this movie on acting alone. Sure, Kevin Spacey does an exceptional job as Verbal Kint, who is interrogated by Detective Kujan. And Gabriel Byrnne does a commendable performance as Keating, a corrupt cop supposedly trying to steer right, but who gets back into the mix. Some of the performances aren't fantastic, but this is one time where I don't think they have to be. The method of getting to the story's climax is what "makes" this suspense fantastic. With the use of going back in forth in time, from the present in the detective's office where Kint is telling his story, to the past, where we not only learn about the five thugs who decide to the take the big job for Keyser Soze, to learning about each one of the five. There are some plot events that you will naturally look back to as "aha" moments. You can credit the screen writers for coming up with this; a creative job of making this work, which usually doesn't work in movies, or ends up sloppy.<br /><br />In many respects, the mystery surrounding Keyser Soze is what makes this puzzle a little more than the average mystery. As you watch the film, it is actually this character, real or fake, that derives much of the motivation for actions of the thieves, such as their decision to take the big job on the boat. Soze is one of the worst villains of the film, and yet, much of the film you are trying to figure out if the infamous killer is more man or more myth. The mystery surrounding this diabolical character's whereabouts, and his association with evil, seems to give the film's final moments even more significance and tenseness.<br /><br />Smart writing carries this film, albeit with a superfluity of profanity spewed about. Its plot is its main strength, and this is the kind of film you can watch again and pick up on things you missed before. Watch this film remembering to take note of all that is seen, and remembering that sometimes things aren't always what they seem.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Everybody should watch this film.

But each minute brings the viewer deeper and deeper into a world in which things are not as they seem. The plot tentacles from the low-life antics of a group of five LA criminals into a global network of criminal enterprise and motivations that is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />The tale is told mostly from the vantage point of 'Verbal' Kint, a small time criminal who is being interrogated by the police. Kint retells a story that starts when he was unexpectedly included in a lineup that includes the other four - the "usual suspects" of the title. There is a police shakedown going on, the unraveling of which becomes the central story line of the entire film.<br /><br />Great performances, especially by Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, the one-time big operator trying to go straight and by Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, the laconic fixer-in-chief of a mysterious Bulgarian named Keyser S&ouml;ze.<br /><br />Well-written and captivating from beginning to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film.

Pay attention to Verbal (Kevin Spacey) in the scene where Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) is yelling at him. SPOILER OVER!!! My only gripe is that Christopher McQuarrie didn't appear in any of the featurettes located on the flip side of the disc (though he briefly appears in the introduction to one of the featurettes). I highly recommend this movie. You'll be surprised. The movie is also very well-written by Christopher McQuarrie and expertly directed by Bryan Singer (both of them would reunite to, respectively, co-write [with Nathan Alexander] and direct "Valkyrie"; please see my review on that equally excellent movie). This movie should have been rated PG-13 for violence and some language.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Bryan Singer's artful direction of Christopher McQuarrie's ingenius  script, as well as perfect casting, make The Usual Suspects a film  impossible to forget.  David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) , an agent for U.S.  customs, has to find out why 27 people were massacred in Long Beach Harbor.  His only source of information, a crippled man, the only one to make it  out unscathed.  Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) procedes to tell his story of  five criminals who, after being somewhat wrongly accused of a crime, decide  to get back at the cops.  The success of their revenge leads to an even  bigger job, this time for the elusive and feared Keyser Soze.  A man each  character inadvertently crossed, the job is penance and appeasment to the  powerful mobster, a man no one is even sure exists.  Keaton (Gabriel Byrne)  is a cool headed professional, who insists that everything be thought out.  McManus (Stephen Baldwin) is a rash, quick to anger thug. Fenster (Benicio  Del Toro) ia a smart ass with a speech impediment.  Hockney (Kevin Pollack)  is a sarcastic, suspicious loner.  These four, plus Verbal Kint find out  that Keyser Soze is all too real, but who is he?  The last five minutes of  this movie will tell you just that as well as make you rethink the entire  film.  A must see movie, one of the best films of the 1990's.  The only  confusing part about this movie is how Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting  Actor Oscar when he's in 90% of this movie, he should have won Best Actor!  Oh well.  &quot;And like that, he's gone.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>The day after a botched cocaine deal that resulted in a huge explosion in San Pedro Harbor, the only two survivors of the night are questioned by police and U.S. Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri).  One of them is a Hungarian mobster who was severely burned and keeps yelling the name Keyser Soze.  The other is Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled man who, despite his criminal record, has received almost total immunity by the U.S. government.  Agent Kujan interrogates him about his exploits with 4 other major criminals; explosives master Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and his partner Fred Fenster (Benecio Del Toro), and former crooked cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne).  Kint tells a very involved story that goes back six weeks to a police lineup in New York City.  It turns out that the 5 men were brought together by international crime lord Keyser Soze, a man who is equal to Satan in cruelty, shrewdness, and evil.  Furthermore, no one who has ever seen Keyser Soze has lived long enough to ID him, except for the man in the hospital.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen.  The plot is very involved and engaging, the actors are perfect in their roles, and it has one of Hollywood's greatest twist endings.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>What earns a film the characterisation "classic"? First and foremost a great script. Check, then. The "Usual Suspects" has the definition of a great script. It keeps you guessing until literally the very last minute when it leaves you in awe. Story twists and state-of-the-art mind games are dominant throughout while parts of the story could actually be separate films alltogether.<br />  A big heist involving 5 former convicts, a mysterious underground lord called "Keyser Sose", and the story being told in retrospect by "Verbal" (Kevin Spacey), a cripple who is interrogated by a top cop (Palminteri) is the basic outline.<br />  As you try to make sense out of what "verbal" says (while the "facts" keep constantly changing and "verbal" keeps adjusting his story according to the new clues coming in) the mind game keeps climaxing and the myth about Keyser Sose elevates to incredible manipulations. In fact, the basic theme of the film is "who is Keyser Sose"? And, exactly because "Keyser" could be any of a number of "suspects", he could be dead, or he might not even exist the intrigue remains intact till the end.<br />  And what an end this is. Possibly one of the most ingenius film-endings ever on celluloid, one not to give away if you are a true fan of the "Usual suspects" or a true fan of cinema.<br />  But the positives don't stop there. Kevin Spacey doesn't simply give yet another solid performance, he gives a trademark performance, one that many a character have since been based-on on film and doubtlessly more are to follow as the character of "Verbal" is sharply inspiring.<br />  But then every character in the film has dynamic abilities, every character contributes as a corridor to the endless labyrinth of clues you are trying to collect as you watch. Gabriel Byrne and Del Toro, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollack as well as Palminteri are all in superb form here. The second time I watched this film it became very obvious that all the actors loved being in this stunning flick. No wonder.<br />  The director falls not short either, he lets the characters lead and he does his part in setting up the scenery where the elusive Keyser Sose can "exist". A scenery dark and intimidating like the character in question. The main element is the fear everyone seems to out over "Sose" but at the same time noone knows for sure what he does or what he is. The most clues are given, perhaps, by Keyser's "right hand" the enigmatic "Mr. Kobayashi" who serves also as a guide to Sose's power for the viewers.<br />Mindblowing film. Puts the "C" into classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>There's not much left to say in praise of this film -- Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey are sublime, Pete Postlethwaite a deliciously eloquent villain, Christopher McQuarrie's script an energetic, imaginative maze of  twists and conflicts, and Bryan Singer's direction rock-steady, making this  one of the most stylish films of the '90s but still packing it with enough  substance and character to back up the flair.<p>It was nice to see a crime  film that didn't ape Pulp Fiction, instead carving out its own niche as a  cerebral, eloquent film about betrayal, deception, fear, redemption (or the  impossibility of redemption), and identity.

The star-studded cast is a delight to watch, but the film is so fixated on its own cleverness and originality that it quickly loses interest, deadening the impact of a surprise twist ending that may have worked had it had a better lead-up. Perhaps what makes the film so cumbersome is its shift from past to present, and vice-versa. Beginning with an explosion aboard a ship on which a shootout has just occurred, the movie then shifts back six weeks to the arrest of five men, all accused of stealing a van full of weaponry. Four of the men, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), concoct a plan of revenge against the NYPD, and the hesitant Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) joins in. After a deluge of plot twists and scenarios that seem completely out of place, the group finds themselves on the West Coast, at the mercy of a well-known man by the name of Keyser Soze, whose lawyer gives each of them a file documentation of their lives as watched by Soze. The motive: each of them has wronged Soze at some point in the past, and their chance for repentance comes with the raid on a cocaine deal set to go down in three days. All of this is narrated and seen in the mind of Kint, played with a fiendish glee by Kevin Spacey, who turns in a well-rounded performance. The rest of the cast also leave lasting impressions: Stephen Baldwin makes a great all-around bad boy, Benicio del Toro is increasingly witty, Kevin Pollack is the ideal picture of gruff and uneasy, and Gabriel Byrne instills in his character a growing sense of unease. But their talents are ultimately cast into a lost cause. &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; manipulates its viewers to the end, taking us where only it wants to go, leaving no room for speculation or thought on the events at hand. It does this by throwing so much at the audience at once that the fear of missing out on something intrical to the overall plot becomes unbearable. In trying to think about what was going on, and watching each scene with full concentration, I almost went mad. In effect, the ending to Christopher McQuarrie's screenplay has little impact. You will be surprised at the movie's final turn of events, but the material prior to it lacks enough interest or even coherence to give the twist any logical sense. To me, the ending seems more like a blind leap towards greatness than a satisfying payoff to the film's convoluted script. Many will disagree with my thoughts on &quot;The Usual Suspects,&quot; and some may even recommend watching it twice to understand the film's twists. I did, and came up short both times. Aspirations of greatness are evident throughout the plot, but they amount to little more than just aspirations. As much as I wanted to understand the central story, I can't forgive a film that throws so much into the pot that the soup is too thick to thin out again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>Given the strength of the cast, The Usual Suspects was a surprisingly down-beat and unambitious film. It was certainly watchable, but is a bit pointless - in announcing that the subject of proceedings is uncovering the identity of the mysterious Keyser Soze, it telegraphs the fact that There Will Be A Twist In The Ending And Keyser Will Turn Out To Be Someone You Didn't Expect (if there isn't, the film will just be plain dull), and unfortunately the twist is guessable after about three quarters of an hour, and all but inevitable by the time it arrives. <p>Could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>Before the dime drops (or should I say the cup of coffee) at the end of the film, I felt that I had already seen a great movie. And then we find out the significance of the name of the manufacturer of bulletin boards. By the time the last word of the film was spoken, my jaw dropped in amazement. This is an extraordinary film. A film that asks the old question: How can we be sure about the truth of anything? Are things true because we simply believe the teller, who might be a consummate liar? Or do we believe the teller because he tells us what we want to hear? <p>I'm going to stop there because this is not an artsy, philosophical film. This is a suspenseful, action-packed, and strangely-funny movie that has as a PLOT DEVICE our susceptibility to believe what we want to belive--it is not the THEME of the movie. And what a plot device! I can't say any more without giving the story away. <p>So I'll go on to the performances. Yes, Kevin Spacey is great, and all that Academy Award worthiness stuff. But the other actors were overlooked, at least by the critics. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin all do a great job, but Benicio Del Toro's role as Fenster is nothing less than a tour de force! Pete Postlethwaite turns in his standard excellence. Rouding out the cast are the always surprising Dan Hedaya and Giancarlo Esposito--two actors that I think deserve better recognition than they've gotten so far.<p>Behind it all is an unbelieveably tight script and Bryan Singer's masterful direction. This is a must see movie for lovers of crime, action, mystery films, and a must see for anyone who enjoys the type of rare film that is well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, which is something that is not usual for movies today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel. <p>Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger "Verbal" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<p>The story is told in flashback by "Verbal" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As "Verbal" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<p>Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of "Verbal" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Nothing usual about the usual suspects. Twists and turns and all sorts of mind benders in this crime suspence. Kevin Spacey makes the film a knock-out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>I will be brief about Bryan Singer's THE USUAL SUSPECTS. It is often classified as a modern film noir, but though it isn't the equal of great modern film noirs as CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, on its own terms it is a well-made, entertainingly twisty little mystery. It has good performances all around (Kevin Spacey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for basically bringing a welcome wit and energy to a generic narrator role---well, at least it seems generic for most of the movie), and Christopher McQuarrie's Oscar-winning screenplay offers deliciously hardboiled dialogue and, especially, some genuinely startling plot twists---with the final twist being the most shocking of all. Personally, I was able to accept that controversial final twist a bit more easily than many others did---it certainly made for great theater, if you know what I mean. Now, whether it truly stands up upon repeated viewings is a more difficult question. All in all, a very good, not great, thriller, but suspenseful and entertaining enough to be worth a viewing or two---and I'm sure most people who watch it once will feel compelled to watch it again. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>A multi-layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, "Usual Suspects" puts together a great cast and a story-within-a-story plot.  The Suspects include Keaton (Byrne) a disgraced ex-cop; Roger "Verbal" Kint (Spacey), a club-footed petty criminal; Hockney (Pollack) the explosives expert; McManus (Baldwin) who's something of an explosive himself and Fenster (Del Toro).  I'm not sure what Fenster's role is, but given the hushed and marble-mouth tones that he speaks in, nobody else seems to know either.  The story is told in flashback by Verbal after the rest are either dead or presumed dead.  The film begins with the explosive destruction of a freighter in southern California.  Only one other man, the freighter's horrifically burnt passenger, survives.  He knows nothing of our heroes, instead ranting about "Keyser Soze".  Recognizing the name of an international criminal who murders almost on whim, and connecting him to the Suspects, a federal agent (Palmintierri) who's made a career of investigating Keaton, puts Verbal on the grill, forcing Spacey's character to recount how the boys came to know each other.  Gathered weeks earlier by the police as suspects or line-up fillers in the hijacking of a police truck carrying guns earmarked for destruction, the suspects (Verbal being one of the "fillers") are initially strangers, yet join together and form a plan.  Released when nobody gets pinned for the truck rap, the Suspects go into business - targeting for robbery various high-level smugglers who pay to keep the police at arms length.  Soon their rep brings them to the west coast, but we also learn that they had already come to the attention of Keyser Soze - by virtue of how their crimes have come at his expense.  Blackmailed by Soze through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Posthlethwaite, looking and sounding more Indo-Pak than Japanese), the suspects reluctantly follow his orders and shoot their way into a docked freighter loaded (says Kobayashi) with a fortune in cocaine.  By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze - less a man than a force of nature gone bad; a Hungarian criminal who killed his own family rather than let rivals hold them hostages against him; a mass killer who not only hunts down those who had tried to hold his family hostage, but their friends and families as well.  Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.<p>Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.  Sure, you'll probably figure out the big secret within the first few minutes (once a police sketch artist is brought in, the secret will practically leap out at you).  Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.  The ultimate trick isn't Keyser Soze secret identity but how the story gets you to root and care for a crew of wretched, murderous and greedy losers who'd be fodder in a more upstanding story.  The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.  I had an idea that it would be some buddy-buddy picture of good-guy criminals - a sort of "Brinks Job" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Nowdays when somebody talks of some unexpected plot twist in the ending "The Sixth Sense" is being mentioned. But before were "The Usual Suspects"... It seems that I know this movie like the palm of my hand but every time I watch the ending shivers are running down my spine. And every time I think: "How couldn't I guess?.."<br /><br />Nowdays everyone talks about how Hollywood unlearned to make movies for smart audience, that all it does now are some stupid, comics-like, PG-13 flicks. I read some review lately and author was saying something like this: "C'mon Hollywood, wake up, people are not that brainless". So here's the answer I think - "The Usual Suspects" - really clever and shrewd film. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job here maybe because he was young and unknown. Later he released "Apt Pupil" - also smart movie, and then... "X-Men", "X2", now he's filming "Superman returns" - well, it's Hollywood after all :) Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and many others once also were making independent interesting cinema... But it's not the point here. As I said "The Usual Suspects" is a smart and intelligent film and those like it are in deficit now. Screenplay is awesome (and it deserved its Oscar), directing is beyond praise, acting Ensemble is like no other: Spacy (Academy Award too), Byrne, Baldwin, Palminteri, Del Toro, Pollak, Hedaya... God, what a cast! You will definately enjoy watching them play.<br /><br />"The Usual Suspects" is one of the best thrillers ever made, you'll never regret buying it for your collection plus the special edition has many interesting bonus features. I was never more sure giving a movie five stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>I happened to catch this film just by chance on a movie channel recently. I hadn't seen it again since it came out 10 years ago, but it was just as good the second time around. It's a dark mystery and thriller about what really amounts to the ultimate bogeyman--a criminal mastermind known as Kaiser Sose--a mysterious but quintessentially evil and nefarious criminal no one has ever seen but who seems to know everyone and everything that goes on in the criminal underworld. No matter how clever you are, he can outsmart you; no matter where you try to run or hide, he can find you (he seems to have spies everywhere), and no matter how bad or tough you are, he's badder and tougher. In short, he's like the seemingly invincible criminal masterminds one used to encounter in the old comic book stories, but reinvented in a more adult way in this very well done movie.<br /><br />If you like convoluted and twisted plots, this movie won't disappoint you either, and just that part of the movie practically takes Kaiser Sose's brainpower to follow and unravel, at least for me. :-) The script is terrific, and the acting by the entire cast is also superb. The drama and suspense build up from the opening scene to the final climax, where at least one of the mysteries is resolved--you finally learn who Kaiser Sose really is. Although Sose's omnipotent presence is felt during the entire movie, he's never actually identified until the last scene, although he does appear on screen. I would have never guessed who it finally turned out to be, but see if you can figure it out yourself. :-) Overall, still a fine movie that has held up very well and that I suspect is destined to become a classic of the film noir and detective/crime genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The film centers around five different criminals in New York that are locked up together, based on a trumped up weapons charge. After their release, they decide to work together and get revenge, by commiting crimes. However, someone else is controlling the events that take place. The five men soon discover that they are connected to each other because they have all pulled jobs where they unknowingly ripped off a man going by the alias of Keiser Sose. The mysterious Keiser Sose is basically thought of as the Devil himself in the criminal underworld. The five men are thrust into a world of danger and mystery as they work together to discover the true identity of Keiser Sose.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's "The Usual Suspects" is one of the best films ever made in my opinion. If I had to create a list of my five favorite films, it would definately be on that list. When it comes to most mystery films, I can only usually watch them once. Once I know how the film will end, I can never make myself sit through them again because the suprise of what comes next is gone. The thing that impresses me the most about The Usual Suspects, is that the acting and overall storytelling of the film are so well done, that each viewing provides for a rewarding experience despite the fact that I know how it will end. In fact, the film only seems to get better after each time that I see it. The film unfolds brilliantly. It is set up in the format of an interrogation between one of the five men and a U.S. customs agent, giving us flashbacks on the events that led up to that moment in time. The whole film will keep you guessing from one minute to the next, and it culminates in of the greatest endings of all time. Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film, is how director Bryan Singer handles the character of Keiser Sose. The film does a great job at making Sose look like the most imposing and frightening criminal ever, and the fact that his true identity has been kept a secret, only makes the character that much more appealing. You come to believe throughout the course of the movie, that Sose could literally be the Devil himself.<br /><br />Another thing to point out about this film, is that The Usual Suspects probably has one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen. The five men that the story focuses on are played by five very skilled actors. Gabriel Byrne stars as Dan Keaton who is the leader of the group. Keaton is a character that has two sides to his personality. On one hand, Keaton is chosen as the leader because of how cold, calculating, and evil he is overall. But on the other hand, he gains respect from the men he works with for the code of honor that he lives by which makes him likeable at times. Gabriel Byrne places both sides brilliantly. This film also marks the breakout role for actor Kevin Spacey with his portrayal of a crippled con artist named Verbal Kint. Spacey had to do the most work in the film without a doubt because he not only had to perform scenes in the events that unfold, but Verbal Kint is also the man that is forced to sit through the interigation where we learn about the events that unfold and how they went down. Spacey does a great job on both ends, and is also very convincing as a cripple. He also has great on screen chemistry with Chaz Palmentari who plays customs agent David Kullan that interrogates Verbal. He was outstanding, because of his relentless nature. The rest of the cast includes Benecio Del Toro in one of his best roles ever, Stephen Baldwin, and Kevin Pollack.<br /><br />This highly entertaining and suspenseful mystery, will become an instant favorite of yours. Christopher McQuarrie's amazing script and Singer's trademark style of directing, really make this film a masterpiece. The DVD is worth the money alone just for the extras. Some of them include never before seen deleted scenes, audio commentaries by director Bryan Singer & writer Christopher McQuarrie, three featurettes, a gag reel , and much more.<br /><br />A solid 5/5...</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>A great movie with a great cast of characters and actors.  I mention both because the script provides us with a great story concerning a collection of rogues, and the actors truly make these rogues memorable.  This film takes a crime drama and adds a twist.<p>As the story unfolds, the viewers, as well as the interrogating police, find themselves getting more and more enmeshed in the tale.<p>The work of Kevin Spacey in this movie is stellar.

The film marked the breakout of Kevin Spacey and helped him become a big star and win the first of his two Oscars.  The cast is full of superb actors including Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postelwaithe, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Espinosa and elicits a strong performance from the normally cringe inducing Stephen Baldwin.  The interplay between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Palminteri is the centerpiece of the film as the story unfolds in a flashback manner.  Mr. Palminteri is a cop who is grilling Mr. Spacey regarding a drug deal gone bad aboard a ship.  Throughout the story, the name of the mysterious Keyser Soze comes up and it is the identity of Mr. Soze that adds suspense and intrigue to the plot.  The ending is a true surprise and you really don't see coming even the clues are there all along. The Usual Suspects will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p></br></body></html>

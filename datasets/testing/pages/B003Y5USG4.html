Basically, movie after movie was a disaster movie most of them being brainless (yet silly nonetheless). It wasn't until "Twister" got released that there was finally a be all end all of disaster movies, and it was a summer smash. I, at 6 years old, was too young to watch it in the theatre, but I remember seeing the trailers on TV. And when it got released on VHS, my parents made a mad dash out to buy the video.<br /><br />This was one of my childhood favorites. I used to watch it a lot, even to the point where the videotape was worn out so we'd have to buy a second tape. However as I got older I hadn't seen it as much, in fact I remember the last time I saw it before back in April was when I was 9 or something. I dunno how this detachment suddenly happened, but who knows.<br /><br />Cut to April 2010. I'm in HMV to buy Avatar on blu-ray, and when I reach the "T" section, guess what movie I find? That's right, Twister. I had no idea the classic was out on  blu, and so I rushed it and Avatar to the counter to suddenly buy. It was only 7.99 too! And watching it for the first time on blu was a real nostalgic rush. Oh, the memories...<br /><br />Basically this nothing more than a cliche fest with special effects, but hey, it's done well, to the point where you're too busy having fun to even notice the cliches. It has a great cast including Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt not to mention Cary Elwes, a FANTASTIC soundtrack (I loved the usage of Tori Amos near the beginning!), tornadoes, great special effects and is overall just really fun to watch. And who could forget the scene where they are inside the tornado near the end?<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is actually very good. The video quality is pretty good, not great though- not a whole lot of depth, but at least colors are good, and Oklahoma looks pretty. The audio... holy cripe, I had to keep checking outside my window to see if there was a tornado! It is THAT good. Debris hitting the windsheild, a house rolling onto a road having been torn from its foundation, and an exploding tanker truck has never sounded so lovely before. I swear, this is THE ultimate audio experience if you want some good disaster fun.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen Twister, put the disc in the player, crank up that sound system of yours, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't pay attention to the negativity from people who don't know how to have fun and watch a movie. Just expect a fun filled Tornado flick, and try not to get too paranoid about tornadoes hitting your area!</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this back in 1996 when it first came out, my wife loved it, & being a fan of Bill Paxton, I thought it was good, the special effects really blow you away, & you feel like you are in a tornado, but at the time, it seemed unreal from a logical stand point, I mean how many tornados can you encounter in a single day? well, now I can say this movie is real, I experienced this in Tennessee yesterday(4/7/2006) eight of them touched down here in Tennessee, & I personally witnessed one, & DO NOT want to again, I have a greater appreciation for this film now, it is real, it is as close to a real tornado that you will get if you haven't already, I did for the first time yesterday, & it was no fun!!, but this film is though!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I was interested to read another viewers comments about Helen Hunts character in this movie, being interested in Tornadoes, because she witnessed her father being sucked away by one as a child. This is the biggest flaw in this otherwise fairly good escapist flick. I wonder why the Hollywood moguls think we have to have these back stories and then a dreary romance effort, in the midst of carnage, much like the more recent Day After Tomorrow. Was every weatherman inspired by a lightning bolt that killed his dog? Are Lumberjacks so inspired because a tree fell on their brother? the list of possibilities is endless. This could have, and SHOULD have been a great movie. The script and story in general aren't bad, and the special effects are of course impressive. This is a movie remember, so those who want to be disparaging about the lack of similarities to "real" storm chasers should wake up. I for one don't want to see a movie about someone sitting in a field all day waiting for weather. That said, the movies penchant for trying to walk a middle line here (not quite disaster movie, not quite love drama) leaves BOTH areas unfulfilled. Will Helen Hunt get back with Bill Paxton? will his new fiance run away? Will they beat the much better equipped and funded competition to the punch? Will they find a "Finger 5" tornado? - Frankly I stopped caring. I wanted to see a movie about a Twister, and although I was expecting something predictable, this was just too much, and that's a real shame. Getting a DVD makeover means of course clearer picture and sound, and those with a 5:1 system at home will doubtless get a lot from the reproduction here. trouble is however, it won't matter how you watch it, it's still a let down - I wanted to give more but 3 Stars is a stretch, and that's mainly for the CGI.</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MOVIE, OTHERS ALREADY HAVE. BUT, NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE TELL YOU IF IT IS WORTH UPGRADING FROM YOUR REGULAR DVD TO BLU-RAY. THIS ONE IS WORTH IT. COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is clearly one of the best disaster films ever made.  The acting is believable all around and who can't enjoy Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton in anything they are in.  The storyline borrows heavily from Cameron's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IL">The Abyss</a> with a couple who supposedly hate each other and are one step, literally, from signing divorce papers (Paxton's character even has his future wife with him to complete this task and that is hysterical) to discover that they still love each other.  The "future wife", nicely played by Jami Gertz, sees this and respectfully and politely steps aside later.<br /><br />The plot has two antagonists in that one is obviously the various twisters, the monster F5 one is awesome, and the other is Jonas, played very well by the nearly unrecognizable Carey Elwes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LOKQ">The Princess Bride</a> fame who is competing with Bill and Helen's crew to launch a device into a twister to learn more about them.  Interesting note here is that when Bill and Helen feel they won't be successful at it offer their help in the name of science to Jonas (who indignantly declines it).<br /><br />Along with a cast of very familiar faces is Phillip Seymor Hoffman, Oscar-winner for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a>, as the lovable, albeit also annoying, Dusty.  Who can forget his "suck zone" and "at least she can fly" jokes in the film.  He is the consistent comic relief in this edge-of-your-seat film and there are numerous one-liners by others in the film that lighten up the tension.<br /><br />The direction is confidently handled by veteran action director Jan DeBont (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GANOQ">Speed</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783237413">The Haunting</a>) and, of course, the special effects are top-notch.  I thought this film was great fun and that's all it was meant to be.  This isn't supposed to be Shakespeare for crying out loud.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>From the minds of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, Twister has a tornado instead of a T-Rex.  The score even reminds you of Jurassic Park.  But despite this, Twister is a real nail-biter.  I started out watching it sitting on the couch, and ended up on the floor closer to the screen at the end.  The weather effects are amazing - and scary.  The tornados are real-looking, but so are the sky, the clouds, the wind, and the mood - which hooks you in.<p>The romance between tornado-chaser Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton), is predictable, but it is still interesting to see how it unfolds.  CSI's Jamie Gertz plays the third-wheel fiancee, trailing along in hot pursuit of the storms because Jo is still sitting on the divorce papers.  Her refined, Southern character is funny in contrast to Hunt's boot-stomping, full-throttle lifestyle.<p>Helen Hunts leads a huge pack of nerds who compromise her tornado-chasing team.  It is interesting to note that Hunt is the only attractive woman in the film.  It was like the casting agent deliberately surrounded her with unattractive women.  Even her mother as a little girl is a big, beefy, homely farm woman, and her father is a typical redneck.  How such a pretty girl could come from them, I don't know.  One of my favorite characters is Jo's aunt.  She is very unique.</p></br><a href="../users/A77184QJM3PM.html">A77184QJM3PM</a><br/><p>Kind of like in 'Jurassic Park', the actors in this film take a back seat(way back) to the real stars: the special effects. The twisters in this film are as close to real as movies can get, and they make youre hair stand on end just watching.<br />The story starts really well, with a flash-back sequence that shows just why Helen Hunt's charactor is so obsessed with finding what makes twisters tick. However, the story kinda bogs and drags after that, although whenever a tornado appears, the film just kicks it into a higher gear.<br />The actors involved try really hard to make something out of the weak dialogue they're working with, but the main reason to watch this for the twisters. They have a malevolence all their own, and seem to have minds of their own, as they chasedown the main good guys.<br />Again, not much story substance, but with effects like this, who needs it?</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I always look forward to watching Twister. It is so much fun. I wish I can be a storm chaser or just ride along with a storm chaser just one time before I die. This movie is so awesome. It is a must see movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>this got to be one of the top greatest natural disaster movies out there and if not on any list well it is on my list.  see the point of the story is there are storm chasers following tornadoes and they also got to have these little thing to get picked up in the storm to tell them the storm from inside out.  that way to give every one more of a warning.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>yeah, I admit, I have a soft spot for disaster movies whether they be earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, or freak storms. This movie is pretty exciting and does a good job of showing tornadoes, with a fairly convincing storyline revolving around tornado scientists. Definitely want to check this out at least once if you're into that kind of thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>If ever a film was made to perpetuate the stereotype of Oklahoma as a state mercilessly and relentlessly ravaged by tornadoes, TWISTER is it.  As a resident of Oklahoma, I can assure the readers of this review of two things:  1) tornadoes do on occasion occur here; and 2) tornadoes do not come in endless waves, one after another, like some sort of demented assembly line.<p>Having said this, TWISTER is a remarkably entertaining film.  It's a fasten-your-seatbelt, get-ready-to-duck, leave-both-hands-inside-the-car rollercoaster ride, complete with eye-popping, hair-raising special effects.  This movie is a vivid feast for the eyes:  menacing, swirling tornadoes of various shapes and sizes; flying cows; and an endless assortment of storm debris to block the path of our protagonists, from tractors to tanker trucks--even houses.  <p>The plot plays second fiddle to the action and special effects.  Thank goodness:  if the plot had to carry this film, the movie would have collapsed into a sappy and contrived love story.  From the very beginning of the film, when meteorologist Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) locates his estranged stormchasing wife Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt) out on the northern Oklahoma plains and asks her to sign divorce papers, the viewer instantly realizes:  the couple, eventually, will get back together.  Thankfully, Mother Nature takes over and the film takes off. Paxton and Hunt are solid in their performances, yet Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show, as techno-goofy, slightly off-center Dusty Davis, a member of JoAnne's stormchasing team.  If anyone can have a good time in the face of oncoming disaster, it's Dusty (who refers to a tornado's swath of destruction as "the suck zone").<p>Director Jan de Bont delivers nonstop action like a swirling wall cloud; TWISTER is nervous energy unleashed, a cacophony of sights and sounds that keeps the adrenaline flowing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>Probably the best disaster movie made about tornadoes/twisters.  The special effects were really exciting if you can overlook the inaccurate scenes enhanced for dramatic effect.  It was a good balance between the story and the action.  Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton were really good - actually the whole cast was wonderful.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this film in the theater when it first came out, and I was totally blown away.  Twister ranks among the best of the disaster films that I have ever seen.  Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt turn in stellar performances as Jo and Bill, an estranged couple who are in the process of a divorce when they are suddenly thrown back together in pursuit of the most violent series of tornadoes to hit mid-America in 50 years.  In working together both are forced to confront some of their own inner demons, especially the ones that drove them apart in the first place.<p>Of course, no movie is any good without a strong supporting cast, and Twister has that in spades.  From Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty on down to Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg, these actors do a heck of a lot more than serve as backdrop to Jo and Bill.  They help to enhance the story, each in their own way.<p>What I liked best about Twister was the fact that I found it to be a very intellectual film, much like The Day After.  Although to some it may seem to be mostly a Jo and Bill story on the surface, I found myself doing a lot of &quot;what if&quot; thinking in regards to any disaster, natural OR manmade, after seeing it.  I couldn't help but ask myself just how I'd react in the face of oncoming disaster, what steps I'd take to avoid getting myself or others hurt or killed, things like that.  This, I believe, is a key ingredient in any successful disaster film--the ability to make you think about how'd you react under the very same circumstances.<p>All in all, I consider Twister to be among the most superior disaster films ever made.  Loaded with awesome acting, superb special effects, and a great story, this is a film that is definitely worth owning!</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>This film is not high cinematic art. It was intended to be a summer blockbuster "put your brain on hold" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was "Independence Day", which is an unwatchably hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchably hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of "normal family life" by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her "in the field" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialogue with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.<br /><br />A popular internet film database ranks this film as 5.9 out of 10. That is probably correct if you are comparing it with Casablanca. If you judge it as an action film against other action films, I'd say it's probably more of a 7 out of 10. The following are the special features:<br /><br />Disc 1<br />* Commentary by Jan DeBont and Stefan Fangmeier<br />* Theatrical Trailers<br /><br />Disc 2<br />* Chasing the Storm: Twister Revisited<br />* The Making of Twister [HBO First Look Special]<br />* Anatomy of a Twister<br />* Nature Tech: Tornadoes [2003 History Channel special]<br />* Van Halen Humans Being Music Video</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This 1996 blockbuster is full steam ahead adventure!. There's been many bashing remarks about there being no story at all. Well, with a movie like this, a decent plot is really not an important thing. I'm amazed at anybody going into this movie expecting it. Have they been to a movie like this before?. The plot, what there is of it, has a bunch of storm chasers, led by the always appealing Helen Hunt, are trying to get a machine they've created into a twister so they can research them and let people know when and where a twister will land. Helen's ex, Bill Paxton, shows up with his fiance(the always underrated Jami Gertz)and they get sucked into the adventure as well. The special effects are, of course, out of this world brilliant. They are the real stars of this film. It's the kind of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat with pure, heart pounding excitement. And, really, that's a good thing to have. A lot of people bash these kinds of movies for just being simple entertainment. What a horrible world this would be without films like this. Anywho, the actors, including the great Carey Elwes, Alan(Spin City)Ruck, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are all pretty decent. This is a wild ride that never stops!. Pure entertainment<br />and nothing more. It doesn't need to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Great special effects.<br />*Gripping suspense and action.<br />*Good cast of characters.<br />*Pretty good story.<br />*Good, fun dialogue.<br />*Some good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Focus on character drama sometimes overwhelms other story elements.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a good, fun, exciting film.  The special effects will certainly please anybody who likes special effects.  Good comedy, witty dialogue, and a gripping story with lots of conflicts makes the movie even more watchable.  At its core, this is also a good drama about an estranged couple trying to get back together.  At times, this drama makes the film a little tedious.  Otherwise, it is great fun, and would reccomend it to anybody who likes action, movies about scientists, and movies about natural disasters.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>What makes TWISTER such an enjoyable film isn't the individual actors' portrayals (though two of the cast, Helen Hunt and Phillip Seymour Hoffman went on to win Oscars for other films), but rather the sense of mad exuberance that permeates this film, much like another Hoffman vehicle, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00320J6WS">Pirate Radio</a>. Although the "divorcing couple" plotline holds no surprises, the rest of the film does. TWISTER is a rush.<br /><br />Bill (Bill Paxton) and Jo (Helen Hunt) are two storm-chasing meterorologists in northern Oklahoma. They are the couple who are on the cusp of divorce. As a matter of fact, Bill has returned to rural Oklahoma from his job in the city as a TV meteorologist to force Jo's hand into signing the divorce papers, and he's brought his fiancee Melissa (Jami Gertz), a psychotherapist, along as proof that the marriage is truly ended. Predictably, of course it isn't, and once Jo and Bill see each other their relationship, as tempestuous as a twister, begins anew, leaving Melissa to blow in the wind.<br /><br />What isn't so predictable is the pirate energy of Jo and Bill's storm-chasing crew. Nominally a group of scientists, they're really a bunch of adrenaline junkies who get off on putting themselves in harm's way. Jo, for her part, has an Ahabian obsession to conquer tornadoes, since she lost her father to one.<br /><br />Jo, both sexy and ramshackle in her wife-beater top and chinos, reflects her crew perfectly. Their vehicles are dented and battered. They're ballcap wearing, mullet-headed geniuses who whoop and holler ever louder as storms toss farmhouses into the air ("We're in the suck zone! Yeah!") and fix their ratty equipment with baling wire and chewing gum. They hate Jason (Cary Elwes) a rival storm-chaser who has sold out by accepting corporate sponsorship and drives shiny new Hummers with all the fixings and a Doppler radar you can see your face in. Both groups have developed a new technology to inject sensors into storms (Jo's homemade "Dorothy" and Jason's factory milled "Dot"), and it's a race to see who does it first.<br /><br />A veritable conga line of tornadoes begins to spawn, and the crew races headlong over the area trying to "study" them.  Bill joins them, despite his promises to Melissa. Melissa is in hysterics after Bill's truck gets spun like a top by three nearby waterspouts, but Bill and Jo are both exhilarated. Melissa, seeing how the wind is blowing, ends the engagement.<br /><br />The crew dash to the town of Wakita, where Jo's p*ss-and-vinegar Aunt Meg lives, to stoke up on food. As they eat, they hear of an F5 tornado, the most powerful type, in the area, and pile pell-mell out the door to find it. It finds them first, and devastates Wakita, but the huge F5 storm provides some of the best CGI disaster footage ever, as gasoline tankers and combines fly like matchsticks, a cow jumps over the moon, and houses implode. The cow is an inspired addition, the signature of this picture. (TWISTER was also the first-ever DVD release and the last-ever DVD-HD release, and the second highest-grossing film of 1996.) All ends relatively well, though nobody in the picture is ever really down to earth.  Particularly the cow.<br /><br />A great light film that will have you hopping in your seat, TWISTER is well worth owning.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>As movie thrillers go "Twister" ranks just behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LINC">The Silence of the Lambs (Widescreen Special Edition)</a> in my book.  It has a great cast, a story close enough to real that my belief was easily suspended, and special effects creating a herd of the greatest movie "villains" of all time.<br /><br />Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt play a married couple literally one signature away from divorce.  They are modern meteorologists and their passion is chasing tornadoes.  See, Helen watched a monster storm suck her father out of a storm shelter as a child, and now she is determined to launch "Dorothy" - a scientific data-collection gizmo - into an actual tornado so that the data can be analyzed and a tornado warning system designed based on this data.  This is all back story with a single purpose - put our heroes in the path of several scenery destroying special effects.<br /><br />We catch up with them on a big day - not only has Bill come to get Helen's final signature so that the divorce is final, but a storm's a-brewin'... and it looks like it could be a BIG one.<br /><br />Indeed - well over half of the film is spent in about every variety of "holy SMOKES, wouldn't THIS be cool!" moment the screenwriters and special effects wizards could conjur.  We learn in the expository intervening scenes that Tornadoes go all the way up to a Five on the Fujita scale - and only Helen has ever seen a Five, the one that claimed her father years ago.<br /><br />We get to see tornadoes toss around heavy farm machinery like a puppy playing with a chew toy.  Our heroes are out in the middle of it, of course, trying to put "Dorothy" into the path of the cyclone, and giving us a thrilling up-close look at the eye of the beast.  Like a roller coaster ride, we know that every scene with a breather is going to be followed by the attack of the swirling menace.  The film features a tasty and varied <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002N7W">Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>, with music from Van Halen, Mark Knopfler, k.d. lang and Alison Krauss.  In one of my favorite scenes the storm chasers are taking a breather outside a drive-in movie theater.  Up on the screen we see classic footage from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a>, then we hear the familiar approaching roar.  Then the screen starts ripping apart, first one tile at a time, then finally bursting as the deadly twister again bears down on our heroes.<br /><br />Any film with Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Lois Smith and Cary Elwes in supporting roles has something going for it. (Although British Elwes employs his nearly intolerable "Texas" accent. The version he uses in this 1996 film is not improved the next year in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305127565">Kiss the Girls</a>.  I always thought it ironic since one of the funniest parts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BLW4">Robin Hood - Men in Tights</a> was his declaration that "unlike some other Robin Hoods, I can speak with an English accent" - harpooning Kevin Costner's dreadful American accent in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630460291X">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (Snap Case)</a>. But I digress.)<br /><br />Okay - this movie is not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X9FLKM">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray</a>] or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NBNB6">The Godfather (Widescreen Edition)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  But it's a doggone entertaining way to spend 113 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>I love disaster flicks. As a kid in the 1970's I loved whenever George Kennedy stepped onboard an airplane....you just knew that sucker wasn't making it to it's destination! How about "Earthquake", "Meteor" or "Towering Inferno"...loved 'em all. With the 80's disaster flicks kind of disappeared. The all-star casts shifted their attention to "Fantasy Island" and "The Love Boat" I guess? Anywho, once the millenium began to approach in the late 90's, Disaster flicks began popping up once again. And to make it better, special effects progressed from models and miniatures to full blow CGI mega-disasters.<br />With "Twister" coming out in 1996, you get a fun little flick about a group of "storm chasers" hanging out in Oklahoma during tornado season. The basic storyline is that they want to launch a new piece of equipment to study tornadoes from the inside. Basically a trash can full of Pokemon orbs. To do this, they must set the unit in front of a rampaging tornado. So we get Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz & Philip Seymour Hoffman running around the midwest farm country in a beat-up caravan meeting all kinds of cool CGI tornadoes. Luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint), they do this on the same day that about 20 tornadoes decide to ravage a 15 or 25 square mile area of Oklahoma.<br />Sure it's unrealistic, but the special effects are cool. I did chuckle to myself when watching this disk on my TV with surround sound. I never noticed there was a "growling" sound effect added whenever a tornado appeared. This is a fun, summer movie and not to be taken too seriously. Like most good disaster movies, the special effects are the biggest draw. Whether it's flying cows, flying oil tanker trucks, farmhouses rolling around like tumbleweeds or watching a Drive-in movie screen disintergrate, there really is only one reason to watch "Twister"...and that to see things get destroyed. And this movie delivers big time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>"Twister" is a film that I repeatedly enjoy.  I recently got a DVD to replace my videocassette.  Jan de Bont who became a star director with "Speed" & then faded with "Speed 2" & "The Haunting" does an excellent job piloting this project.  The film was nominated for Oscars for Best Sound & Best Visual Effects.  Bill Paxton who was creepy in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AUJR">Frailty</a> plays Bill Harding who is trying to get his ex-wife to sign divorce papers.  Paxton may not have great depth; but in a film which hinges on visual effects, he does a good job.  He shows up with his fiancee Melissa who is a sex therapist.  Jami Gertz plays the character as a prissy, overly organized person who is out of place with these storm chasers.  Helen Hunt who won an Oscar for "As Good As It Gets" & a Golden Globe for TV's "Mad About You," is the real star as Jo Harding.  Jo is driven by the childhood loss of her father to a tornado and researches to improve early warning capability.  She is emotionally still attached to Bill and finds it difficult to let go.  As the day of tornados gets underway, the interplay between the two sparks the film, similar to the great formula for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04FG">Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)</a> where Angelina Joli & Brad Pitt played spouses who argue throughout the action.<br /><br />Many of the smaller parts are well played despite the snippets of dialogue.  Lois Smith who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006TL806">P.S.</a> & played Jack Nicholson's sister in "Five Easy Pieces" plays Aunt Meg who is always glad to see her niece and feed her crowd.  Alan Ruck who worked with de Bont on "Speed" and was recently in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZOC6Y">The Happening</a> plays Rabbit who continually checks maps.  Gary Busey's son Jake plays a mobile lab technician.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who would later be nominated for an Oscar for "Charlie Wilson's War" and win one for "Capote" plays the rock blasting Dusty who talks to Melissa about "the suck zone."  By the time the final frames arrive, we feel like we've been as close to a tornado as we are ever likely to want to get.  There are a few extras on the DVD scenes that give an appreciation for the lean cut de Bont made for the film.  In addition, Van Halen do a music video on what is also the excellent soundtrack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002N7W">Twister: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>Bill Paxton plays in this movie about two people who want to put this "instrument" into the funnel of a tornado to get lots of information on the tornado. Let's just say they barely escape with their lives!<br /><br />  Bill Paxton does a great job in this movie. This movie shows courage and persistance. I really enjoyed watching this movie! I definitely recommend this to you!</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>Even though some segments of Twister are a bit unrealistic, that's ok. The action and special effects are spectacular and the acting and character development are great. From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>It's the special effects that are the star of this megahit; the script and performances are run of the mill, offering nothing extraordinary at all.  But if you like a good disaster film, TWISTER delivers.  Director Jan DeBont(Speed) keeps the action sequences tense and volatile, but the film bogs down when it tries to focus on the failed relationship of stars Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.  Throw in Jamie Gertz and Cary Elwes in derivative roles as Paxton's new fiancee and his self-absorbed competitor, and you have the ingredients for standard disaster cum personal crises film.  But who can argue with the awesome dynamics of the terrifying twisters; the flying cows; the eighteen wheeler oil tanker, and other SEs which permeate and validify this blockbusting movie, which has the honor of being the first movie released on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I have had interest in the concept of severe weather for my entire life and had high expectations for the movie &quot;Twister&quot; and the result cuts boths ways for me. <p> The movie is of a married meteoroligist couple who are in the midst of getting a divorce, and have not gotten along for a very long time and they make a new invention that they believe will help them see what it looks like, inside a full blown tornado. They have ambition to deploy this new technology to disperse 'lighter than air' radio transmitters into a twister and record the signals to see what it may look like inside a tornado. <p> The special effects when the tornadoes strike are absolutely awesome not to mention the chase scenes especially towards the ending when the couple speed away from a tornado drive right through a house that was thrown onto the countryside road by a tornado (Impossible in real life) and the other of when a drive-in movie screen showing a snippet of the movie &quot;The Shining&quot; being ripped apart by a F5 tornado in the middle of the night. <p> &quot;Twister&quot; though suffers from several things and I can sometimes see where some of the detractors are coming from when regarding this movie. While the action scenes and special effects are amazing, the movie's plot lacks a good flow and the film drags on and on in several places and one scene which is just like a boring day at home would've been better left out altogether. Plus the characters are very unconvincing and lack personality. <p> Even for me who doesn't mind ocassional deviation from the laws of physics in movies, some of the tornadoe scenes are completely unrealistic. For example as I said earlier in a review, there is no way a twister could fling a whole house across a countryside road or even roll the whole intact house across the countryside because most houses are built on foundations and strong tornadoes in real life  would shed houses into tiny pieces or otherwise reduce them to ruin. An F5 tornado would leave nothing of a house behind and can even rip the pavement off a road if the conditions warrant. \<p> This movie is nonetheless worth watching just for the tornadoes alone but this movie could have been a lot better than it turned out to be. While having it's share of flaws Roland Emmerich's &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot; is far superior on many levels and corrects a lot of the flaws of &quot;Twister&quot; in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Special effects are a bit weak, and it is a little dummed down, but this movie will bring back memories for anyone who has been through this kind of weather catastrophe.  It captures the emotions of a real life disaster, life or death situations. <p>It brought back memories of the Oakfield tornado in FDL County, Wisconsin...a weather event I covered for the Fond du Lac radio station KFIZ.  Helen Hunt is excellent in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>Some time ago I had the chance to see the movie Twister.  This is a movie about some tornado chasers and the biggest storm system on record.<p>A group of tornado chasers are out to test a new device that will provide researches with enough data to give a fifteen-minute tornado warning (as opposed to the current three-minute warning).  There is a rush to succeed as an evil associate with lots of funding has stolen the idea and is out to get the data first.  Throw in some special effects tornados and the result is Twister.<p>On the side of the good guys is a researcher who has an almost-psychic link with tornados and is thus able to predict their paths better than any instruments.  But then you have the common problem of scale that occurs when special effects are added to live footage.  Half-a-mile looks pretty small in this film.  Half-a-mile is the supposed diameter of the film's final funnel cloud.  Unlike Crichton's other films of this nature, the scientific breakthrough is not lost at the end and therefore the film fails to fit the real world.  But despite these things, this is a edge-of-the-seat, white-knuckle film.  If you like action and tension then this is a film to see.  While, in my opinion, the story is very implausible, the movie succeeds in affecting the audience as planned and that is a rare thing.  So I have to recommend this movie to those who have not seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>In everyday Hollywood the Tornado is only a fancy but good effect but in Oklahoma in 1999 it was a reality as in 3 years later in November when a recorded unheard of 70 twisters had<br />touched down in a midwestern town my point is that Twister is<br />a film that should have been exactly what it was and no less<br />due to respect of reality to the real people who have been<br />through the real twisters that could tell you what an F-5<br />looks feels and sounds like.Everyday occurances like this<br />Hollwood could not resist and they had a huge summer hit.<p>  Jo at the beginning of the film just a little girl<br />her family is terrorized when her home is hit by an F-5<br />a tornado that can be in excess of 250 to 314 miles an<br />hour she tragically loses her father in the monster.<br />Now we come to present day in the film Bill Thornton who<br />is played by (Bill Paxton) and Dr.Melissa Reeves(Jami Gertz)<br />who are engaged are visiting a much older Jo(Helen Hunt)<br />to finalize there divorce.But little does Bill know that<br />he will coming on for a much further trip then just divorce<br />papers when he sees his old crew and the new satillite that<br />Jo has improved on that was his vision TOTO(Totable Tornado<br />Observatory)which he affectionately calls Dorthy.<p>  Having spats along the way with his fiance povides humor<br />but when the leechey Jonas Miller(Carey Elwes)thwarts there<br />misson and come up with the same idea as Bill a showdown is<br />looming as Bill tells Jo that weither Dorthy flies or not<br />he will leave in two days,this puts Twister into action ,<br />trying to beat Jonas to the punch and to get close enough to<br />the Tornadoes to release there cargo,they make a pit stop<br />at Aunt Megs (Loius Smith),where Twister get's a little bit<br />of an emotional storyline that Jo may still have feelings<br />for Bill Thornton,but after this scene Twister picks up and<br />pretty much gets right to the point,in one scene that is the<br />scariest of Twister at a drive in a Tornado looms as the<br />tension builds as the F-4 rips right through the drive in<br />and the town of Wetchitaw where Aunt Meg is the team hurrys<br />to save her life and when they do only to find that an F-5<br />is on the way,they must do anything and everything they can<br />to get there cargo in the monster of a twister so they can<br />save lives.<p>  Jan De Bont's tense and taught thriller is not without<br />it's humor Dusty(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)is the comic relief<br />in this film and provides laughs, the story between Bill Thornton<br />and Jo is romantic but is just not what the doctor orderd in a<br />film that has a title like Twister which is the real star with<br />incredible special effects from Industrial Light and Magic we<br />can now see what happens from outside and inside a twister but<br />the sustained F-5 at the films climax is incredible as it ,<br />destroys houses levels buildings , throws tractors and an oil<br />tanker and gives our charachters a run for there money.<p>  Twister has a worth while commentary from Jan De Bont<p>and is produced by Michel Chriton it has two documentarys<br />and is featured in DTS 5.1. that well if you don't know<br />what a tornado sounds like this is the closest your going<br />to get in fact the sound is so clear that it's the second<br />best iv'e heard next to Saving Private Ryan hey this may<br />not be an Award winning film but it's one that is worth<br />adding to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>In order to really appreciate this film you must overlook the obvious.  Such as the fact that many times these tornado chasers somehow seem not to be effected when they are close to the whirlwind.  The special effects are good overall.<p>The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton really pulled me in to the feelings.  The fight in the truck when they get together again is classic.  The characters that they are portraying remind me of many average Jane and Joe's across the country.  The wide variety of personalities that add to the supporting cast are excellent.  Each one, in their own, adding to the overall mood of the movie.  <p>This movie is entertaining (as movies should be) and the flaws are very easily overlooked.

It just keeps twisting around, and around, and around...owww.<p>Don't get me wrong.  It is a visual feast, but so improbable even if it does open up under the premise of &quot;the worst storm activity&quot; in who-knows-how-long.  It's still improbable all the same and our bad guy (Mr. Elwes himself of Princess Bride fame) is not so much a bad guy but an excuse to provide Bill Paxton &quot;motive.&quot;  If you can call it that.  Wrap that around a confused separated-but-rediscovering-love plot twist and you wind up with a cookbook Hollywood film bound to please Hollywood executives with $$$.<p>It's not bad.

It was good in terms of both story and effects. I wasn't blown away to the degree of some by the effects but they were good and they did get the point across.<br /><br />The story is of a young researcher of tornados played by Helen Hunt. She runs a budget operation trying to study tornados. She has invented a gizmo to actually get into the heart of the beast and get incredible amounts of data. The catch is that you have to get really close to deploy it. In competition with her is a blowhard who is well financed, arrogant and who has stolen the plans for her gizmo. Into this state of affairs comes the husband, played by Bill Paxton, who wants her to sign the papers to finalize a divorce so he can re-marry. He too is a former tornado researcher. As he tries to get her to sign the papers, he gets sucked back into storm chasing and it is practically required that he get sucked back into the marriage as well.<br /><br />It's well done, interesting, at times funny and at times exciting.

This DVD version tops the horrid Full-Frame VHS copy by a mile.<br /><br />Sure, this film is a bit overdone in many places, I suppose. And there are enough contrivances to fill up a football stadium -- but it's still a lot of fun to watch nonetheless.<br /><br />Many people have praised the tornado special effects in &#34;Twister&#34;. But, in my opinion, I found most of the CGI tornado footage in the film to look a tad bit on the &#34;phony&#34; side. I think some of these tornadoes look a little &#34;too perfect&#34; to be &#34;real&#34; looking.  The majority of twisters I've seen in pictures and on video haven't really looked like these so-called &#34;real&#34; storms we see in this motion picture. The movie's twisters, while impressive and imposing, just don't look quite &#34;right&#34; if you ask me.<br /><br />In addition, I found some of the sound effects during the tornado scenes to be a bit odd. The filmmakers have seemingly added some unusual-sounding noises to these windstorms. Since when do twisters emanate &#34;groaning&#34; noises? I've always heard that an approaching tornado sounds just like a freight train. I don't think there's any &#34;freight train&#34; sounds in this whole movie. The movie's storms seem to like to groan and whine; almost as if the filmmakers were attempting to make the tornadoes seem like &#34;living creatures&#34;. Most curious, IMO. But, oh well... :)<br /><br />The flying cows and flying tractors are probably a bit on the exaggerated side as well, but it's all in good fun -- and nobody gets hurt by the orbiting moo cows, etc., thanks to Bill Paxton's expert skills of driving directly through the center of an F4 or F5 monster tornado -- a handy skill to have in this film.<br /><br />Plus: the &#34;flying cow&#34; scene is redeemed by Bill's funny line of dialogue after being warned by Jo (Helen Hunt) of a SECOND flying moo cow in the vicinity -- &#34;Actually, I think that was the same one.&#34; (LOL!)<br /><br />Besides the massive amounts of really windy weather that we experience in the movie, another of the main reasons this motion picture appeals to me (and remains highly re-watchable) is the sheer likeability of the film's characters. The main stars of the film (Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton) perform their tasks fairly well, but it's the secondary (supporting) characters that I really found the most engaging in &#34;Twister&#34; -- such as Jami Gertz, who plays the new woman in Paxton's life. In addition to Gertz, I really like each of the characters that make up the tornado &#34;chase team&#34;, including Alan Ruck (&#34;Rabbit&#34;) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (&#34;Dusty&#34;).<br /><br />The actors that were employed to represent the team of storm-chasers here seem to me to be 'just right'. That guy &#34;Dusty&#34;, in fact, looks perfect for his part. He's totally believable, IMO, as the kind of sloppy-looking, off-the-wall guy who does nothing but chase funnel clouds across the landscape. He gets in a few good zingers of dialogue during the film, too.<br /><br />This Warner Brothers' single-disc DVD of &#34;Twister&#34; delivers the goods very nicely. The disc contains a good-looking Anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen print and three different 5.1 Surround soundtracks (a DTS track, along with English 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DD).<br /><br />This movie is well-suited, I think, for the really-wide &#34;scope&#34; aspect ratio we get here (2.35:1). A nice-quality video transfer makes the movie shine on this DVD.<br /><br />The DVD has some bonuses worth checking out as well. ..... There's a 2-person Audio Commentary Track, which includes participation by the film's Director (Jan de Bont). In addition to that, the disc has 2 behind-the-scenes featurettes -- &#34;The Making Of 'Twister' &#34; (run time of 13:50) and &#34;Anatomy Of A Twister&#34; (8:32). &#34;Anatomy&#34; takes us on a nice little tour showing how the special effects for the film were accomplished. For some reason, the DVD package only shows the &#34;Anatomy&#34; documentary feature, and omits the other (longer) featurette. But there *are* two separate mini-docs on the disc.<br /><br />A Van Halen music video, 2 Theatrical Trailers, and some text-only &#34;Cast & Crew&#34; Notes are also included as Special Features on the DVD.<br /><br />Some additional information about this DVD can be found below:<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; &#34;Twister&#34; was Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for &#34;Intense depiction of very bad weather&#34; (ROFL!! That MPAA blurb kills me! Just imagine what rating a film about a Category 5 hurricane would garner! That'd probably get an NC-17! LOL!)<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Feature Film Run Time -- 1 hour, 53 minutes.<br /><br />&#62;&#62; Scene Index, located on inside flap of the &#34;Snapper&#34; case.

Just as more and more videos of twisters appeared on nightly TV in the 90s this movie came out.<p>One thing this movie is though it is an great introduction, in a bit of a farcical way to the science of tornados.  This season of twisters has been very devastating and with so many storm chasers today, there are even what they call 'chaser jams' as the cars load the roads.  Unlike the competition in the movie for who will get the best view, there is a courtesy.<p>However, this movie has great special effects, the cow in the air scene was somewhat comical.  Touching was the scene of the destruction of a friends house, and horrifying was the scene just prior to it of a twister hitting a drive-in theater.<p>Hunt and Paxton work together well in this movie.  The attempt to outrun the category 5 at the end was a bit unreal, yet you are on the edge of your seat as the 1/2 a mile wide funnel gets ever closer.<p>I have purchased this movie as a gift for friends and have it on my want list for the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Twister is one of those goofy fun movies filled with colorful characters that you wish you could hang out with. The special effects are mesmerising but the one element that makes the film work is its well-developed characters. Helen Hunt's JoAnne Thornton-Harding and Bill Paxton's William 'Bill' Harding take up most of the spotlight but its Philip Seymour Hoffman's Dustin 'Dusty' Davis, Lois Smith's Aunt Meg Greene, and Jami Gertz's Dr. Melissa Reeves who have the best lines. All of these performers bring a natural grace to their roles and each time I watch their performances, I feel like I'm being reunited with old friends. I wish all my dinner table conversations were as fun as that one at Aunt Meg's. Kudos to director Jan DeBont who does a wondeful job following up his previous film Speed (1994) and to composer Mark Mancina who writes the best musical score of his career. I would have preferred seeing the movie end one twister before it did but that's a small nitpick with an otherwise entertaining movie.  Twister is a film you can watch again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Even if the melodramatics and the dialogue are contrived, TWISTER is still one of the best of the latter-day disaster films.  Much more realistic than a volcano turning L.A. into lava (VOLCANO) or a gung-ho uprising against evil aliens (INDEPENDECE DAY), the subject at the center of this 1996 sci-fi/disaster movie is one of the deadliest manifestations of nature--the tornado.<p>Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton portray scientists who, though they are on the edge of divorcing, are soonthrown back together when extremely violent storms form on the eastern fringe of the Rockies and soon sweep into the Midwest, an area known as "Tornado Alley."  Paxton looks upon it as a science, but Hunt is much more obsessive about it; she has been ever since a twister in June 1969 killed her father.  Caught up in this whole tornado business is Paxton's intended next wife (Jami Gertz).<p>Competing with a former partner (Cary Elwes) of theirs whom Paxton refers to as a "night crawler", Hunt and Paxton continually try to get their new tornado mapping device they call "Dorothy" (inspired by THE WIZARD OF OZ) into the heart of one of these dark and deadly storms.  They finally manage to do it with a monster twister measuring a mile wide at the base, but they nearly become casualties of that monster.<p>Despite the contrivances, TWISTER works because of the fine performances of Hunt and Paxton, who work good together even when they're bickering.  The film itself has a very kinetic, suspenseful, and downright frightening quality to it, thanks in large part to the direction of Jan DeBont (SPEED) and the realistic premise of the screenplay by Michael Crichton (JURASSIC PARK; WESTWORLD) and his wife Anne-Marie Martin.  The tornado effects, including the flying cow, the runaway debris, and the fuel tanker, are all quite hair-raising.<p>This is about as realistic a disaster film as there has been since the grand-daddy of all disaster films, Irwin Allen's 1974 epic THE TOWERING INFERNO.  It may not be an unflawed film, but it's definitely better than average.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>&quot;Twister&quot; succeeds on its face because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, a great special effects movie.  The plot is uninspired, the acting is pretty good but not exceptional, but the special effects make the film.  The tornado sequences will literally and figuratively blow you away.  Some of the scenes defy credibility (our heroes manage to outrun a monster tornado on foot, yeah, right) but this isn't a movie that begs to be taken seriously; grab the popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.  And just as the real star of &quot;Cat Ballou&quot; was Lee Marvin's drunken horse, so the character who steals &quot;Twister&quot; is a cow caught up in the turbulent winds turning mad somersaults in midair, looking thoroughly bemused.  It's priceless scenes like this one that define the movie and make it so much fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.<br /><br />Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It's not ordinary, either.  It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.<br /><br />This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.<br /><br />Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through.  What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie.<br /><br />Favorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That's just one of MANY awesome scenes.<br /><br />The storyline is really good too.  It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There's a lot more to it than that.  It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).<br /><br />This is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don't GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I didn't really care about the disappointingly appalling plot (Jo and Bill's divorce/Jonas's hunger for fame) I just enjoyed every minute of when those tornadoes, both small and humongous, were destroying everything in its path.

Unfortunately, people get in their way.  The special effects are top-notch, but the story is so full of little Hollywood tricks, it's hard to take. <p> Why can't Helen Hunt be interested in tornadoes just because, well, tornadoes are interesting?  That's not good enough for this flick, so the screenwriters throw in a flashback to the terrifying twister that killed her dad.  It's as if they don't think the audience would believe and intelligent, attractive young woman would fritter away her life pursuing such an esoteric field of interest otherwise.  Just a touch of Freudian silliness and typical screenplay shorthand that substitutes for real characterization.  I was hoping that very same tornado would come back at the end so she could get revenge, but no such luck. <p> Also, you can tell Bill Paxton's the good guy because he has some sort of mystical connection with the twisters- plus, his crew are a bunch of rock-n-roll tornado cowboys.  They make supercells fun! <p> And Cary Elwes is the bad guy because not only can he not sense tornadoes, but he's in it for money.  It helps, too, that he drives around in all-black high tech vehicles.  Thanks for telegraphing that, people.  But then again, it's pretty easy to predict everything that's going to happen in the movie. <p> On the positive side, you get to see plenty of tornado mayhem and that's worth at least one star.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie only adds up to another.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was one of the first DVDs on the market and it was done very well. The special effects are great (the kind where they are so good that you do not realize that they are special effects). The sound is very good. The movie itself is very good. The actors are excellent and help move the plot along at a good clip. Although somewhat predictable, it seems more true-to-life than many films. I have bought several hundred DVDs and sold many, but this is one that I plan to keep.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I'm a huge Michael Crichton fan.  But, I've noticed that the best of Micheal Crichton is still unavailable on Blu-ray.  Even though I'm not particularly fond of Jurassic Park, it is considered his most famous story and film, and yet not available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />"Twister" is Okay.  It's not Michael Crichton's best story writing film effort.  Far from it.  And the other known Micheal Crichton film currently available on Blu-Ray is "Sphere".  It's had mediocre reviews, but yet it too, has been made available on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I'm not particularly fond of "The Andromeda Strain", but I'd appreciate it over "Twister" and "Sphere", as I'm sure many people do.  But, these are the Micheal Crichton films that I am sure MANY people are anxious to see remastered in High Definition on to Blu-ray.  Prepare to get a hard-on when you see all these great movies suggested all in one sentence:<br /><br />"Westworld", "Coma", "The Great Train Robbery", "Runaway", "Looker", "The 13th Warrior", "Rising Sun", "Congo", and "Disclosure."<br /><br />These are the one's that we are waiting for on Blu-Ray.  Perhaps we could get a box set put together like they did for Stanley Kubrick since he's dead now, too.  One less person they'll have to pay royalties to.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I don't know if I would've forgiven this movie more if I hadn't had an amateur meteorologist with me when I saw it or not.  But I did.  And his constant interjections of "that would NEVER happen" got so annoying that I finally had to say:<br /><br />"Hey, I never went to Weather School but I KNOW that couldn't happen!"<br /><br />My hopes were also high since Michael Crichton's name was on the screenplay.  But then again, so was his wife-at-the-time listed as a screenwriter.<br /><br />But what really got me was that this Hollywood monstrosity had an opportunity to use the best sound and state-of-the-art visual effects to show the raw power and terrifying danger of a real tornado...and they instead chose to pay endless homages to THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Have you ever been in a tornado?  I have.  Nobody's pausing to calmly and safely watch barnyard animals float by.  This movie totally trivialized that stark terror.<br /><br />Whatever tires were on that pick-up truck that Bill Paxton drove around with Helen Hunt and Jamie Gertz had to be magic: somehow houses and tanker trucks could be tossed around like crazy--but not that pick-up truck!<br /><br />Storywise, you can also see everything coming from a mile off.  I'll bet everyone can guess how the relationships will end within the first 20 minutes.  Characters are so broad that I wondered if the two groups of scientists were in this movie or if they were the two competing summer camps in MEATBALLS.  Of course the bad scientists--and they're bad because they drive new black vehicles--are going to suffer the most at the hands of nature.  Of course the leads will have their happy ending.  Of course the tornado will strike the drive-in movie theatre when Jack Nicholson sticks his face through the door in the clip from THE SHINING (I knew that was going to happen as soon as they showed the movie marquee).<br /><br />If this movie had Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay's name in the credits, I wouldn't be able to be so critical.  I just expected more from Michael Crichton.</p></br><a href="../users/AT2BYFEVLVITT.html">AT2BYFEVLVITT</a><br/><p>When i saw this at the movies, I thought it had one of the coolest opening  scenes i'd seen, and the effects throughout the movie were great. After  seeing the movie a few times, the ooOO's and ahhh's have worn off, and I  really notice how cheesy the acting in this movie is. I still think that  the movie is half decent because of the special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>In the movie, the twister destroys a drive-in while The Shining is showing on the screen.  One could only imagine that this amounted to a review of The Shining.  I don't agree with this review.  The Shining is a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>I love Tornados.  I love reading about them and I love watching tornado videos.  And that's why this film was such a collosal disappointment to me.  Yes, the special effects are teriffic, but the screenplay is SO corny and contrived that I found myself wishing that all of the human characters would be anihilated.  Problem number one is Jamie Gertz's character, the girfriend of Bill Paxton's hero character.  She serves absolutely no purpose and every moment she is on screen is like fingernails on the blackboard.  Then there's the alleged romance between Helen Hunt and Paxton that is completely contrived and predicatble.  Let's also throw in an incredibly stupid subplot involving so &quot;bad guy&quot; rival scientists (&quot;bad&quot; only because they have the audacity to take better paying jobs and to have theories that differ from the heroes).  The film also makes the fundamental scientific mistake of referring to the climax tornado as an &quot;F5&quot; when that scientific description refers to the damage a tornado causes, not its appearance.  Believe me, I could keep going.<p>Bottom line is that the screenplay for this film was written at about the level of a ten-year-old.  It has as many surprises and about as much drama as a Saturday morning cartoon.  Any weather-phile with a brain will likely be sorely disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I always liked Twister but mosty because of the fun special effects. The characters themselves are annoying and you actually wish they'll die because who in the hell is dumb enough to chase a tornadoe anyway ? lol. Bill Paxton plays a guy who can sense when a tornadoe is coming and when it's gonna strike when I heard that's not possible. Helen Hunt plays a nutball who's obsessed with chasing a tornadoe because one killed her father when she was little. Paxton and Hunt try hard but their roles are dumb as is the script. Also annoying in supporting roles are Philip Seymour Hoffman "who's a much better actor now and Jamie Gertz (Lost Boys) as Paxton's g/f. The Tornadoe itself is what makes the movie worth watching. The scenes with flying cows, tractors and gasoline trucks help make the movie more fun. The movie would've been better if was about just normal people trying to survive through a tornadoe that's hitting their town.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>&quot;Twister&quot; is a success in many different ways, mainly due to the incredible use of special effects that went into its making. A movie about lots of big storms and at least five different tornadoes calls for some of the most sophisticated digital effects on the market, and on that basis, the movie delivers. The action is quite intense, and certain scenes call on some old-school clich&eacute;s that we'll all recall from past disaster films. In fact, the only place in which the movie fails is its story, despite a very talented cast. <p>I would say that it started a revolution in the movies of today: nowadays, moviemakers seem to think that the bigger the effects, the better the movie, regardless of characterization or story. This is definitely the case with such movies as &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Armageddon,&quot; and there are movies that seem to get the formula for effects and story evened out, but rarely. In this case, &quot;Twister&quot; is more about the special effects show than about anything else. <p>Beginning appropriately enough with (duh!) a tornado, young Joe (played in adulthood by Helen Hunt) is traumatized by the death of her father, who was sucked up in the twister while trying to hold the storm cellar door in place as the tornado comes wailing overhead. This is one of the movie's unexplained events: he is holding the door in place so that his wife and daughter would not be sucked out of the cellar, so when he disappears, why are they still standing there? Also unexplained is the absence of her mother for the rest of the movie: did she die? Was she abducted by aliens? Guess we'll never know.<p>Moving on in years, the present day finds Joe and a crew of storm chasers doing what they love: spotting twisters. It is here that the baggage piles on heavily: her ex-husband, Bill (played by Bill Paxton), wants her to sign divorce papers so he can marry his new girlfriend, who, annoying enough, tags along for most of the movie's ride. Because he wants her to sign the papers, he follows along with her to chase the storms, hoping that the system he devised will be a success. <p>That system is a way of plotting how tornadoes form in hopes that warning time may be increased for areas in harm's way. Of course, these machines must be placed in the storm's path just a few seconds before it reaches that specific spot, making for some incredibly tense situations. And, as if the tornadoes were not a formidable enemy, the movie introduces a rival group of storm chasers with sophisticated equipment and the same system Bill developed. <p>Before I get to the bad parts, I must say that the special effects and action in &quot;Twister&quot; are in all the right places. Director Jan de Bont gets everything right in these areas: our characters find themselves in one tight situation after another. Some are unbelievable, yes (I was a bit unconvinced when the twisters come right up on the hood of the red truck), but in the grand scheme of things, this isn't the kind of movie to take too seriously when it comes to the danger. <p>And the effects will blow you away. This is probably one of the best recreations of inclimate weather ever put forth for the big screen. The twisters themselves are fascinating: for those of us who have always been intrigued by them, this is probably the next best thing to actually seeing one up close (and, I'm sure, a lot safer). Waiting for the first real view of a tornado is one of the best things about this movie, too. <p>But the story is a flop, its only purpose being to supply the motive for the effects and action, while never actually taking on any cling or meaning. Actors Paxton and Hunt, as well as some brilliant supporting actors, are given characters that do little other than put themselves in danger again and again. Basically, the story is there to give the effects a purpose for being the movie, and then it really has nothing else to do and nowhere to go. <p>Overall, it's lacking. This is the kind of movie where the story is overrun by an overabundance of special effects, and while they are terrific, they cannot save the movie completely. I expected more out of the story, and while I was completely enamored with the special effects and technological excellence that was so lovingly extracted for the film, I would've like to have seen better characters for such talented actors.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMOLKXVKQ06Z.html">ACMOLKXVKQ06Z</a><br/><p>This movie was a blast.  It was fun to watch and it was very entertaining.  If you can, check it out on DVD, the digital sound mix is definately something you can use to show off your sound system.  The only problem I  had with this movie was the fact that the plot seemed to keep repeating:  Go out and get tornado, almost get killed, survive.  That is mostly the  movie, and there is a side love story.  Here is an interesting gripe, when  they are 20 feet away running from the tornado, their hair isn't even  blowing!  I guess CG tornados can't do that.  <p>Still, great special  effects, good fun, and good entertainment.  Reccomended for action buffs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LSRBVD2MK3PL.html">A2LSRBVD2MK3PL</a><br/><p>&quot;Twister&quot; is a wild ride of a film that is also non-stop fun. The tornadoes in this film are staggering, brought to life by amazing visual effects, I can't really say to much about this movie except that it  is always exciting and fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>A lot of disaster movies tend to be sold around one thing: who's going to bite it and how grisly is it going to be? You don't go see Independence Day or Dante's Peak for compelling storylines and interesting characters, you go for carnage and mayhem and big action pieces. It's rough to say but it's kind of true, so it's odd that Twister doesn't have many onscreen deaths. It does have a lot of destruction and that's probably the main reason to see it. There is a lot of more development than most films but still, it's cool to watch.<br /><br />Tornado warning systems aren't very effective, especially since tornadoes can hit with little warning time so we have stormchasers who try to take more accurate scientific measurements and hopefully design a more advanced warning system. Only we are dealing with a tornado, an incredibly destructive weather phenomena. And it doesn't help when you have your ex-wife, your soon-to-be wife plus your archrival is around.<br /><br />It's always funny when you look back on effect shots and notice how much advancements have been made. Yes the effects are most impressive but also at times it looked a bit too CGI-y such as a huge tornado near the end or the debris that they pick up, such as trailers, tractors and barn roofs. But granted this is 10 years ago and it's certainly impressive to watch in action. It's also good that we don't get a whole lot of tornado stuff since it would become very boring and too same-y.<br /><br />The casting is quite spot-on and I never saw a weak link in the cast, although some people might have a couple. There's a bit of plotholes now and then(or else there's a whole bunch that I never caught since I'm not a science geek). The film does need a bigger special edition than we have since there's so much that documentaries can explain yet we get commentaries and a making-of, nothing too big. It's understandable since Twister is actually the first movie ever released on DVD but it has been 10 years.<br /><br />It's not dumb fun like Armageddon but it's at least likable and quite entertaining. Plus it's got flying cows and come on: how can you resist "I gotta go, we got cows!".</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>OK, I've read the other reviews...I think &quot;Twister&quot; is entertaining, with great CGI effects. The plot is intense, and most sub-plots are silly. Helen Hunt is beautiful, and quite a good actress. Bill Paxton is customarily hammy. Still I enjoy this film as entertainment. It's interesting to note that a lot of our current best actors today got a start in this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in particular, shows great flair, as well as Jeremy Davies, playing the wimp. Director Jan de Bont seems to use Alan Ruck a lot, and for good reason: He's talented. I was disappointed when Jamie Gertz won the Razz Award as &quot;Worst Supporting Actress&quot; in '96. I thought she gave a fine performance...her character was written to be reactionary, and I thought her every nuance was touching and sincere. As far as writing, well, some of the soap opera stuff could've been cut short. Jan de Bont, with all the films he could've chosen, showed scenes from Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; (at the drive-in), and Cukor's &quot;A Star is Born&quot; (before Aunt Meg's house is blown away). If these are homages, he has good taste. And Lois Smith was solid as the aunt; I've liked her since she played Nicholson's sister in &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;. A fine character actress. With this stuff in mind, I watch &quot;Twister&quot; often, and enjoy it each time. Why be so analytical? It was made as mass-marketed entertainment and, on that level, it succeeds. Doesn't seem to matter that it was also on quite a few &quot;10 Best&quot; lists in '96. I like it a lot; if you don't, maybe you should get out more...</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The film that kicked off the 90s disaster movie revival, Twister is a spectacle, pure and very simple, with just enough plot to propel you to the next big set piece of destruction as ex-stormchaser Bill Paxton finds himself swept up in the thrill of the chase as he tries to get Helen Hunt to sign their divorce papers. Don't look for anything profound - Cary Elwes' villainous better-funded rivals even drive black vans while, after the film goes to enormous lengths to stress how all-powerful the twisters are by throwing oil tankers and even houses at them, the heroes survive by, er, tying themselves to some pipes and holding on very tight. Yet the special effects are suitably apocalyptic while the film has a real sense of speed and motion thanks to some great helicopter and driving work, and even the presence of two of the most irritatingly mannered supporting actors in the business, Philip Seymour Hoffman (in the Jack Black role) and Jeremy Davies, doesn't dampen the dumb fun. And no doubt about it, the cow is definitely the star of the show.<br /><br />After  a previous underwhelming  release, the 2-disc  set  finally gives  the film a  decent  selection  of  extras even if the transfer  doesn't  appear to be an imprpvement on the previous  issue.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Is it just me or is Helen Hunt an annoying actress? As for the film, there is great action and solid special effects.  It's just that Helen Hunt is so obnoxious in her role in this film. <p>Bill Paxton does a solid job but one can't help but realize the nose dive his career took after this film was done. Oh well. Twister might have you wanting to become a storm chaser when it's all said and done. I know I gave it some thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>When &quot;Twister&quot; was released in 1996, it was panned by many film critics; but not everyone agrees.  &quot;Twister&quot; takes place in America's heartland where tornadoes are common and where residents live in fear of destruction any time a very dark cloud looms overhead.<p>The film depicts the desires of the scientist, Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt), to get a tornado to swallow up hundreds of sensors so that scientists can analyze their data and obtain a better understanding of tornado dynamics.  Her soon-to-be-divorced husband, William 'Bill' Harding (Bill Paxton), plans to marry a very urban psychologist, Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz), as soon as JoAnne signs the divorce papers.  Bill brings the divorce papers out to JoAnne, but she's too busy with her sensors and the discovery of a nearby funnel cloud.  JoAnne and her crew hurry off to chase the funnel cloud with Bill &amp; Melissa along for the ride.<p>Over the course of the film, Melissa disovers what Bill really likes to do and that he still has a lot of feelings for JoAnne.  She also realizes that she hates being in very close proximity to tornadoes.<p>The special effects and constant action in the film keep the audience at the edge of their seats!<p>If you want to &quot;get blown away&quot;, this is a great film to own!</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>I really enjoy this movie every time I watch it.

Mankind decays slowly and faces its extinction as infertility has been the rule for over 18 years. Theo (Clive Owen), a disillusioned man, must escort through a sea of unimaginable adversities the most precious person: a pregnant woman.<br /><br />THE FILM is great at many levels. First, I'd say it is because of a great cast. Clive Owen is the perfect "zombie", a man who just lets himself go on with nothing to look forward to. His performance is unforgettable as a passive anti-hero who'll go all the way in order to accomplish his mission. Julianne Moore is also perfect as she gives a very quiet and underplayed performance as an activist hunted by the police (with whom Theo was once in love). Michael Caine shines (as usual) as an old hippie who now lives in the woods - in fact, his performance made me go back many times because it is so rich and physical... I really had to see it again several times at certain scenes.<br /><br />The Production Design is a landmark.<br />Rarely we have seen such a puzzling look at the future. It is not Blade Runner. It is not Star Trek. It is not I, Robot. It is simply (if I try to define it) a version of the future which is incomplete... as (like i said before) mankind is slowly disappearing, the future becomes stagnant and reduced to minimum signs of utopia and evident signs of dystopia.<br /><br />The direction is precise and creative.<br />The director really succeeds in giving us his full vision of the story, in scenes that are absolutely great. Using excruciatingly long takes, he really succeeds in giving us the true feel and the emotion behind the story. The car sequence is unbelievable. The old building shootout scene is unbelievable - just to chose two.<br /><br />The cinematography & camera work are perfect.<br />From the composition of the shots to the light in each shot/scene... the camera movements, the focus... everything here is right. I loved the blood drops on the lenses. you really don't see things like that every day...<br /><br />The screenplay is near perfect.<br />Well paced and well developed. It makes all journeys though "urban chaos" look like Disneyland. Characters and situations are very well written. I really felt the screenplay went where the story needed to go.<br /><br />Special effects are perfect.<br />THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!!!!!<br /><br />This HD DVD edition is a combo disc meaning that the disc comes with two sides: side A is a HD DVD side. Side B is a regular DVD side you can play everywhere.<br /><br />Isn't it great?<br /><br />The extras are great:<br />- Picture in Picture interviews with the director, crew and cast. (an exclusive HD DVD format feature not possible in the Blu-ray format).<br />- U control feature: exploring the imagery (another HD DVD exclusive feature that takes advantage of HDi).<br />- Info & Commercials: expanded from what we saw in the movie while we watch the movie. VERY DISTURBING! (another HD DVD exclusive feature).<br />- The Possibility of Hope: a documentary exploring the themes you'll find in the film.<br />- Under Attack: a short piece showing us how they made two very hard scenes (yes, the car sequence is there!).<br />- Deleted scenes (the one in the Art Ministry is my favorite).<br />- Theo & Julian: a short piece detailing the characters/actors relationship.<br />- Futuristic Design: a short piece on the stunning visual aspects of the film (a must see!).<br />- Commentary.<br /><br />This is one those titles that really show you how great HD DVD is.<br />HD DVD is truly a great format. It delivers the goods. It is the best choice.<br />A treasure!</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>An excellent dark, man on the brink of extinction, type film which you don't really understand why until you watch the documentary that's available in it's "special features" option.  The documentary puts this world at this level of despair thanks to man's neglect to recognize "global warming".  The film was almost miserable to watch but I'm glad that I saw it.  I see it as a plausible warning about our future destination rather than just to be entertained.  The camera work was really good.  Almost like how Stanley Kubrick put a greater emphasis to a scene.  People walking towards or away from the camera as the cameraman follows the person so you would see that person's horrific surroundings as he passes through it.  Visual destruction was everywhere.  So this film was definitely visually stunning.<br /><br />I never thought that I would ever see and hear the classic song "In the Court of the Crimson King" put to a movie.  What shocked me was when that song came on,  I thought that my CD player just kicked on for no reason because I did, in fact, have King Crimson's CD in my CD player at that time.<br /><br />And did anyone else notice one scene at the window where you saw a balloon of a "pig", and the old pollution spewing chimneys of that classic old factory that was used on the "Animals" album from Pink Floyd?  Perhaps this is one clue put in about "global warming".  I wonder if there are other unique references to our past that is used here in a future about 20 years from now.  The music in this film was all just a bunch of music from their past.  I wonder if that was meant to say that all the musicians of the world are already succumbed to extinction so the only music that's known and heard is all so old.  That's something to ponder.<br /><br />I think I need to watch this again.  Now I'm curious to know if I've missed anything else in the backgrounds of each scene.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>WARNING- SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />A dystopian tale set in 2027 and based on a novel by P.D. James, "Children of Men" takes place in a future where women suddenly become infertile. The world is tearing itself apart and the only sea of tranquility is Britain yet that tranquil sea is very much an illusion as the nation has turned into a police state where everyone must carry their passport to prove they are citizens or be shipped out to a war zone like concentration camp. Theo (Clive Owen) once an activist seems trapped in an emotional war zone of his own of apathy having never recovered from the death of his son nearly a decade before. His own emotions have become still born. When his ex-wife (Julianne Moore) the head of a radical terrorist group called The Fish asks for his help in smuggling a pregnant woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety, he is reluctantly drawn into her plan for the money but finds that his emotions immerge from their cocoon as well becoming the man he used to be.<br /><br />In a dreary year for science fiction films, "Children of Men" finally presents an oasis of memorable images, characters and observations. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n wisely turned down the chance to director the sequel to his "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" to helm this project. Brilliantly directed with a marvelous, rich screenplay by Cuar&oacute;n, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (one suspects that the bulk of the writers on these projects worked on earlier drafts that have little resemblance to the final product) the film uses the heavy handed imagery of P.D. James novel to its advantage. Clive Owen continues to prove he's a magnificent and underrated actor. He brings depth and presence to his world weary portrayal of Theo. The film features strong support performances by Danny Huston, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Caine adding a sense of gritty reality to the proceedings.<br /><br />The gritty look of the film is quite intentional as the director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", "Y Tu Mama Tambien") wanted to make the audience feel as if they were seeing a realistic look at the future. As a result the film has both the gritty feel of a documentary in terms of the film grain but also in terms of the constant camera movement throughout the film.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />While there aren't a huge amount of special features many are worthwhile. First up we get three deleted scenes that run around 2 minutes. While none of them are essential at least two amplify the desperate situation that Theo finds  himself in; one features Theo's apartment manager showing up at his door for four months past due rent while another continues Theo's meeting with his cousin who is a member of the government and collects artwork.<br /><br />We also get "Children of Men Comments by philosopher Slavoj Zizek" which most folks are going to skip. While some of his observations are interesting, they're the type of observations that you'd hear in a basic philosophy class. I suppose they are included to give legitimacy to this science fiction film but his comments aren't necessary to recognize the power of this film.<br /><br />"Under Attack" highlights the long takes used throughout the film. We hear from star Owen, director Cuar&oacute;n and the producers discussing the difficulty in shooting the action sequences with these long fluid takes shot on location. Cuar&oacute;n's vision for the film required constant camera movement which doesn't allow the filmmakers to fake it as they might normally. In particular we see the sequence where Theo, his ex-wife and others attacked in the country in their car and how it was put together with physical effects allowing for a 12 minute uninterrupted take.<br /><br />"Theo and Julian" allows us to hear the actors Julianne Moore and Clive Owen's thoughts on their character. Director Cuar&oacute;n also chimes in on the collaborative nature of creating a character with his actors and integrating their suggestions into an already finished script. It's clear that he relishes the collaborative nature of film and that the performers that have worked with him enjoyed the project as well.<br /><br />"Futuristic Design" focuses on the production design with comments by producer Hilary Shor and how they had to straddle the line between the futuristic look of the film while also grounding it in our world. Jim Clay and Jennifer Williams the production designer and set designer respectively discuss how the natural instinct is to go for a visually strong look for a science fiction film. He suggested they fight that instinct create and use ugly environments that refer to our current world to bring home the gritty reality of the film as much as possible. Using London as their background the designers created a world that is as old and tired looking reflecting the biological sterility facing mankind but also reflects a world that is at the brink of collapse.<br /><br />"Visual Creating the Baby" highlights the delivery scene in the film. Created with CGI this sequence was difficult to shoot because they couldn't use a real baby for the sequence and had to use a combination of prosthetics, CGI and physical effects to create the sequence. Small details such as Theo's breath in the freezing room where the baby is delivered were created in post-production and digitally inserted.<br /><br />An effective, powerful science fiction thriller, "Children of Men" features a number of powerful performances from Owen's world weary take on Theo to Moore's activist Julian their performances bring gravity to the situations in the film adding another level suggesting this world is just around the corner from our own.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Children of Men takes place in Britain in the year 2027. The film begins with the death of the world's youngest person, Baby Diego. The world mourns his death in a manner usually reserved for larger than life figures like Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. Women weep in the streets and people stand transfixed by the television watching the report of his death. Baby Diego was 18 years old.<br /><br />In this version of the future, women are infertile and there hasn't been a human birth in nearly 20 years. Clive Owen plays Theo, a Brit who is just living day to day, but who has become lost in a world thrown into turmoil by its impending doom. Fertility tests are mandatory in this future, the world is at war, and Britain is the only place that seems to have some hold on civilization. Accordingly, people flock to get there, but the borders are strictly patrolled and refugees are locked in cages and displayed for all to see.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays Julian, the leader of a "terrorist" organization called Fish, whose goal is to allow a home for every refugee who seeks asylum in Britain. She is also Theo's ex-wife. She comes to him after years of separation to ask him to help transport the first pregnant woman in nearly 20 years. It his her hope that the birth of this child might stop the turmoil and strife engulfing the country and possibly bring the world back from the brink of chaos.<br /><br />Children of Men paints a rather bleak picture of the future and, in this respect, was at times hard to watch. The world is torn apart by its impending doom and people have nothing left to live for.  This unborn child could give hope to the many who have lost it, but there are others who would use it for their own ends. This film was gripping, engaging, and moving despite the fact that it's also depressing, violent, and difficult to watch. The lack of a future has thrown the world into utter chaos with people being killed in the streets, the government dropping bombs at random, and anarchists fighting to put the world back in order. The fate of the future rests in the hands of someone who isn't even born yet, and that's something that's hard to perceive.  Still, I think Children of Men is definitely worth watching and it definitely starts the 2007 film season with a bang.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuar&oacute;n thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuar&oacute;n manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.<br /><br />The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.<br /><br />There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuar&oacute;n. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.<br /><br />After his scene-stealing turns in "Closer" and "Inside Man", Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious filmmaking, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuar&oacute;n as an important creative force in cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Visually, Children of Men is a stunner. It convincingly brings us into the terrorist battlezones of the future, complete with immigrant holding pens and bleak cityscapes that are made all the more plausible by excellent camera handling, and a cold color scheme. The acting ranges from very good (Clive Owen) to so-so (Julianne Moore), but the cast mostly does a fine job with what are ultimately very thin roles. Michael Caine is endearing in an ultimately wispy role as a pot dealing comic artist. It's an eccentric little turn, but reads like a screenwriter piling on eccentricities for their own sake. As a result, in the end, Caine is pleasant, but forgettable.<br /><br />But, the real problem with Children of Men is a story line (not premise, mind you) that simply doesn't flow naturally, It is propelled from point to point by very artificial devices that speak mostly of poor plotting. Serendipitous events jar the characters along, coupled with dialogue that says too much -- with a ring of audience spoon-feeding. A good example of this is when Owen's character overhears a group of bad guys revealing what they did, and what they plan to do with Owen's character "tomorrow." It felt like a cheesy James Bond moment in which the villain explains his "plan" for no purpose other than to given Bond sufficient information to save himself. The script, sadly, has a number of these moments, and the result is a story that never quite coheres, and never lives up to its potential.<br /><br />What Children of Men gets very right, however, are those moments when we feel like this bleak future is very possible -- a fleeting glimpes of a New York City mushroom cloud, a bombing victim cradling her own arm, tanks assaulting a London high-rise. Cuaron's work is like a painting. If only he had a better script to paint.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Set in 2027, when no child has been born for 18 years and science is at loss to explain the reason, African and East European societies collapse and their dwindling populations migrate to England and other wealthy nations. In a climate of nationalistic violence, a London peace activist turned bureaucrat Theo Faron, joins forces with his revolutionary ex-wife Julian in order to save mankind by protecting a woman who has mysteriously became pregnant. This movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. "Children of Men" is a cinematic milestone. Great special effects and an effective soundtrack accompany this heartfelt, moving and thought-provoking movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Children Of Men is the kind of movie you either love or hate. When Vendetta came out, critics stomped it with criticism; they said the film had a shoddy conclusion and the decisions made by the protagonist were bought under scrutiny. There is no such protagonist in Children Of Men yet it is similar. Britain is a power in this movie again but then one might ask, what's the use when there is such a sense of uneasiness going on - around the world? Clive Own earns a lot of respect. His act is solid. There is no doubt that the action scenes in this film will make you wonder what hit you. To some, this film might appear  a bit "over the top" and to some, it might make perfectly skewed sense. CHILDREN OF MEN has a scene that stops your breath and makes your eyes go wide when your mind is telling you, "That's impossible" but yes, that where it sets itself apart.<br /><br />The best scenes in the film involves cars,on foot chases, men on the verge of insanity and utter dismay at one's helplessness. The direction tells us that power is ultimately sought. While Vendetta was based on a totalitarian form of government, Children Of Men takes a more conservative yet forward approach. Countries are fighting among themselves wondering why a woman can't give birth anymore. The storyline is good but the action and overall impact is quite staggering,really. The music of the film is worth remembering though not all tracks are found in the soundtrack. Why 4 stars, you might ask. I thought the film could have been longer (perhaps the editing could have been more generous) and I had difficulty understanding what was being said by a few characters.<br /><br />This is as good as Vendetta was, in my opinion, if not better. In ways best left home, it is also better than Vendetta whilst being a tad similar to 28 days later form of "run for your life"<br /><br />Give this film a chance, it will definitely leave an impact.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Children of Men is the kind of film that you really don't see that often: the kind of film that keeps surprising you. From the very beginning we are thrown into a decaying, depressed world. We learn quickly that the human race has become entirely incapable of reproducing. Although the causes are unknown for the most part, there is much speculation throughout and conspiracy theorizing.<br /><br />The film covers all aspects of the human condition and currently relevant topics as well. Immigration, discrimination, loneliness, depression, hopelessness, government control, media spin: all of these topics are given ample consideration.<br /><br />The future that Alfonso Cuaron paints here is bleak and depressing. But visually, the film is stunning. Several shots last for several minutes and cover unbelievable amounts of distance and action. At times it's hard to imagine that the camera has been rolling continuously while buildings explode and people are mowed down by machine gun fire. This helps give the movie a sense of reality that only deepens the darkness of what we see.<br /><br />All the acting is phenomenal, and Clive Owen makes a great anti-hero, as a normal guy trying to navigate the perils of terrorist groups and governmental control.<br /><br />The special features are great and include a documentary about what the film represents and a look into what we are doing to our planet through pollution and our treatment of our fellow humans. Overall, this is just a solid DVD that belongs in any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Every so often, you see a film that you know, instantly, is a classic.  This film is of that kind of quality:  it portrays a future world - an exaggeration of the present - that raises deep questions, is emotionally moving, and full of realistic action that adds to the themes.  In my opinion, this film is on the level of The Day the Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet, but it addresses current crises, from global economic breakdown and emigration to personal identity in a world gone wrong.  I was utterly riveted from the first minutes of the film, was moved at the plight of the mysterious child, and was inspired to wonder at what my children will face.<br /><br />I will try not to play the spoiler, but it is well known that this is about a dystopia that has arisen because suddenly, for reasons that no one can fathom, all women in the world have been infertile for nearly 20 years.  The sense of crisis at the demise of the human race is palpable in the chaos that has resulted:  the economic order is breaking down, illegal immigrants are hunted and forced into lawless ghettos, and human rights no longer exist except for a tiny slice of the elite population.  Gangs roam the countryside, the security apparatus of the state has few civil limits placed on it, and normal citizens are retreating into protected or hidden enclaves while radical activists seek to foment revolution.  My kids were appalled and frightened at this vision and watched with silent fascination, afterwards sparking a long discussion of where the world is headed for them.  We watched it twice, one viewing after the other.<br /><br />The central character, Dylan, is a broken man; he has given up and become cynical about his ideals, drinking for solace rather than contemplating action.  He is watching the world deteriorate around him, losing his empathy and unable to look ahead.  Then, his former lover - the mother of his deceased child - kidnaps him, asking for help.  What ensues is an adventure that renews his faith in humanity and the future, all the while highlighting the brutal machinations of those around him, who want to control what could be the savior of humanity.  He is a normal guy, thrust into what will become greatness.  I completely believed it, to the point that I got choked up at the climax.<br /><br />There are also some excellent commentaries with the version that I bought (2 disks of region 2).  There are documentaries with philosophers (e.g. Lovelock)  and  journalists (Naomi Kline, of whom I am a fan even though I am a moderate conservative) that are quite thought provoking.  Of course, there are also insipid promotional materials ("It was wonderful working with everyone"), but it is worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.  I see maybe one film per year that enters my pantheon, and this is the one.</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>Quite simply put, this is the most amazing piece of cinema that I've seen in a while and certainly the most plausible vision of a future Anglican dystopia yet committed to film. It's an instant addition to my favourite films of all time. Its difficult to do the experience of watching it justice in words - if you can imagine a more humane Kubrick or perhaps Andrei Tarkovsky or Elem Klimov working within the perimeters (but not conventions) of the British/American film-making lexicon, then you're getting close. It takes a thousand images from the contemporary world that you're familiar with and weaves them into a tapestry of such alarmingly plausible disquiet that you can't help but be drawn in. If you're a fan of film-making you can consider it a 'must-own' for the simple reason that it contains two of the most hauntingly evocative scenes ever committed to celluloid - one is an attack on a car full of people on an open road, the other is a pitched battle that grinds to a halt in order to provide safe passage for innocents caught in the crossfire. Stunning stuff. We need more films like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A suprising flop at the box office, Children of Men is a solid adventure story that gets a great deal of value out of its dystopic setting; it's not as profound a movie as some people have maintained, but it's very well-directed and consistently interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>this film was great. it was deep, and had a lot to say. really makes you think, about the world and the population in general. petty things that don't matter compared to a fear of us being no more on this earth. another point made is that mother nature is above all science, and man here. very well written, the whole story was very interesting, and shows what one man with nothing to live for, would do for mankind. clive owen gives a brilliant performance. this put his name on the map, defenitly. well acted, nailed his character right on the mark. from an ordinary man to a hero in a day. julianne moore and michael caine played meaningful roles, both gave a huge sacrifice for the miracle of the world. this movie is very entertaining, shows how the world because of us has gone to hell, all hope is lost, when out of nowhere we get a second chance. brilliant idea, loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>A world where women are no longer giving birth. A world in turmoil. A world that will end for mankind in less than 80 years.<br /><br />A lot of war still going on in the world in this movie and it's sad. You'd think at the end of times, man would come together to figure out a cure for what is wrong. Or maybe just not die mad, but peaceful. That part was kinda sad for me. You can just look at most of the people and just see in their faces that the end is near. Why people were even working anymore was a surprise to me.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) unexpectedy gets mixed up in a series of events starting off with a lost love that ends up with him meeting a pregnant girl that he will soon have to get out of the place that he lives to a more peaceful area of the world, and hopefully save mankind.<br /><br />I thought the whole story was pretty well done in the movie. It definitely kept my attention throughout the movie. The pace of the movie seemed very fast once the action starts to pick up.<br /><br />The camera work in the movie was phenomenal. The action scenes were so well choreographed it seemed real. The best part about the movie in my opion was the action scenes. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (the director) made every action scene without taking one cut which made it all look so damn real. The last big action scene had to be about 15-20 minutes long with no cuts. I was just in awe with how well it was done.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about the movie was the ending, and it wasnt even that bad, it was just not how I would've ended it. Also some parts of the story seemed to have been thrown in for filler. Other than that though...great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Based on P. D. James' novel of the same title, Alfonso Cuaron made a futuristic action/thriller, which opens with a strange news report about a shocking death of 'the world's youngest man.' The film is set in England, now chaotic country in the year of 2027. No child has been born for 18 years in the world and the country witnessed the widening gap between those who have and those who do not. Humans are going to be extinct very slowly.<br /><br />[STORY] Clive Own plays a quiet businessman Theodore, a former activist whose ex-lover (and now the leader of anti-government group called FISH) Julian (Julianne Moore) suddenly shows up before him and asks him to do an impossible thing for her. She says her organization needs a government's pass to secretly transport a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England, who is, she believes, the only hope to save the world from destruction.<br /><br />[ACTORS] Though Julianne Moore is second-billed, and her character plays an important role in the story, hers is actually an extended cameo. Michael Caine effectively plays an ex-hippie Jasper (with a long hair which might look a bit strange) who gives a help to Theo, and there are supporting actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, Danny Huston and Peter Mullan, but the film basically belongs to two actors Clive Owen and Claire-Hope Ashitey.<br /><br />[VISUALLY STUNNING] You should not miss two long continuous shots, one of which goes on more than 10 minutes. Besides these technical things, Alfonso Cuaron, with Emmanuel Lubezki very realistic photography, succeeds in creating a bleak view of the world that reminds us of recent news footages from Iraq. The director refuses to use his trademark green color here. Instead he uses grey-colored images that captures the brooding atmosphere of the future with no hope. And don't forget this; the film is sometimes violent, showing spluttered blood on the lense.<br /><br />Clive Owen is very good as reluctant hero and so are other actors, whose acting almost makes up for the film's flawed script. Though I have not read the original book, Alfonso Cuaron clearly changed it to make the film's theme more immediate. That is fine, but still the plot suffers from some incredible coincidences (which I cannot reveal here) and some gaps in logics. To me Cuaron's vision about the strife-torn land of England, where refugees are treated in the places that look like concentration camps, are convincing only visually -- why do people rush to England when Theo and Kee must leave? Is there a better place outside there? These and other details remain hazy.<br /><br />Though the film is set in the near future, it is clearly about our time. The film is visually stunning, especially during the battles (don't miss the driving scene) and you also get the original music by John Tavener, but the more detailed logics in plot would have made it a better film. Still the film's intense and impressive images cannot be easily forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Oddly, I must be one of the few folks to have seen "Children of Men" and did not form an opinion as to it being a rancid pile of rotting mule skin or the greatest movie since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063UR1">Silent Running</a>. I found the basic premise to be fascinating: How would the world react twenty years into an epidemic of childlessness? Which some of the reviewers here seem to miss...this is not just how the world reacts to the onset of infertility, but almost two decades since the last baby was born. So many industries would fall into slow collapse; education, garments, much of the medical industry, etc...as the population ages past the point where new folks would replenish both consumer and professional.<br /><br />Clive Owen starts off the movie in a coffee shop as the world learns of the death of its youngest citizen. He walks into a city full of violent rebellion and to where Britain is the last nation that hasn't fallen into anarchy. The government has slipped into a fascist state in order to keep from being overrun by refugees, yet Owen's ex-wife (Julianne Moore, great in a brief role) kidnaps him to set a plot into motion. They have discovered the last pregnant woman on Earth, an African named Kee. They need to smuggle her out of England to a mysterious "Human Project" group.<br /><br />This is where the chaos really begins and the allegories become oppressive. Kee's baby has no discernable father (and a miracle birth is even joked about). The miracle baby has factions splitting off of factions before the little savior is even born. Oh yes, the African mother; how very Cradle of Civilization! Plus one reclusive ex-hippie idealist (Michael Caine, all crazy hair, John Lennon and homegrown weed) to emphasize just how badly the sixties failed when they were all so much better then than these fascists now.<br /><br />The heavy handedness of the message is carried by some incredible cinematography, like the near ten minute single-camera shot of Owen racing through the prison camp uprising while under fire. London in decay is depressingly gritty as is the Fugee concentration camp (with shades of Abu Gharib). The sense of dread curdles under each character (like Owen's visit to his brother, the art curator), yet the tiny light of hope of the new baby still stops a war in its tracks, however briefly.<br /><br />It is that final sense of redemption - the "maybe we might get our miserable species out of this mess anyway" message - that keeps the relentlessly bleak view of "Children of Men" from completely tanking. But it's the ham-fisted proletyzing that also stops it from arcing beyond its science-fiction art-house roots.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>This is a beautifully crafted, powerful and resonant film. Viewers looking for a conventional action or science fiction film will be disappointed, because "Children of Men" has much more of the spirit of an art film. In fact, each scene of the film, instead of being filled with CGI, is composed like a provocative painting. (In this manner it recalls another dystopian masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange".) The story itself revolves around the theme of hope. In a future where no children are being born, human life has been reduced to a mixture of despair, violence and empty pleasure-seeking. When a pregnant woman is discovered for the first time in 18 years, she becomes both a beacon of hope and a pawn in the political agendas of various societal elements.<br /><br />My friends who watched this film with me didn't like the film's open, anti-climactic ending. I thought it suited the film perfectly. Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>CHILDREN OF MEN is a brilliant film. It truly truly is. In fact, this could be one of the most important films to grace the silver screen in a long time, yet I won't give it the full five stars for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First of all, Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, should be commended for what he has done here. This is a sharp, well produced and well choreographed film. Despite it's ugliness, it's a beautiful film.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is all gloom and doom. The youngest person on the planet has been assasinated. He was 18. There hasn't been a pregnancy on earth in years. The earth's human population is doomed. The world is in turmoil. Countries are in flames. Unrest is rampant. Terrorism is running wild.<br /><br />The color schemes are all grey and drab. Yet, despite all the ugliness and the grey sceneries. The camera shots are brilliant and beautiful. Cuar&oacute;n shot the film in a documentary style. It's as if you the viewer are running along side Theo Faron (Clive Owen) as he unwillingly falls into a save the world scenario. The violence is real and in your face. The explosions are gut churning and duck inspiring. What Cuar&oacute;n did with the camera in this film, WILL, without question, set a new standard for future films. More action films will be shot this way and I can't wait.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars for such an important film. Oh, just a couple of things. First of all, the movie, story-wise, is a little one dimensional and anti-climatic. I won't give away anything, but I was hoping for more as the story played itself out.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie rests on the shoulders of a premise that a baby hasn't been born in nearly twenty-years and the human race has accepted its fate as doomed. In my humble opinion, that is slightly tough to swallow. If the human race is so void of humanity, as the movie suggests, I would think that sometime in those eighteen years, somebody would decide and okay the use of CLONING. Just a thought.<br /><br />Despite the downfalls, CHILDREN OF MEN, is not to be missed. Brilliant film. Turn up your surround sound and enjoy because this is what making movies is all about and don't forget the name Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, cause you're gonna hear it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I wouldn't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but its close. The enthusiasm of many of the reviews of this picture is entirely justified. Though it is unlikely to make anyone feel 'good', it will offer a thought provoking and chillingly plausible vision of a world sliding into despair. The pseudo-documentary camera work is slightly jarring at times, but lends further weight to the film's sense of being grounded in a realist tradition.<br /><br />The most outstanding thing in this film is the utter realism it achieves through extended shots that seem to run forever, but never lose excitement. I don't have to tell anyone the two most amazing shots in the film that use this. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't, you will. The tale of post-apocalyptic London and the dismal future of the world is nothing new. But the depiction of the "near-future" in "Children of Men" is so subtle and organic; it comes across surrealistically.... real. It allows the viewer to look past the time and focus on the story. (We've all seen enough films that show us the bright and shiny, flashy as Epcot Center, future) It's nice to see this done so well while still being interesting and unsullied. Another thing I loved about this film was that it didn't try to explain what happened like often happens in sci-fi movies, this is very plot driven, they just show you the landscape and tell you the situation and move on. I also liked that on the extremes of either side of the political landscape in this movie they where more or less the same, just on side had power and the other none. I thought that was very true about most of life, with the people in the middle just kind of caught up in it all.<br /><br />As for the performances, I thought Michael Caine shines as the eccentric hippie who lovingly attends to his disabled wife and Clive Owen extends himself as the chain smoking hero who doesn't need a cache of firearms to justify this mantle. Julianne Moore is typically excellent as the leader of the terrorist group and there are a few cameos such as Peter Mullan as the gruff and pragmatic soldier Syd. "Children of Men" definitely has heart. In a gritty war-torn scene of violence, to see the hearts of men and women so touched by the sight of a child made me slightly tear up. I am filled with admiration for Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n - he is truly a visionary and while I don't particularly like what he shows us here, he expresses it with intense artistry.  In the end, for all its action and excitement, this film is about the heart of humanity, If not the survival of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>In the dreary, toxic, terrorist filled Britain circa 2027 of Alfonso Cuaron's "Children of Men" there is no hope...only despair and the television and billboards scream out at you about something called "Quietus: YOU decide when." In other words, the world is so rancid, the youngest person in the world, an 18 year old boy, has just died, there is mass infertility and basically the only choice left to you is when to die.<br /><br />Theo (a rumpled, emotionally depleted Clive Owen) was once a revolutionary, an activist but now he is merely a bureaucrat scratching out an existence when one day an old flame and current freedom fighter, Julian (Julianne Moore in a cameo) approaches him or more to the point has him kidnapped, bound and gagged and brought to her to ask a favor. This favor changes his life, gives him a little hope and introduces him to Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a young black woman who is unbelievably with child.<br /><br />Adapted from a story by the excellent writer, P.D. James, "Children of Men," offers more than a glimmer of hope and the idea that the world can be saved via a baby is a very Christian conceit. That this child is issued from the loins of, in the world of this film, a reviled, "immigrant" only makes the birth that much more resonant and thoughtful. There is a magical and very emotional scene towards the end of the film in which the revolutionaries are battling with the army, machine gun fire everywhere, bodies dropping like flies and Kee, Theo and the newborn baby descend a crumbling staircase and everything stops as army, revos and everyone one else realizes what Kee is carrying: a child yes but also a miracle, a beacon of hope, a hope for salvation. Interestingly enough, this scene, instead of being hokey, isn't because once Kee and child are outside the fighting immediately continues full bore: life goes on.<br /><br />"Children of Men" is a cautionary film and one that is particularly creepy yet visionary because it is not set some 100 years but a mere 20 years hence. The Britain here looks pretty much like it does today just seedier and unkempt: annihilation doesn't come by way of one big blast; it comes slowly yet inevitably creeping up upon us...little by little.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>Monday afternoon I had one of those rare movie-watching experiences: a film I'd never heard of that absolutely amazed me. In fact, CHILDREN OF MEN (Japan/USA/UK-2006) is EASILY the best motion picture I've seen this year.<br /><br />I'm not much of a sci-fi fan and had my doubts, especially during the story's first half-hour, but what came later was so mind-bogglling, so unique, that I won't dare ruin it for anyone who hasn't yet seen this superb work.<br /><br />It's set in the dystopian world of 2027. The last child to be born was 18 years earlier and no one knows why women can no longer conceive, thus the human race is on the brink of extinction through natural attrition.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) is hired to escort an illegal to England's coast. Against all odds, the African-born Kee (Clare-Hope Ash?tey) is eight-months pregnant, which makes her the hope of our entire planet. There are some who wish to exploit Kee and others want her dead. Theo and a handful of friends, including eccentric hippe  Jasper (Michael Caine) and Theo's ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), are her only chance for escape and safety.<br /><br />Once the pursuit begins you will witness things you've never seen before, including one inspiring moment in the midst of total chaotic war.<br /><br />WHAT a movie! I just now bought a copy for my home library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>This looks great. A lot of time was poured into set design here, making post-apocalypse London look grim, indeed. However, it falls down on plot line and audio quality. Was it just me, or was the dialogue very hard to make out, never mind the thick British accents? A few years into the future, no babies have been born for 18 years and the world population is dying off, split among re-"fugees"- and the rest, a commentary on today's war on terror, one presumes. But one woman delivers a baby, and the movie is all about trying to get her ... somewhere....called "the human project.' I have no idea what that was. Most of the movie is a long chase scene through war zones and various attacks, shot by handheld camera. The look is fascinating, but the content is a weakness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>The Siege of Seattle continues. New York is in flames. The "world's youngest living person" has tragically died at 18, to the dismay of millions of "fans". Authorities in the U.K. continue a relentless,SS-style round up of all illegal immigrants, crowding them into Gitmo-like compounds. Most significantly, scientists remain at a loss to explain why a universal plague of female infertility continues unabated into its eighteenth year. These are some of the cheery news headlines dominating the year 2027 in the not so distant, dystopian future of Alfonso Cuaron's  "Children of Men."<br /><br />The story is set in (a not so) jolly old England, where we are introduced to glum-faced Theo (Clive Owen), a world-weary bloke working in some kind of vague, low-level bureaucratic job in London. He is not having a good morning. After narrowly escaping death by terrorist bombing on the way to work, he decides to beg off a day at the office, only to be kidnapped by a group of radical human rights activists<br /><br />It turns out that the cell is led by Theo's ex-wife (Julianne Moore), who wants him to use his connections to pull some strings and help out a "very important" colleague, (a female immigrant with a Big Secret). Initially, the reluctant Theo is determined to keep his activist roots safely embedded in the past, but fate and circumstance soon rekindle his old idealism, and he finds himself risking life and limb to help deliver the only known fertile woman in the world to the sanctuary of an organization called the Human Project .<br /><br />The film ultimately spreads itself a bit too thin as a political potboiler; there are too many confusing factions of insurgents, activists and terrorists running about killing government troops and each other with equal abandon (not unlike Iraq). However, the film does become quite gripping as a straight-ahead action-thriller, especially in its final third. Cuaron effectively applies an oppressive, steel-grey visual look to his cold, cruelly bleak future vision.<br /><br />From a purely thematic standpoint, I thought that the rampant use of Christ metaphor became a bit much (especially in an eye-rolling Big Death Scene that is a bit too reminiscent of "The Omega Man").<br /><br />There still are enough good reasons to recommend seeing this film, particularly for the uniformly excellent performances. The ubiquitous Michael Caine steals all of his scenes as Theo's mentor, an aging hippie activist. An honorable mention must be given as well to the always wonderful Peter Mullan ("My Name Is Joe", "Trainspotting"), who really chews up some major scenery as an opportunistic immigration control officer.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Children of Men" is definitely unconventional, and has more than a little originality, something welcome in an era when so many films are simply spat out of screenwriting software.  Cuaron achieves a triumph of cinematography and production design.  The tracking shots are amazing and reflect a mastery of direction and photography.  And the production design is interesting and gives us little bits of the future without the annoying "hey, look at the cool toys" factor of many SF movies.  Indeed, even cars of the future are handled in a way that doesn't make them instantly laughable.  The direction cannot be faulted.  Neither can the actors, who uniformly turn in excellent and convincing performances.  We are immersed in the convincing future world of 2027.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  The script is weak, and leaves you scratching your head at exactly why certain things are happening and what the motivation of certain characters and groups are.  Cuaron has shown himself in the past to be a master of character - getting great performances and characters from his actors - and of direction.  However, story has always been his weak point, and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this movie is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>The reason most dystopian films fail is the lack of realism.  Whether a flying car or talking ape ruins credibility, there is always something unbelievable distracting the viewer.  In this film, however, there is enough familiarity with the picture of impending apocalypse - regardless of scientific likelihood - that it feels possible.<br /><br />The year is a believable 2027 (thanks to the subtle cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki), an expanded neon world in shambles, governments have collapsed, armed insurrection threatens anarchy.  As a result of harsh immigration policies, Britain serves as the desired destination...if one can get past the immigration camps (read: concentration camps), swarms of menacing guards with machine guns and dogs, and vicious bands of outsiders who have formed ad hoc societies to survive.  A credible global political climate exists where fringe groups war with an apathetic, if not conspiratorial government.  Making matters worse is the death of "baby Diego," humankind's youngest living person, which has shocked seemingly everyone except former activist Theo (Clive Owen).  Every bit the flawed hero, Theo apathetically drones through his alcohol and cigarette filled day of avoiding emotions.  Birth is now seemingly impossible - none for over 18 years - extinction is imminent.  Hope is lost.  Not until Theo is reunited with his ex-wife Julian (Juliane Moore), an underground militia leader whose organization is protecting Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the first pregnant woman in eighteen years, does he embrace the reluctant role of protecting humanity's last hope, thereby finding a purpose and possible salvation.<br /><br />Like McCarthy's "The Road," the power in the despair is the possibility.  In fact, this could very well be the precursor to McCarthy's vision; it's a world with a glimmer of hope, a dash of humanity, and a step removed from the complete chaos of a world with nearly feral humans.  While there is a definite gut punch in Children of Men, and similar themes of humanity's demise persist (e.g. famine, disease), it's not quite as hopeless as the starving, exhausting cross-country march in The Road for a single reason: birth causes hope to spring eternal.  True credit goes to Alfonso Cuaron for creating a world in which giving up may be the best answer, but holding onto hope is the likeliest choice.<br /><br />Acting-wise, Clive Owens truly comes into his own as a hero.  I've never quite felt the same way about a character he has portrayed, but the vulnerability of Theo made him appealing...especially when he went the second half of the movie in flip flops (don't ask).  The rest of the cast fills in their required gaps, with Pam Ferris acting like a renegade wet-nurse who remembers birthing before the baby drought, Chiwetel Ejiofor balances good and evil while desperately trying to fill the shoes being worn by Clive Owens, and Michael Caine gives the viewer a peek inside the chemically enhanced mind of an eternal optimist.<br /><br />By the time the second act breaks, this is a full-fledged, war-torn action (passable but not spectacular) movie and all that's left is watching to see if Theo will deliver Kee and her baby to safety.  Highly engrossing, highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>"Children of Men," by Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron, was one of the more unusual success stories of 2006.  While not a blockbuster, by any standards, this unconventional film was all but abandoned by a studio that didn't know how to market it.  Positioned for release during prime Oscar season, this is not a film that was backed as a potential nominee.  However, as almost universal critical acceptance came rolling in--a smaller, but loyal, fan base discovered and embraced this movie.  "Children of Men" ended up, therefore, with much acclaim and admiration, decent box office, a more widespread distribution, and 3 Academy Award nominations (Screenplay, Editing, and Cinematography).<br /><br />In an interesting twist on the apocalypse drama genre, "Children of Men" presents a world that is coming to an end with a whimper as opposed to a bang.  For there is no cataclysmic explosion forcing humanity to confront it's own mortality.  No, in this case, people have simply lost the ability to reproduce--and the youngest person alive is now approaching adulthood.  Of course, over the ensuing years (the film is set in 2027) of this ongoing tragedy, there has been an expected societal breakdown.  Now, the streets of London are ravaged by terrorism and extremist groups are battling to overturn the complacent, and possibly complicit, government.  While this may seem like a broad and epic canvas, "Children of Men" covers many weighty issues within the relatively straightforward story of its protagonist, Clive Owen.  Owen, an ex-activist who is now somewhat disconnected, is drawn back into a world that he wants no part of.  The unlikeliest and most reluctant of heroes, Owen confronts his own ideology and apathy when an extremist group introduces him to a pregnant teen.  Fearing that she will be exploited, used, or otherwise politically manipulated by the warring factions--he decides to deliver her to a utopian (and perhaps mythical) society whose only interest is in saving humanity.  Getting her free from the controlling clutches that bind her and crossing a country plagued by insurrection, "Children of Men" becomes a harrowing and brutal action picture with violence that resembles much of what we see on TV news today.<br /><br />Owen has long been a favorite of mine.  Having taken notice of him in "Croupier" (and if you haven't caught this great noir piece, please do), I have been quite impressed by his rise in mainstream films.  He was so electrifying in "Closer" that I even forgave him for "Derailed."  Here, he is the perfect antihero--and his evolution from a disinterested party to a rogue patriot is an indelible portrait of a man rediscovering a purpose and meaning in life.  Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Clare-Hope Ashitey (as the pregnant team) lead an able supporting cast.  The documentary feel of the film's action pieces suit the material well, and the conflicts are well staged and all too believable.<br /><br />Now, there are many political debates to be started from "Children of Men" (none of which will I engage in here), but what I admired about the film's screenplay is how focused it is.  Without being preachy or engaging in unnecessary "speechifying," this film plays as straight action.  And while there is a "revelatory" moment near the end that almost goes too far (but is understandable within the context of the film), "Children of Men" allows you to draw your own conclusions.  It just presents the story and leaves much of its interpretation up to the viewer.  That, to me, is always a satisfying choice.  Whether you view this film as action, sci-fi, political allegory, or a combination of all three--it's a worthwhile and entertaining film.  KGHarris, 03/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>While I loved the movie, I strongly suggest you read the book as well. There are differences between the two and, of course, verbal descriptions of characters' thoughts are often hard to reproduce on screen. Almost always, sacrifices must be made in the script - and this film is no exception. However, I DO feel the movie stays true to the INTENT and MESSAGE of the book and it is quite a wonderful film.<br /><br />  It is futuristic and if you know anything about the author of the book on which this film is based (P.D. James) you'll know this isn't her usual mystery story. But it is one of my favorite works that she has written, telling of a time when people are infertile and of the hope that resides when there is a chance that someone can produce children again.<br /><br />  The government gets involved and there are political messages and subplots, all set against a certain, dark atmosphere. This film will make you think and I actually find the possibility of a future where infertility is almost the norm not outside the realm of possibility. Even if you don't, the "What ifs?" will keep you interested in this masterful film and Clive Owen proves that he is  becoming more interesting an actor as time goes on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Over the lifetime, I often read reviews of films in which the critic proclaims a film to be "haunting."  I always chalked that up to hyperbole...until I saw CHILDREN OF MEN.  It's been almost three weeks since I saw it...and feelings and moods and images from the film still revisit me from time to time.  It's a feeling that's pretty new to me, and I've seen 3000 or more films in my life.<br /><br />It's not that the film is perfect...I've certainly seen films that leave me more shaken, more entertained, more impressed or more moved to action.  But CHILDREN OF MEN soaked me in an atmosphere and a mood and a world in such a specific, complete manner that some of it's images are almost like sense memory to me now.  I think the last time I had a similar feeling was in about 1980 when I first saw David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN, which left me so shaken that I had to go again and again in the same week.  I'm planning on seeing CHILDREN OF MEN again soon, and may have to go a third time.<br /><br />I don't think I need to rehash the basic plot...others have done that pretty well.  One thing I feel I must comment on is the criticism I've seen in a few places that there isn't any plot, or that we don't know what's going on in this futuristic society.  To me, that's almost laughable.  How many people wanted to know why the earth became the way it did in BLADE RUNNER?  Or SILENT RUNNING?  We accept the world presented to us.  I think part of the power of CHILDREN OF MEN is that it set in a not very distant future, where the world is turned upside-down...and yet it feels possible.  The landscapes, cityscapes, technology, clothing, etc. that we see look very familiar.  It feels like today, or maybe just next year.  And yet we don't recognize the society, the politics, etc.  It's deeply unsettling to see a "future" that feels so totally possible.  So bleak, and yet so credible.<br /><br />True, we don't know exactly why no one has had children in nearly two decades.  Would the narrative drive of this movie work better if we did know?  Would having that one little answer make the film suddenly perk to life for skeptical viewers?  I find it hard to believe.  I had no problem not knowing...I can fill that blank in for myself.  Otherwise, I think the socio-political climate in the Great Britain presented in the film is VERY easy to glean.  There's some easy to swallow exposition and then off we go with the film.<br /><br />It is the story of one man, Theo, played brilliantly by Clive Owen.  He looks weary, furrowed, troubled, smart, cynical, heroic, handsome, dirty, smelly.  It's probably too late for Oscar attention for him...but it's an Oscar worthy performance.  He's so easy to like, and yet he's very much an anti-hero.  But during the film, we see him come to life...to suddenly have something to live for.  That's what the movie is about.  Not plot twists.  Not this happened, then this, then this.  It's about one man (living in a society where he already knows the background of what's happened...why would the film tell US?) who is just going through the motions of living.  Then some events unfold that jolt him back into engaging in the world and actually working to make a difference.  It's effective.<br /><br />Also, I have to address the violence and some viewer's criticism of it.  Yep, it's violent.  It's graphic, but not over the top.  Lots and lots of people die, but the camera doesn't linger over the nasty results.  In fact, people die most often on the fringes of the film.  The camera pans, and just as it passes someone in the background, they drop from a gunshot and are seen no more.  It's highly effective in giving us a sense of the sudden death that awaits in this new society.<br /><br />There are many specific parts of the film that I loved.  Michael Caine's joyful performance.  Theo's ongoing problems with footwear (don't ask).  The way in which the midwife character in the film is suddenly yanked out of the story (the whole scene showing Theo's arrival at the detention camps is amazingly well done...just look out the bus window as the scenes roll by).  The scene when Kee's secret is first revealed to the general populace and their reaction.  It's all stunning and moving.<br /><br />The movie is very gray, and bleak.  Yet there are just enough glimmers of hope to make it bearable.  Theo's redemption alone make it worth taking this difficult journey.  I felt exhausted after watching it...but also so impressed with the craftsmanship and the feelings I was grappling with.<br /><br />So now I sound like a real touchy-feely guy.  That's not me!  But for CHILDREN OF MEN, the best thing I can say is that it was haunting.  This is a film that you must see and experience for yourself.  I guess you might not like it...others didn't...but if you do like it, you'll be SO glad you didn't miss it.  And see it on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I suspect that if one agrees with what appears to be director Alfonso Cuaron's premise, that humankind's basest instincts for selfishness, fouling its own nest, violence toward each other and the acceptance of authoritarianism when faced with fear can be met by the redemptive power of hope and love, then one will accept Children of Men as a film of emotional power.<br /><br />For me, Children of Men is a movie in which Cuaron tries to stuff in far too many actions. He seems to aiming for the kind of allegory that can change the way we feel about our lives, but he winds up making many of the compromises that movies force upon some directors as they find themselves with big budgets to work with and the need to sell tickets to justify the investment.<br /><br />The story, as has been pointed out by others, is one big Macguffin. It's 2027 and civilization has fallen to its knees. The world is nothing but chaos, terrorism, a rotting environment and death. Britain has managed to survive as a nation state by becoming a horrendous dictatorship, needing immigrants for menial work and turning them into outcasts, periodically rounding them up along with the fugees, the refugees from the world's chaos who managed to slip past Britain's barriers. Concentration camps are filling up, laws are enforced with ferocity, there are no civil rights and the government has become the greatest killer of them all. In exchange, the British have order.<br /><br />And it has been 19 years since a baby was born, anywhere in the world. Humankind has mysteriously become sterile. The point of the movie is that a frightened young woman is discovered to be pregnant. In an instant she becomes the center of the movie...will she be used by rebels to try to undermine the government? Will she find a way to escape by sea to some almost mythical group of scientists who are searching for peace and an answer to humankind's infertility? Will she and her baby be killed? Will they survive? It seems her only hope will be a burned-out, used-up functionary who once tried to change things, years ago. From the time this man first meets this scared girl-child and realizes that she's pregnant, to the end of the movie in a small rowboat waiting to see if mankind has a future, we're on a medieval journey through the terrors of hell as the girl and her protector deal with hatred, avarice, brutality, imprisonment, death and war.<br /><br />The question for me was: Is all this Macguffining well done enough to be interesting? If it is, is the story itself worth it?<br /><br />You'll have to make up your own minds. Simply as a story, I think whatever success Children of Men has had has depended on Clive Owen. He's the protector and he's in just about every scene. Owen is a fine actor. Unlike many actors who have made it to the top, he is most effective reacting. He seldom indulges in flashy heroics in his movies and doesn't do so here. At first, he's uncertain, confused and cautious. When he commits himself to the journey, he doesn't have all the answers, just a willingness to take advantage of opportunities and to risk his life because he's come to believe in what he is doing. It's a first-rate performance.<br /><br />But then we have Julianne Moore as a rebel leader and Owen's former wife. In my view, she's too big a name for the size of the part, and the part is too large for the story. Michael Caine has a juicy role as Owen's older friend. He's gotten up to look like Brent Spiner in Independence Day. Caine does a nice job, but both he and Moore infect the movie with "star" presence. I think both roles would have been better for the movie if played by little known but good actors. Chiwetel Ejiofor is excellent as a dedicated and even ruthless rebel leader. But the movie only needs Owen, and he delivers.<br /><br />Cuaron, in this medieval miracle tale, has given us a great look at the hell humanity has made for itself. At times, for me, he lingers on and expands this view the better to sell tickets. The whole extended urban battle at the end of the movie seemed to go on and on for no great purpose than to show us how a well-crafted urban war can be presented. Most of the movie's horrors, in fact, are so carefully framed and photographed, so well and ingeniously lit, that I was always aware I was watching a movie. Most movie-ish of all was that heavenly voice wafting down on us as humanity's redemption is resolved by a young mother and her baby.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that, for me, needs to be taken seriously simply because a talented director with serious themes has made it. In this era of endless comic book movies and films with the old ultra violence, Curaon deserves our respect. So does Clive Owen.<br /><br />Try Owen in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001BKACG">Croupier</a>.

Well the notion that Cuar&oacute;n was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.<br /><br />Cuar&oacute;n can indeed make a great movie and could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness clearly shines through when Cuar&oacute;n is turned loose with "his own" film, and Children of Men is a good example.<br /><br />Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what Cuar&oacute;n does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar nominated Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n).<br /><br />In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth, and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28 Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I was reminded of throughout Children of Men.<br /><br />Cuar&oacute;n adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through.<br /><br />Clive Owen leads the cast, and this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in A-list performances.<br /><br />A fair amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of Men? You don't get that too often anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)<br /><br />I have to say up front that I was not a big fan of the book upon which this movie is based. Thus, I approached the film with a bit of trepidation; sometimes mediocre books make for great films, but more often than not, they don't. The good news is that Children of Men is better than the novel upon which it is based; the bad news is that it's probably not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Cuaron (who holds three Academy Award nominations, two of them for writing, none for directing) here gives us the story of Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a minor government functionary whose ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), is involved with a resistance group in a near-future London where women have lost the ability to bear children. (As the movie opens, the youngest person on the planet, at eighteen years and change, is killed in South America.) Julian contacts Theo and asks if he can pull some strings to get a young black refugee out of Britain and into the arms of the Human Project, a much wider-ranging revolutionary group based outside the country. (Britain has become a racists' paradise; even black citizens, it is inferred, are suffering the persecution that the "'fugees" suffer openly.) Theo goes about it halfheartedly until he finds out the reason this particular girl is so important: she's the first woman in more than eighteen years to become pregnant.<br /><br />Owen and Moore both tend to be hit-or-miss actors, but they perform capably here. It helps that they're backed up by a fantastic stable of actors; Michael Caine is excellent as always, and the wonderful Peter Mullan, in a small role, absolutely steals the show. Cuaron turns an emotionless, overly talky book into a credible thriller. It's still a bit on the talky side, but is definitely faster-moving than the book. Worth a rental. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Amazing how two films about babies that I've seen in the past couple of days (this and Knocked Up) can make me feel so differently about the world. For starters, Knocked Up made me feel depressed about relationships in general. Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top and shooting all the zombies.<br /><br />Wrong film.<br /><br />Children of Men ultimately makes me feel like getting on a roof top, with a megaphone, and telling everyone to throw away their pill, their condoms, etc. If every woman in the world is going to end up infertile, then lets get procreating now!<br /><br />Hahahahaha.<br /><br />OK, a bit OTT, but what a harrowing film this is to watch. It's all about the world in 2027 (twenty years away) when no child has been born in 18 years, as all women are infertile, and the world's youngest human is murdered. Clive Owen (I know!) is sought out by an ex girlfriend (played by Julianne Moore) to help protect a pregnant girl.<br /><br />It's set in a very dark and depressing England, filled with guns, violence and lots of not very nice things. The film did grip me from beginning to end, purely because of how shocking it is, despite the fact I hate Clive Owen's acting with a passion. It's a infinitely shocking movie, which will leave you depressed, full of no passion for life anymore - yeah, I do let myself get too affected by movies sometimes. Give me a couple of days. The best thing to do after watching this movie, is to get into bed with the person you love and stay there.

In the year 2027, governments have collapsed due to a major infertility problem. It seems that, for reasons no one is sure of, women are no longer capable of bearing children, and as a result, panic and fear has gripped the world. The story takes place in London, where a newly formed military government has control over everything. This is especially true when it comes to illegal immigrants, who are rounded up on a daily basis and sent to live in battle stricken refugee camps. Watching this film was a scary experience for me; what we have is a new version of an Orwellian civilization, where a failure to cooperate can lead to harsh penalties.<br /><br />The film begins with the news reporting the death of the world's youngest person (he was only eighteen). In an age where no new children are being born, such a loss is enough to make total strangers weep. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is quite aware of their grief, yet he can say nothing about it. Many years ago, he was an activist who rejected the government's strict regulations. But ever since the death of his young son, he's lived a humdrum life, monotonously going to work everyday carrying a cup of coffee. Only when he's kidnapped at gunpoint does his life get interesting; he's taken to a secret location and reunited with his estranged ex-wife, Julian (Julianne Moore). Apparently, she's now part of a terrorist group that demands equality for all immigrants.<br /><br />She kidnapped Theo because she needs his help. Apparently, a girl from Fiji needs the proper papers in order to safely cross into a restricted area. He can use his influence on his cousin--a high-ranking British minister--to get these papers. He's initially reluctant to be a part of Julian's plans ... until he actually meets the Fijian girl. Her name is Kee (Claire-Hope Ashity), and she has a big secret: she's eight months pregnant.<br /><br />What follows is a dangerous journey through England, pitting the characters against seemingly insurmountable odds, including raids, deception, gunfire, and death. What makes the situation more difficult is that not everyone in this film as easy to trust as one might think; a number of characters have hidden agendas, not the least of which is preparation for The Uprising, which will supposedly pave the way to a new tomorrow by overthrowing the government. Those affiliated with The Uprising want Kee's baby for themselves, if not for a safe haven, then for a way to show the world that they are capable of starting a new society. It would seem that in this bleak future, money, land, and goods are not humanity's most valuable possession. Babies are. A baby means that there's hope for the future.<br /><br />In realizing the position Kee is in, and in understanding that danger is consistently surrounding her, Theo decides to help her himself. There are very few he can rely on for help; it seems that the only two trustworthy people are the holistic Miriam (Pam Ferris) and the philosophical stoner Jasper (Michael Caine). Soon word begins to spread about a secret development called The Human Project, which is a way to start a new society. This will be Kee's sanctuary as well as her baby's. It's only a matter of getting them both there before it's too late.<br /><br />Most of the narrative ideas in this film are not new; if anything, they're derivative of other futuristic Anti Establishment stories, such as "1984," "Escape from New York," "V for Vendetta," and "Mad Max." However, there's an underlying optimism that makes this story unique. Even when the bombs explode, the bullets fly, and the blood spills, I couldn't help but feel that Cuaron was working towards a more positive resolution, as if to say that hope is in fact a good thing to have. I even felt that way during a long shot, in which the camera follows Theo as he runs through the rubble of a refugee camp, trying to dodge the barrage of gunfire. A man is murdered in the midst of the fighting, and a few drops of blood hit the camera lens. It was a powerful reminder of humanity's weaknesses, especially since the scene doesn't cut to a new shot.<br /><br />Dr. Phil occasionally says that the past is gone and the future hasn't happened yet; the only time is now. Films like "Children of Men" could reinforce such a perspective, considering the future we're presented with is one to avoid at all costs. What good will come from thinking ahead towards a dark, cruel future? I think that's the point the film is trying to make, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. This is a fascinating film, filled with complex issues and difficult situations, all of which come together to form an appropriate ending.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Science fiction is always about the present.  This has been true since the beginning of science fiction.  It has to be true since we can only extrapolate from the present to the future.  Only rarely, once in a million tries perhaps, does somebody come up with something truly original, or something unpredictable.  Leonard Da Vinci foresaw submarines, but if you think about it, he had the example of turtles, whales and dolphins.  Who foresaw nuclear energy? Who foresaw electricity and all that it can do?<br /><br />So this is about the present.  The refugee camp could be in Palestine.  The round up of immigrants is what many people in Europe and the US want.  It may happen tomorrow; in fact it is happening to some extent.  The irony and perhaps the illogic of this film is that with no babies being born, now for eighteen years, there is no labor force coming on to do the grunt work of society.  So why are the Brits in a frenzy of anti-immigration?  Apparently because of a fascist government has come to power.<br /><br />This reminds me a bit of something from Terry Gilliam who directed 12 Monkeys (1995) and Brazil (1985).  There is something about the decadent and bombed out feel of the scenes that is the same.<br /><br />This is a film for the underdog, for the oppressed.  It is in a symbolic sense a statement about aging Europe with its declining birth rates needing the fertility of people from southern climes, people of color to save the world from extinction.  In Europe today there are countries with birth rates so low that their populations are declining.  In both Europe and the US it is immigrants who are supporting the declining populations which are increasingly old.  In the US we have winked at the influx of illegal immigrants for decades because those in power know two things: (1) cheap labor is good for their bottom line; and (2) without young people paying into social security, the system will go bankrupt.<br /><br />The sets were exquisite, the battle scenes in the refugee camp seemed as authentic as the nightly news, well focused and involving.  The camera work was outstanding and carefully set up.  Michael Caine as the aging hippy was perfect.  I saw him recently in The Prestige (2006) and I have to say, he is like a man with a new career in his mid-seventies.  Claire-Hope Ashitey, who played Kee with her big eyes and her fresh face and her reserved style was also very good.  Clive Owen looked as heroic as the part demanded, and Julianne Moore in a limited role was good.<br /><br />There was some corniness in the movie and some politically correct stuff, like Kee braiding the old woman's hair and our hero being sensitive enough to be a midwife (today's men are above and beyond the purely macho).  There is also a root for the underdog feel throughout with the good guys (relatively speaking) being outsiders.  The scene where the government troops stand in awe of a baby's cry was striking (imagine how Spielberg would have milked this!), but I suspect that somebody, at hearing of the first human birth in over eighteen years, would have ignored the resumption of fire and stayed with the only woman on earth who was fertile.  I think everyone would have wanted to protect her and her baby.<br /><br />A nice touch that director Alfonso Cuaron could have brought to the film was to show us people doing extreme things in their desperation to have children, worshipping icons of fertility maybe, acting out weird rituals while imbibing strange concoctions.  Instead of just showing some religious demonstrators blaming the lack of human fertility on sinfulness, we might have gotten a glimpse of fertility cults drinking the essence of goat eggs or rhino horns as they danced around some fertility symbol.  Maybe there could have been a national health crisis as myriads of people, especially women, went crazy or committed suicide because of depression brought on by infertility.  Actually there was a hint of this in the movie but it was greatly underdeveloped.<br /><br />Another problem with this film (from my POV; for others this might be a plus) is that the direction relies heavily on action sequences.  There are chase scenes (and a nice car door opening gimmick used twice, once to knock the bad guys off their motorcycles, and once to knock down one of the fishes holding a gun).  But there was little subtlety in the story.  Most of the subtlety in the movie is in the scenes themselves and in the camera work.  And the characters are rather one-dimensional.  Theo (Clive Owen) is merely heroic.  He fights through the bullets and the other obstacles to help Kee and her baby.  Kee herself is hardly developed at all.  Michael Caine's character Jasper is the only one with any real depth.<br /><br />Two final points: I don't think this film is nearly as interesting as Cuaron's Y tu mama tambien (2001), and I would not dream of watching this film without subtitles since a lot of the dialogue is almost inaudible to these ancient ears.<br /><br />By the way, a discussion of why women were infertile and how the movie differs from the book can be found at the IMDb.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I went into this film expecting "The International" meets "Minority Report." Instead, the film plays out more like "28 Days Later" meets "Saving Private Ryan." Either way, it's a solid piece of filmmaking that stands out due to it's emotional stance and amazing performances. I was genuinely impressed at the calculated tension the film delivered (the scene with the stalling car nearly stopped my heart!) I rate this movie as a solid 4, and it could have been a 5 if the ending were a little better. (As it stands, it's a sort of sad/abstract ending. Hope is coming, but there's no REAL climax.)<br /><br />Highly recommended work of art!</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>At first, this film seemed to be a sci-fi film noire in the mold of Blade Runner. It portrays a dystopian society in which women lack fertility. Indeed, unlike a lot of sci-fi films nowadays, "Children of Men" does not shy away from making dystopia realistic and grisly. Key characters are killed suddenly, the color palate is mainly grey, and all of the key characters have traits that make them less than admirable. In one chilling scene, an important character is last shown being taken away by troops with a hood over her head, which is the last we see of her.<br /><br />The film could have really been a sci-fi hit had it not been so pointless. It lacks focus and the plot never really grabs the viewer's interest. A lot of important relationships and plot twists are left unexplained. We never learn why women become infertile or why immigrants are treated so badly, except perhaps that this is a dystopia. Unlike Blade Runner, the movie had no insightful moment or moral revelation. Rather than provoking thought, the film's end seems too hollywood for the genre.<br /><br />I like the style of dystopia, the basic idea by P.D. James, and the cinematography, but the plot (which should be the heart of the film) is just not strong enough. I found myself bored during the film and frankly not caring about the characters or the outcome. I would give the director another shot at a sci-fi dystopia, but with a tighter story-line.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's "Children of Men" is a horrifying vision of how the world could end if no more children were born.  Extremely provocative, this film made me realize how important children are to our future.  Without them, the world becomes psychologically insane before dying a physical death.<br /><br />  Mother Nature has imposed her own form of birth control on mankind.  At first, a few women began miscarrying, then hundreds more until it became a world-wide epidemic.  It is now the year 2027 and a child has not been born in eighteen years; despair and grief has led the world to the brink of total destruction.  Every country, except Britain, seems to have collapsed.  The British government has launched a campaign to rid the country of all illegal immigrants known as Fugees.  One of these Fugees is a pregnant girl, Joy.  Theo Faron (Clive Owen of "Derailed") struggles to help her get safely to a boat owned by Operation Humanity.  Unfortunately, a terrorist group, the Fishes, wants to use Joy's baby as a pawn for its diabolical plans against the British government.<br /><br />  "Children of Men" is highly recommended for fans of apocalyptic, end-of-the-world horror.  Extremely tense and war-like in its graphic depiction of street violence, this film is highly emotional.  Not easily forgotten, it will leave you asking, "Could this really happen?"  One touching scene that made me cry was when Joy's baby was being carried out of a destroyed building.  The tenants stood spellbound, gaping and murmuring, "A baby.  A baby," as they remembered a world that was long gone.  A political statement as well as a disaster film, "Children of Men" should be added to your science fiction/horror/adventure collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Visually arresting, CHILDREN OF MEN is one of those movies that are best appreciated after being viewed a second or third time.  The vision of the future is chilling as society frays at the edges amidst massive infertility. Governments have become increasing authoritarian and government-dispensed pills become the opiates of the masses.  The specter of human extinction looms on many levels - some manmade and others biological.<br /><br />The presence of a pregnant refugee becomes a symbol of hope and redemption as the movie's protagonist transforms from indifference to committed partisan in her journey to safety.  We can all hope that a "HUMAN PROJECT" awaits to save us from the long-term consequences of our own folly.<br /><br />A haunting soundtrack complements the cinematography.  Michael Caine turns in a brief yet masterful performance.  Not quite on the order of BLADE RUNNER (what is?), but definitely worth seeing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>I was somewhat hesitant about renting this movie, as I had heard that it was just another left/liberal rant against corporate/conservative types. It's not. If anything, it's more of a Christian allegory than anything else. The protagonist is named Theo (Greek for "god"), the movie opened in the USA on Christmas Day, and the story is basically a Nativity story set in a bleak, fascist future. It's a bit ponderous and heavy-handed in places, but overall "Children of Men" does a great job of making the world it is set in real and frightening. On its own merits, I'd give it four stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to dock this DVD a half-point or more for its inclusion of an unnecessary, irrelevant, and highly biased "bonus feature" called "The Possibility of Hope," which is complete rubbish. It is nearly a half hour long, and consists entirely of leftwing wackos ranting against globalism, capitalism, and industrial society in general -- all of which has little or nothing to do with the movie!<br /><br />At one point during the movie itself, when one of the Fishes starts making political comments, the others tell him to shut up, that it's all irrelevant now. Too bad the movie's producers didn't follow that advice. If they had, I'd be giving this DVD four stars, but as it stands I'm downgrading it to three.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Clive Owen plays Theo, a reluctant hero.

But until that time we have "Children of Men," yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.<br /><br />Based on a novel by P.D. James, "Children of Men" takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).<br /><br />The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).<br /><br />"Children of Men" has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.<br /><br />But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional "chase" movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from "Fahrenheit 451" to "Logan's Run" to "The Island" to "Minority Report" to "The Imposter" to "Paycheck," to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the "name" players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.<br /><br />"Children of Men" is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>This a bold. challenging, ingenious yet flawed movie. It is mostly for film buffs/sci fi fans and arty types.<br /><br />The premise is fascinating...women are now infertile and the human race is dying out. The world has gone down the crapper. Immigrants are now subjected to concentration camps and are considered lower than low. There is a discovery of a pregnant immigrant and her baby will be the subject of some type of multiple illicit political ploys.<br /><br />Clive Owen is a real cool actor. He is no action hero yet he is a man's man. He is not loud and brash yet he radiates charisma. His acting talent was effectively demonstrated in the terrific drama "Closer".<br /><br />There are two action sequences that are quite harrowing. One involves an unexpected ambush in a car and the other is Clive Owen chasing/looking for a baby while an apartment building is in the midst of a military attack. Both scenes involve (I believe) just one camera take (a la "Saving Private Ryan's" opening beach battle scene) so you know the battle does not take place on a sound stage but rather it is laid out in a more elaborate manner. The long takes makes it look like it is really taking place, like it is a documentary.<br /><br />An issue with the movie is the lack of narrative. I guess, the viewer catches wind of what is going on while Clive Owen's charactor does but the effect makes the movie slow at times. It is hard to understand the depth of any of the charactors because of this type of story telling. Charactors come and go (like... die off) and the movie really does not deal with it.<br /><br />Lastly, (I am not giving away anything), the ending is abrubt and very unfullfilling. The movie starts out slow. builds up steam, captures your passion and then has a very weak ending. That may not be the film's fault since the movie is adapted from a novel. Whatever it was, I thought the movie was anticlimactic.<br /><br />Now, I give this movie a big thumbs up because it was great science fiction. It was no lasers/robots/spaceships sci fi but, rather, a plausible plot occuring in the not so distant future. You would have to think about this flick when it's over.<br /><br />This may be like a Stanely Kubrick movie where you just are not going to get it upon one viewing. Theer are a lot of subtleties in the movie that may need a second analysis.<br /><br />Since there are so many problems in today's world, I like a good dommsday movie. It seems very topical.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Written and directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. That's how science fiction movies should all be:  inventive, without special effects and, most of all, NOT infantile to please pimply teenagers. A must.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I cannot give a poignant review that would do justice to *Children of Men*, like K. Harris and other top reviewers here.  Just read theirs, they've said everything beautiful about this film.<br /><br />All I can say is that this film enchanted me from the beginning to the end.  I love films that cause me to think after the movie is over.  But this one caused me to think about it days after I saw it.<br /><br />Clive Owens plays Theo Faron, living in England...in 2027.  People around the world has stopped being able to reproduce children.  The youngest human was 18 but was murdered for refusing to do something.<br /><br />Immediately after this murder, Theo's estranged wife appears and pleads him to help her sneak in Kee, an African-American refugee to the "other side".  However, she must have travel permits/papers.  After a round of adventure that resulted in a death, Theo discovers that Kee is actually pregnant.  The first such pregnancy in almost 20 years.  Theo suddenly understands why Kee must go to the other side...into the safety of the Human Project, whose aim is to cure infertility.<br /><br />All I can say is that *Children of Men* presented such an issue that is worth intellectual discussion.  For many, the possibility of a world-wide infertility is impossible.  However, if it should ever happen, how would the world react?  And if a woman was to get pregnant, would she be used as a political weapon or as a medical guinea pig?  And are you willing to die to ensure the birth of a miracle?<br /><br />I cannot decide which scenes were my favorites.  I liked the abduction of Theo.  I liked the escape from the Fishes.  I liked the war scenes between the army and the militia.  Heck, I liked everything.  This is truly one that you should have added to your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>while watching, I sat and compared this film in the genre of mature science fiction. Blade runner comes to mind, as you've maybe come across a few reviews with it. I feel it bare's strong resemblance to the sleeper hit 12 monkeys, staring Bruce Willis as a confused convict with a gaping hole in his memory, which slowly rejuvenates through the coarse of the movie towards the climax, in which he discovers his own beginning. A sort of Time vortex for you science minded ones. The comparison comes from the anxiety ridden truth that there seems to be this world, which is perfectly sensible to the characters within, but to the viewers, is crypted and otherworldly. Though, both, lead you to believe there is a final answer, just in that mysterious, ambiguous, unsaid way. For Children of men it is hope, not the avoidably gargoned definitions that lie in the answers of a not-to-distant-future's civilization. For 12 monkeys it was the terrible agony of fatalism. But it seemed trapped within that boys eyes, eyeing his adult self, that there was the hope that perhaps one lifeline will produce the cure for a diseased and hopeless world. The same hope, resounds at the end with the idea of the human project.<br /><br />  Children of Men is outstandingly ambiguous in nearly all departments. It thrusts you into a mans life, whose past seems to slowly catch up with him. You are led to trust this man, as will the fertile carrier, whose harsh, direct way of communicating somehow becomes servile to. (Fatalistic?) It seemed almost out of character for her, after fumigating her disfavor for the man almost incessantly from her sudden arrival. She uncovers her meanness by unbosoming her 'boys' name, whom he disregards as a clownish attempt at a most serious matter, and to take a step back in the timeline of the movie to a further degree as she freely, and carelessly, 'unbosom's' herself again to show in true form the nature of their journey, her round, and very pregnant belly. (in fact nearly bursting as you will soon find out) The film is a respectable combination of artistic camera work, and twisting, gyrating tension in what feels like a short story of sorts. It is without expanations, but fullfilling in that way that pocket, novellas provide for subway riders, or those with ample and numerous moments alone. It's climax is gratuitously wartorn, and its escapism edges you to the borders of your seat, panting and sweating in the dark, mesmerized by the shockingly, numbingly good sequences until the poetic end. Filled with applaudable actors giving respectable due to a most determined director. I couldn't help but stand and feel a jerking strain at seeing the blank screen and trademark like post-title.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>It's 2027 and the world no longer can produce children.

Yawn.<br /><br />After seeing it, I don't think I would rent it again.<br />So, there you go.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>By any measure this is one of the finest dystopian works of art ever made.  It easily takes its place alongside other visions of the future such as novels such as 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451, and BRAVE NEW WORLD and films such as BLADE RUNNER and BRAZIL.  But unlike most of these other dystopian masterpieces, CHILDREN OF MEN ends on a hopeful, mildly optimistic note.<br /><br />The movie, set approximately 20 years in the future, begins shockingly with an announcement on television news that the world's youngest person has died at age 18.  A few seconds later the fast food place on whose TV we have been watching the news is destroyed by a terrorist bomb.  The two shocking events set the tone for the rest of the film.  We get a picture of a society in rapid decline, a dying world in which one widely advertised project is Quietus, a reference to the peace that Hamlet might receive if the fear of an afterlife did not keep him from suicide.  In this instance it is indeed a medication for ending one's life.  The film is set in England, which is the last orderly spot on earth and which has become both armed encampment and police state, struggling both to control the populace at home and keep the rest of the world out.  The world crisis has been created by the sudden infertility of all the women in the world.  I normally would hestitate to reveal the next detail, but since advertisements for the movie have been giving it away there is no point in playing coy.  Theo, played by Clive Owen, is recruited to help assist a young black immigrant girl to a location where she can escape from England by vote.  The reason she is so important is simple:  she is pregnant.<br /><br />I won't spoil anymore of the plot.  I think this is a film that is best seen with minimal knowledge.  I will say that I have never seen a film that is more viscerally real than this one.  There are numerous action sequences that feel so realistic that they almost feel real than rigged.  This is not typical movie special effects, which usually are exaggerated to make it more theatrical.  The action is more muted, but also vastly more realistic, so that you almost feel that it is happening around you.  It is not always an easy movie to watch.  As Theo and Kee, the young girl played wonderfully by newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, wend their way through the chaos around them, you feel at times that the world is on the verge of collapse.  Some here have criticized the ending.  I found it moving and deeply touching, as well, as I mentioned above, quietly optimistic.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie stands out.  The design of the film is outstanding.  It feels both futuristic and yet still very much like the world we live in now.  The cinematography is outstanding and the special effects as good as you will see without using CGI (there was CGI, but what I'm praising are the non-CGI effects).  The direction by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n is deft throughout and on the heels of such diverse successes as Y TU MAM&Aacute; TAMBI&Eacute;N, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN (still by far the best film in that series), and THE LITTLE PRINCESS further establishes himself as one of the world's most fascinating directors.  And the acting is impeccable.  Clive Owen is simply one of the world's finest actors and this is his finest performance yet.  The film is buttressed by a number of supporting performances.  Although he hasn't yet had a break out performance to establish his popular reputation, Chiwetel Ejiofor has through a number of fascinating performances established himself as one of the worlds most versatile and gifted actors (try watching this film along with his performances in SERENITY, KINKY BOOTS, and DIRTY PRETTY THINGS and you'll get an idea of his talent and range).  Michael Caine is superb as a hippy journalist.<br /><br />I rarely like to comment on DVD special features because I don't think most people watch them and partly because it is never why I buy a DVD anyway.  But this disc has some of the best special features I've ever seen.  They explain how they performed some of the amazing special effects in the film.  I definitely recommend watching them.<br /><br />Just a word or two about astonishingly low rating this film is getting here on Amazon.  If this isn't a five star movie, the rating makes no sense.  Critics have been beside themselves in raving about this movie and ordinary fans and viewers are not giving this low ratings elsewhere.  On IMDB.com, for instance, it currently has a 8.1 User Rating and is #149 on the list of the 250 most highly rated films.  It really is that good.  I can only speculate on who is giving it such low ratings, but let me caution potential viewers that this is not a blockbuster adventure film.  If your idea of a great movie is SAHARA or NATIONAL TREASURE, you will find this to be a shocking disappointment.  But if you enjoy more artistically rendered films, like art films, and like more serious rather than merely commercial films, you will love this.  In my opinion it was, along with PAN'S LABYRINTH and THE LIVES OF OTHERS, one of the three truly great films of 2006 (though it went into general release in 2007, it had a limited 2006 release).  If you like intelligent, serious, noncommercial films, this will leave you stunned.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Children of Men gives us yet another brilliant cinematic dystopian experience in the tradition of great films like A Clockwork Orange, Logan's Run, The Terminator, 1984 and Bladerunner.  It makes a web of appropriate, contemporary and significant social insights, while at the same time it gives us hopeful storytelling about the fall and possible triumph of humankind.<br /><br />The story is set in the year 2027, which is closer than one may think and seems to follow a time period of immense global change.  Make no mistake about it, in order for things to end up the way they do in the year 2027 here in Children of Men, we will have to endure some really horrendous ordeals in pretty much the next two or three years.  This includes a flu pandemic, some kind of nuclear conflict, large scale societal and cultural breakdown, terrorism, the collapse of all governments outside of England and of course, the most significant feature, the complete infertility of all female humans on Earth since the year 2009.  Despair is all that exists in this world but despair is not what this story is about.  Children of Men is a story about hope.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directs; one of my personal favorite filmmakers for Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n.  The story is inspired by P.D. James' novel of the same name.  Cuar&oacute;n's take is actually quite consistent with Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n in that it is a road movie about the primary character's self-discovery and makes some really insightful social commentary.  The movie opens by informing us of the unexpected death of "baby Diego", the youngest human being on Earth.  We then follow Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who is an unlikely hero in complete despair.  He is a flawed drunk who smokes and when asked about his smoking he replies "it's not working", implying that he just doesn't care to live.  Then again, in this setting, who really does?  The human race will be extinct in less than 100 years.  Children of Men could've benefited from less detailed advertising as I almost wished I didn't know that Theo's transformation from despair to hope would be because of an African refugee Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), who is the first pregnant woman on Earth in 18 years.  That isn't to say the film did not surprise me time and time again.  It certainly did.  I didn't know much about Children of Men going into it and I think knowing less is better for the audience here more so than many films, so I will spoil no more than I have already.<br /><br />There are two things that make this movie amazing, beyond the fundamental strengths of it's story and overall direction.  The first point I'd like to mention is with regards to the performances.  Each actor melts into their roles brilliantly.  Obviously we expect this from Julianne Moore and Michael Caine but we get some great performances from the newcomers as well.  Even the small supporting roles are great.  But most of all, Clive Owen has truly arrived here.  He actually helped write for his own character and his passion for the role really shows.  I'm actually surprised he wasn't considered for an Oscar.  It's often easy to say that the character's writing itself is what pulls forth a great performance from the actor, but the fact that Clive assisted in writing the character into the screenplay, and then blew me away with his performance is remarkable to say the least.  The other big strength for me is the modern political flavor.  The film functions as a loose deliberation of sorts on our current global political climate, and it offers us some potentially dire consequences.  It's elaborate to decipher where Cuar&oacute;n's convictions lie, but it's certainly worth joining in on his insights regardless of where you, the viewer, stand.<br /><br />Keep in mind, Cuar&oacute;n does not care to offer us a back story like most movies do and the casual viewer may be frustrated with some key questions.  It's not a typical action film narrative and the audience is expected to draw some of their own conclusions or even accept that we just don't have the answers at all.  Of course that mirrors real life and for me it's challenging questions that make a movie great.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuar&oacute;n uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.<br /><br />The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.<br /><br />Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.<br /><br />Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 07</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Children of Men is a science fiction story that could appeal easily to non-sci-fi fans. The movie is set in the year 2027 and portrays a very believable future. The twist is that by 2027, all humans have become infertile. The youngest person on Earth is 18 years old and when people stopped having babies, the world fell apart. Clive Owen delivers an incredibly realistic performance in bringing to life this book by British mystery maven, P.D. James. Owen stars as Theo Faron, the one-time activist who has lost his cause and seemingly his passion for life as well. An important part of his past catches up with him when he is confronted by an extremist organization asking for help. Does he help this woman find help, when it means risking her life and his? And does his decision become easier or harder when he learns she is pregnant!?<br /><br />The movie has it all: action, humor, and a brilliant theme showcasing the relationship between faith and chance in our lives. The action was gripping and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. In Children of Men, they do not hold your hand through the story; things happen and they happen quickly. You will not get lost due to the speed, but be prepared. Things happen and you may not agree with them all, but by the end of the movie I hope you agree with me that everything that happened was necessary and well-timed.<br /><br />The laughs come at odd intervals, but seem to be just when you need them. The performances by Michael Caine (Jasper) and Peter Mullan (Syd) added the right about of levity to balance out the serious nature of the story. I could talk all day about Michael Caine alone and his iconic career in film, but I will leave it at this: he was fantastic yet again. Any elaboration I make on that would mean divulging a detail of the film that you should experience for yourself.<br /><br />Jasper even brings the theme (mentioned above) right to the audience. He tells a story about Theo's past and sets it up nicely. I love movies that can pull that off; I can't imagine it is easy.<br /><br />I have never been in a war zone. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in such a hostile environment. From what I would imagine, Children of Men nailed it. I have seen movies with similar scenes, but they have never felt as real. Maybe it is the political environment currently that added to the feeling in the movie.<br /><br />I liked Children of Men for many reasons. I will admit that there were a few moments that I felt the time passed too slowly, but they were brief. Clive Owen did wonderfully. The language was rough and there is a lot of blood shed. If those do not deter you from seeing other movies, you should see Children of Men.<br /><br />For another Clive Owen movie you should see, check out Croupier.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I am a fan of dystopian-future movies, and this is certainly one of the most chilling -- and plausible -- that I have seen.  The year is 2027 and a series of cataclysmic disasters has brought humanity to the brink: New York City has been nuked, famine and political upheaval have uprooted civil society across the planet, and for nearly twenty years the human race has been rendered sterile. Ah, but there will always be an England... In this case, it's an Orwellian-fascist state riddled with violence and paranoia, with a refugee crisis that threatens to topple the fragile underpinnings of a brutal police state.  The film is very dark, but has a mordant sense of humor that is its savings grace.  It's also directed in a half-dreamy style that curiously undercuts the action-movie cliches -- a car chase takes place with in a broken hatchback that our hero is trying to bump-start, as the bad guys chase him on foot; later he loses his shoes and runs through the rubble wearing only a pair of plastic flip-flop sandals.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very effective, but inherently frightening view of the future.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Of all the cinema's many apocalypse films, never have I seen one so profoundly cynical and melancholy as Alfonso Cuaron's CHILDREN OF MEN.  Adapted from popular novelist P.D. James' one departure from her usual mysteries, the film is set in 2027, where the world is speedily falling into mass chaos.  Humankind can no longer reproduce, and as the lead character, Theo (Clive Owen), remarks, "All of this [humanity] will be gone in seventy years."  The one society that remains relatively kempt is Britain, where Theo attempts to evade the frequent terrorist attacks and assaults from savage bands of the homeless.  One day Theo is reunited with his old flame, Julian (Julianne Moore), now the leader of a terrorist organization.  Julian needs papers to escort a young woman across the border; Theo reluctantly agrees to get the papers and escort the young woman, but finds that his role is far more important than he could ever have dreamed when he learns just what the young woman is carrying.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is more than likely the finest of all apocalyptic films, surpassing even such classics as MAD MAX and its sequel, MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR.  While those films had impressive-enough craftmanship to give them considerable cult appeal, they lack the artistry of CHILDREN OF MEN.  This is due completely to Cuaron and the highly-talented cast, which also includes the surprisingly menacing Chiwetel Ejiofor and the always delightful Michael Caine as a gas-passing, pot-smoking Lennon-esque character.  Cuaron made a name for himself with the erotic Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and the magical HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, but CHILDREN OF MEN is unarguably his masterpiece.<br /><br />Cuaron succeeds wonderfully in the dramatic sense, inspiring absolutely top-notch performances from all the actors.  Owen, as usual, is simply marvelous.  As the film begins, he's unquestionably the antihero, but by the film's end he has become a hero in the most sincere form of the word.  Moore is typically impressive, but her role is almost painfully short.  It's Caine who steals the show, as he has done in every film he's appeared in over the last four years or so.  His ridiculously aloof, rude, yet oddly charming performance provides some much-needed comic relief amidst a stupefying amount of bleakness.<br /><br />However, Cuaron is even more of a success in his role as a sci-fi director.  All too often an interesting concept is wasted on a pretentious filmmaker who uses big names and bombastic explosions to attract audiences.  Cuaron doesn't strive for greatness; it comes naturally through the effort he puts into his films and the amount of sheer talent he has.  In CHILDREN OF MEN, he fashions enough of a science-fiction film to make the audience think, enough of a drama to get the audience emotionally-involved, and enough of a thriller to make the audience panic.  It's how surprisingly down-to-earth the film is that makes it all seem so terrifyingly real.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, the most horrible aspect of CHILDREN OF MEN is its depiction of the near future.  This vision of 2027 isn't far-fetched at all - in fact, most of the film's scares come from how chillingly similar 2027 is to 2007.  It's a believable future, where newspaper clippings protesting the Iraq War still remain, the designs of cars have changed very slightly, and rock band Radiohead has finally received the credit it deserves.  The suddenty of humankind's infertility, and the speed at which humanity descends into sheer madness, is enough to keep anyone awake long nights dreading the seeming inevitability of so black a future.<br /><br />What keeps the audience from drowning under CHILDREN OF MEN's tidal wave of futility is hope, a white light that becomes progressively brighter as the film pushes on.  Hope that things are not as bad as they may seem, hope that things will get better, hope that we aren't helpless at the world's end.  But as strong as this hope may be, and even though the film does end on a relatively happy note, it's the fear that things will not get better and that we are helpless that will leave theatergoers trembling and pondering direly far beyond the end credits.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>If you're expecting a fantasy like "Enchanted", stay away from this film but if you want a cautionary tale of the future like "Blade Runner", check this one out.

Totally recommended for fans of sci-fi and "Blade Runner" fans (Bush and other politicos be aware of what you're doing to this planet!!) The HD-DVD transfer gives you a "you are there" look too.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Children of Men', directed by Alfonso Charon, and starring Clive Owen is being touted as a `Blade Runner' for the 21st Century. This blurb was the primary reason for my interest in viewing the DVD, since `Blade Runner' is easily on of the five (5) best all time Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is no `Blade Runner', and does not even have many similarities with `Blade Runner', aside from those things which every work labeled `Science Fiction' has in common with every other SciFi work and the fact that both are set in the 2020s. While `Blade Runner' is a relatively slow-paced `film noir' piece with a lot of exposition laying out the single underlying premise, `Children of Men' is a marathon of frenetic action and tension, with relatively little exposition to explain the reasons for the multiple `what if' premises which turn this into a SciFi flick. That does not mean this is a poor movie, only that comparing it to `Blade Runner' does not reveal anything insightful about the story.<br /><br />Part of the problem I had with the thinness of the exposition on the background is that there are two different premises driving the plot, and I could see no connection between the two, although there was plenty of interactions between the two premises. The first premise, clearly stated in the trailers, is the fact that the entire human population has gone infertile for the last 18 years (beginning in 2009). The second premise, working largely as the palate from which is painted the story's background is painted, is the assumption that the kind of insurgency common in Iraq today has spread to virtually all civilized countries.<br /><br />It may be that the most compelling thing about this movie is the way in which this background has been directed and filmed. The blocking and cinematography actually have a lot in common with Stephen Speilberg's first 15 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan'. The skill with which the camerawork emulates a documentary style makes one believe they are watching CNN, assuming CNN would actually air these scenes. Another movie with which `Children of Men' shares much is the recent English horror flick `28 Days Later', although `Children...' is far more original, with higher production values.<br /><br />The DVD's commentaries are a bit thin, and I'm surprised that they don't bring out the Christian allegory of the story line. While it may not be the primary theme, it should be obvious to anyone who views the movie at least twice.<br /><br />This is Clive Owen's film from start to finish. Costars Julianne Moore and Michael Caine appear in just a few short scenes each, and their top billing is primarily to highlight the importance of their scenes, which may be inadequately done by the narrative.<br /><br />This film easily has some of the socially and politically most interesting SciFi premises since `Soylent Green' and `Logan's Run', and is cinematically far more interesting than these relatively routine Hollywood products; but it won't make my list of top 10 best SciFi movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>There's no time to lose, I heard her say<br />Catch your dreams before they slip away<br />Dying all the time<br />Lose your dreams<br />And you will lose your mind.<br />Ain't life unkind?<br /><br />Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday<br />Who could hang a name on you?<br />When you smile with every new day<br />Still I'm gonna miss you...<br />Ruby Tuesday plays throughout the movie...<br /><br />"The report from 2027 delivered by "Children of Men" is mixed. On the plus side: Flat-screen TVs for every one! Also, alcohol is plentiful, and the dog track is still operating. On the minus side: The world has turned to smoldering ruins, and it's been 18 years since any woman has given birth. Also, the leading consumer product - the Coca-Cola of Dystopia - is a suicide drug called "Quietus." Motto: "You decide when."  Kyle Smith<br /><br />London, 2027 is a world upside down. The riveting scenery reminds me of Cormac Maccarthy's 'The Road'. Bleak, barren, fires burning, men chasing and killing each other. In this case it is the immigrants who are not wanted, they are all rounded up and probably  executed.  Clive Owen plays Theo, an activist brought into the picture by his ex-wife, Julianne Moore. Under a pretext of bringing her to the coast she asks for his help. It turns out that she has a pregnant young woman to escort. There has not been a prenancuy in 19 years, and we are left to guess why. Along the way through many, battles a baby is born and the drive to free the mother and baby goes on.  Theo's old hippie, pot-smoking mentor, played by Michael Caine as you have never seen him, is the epitome of excellent acting. There is no explanation for the infertility, or why a move to the coast or what has really happened in this world.<br /><br />"Based on a novel by British mystery writer P.D. James, the film works both as a thriller and as a satisfying political and social drama. It should prove a winner at the boxoffice in all territories. Set in 2027, with the world gone to hell in a handbasket, the film paints a bleak portrait of a future in which complete global human infertility has meant that no babies have been born anywhere in 18 years. Disease is rampant and military governments everywhere are out of control even in the U.K." Ray Bennett<br /><br />This is a stunning visceral movie. The filming and scenery are phemomenol. You can forgive a lot in the face of filmmaking this dazzling. The story leaves much to our imagination and much to be desired. Clive Owens, Theo, has become a true hero. Why does he risk his life? What does this all mean? It is for you to judge.

"Office Space" and especially in this case, "Blade Runner" and "Touch of Evil."<br /><br />To that list, I believe we'll eventually add "Children of Men," which I honestly feel was the absolute best movie of 2006.<br /><br />When the end titles flashed up on the screen, I was jolted. I had one of those rare moviegoing experiences where I felt I'd just seen something amazing and awe-inspiring.<br /><br />But apparently about half of the people who saw the film completely disagree. After I saw the movie, I wound up in a lot of conversations with people and kept hearing (and, on Amazon, reading) the complaint, "Well, we never found out WHY the women in this movie became infertile." And although I understand the curiousity, I was actually proud of the film for not breaking it all down for us. I think we can suspend disbelief, especially given the conditions of the movie's world. And, really, had the movie in one of its many flashes to the television, offered up a "Jurassic Park"-style primer on the mass infertility, I still don't think the naysayers would've been satisfied.<br /><br />Admittedly, for some, "Children" is a long row to hoe. Writer-director Alfonso Cuaron makes the viewer really work to piece together the plot, and some of the stories questions go completely unanswered, but I'd much rather walk out of a movie still wondering than exit with everything neatly wrapped up. That's why I buy/rent movies on DVD and watch them a second time.<br /><br />And given the movie's apocalyptic and distopian premise, it would've been completely presumptuous for Cuaron to give viewers any kind of concrete resolution.<br /><br />But there's so much to like here: The totally plausible background story about Baby Diego; those three amazing extended takes; a really brave and against-type turn by Clive Owen (who, all through the movie, looks like a shirt that's been pulled out of a washing machine and not properly dried -- hey, he picks up the change that the bad guys throw to him, you gotta love that); little touches like the use of Guernica, the Pink Floyd pig and the statue of David with a prosthetic leg; a Ken Russellian shot set to King Crimson; and especially the widwife's explanation of *how* (not why) the infertility began, which is really all the explanation the problem needs.<br /><br />It all adds up to a challenging, somewhat mind-boggling movie. I wish more people had liked it as much as I did, but then again it's not really the kind of film that people immediately reach out and embrace. Hey, there are wars going on.<br /><br />*** As much as I liked it, I will for balance lodge a few complaints: I hated that awful cover of "Ruby Tuesday" that got trotted out not once, but twice; I felt Michael Caine's otherwise excellent performance was marred by his excessive use of the word, "Amigo"; I don't believe a man could disable three vehicles while standing within whispering distance of armed guards; I didn't believe a certain medical procedure that occurs toward the end of the film could be performed as easily as it was under the conditions depicted; and I really wish Cuaron hadn't called the Human Project's boat "Tomorrow." But, hey, in the overall picture those problems are minor, especially compared to the wonder of that last six-minute tracking shot, which, as it happens, is the only tracking shot the DVD's extra features *don't* explain. And there again, I'm not sure I really need to know.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This movie had an interesting concecpt. What if the world could no longer produce babies? And it did a fine job of portraying the effects. Though there really wasn't any type of explanation as to WHY no one could conceive any more. Visually, the movie is gorgeous. Its crazy and bleak all at the same time. Clive Owen gave a perfect performance. However, I have a major gripe with the ending. No spoilers here. But I mean, it just ended. And what? It sort of just leaves you hanging without hope or expectations. It jarred me from the otherwise brilliant film.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Apocalyptic film about a world with no children. Even England, the last bastion of civilisation, is slipping into choas.<br /><br />Cuaron's vision of the future is memorable but the plot is less interesting. Features some extraordinary visual effects - this film goes a long way on a modest budget - but his use of the hand-held camera is relentless. Might have made a better video game than a movie. Ends abruptly. And what exactly is the point?</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>It is England 2027 and for some unexplained reason, no children were born in 18 years in that country.  Women can no longer conceive and there are no more children playing around.  As world is getting older, it is not getting wiser.  There are terrorist groups, fractions fighing for immigrants rights to enter England, there are militant groups fighing for their political survival.  In a middle of all that misery and fright, Fuji woman is pregnant to everyone's bewilderment.  No one knows who the father is but that does not seem to matter as this young mother is determined to deliver her child and protect it.  There are groups that wish to profit from this event.  For them the birth of the child first time in 18 years is a political statement, particularly since mother is of non-British descent.  This is political, cultural and social revolution ignited by the new life of a baby girl.<br />I have never found more amuzing pothead as that portrayed by Michael Caine in this film.  Julianne Moore is a mother whose child is snatched from her by his untimely death.  In her grief she turns to political activism, terrorism and her own inevitable death ironically caused by her own peers.  Clive Owen is heartbroken father, husband of Moore's character, whose grief leads him to apathy towards life, alchoholism and determination to do whatever it takes in order to protect the innocent child.  He is surrogate father to a newborn girl whose mere existance is a miracle that stands on its own.<br />Powerful, touching and unapologetic.  Just what one would expect from talented director like Cuaron.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I put this DVD in my home theater with surround-sound and must admit that the last 20 minutes of this movie, I literally felt transported into the screen.  The effects are that good as well as frightening.  The scene called "ceasefire" was gut-wrenchingly poignant.  Now to the movie.  It was pretty good though not as great as the critics seemed to say.  The plot was a little difficult to understand.  It appears that Britain in this wacky future world is the only "intact" country remaining after world-wide anarchy has taken place over mankind's inability to reproduce.  Even Britain itself is a hornets nest of pitched battles itself with more chaos than what is going on in Iraq.  The government seems to have been cracking down on "illegal" aliens; hunting them down.<br /><br />Julanne Moore is the rebel leader and she is gunned down rather early in the movie.  The other rebels are harboring an alien who is pregnant.  Clive Owen's character overhears the rebels plotting to kill him and the woman after she gives birth.  This causes him to flee with the pregnant woman and go into hiding.<br /><br />I should mention that Owen gives another great performance as well as Michael Caine, who is an aged Woodstock-type hippie.<br /><br />The ending leaves the viewer with some hope that better things should come, and leaves the movie open for a possible sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Mopey office man (Theo) is brought into a rebel brigade by ex-girlfriend and mother of his dead child with the purpose of getting some travel papers to get a young girl out of England. It's 2027 and not a single birth has occurred in 18 years. The young girl is pregnant and they want to keep her safe. Mopey office man quickly bites off more than he can chew.<br /><br />This is a dark movie, much like 28 Days Later, except without the zombies. Lots of explosions, car chases and mass murders. Michael Cain has a small role as the most "excellent" best friend. Julianne Moore plays the girlfriend but don't go to see her if you're a fan. It's a very small part. Clive Owen is actually quite natural as this character especially in the one-on-one scenes with Cain.<br /><br />I have two peeves. The propagation of humanity problem is because of women's eggs. In the 1994 book of the same name, by author P.D. James, it was the sperm count that was affected. While I expect many changes when you transform a book into a movie, this detail bothers me.<br /><br />Second peeve, throughout the whole movie cats, dogs and various wildlife seem attracted to Theo. They make a point of showing it with the cinematography so I kept thinking it would come up at the end why but it never did. Even my date kept expecting something more. While the story is complete in the main story sense I felt there were gaps that may have been edited out. I'm looking forward to special features when it comes out in rentals.<br /><br />I'd watch it again. Even if you're not a Clive Owen fan it's worth seeing. I want to read the book now.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>In particular, a young woman, pretty, and marked by her face as an outsider in a country that cages outsiders like cattle. The child, in particular, is hers. It's also the first human baby born in nearly twenty years, since some unstated catastrophe ended every human pregnancy - and stopped every other pregnancy since, except hers. She's so young that she never even saw a baby, except in pictures, and now she has one. The only one.<br /><br />But the world around her has gone to hell, or maybe become a hell. "After the fall" movies have been around for a long time: Soylent Green, Hurt's 1984, Bladerunner, and many others, always fallen just a bit farther than the one before. Now we have Children of Men. Skies are stained with smoke, streets are littered since no one cares, and the government ration boxes include suicide kits - the ones advertised on subsidized TV. It's just too believable.<br /><br />I can't say there's a real plot to this movie. It's a small kind of quest, maybe just a trek through concentration camps, buildings burning in urban combat, and scorched earth. Michael Caine puts in a superb performance, since he doesn't know how to do anything else. This time, he's an aging hippie, but also a very brave and pacifist combatant in that war that seems to have no reason, and something even braver for his wife. Claire-Hope Ashitey, an emerging star, plays the young mother (or new Eve) with quiet beauty and charm. The rest of the movie doesn't conspicuously manipulate our feelings until the end, but we want it by then.<br /><br />I'm still not quite sure what to make of this movie, or even whether I want to see it again. I came away impressed, though, and moved in ways that I don't have good words for.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>With global warming no one seems to think of the other<br />possible future effects of pollution.<br />A well acted, well staged, well filmed future.<br />I think this film is timely and has meaning.<br />People tearing themselves apart for no real reason.<br />Hate ruling lives and making a mess of everything.<br />We have to consider there may someday be a last human child.</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>In director Alfonso Cuaron's finest work to date, he attacks itchy subjects such as terrorism, overpopulation, pollution, and illegal immigration in a way that culminates in one of the very best cinematic examinations of the milliniem. Set in an irrevicable future in which women can no longer have children, Children of Men, adapted from P.D. James' book, reminds us -- with heightened intensity -- where our problems today could put us twenty years down the road. Top-notch performances and a crisply cut script, delivered via the depressingly beautiful backdrop of a dying country, amount to a devastating experience, impacting anyone with a pulse and tapping into the great watchful minds of the industry's scrutinizers with a powerful message: What's to come of mankind in twenty, fifty or a hundred years? I haven't the slightest clue. However, as long as we're given tidy diversions such as this, I'll be satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>Perhaps I just don't "get it."  This was an uninspired romp though the director's vision of a bleak future. There's no back story - except a mysterious reason for infertility. Man has simply given up, with no obvious research being done on the problem. Ignoring the fact that, 1) simultaneous worldwide infertility is a really, really long reach. 2) Every government on the planet collapsing at the same time (except England) is an even longer reach.  Good Science Fiction requires a solid foundation and a believable premise - this film has neither.<br /><br />"Blade Runner" for this generation?  Not even close.  The ending was as much an anticlimax as could be anticipated from such an overhyped film.  Now, if we ignore the script, premise, plot and much of the acting, I'll agree that what's left is great. The sets, directing and photography were phenomenal.  The Nicholas Cage movie "Snake Eyes" used a single, long opening shot to establish the action and feel. This movie is composed primarily of that style of shooting - sometimes to such an extreme that it distracts from the movie (that's a good thing much of the time.)<br /><br />Except for the accents and vehicles, it could have been modern day Bosnia or any other war-torn local.  It's not a Science Fiction movie - it uses a Science Fiction premise as an excuse to create a visualization  of the future that is nothing new or unique.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>(3 1/2 *'s) How refreshing it is to get a nightmare science fiction movie.  It's been a long time since we've seen a disutopian novel put on the screen.  'Children of Men' takes place in 2026, not too far in the future.  The planet has become infertile, and baby Diego, the youngest member of the planet has been killed in a terrorist attack in London.  Theo Farran (Clive Owen) is caught between the polarities of that world:  There's the military arm of the government, keeping immigrants in the equivalent of concentration camps.  Then, there's the underground resistance.  Theo's a pedestrian.  He cares about keeping as much stability in the chaos and out of as much trouble as possible.  His love interest is for Jillian who's a part of that underground, and his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), is an elderly hippie who lives out in the country and maintains a mild mannered, but mature dissenter.  As an insider, Theo has what the resistance needs, a program to support their cause.  They give him an offer he can't refuse.  More interesting is someone under their wings, a Fuji woman who is pregnant and in hiding.  Theo has mission impossible, he must, significantly enough, evade both the police state and the rebel radicals while bringing the woman and her baby to safety.<br /><br />Messages galore come out from the movie.  The infertility part is certainly extrapolation, but little else is.  (Merely blowing up tendencies of today is an essential ingredient of science fiction, however.)  The mounting of counter-terrorism in a war at civilization's footstep doesn't try to bring the future too many leaps forward.  The composite picture is an ominous urban nightmare with dilapidated buildings, broken glass, and villains with submachine guns everywhere.  While I think 'Children of Men' is a good diversion from the usual movie fare, I sometimes thought as skillfully as the battle scenes are delivered, and the speeches are being made, that maybe the dialogue and a greater variety of developments would have made it a better picture.  Still, I must concede the movie still haunted me long after I left the theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Children of Men transports us to the year 2027 where the world has not experienced a new birth in 18 years due to mass human infertility.  As a result, people have lost hope and have turned violent.

I believe you have to have that knowledge and perspective when watching this. That being said , it doesnt excuse the laboring scenes that attempt artistic looks. The beginning has a somewhat convoluted feel that prevents the viewer from fully understanding the main charactor(and for that matter the supposed futuristic era). I think the surroundings to create the year 2027 were weak. Their seemed a concerted effort to not go overboard. As far as the pace, I'm not the average "Blockbuster" viewer, and it was slow. I personally love most films taking place in England or with a British slant but I can see how this film saturated the beginning with boredom.<br /><br />  The concept is great. No more human births  and saving a beyond rare newborn has great appeal. Too many unnecessary scenes though that Clive Owens charactor seemed to be walking through. A real stretch(and yawn). Towards the later middle of the film it takes off. This is not simply because of the action picking up, but because you could more clearly see a bigger storyline coming together. The filming is brilliant as the interaction of unique charactors brings realism. Pure excitement abounds as bullets fly through the twisted rubble and you root for the near impossible. Again, brilliant filming. So much dragging in the beginning forced a simple ending. The end is where the expanding needed to be, with depth. Im not a strict thrill seeker only, and love heart felt and intricate scenes, but the start to middle was a little too big for itself. The movie is saved by some of the most harrowing rescue and action scenes I've ever seen. The standard dvd picture is decent but not outstanding. I cant comment on the HD DVD yet. A word to the viewer, be prepared to settle in early on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Children of Men" is based on P.D. James' dystopian novel set in the year 2027, where all women have been mysteriously infertile for 18 years. This world without children has deteriorated into chaos, ostensibly because there is little reason to maintain our infrastructures or composure if humans have no future. While the rest of the world wages perpetual anarchic war, Great Britain musters on, its government and industry still functioning. Refugees who have escaped violence on other continents stream into Britain illegally, where the authorities do their best to contain the immigrants in camps and shanty towns. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a middle-aged bureaucrat, is kidnapped on the streets of London by a revolutionary immigrant-rights group calling itself "The Fishes". Their leader is Theo's ex-wife Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore). who implores Theo to help her obtain transit papers for a young woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who desperately needs to reach the coast.<br /><br />Julianne Moore's strong presence is the only thing that "Children of Men" has to recommend it. We don't see enough of her, and the rest of the film is completely forgettable. Too dull to be an action movie and too shallow to be anything else, "Children of Men" spends most of its energy wallowing in bleak, bluish, squalor. The production design draws attention to itself in every frame without ever managing to captivate. Squalor seems to be the principal theme. "Children of Men" is a chase movie, in which the characters are running away from one thing and toward another. That's fine for an action movie, but the action here consists simply of running or driving away from gunfire. The characters are woefully underwritten and the story simplistic. Oddly, "Children of Men" expresses its agenda in the background. Literally. The mistreatment of immigrants in the background of so many scenes conveys what are presumably director Alfonso Cuaron's views on immigration and open borders.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): Bonus features include deleted  scenes and 6 featurettes. "The Possibility of Hope" (26 min) are various doomsday predictions by social philosophers of the far left persuasion. In "Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek" (6 min), social critic Zizek talks about what he sees as the true focus of the film, that being social oppression in capitalist systems. "Under Attack" ( 7 min) discusses the film's very long takes, with analysis of the opening sequence and  the car action sequence. "Theo & Julian" (5 min) discusses the characters. "Futuristic Design" (8 min) talks with set designer Jennifer Williams and production designer Jim Clay about creating the disintegrating society. "Visual Effects: Creating the Baby" (3 min) shows us how the baby delivery scene was created, including animating the baby. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French.

Bleakness so pervades every corner of this world that the light of hope cannot help but be extinguished.<br /><br />Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is drawn into the web of rebel group who have an important task for him.  He is told by his ex-lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), that he must accompany a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England and deliver her to a sanctuary run by "The Human Project."  What makes Kee so special is that she is pregnant - a miracle in a world where the female population has become sterile.  Yet, Theo's task is far from easy as government factions and a rogue element within the rebel group want Kee for their own purposes.<br /><br />"Children of Men" does have its share of positives.  It does not shy away from addressing many hot-button issues regarding immigration, assisted-suicide, and totalitarianism.  Also, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is astonishing.  The future world he captures on film is frightening and is all the more disturbing because it could easily be seen as prophetic in light of the numerous troubles currently plaguing the real world.  Yet, the film overall is ultimately unsatisfying.  The story turns out to be uninvolving and even borders on the boring after the film's premise is established.  As it unfolds, "Children of Men" devolves into nothing more than a prolonged chase that tries to keep matters interesting by sneaking in some social commentary every now and then.  Cuar&oacute;n undoubtedly set out to make a film with higher aspirations but only succeed in making one with squandered potential written all over it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Flaws first:  They could have cast anyone in the role played by Julianne Moore and Michael Caine; there is no explanation for the pandemic of infertility or for the hatred of refugees and immigrants.<br /><br />What's worth watching:  the other actors give strong performances; the production design and camera work are stunning; the self-administered euthanasia pill called Quietus is a nice touch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Takes place at a future time when the only young child has just died.

And so I rented Black Sunday recently.<br /><br />And 30 years later, the film doesn't show its age very well. It's very rooted in the 70s. It is filled with more "movie moments" than genuine truths, though those moments are well-disguised.<br /><br />And that about sums up Children of Men, too. It's trying so hard to be Important. It's obviously a protest against the current war on terror and all the infighting it has generated. But it's based on a red herring--or a gimmick, to put it less charitably--and it's about as subtle as a boulder falling off a thousand foot cliff.<br /><br />Folks, the issue we'll be facing in the near future won't be wars stemming from underpopulation (why terrorists are at war on this is never really explained), it will be on *over*population. More specifically, overpopulation with dwindling natural resources, and electorates everywhere who have done nothing past lip service because they're busy stuffing their pockets with donations from those who control the existing natural resources. *That's* a topic I'd like to see a grim movie like this tackle. But it just might make theater-goers a little uncomfortable as they climb into their Hemi pickups and SUVs afterwards.<br /><br />So instead we get this self-important movie that either the NY or LA Times (I forget which) says frightens us because we know, deep down, this could be our future. I'd say it's watchable and enjoyable because deep down we know this isn't our future. Is there really an infertility epidemic going on that I'm unaware of? There are grave problems threatening us today, and not one of them is in this film. There's not much in this film, really. It's a cleverly-disguised action thriller, Mad Max meets Brazil (both better movies, btw).<br /><br />In addition to the red herring of infertility (which is never explained, by the way...Nor do we have any reason to believe the child at the end will survive any better than anyone else, especially since she's a preemie, so the whole ending felt pointless to me), there's the infighting. Here the message is obvious, driven home by power tools, and in case you're out getting popcorn during this bit the director constantly has huge overbearing signs in all the locations with messages like "Report Suspicious Activity." Yes, I know there are really such signs nowadays. Yes, I get the indictment of what's going with British and American governments currently. Anyone who hasn't been lobotomized gets it. But after beating us up with it, the filmmakers don't develop it, doesn't make a point past the obvious one. By contrast, look at the odyssey the central character in Brazil undergoes, and how it affects both him and the people he loves and looks out for.<br /><br />What stymied me after watching Children of Men was that such a one-dimensional movie impressed all the high-brow critics. Then I went back and reread the 1970s reviews for Black Sunday and understood. So often films that seem so foretelling look naive a couple decades later. It's hard to predict the weight of your warning when you are so close to it--and this film is very emotionally-close to its subject. I make the prediction right here and now that this film will play very different on our consciousness 30 years from now, as environmental warnings from the 70s about an impending ice age do today.<br /><br />And this wasn't particularly groundbreaking filmmaking either. We have a standard stock of characters here: the reluctant hero who rediscovers his idealism after a great personal loss, the old flame who reunites him with his past ways (and geeze, Julianne Moore has one of the most heavy-handed, literally un-believable entrances in screen history here), the sacrificing fatherly figure (did anyone not know how that part was going to end?), the shining young woman who represents Hope, and so on.<br /><br />Children of Men is the latest in a line of Syrianna/Constant Gardener/Traffic-type films, with sprawling plots, timely messages, a documentary look, lots of violence, a backdrop of decaying society, large cast of characters, etc.  Except the other films had valid conceits.  That's the difference.<br /><br />The disc looks great, however, and there's plenty of bangy-boomy sound to give your subwoofers a workout. There are several small featurettes about the making of the film, including a nifty pieces demonstrating worldlessly how they created the CGI baby. No trailer, oddly. But after you, not believing my review, rent this anyway, go see Brazil, a far deeper film that has turned out to be eerily accurate about how things are shaping up (terrorist wars that drag on and bankrupt governments, governments that are pennywise and pound foolish, drone workers whose only escape is disembodied fantasy, trying to achieve immortality through plastic surgery, wrapped presents that are destroyed at checkpoints, consumerism run rampant and in the guise of patriotism or religious fervor). That's the difference between a pseudo-intellectual movie and a film that really makes you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Even though most people on Amazon don't seem to like honest reviews, here we go anyway:<br /><br />The idea behind the movie is cool: it's in the 2020s and the human race has lost the ability to reproduce; the last child was born 18 years ago. What they do with that idea, however, is another matter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot of CoM is strained and not satisfying. There's not enough back-story and there are too many loose ends that are not resolved/explained. The ending was a bit clich&eacute; as well. The pieces just don't really fit together as a story. In fact, the whole thing was VERY reminiscent of "28 Days"--plot, style, setting, ending, everything. (Maybe it was the same producer? I don't care enough to check.)<br /><br />If I would have spent $18 to see this in the theater (or to purchase the DVD), then I would have been seriously hacked-off. I guess it's worth the $3 rental though.<br /><br />Disappointing. Not recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Children of Men--the story of a future society struck barren, the chaos that ensues, and one man's struggle against all of that--feels like a high-speed, thrill-ride through a dark, shadowy wood. It is something like a fairy tale of the old school variety; once Clive Owen leaves the path and wanders into the trees, he falls from danger to danger.<br /><br />I am told that the movie is dystopic, in the tradition of Orwell, Huxley, Rand and Levin. I'm told that it has a strong political bent. I don't find either of these claims to be particularly true. While it is the case that the film is set in a future-gone-bad, the movie rarely stops long enough to catch its breath to develop any real philosophical or political messages, and that's what I find distinctive about the great dytopias of the 20th Century. They were trying to identify trends in society that would lead us all to ruin. Children of Men, on the other hand, introduces a out-of-left-field plot element to bring us low (making all women barren), and then just uses the setting as a dark backdrop for, what is, essentially an action flick.<br /><br />Oh, along the way, we might argue that the film is in favor of, say, immigration rights or the legalization of marijuana, or such, but these do not form any particular, actual indictment against the society presented, here. They are simply little political statements included, as one might incorporate a product placement by having a character drink a can of Coke. (The reason why the immigration rights thing doesn't constitute an 'indictment against the society' is because it isn't clear that the government is wrong in what it's doing: given the barrenness thing, and if the rest of the world has truly collapsed, as is suggested, then England's immigration policy might be actually fairly sensible policy in order to prevent complete anarchy. It is hardly Orwell's doublethink.)<br /><br />At the end of my longwinded rambling, what I'm trying to say is this: for all of its trappings, this is an action movie. It's a decent action movie, terribly gritty and high-impact, with a dark palette and lots of bleakness and paranoia.<br /><br />While I respect the film, I didn't walk away feeling particularly good about anything (the name of the boat did little to lift my spirits). I don't believe I would want to see it again, and I don't think I would recommend it to you.<br /><br />Three stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>it touched me and made me think of all the children we, as human race, take for granted, don't care for and abuse.<br /><br />children are miracle, and joy, and should be cared for lest they be taken away from us.<br /><br />sometimes i do think god would be better off wiping us out by another plague or, as in this movie, by worldwide sterility.<br /><br />if we are not able to care for children of the world, they should be taken away from us, and with them our hope, our future, our joy of life.<br /><br />excellent direction and cast notwithstanding, the power of this movie is in the fact that it made me think, it made me cry, and it made me care even more. it made me care to the point of being determined to do something for children of men we see in the news hungry, maimed, abandones, abused, sold, exploited.<br /><br />we can and should, as race, take care of our children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>This is at best, a good book turned into a very slow, tepid, and clueless film.

While not a blockbuster, by any standards, this unconventional film was all but abandoned by a studio that didn't know how to market it. Positioned for release during prime Oscar season, this is not a film that was backed as a potential nominee. However, as almost universal critical acceptance came rolling in--a smaller, but loyal, fan base discovered and embraced this movie. "Children of Men" ended up, therefore, with much acclaim and admiration, decent box office, a more widespread distribution, and 3 Academy Award nominations (Screenplay, Editing, and Cinematography).<br /><br />In an interesting twist on the apocalypse drama genre, "Children of Men" presents a world that is coming to an end with a whimper as opposed to a bang. For there is no cataclysmic explosion forcing humanity to confront it's own mortality. No, in this case, people have simply lost the ability to reproduce--and the youngest person alive is now approaching adulthood. Of course, over the ensuing years (the film is set in 2027) of this ongoing tragedy, there has been an expected societal breakdown. Now, the streets of London are ravaged by terrorism and extremist groups are battling to overturn the complacent, and possibly complicit, government. While this may seem like a broad and epic canvas, "Children of Men" covers many weighty issues within the relatively straightforward story of its protagonist, Clive Owen. Owen, an ex-activist who is now somewhat disconnected, is drawn back into a world that he wants no part of. The unlikeliest and most reluctant of heroes, Owen confronts his own ideology and apathy when an extremist group introduces him to a pregnant teen. Fearing that she will be exploited, used, or otherwise politically manipulated by the warring factions--he decides to deliver her to a utopian (and perhaps mythical) society whose only interest is in saving humanity. Getting her free from the controlling clutches that bind her and crossing a country plagued by insurrection, "Children of Men" becomes a harrowing and brutal action picture with violence that resembles much of what we see on TV news today.<br /><br />Owen has long been a favorite of mine. Having taken notice of him in "Croupier" (and if you haven't caught this great noir piece, please do), I have been quite impressed by his rise in mainstream films. He was so electrifying in "Closer" that I even forgave him for "Derailed." Here, he is the perfect antihero--and his evolution from a disinterested party to a rogue patriot is an indelible portrait of a man rediscovering a purpose and meaning in life. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Clare-Hope Ashitey (as the pregnant team) lead an able supporting cast. The documentary feel of the film's action pieces suit the material well, and the conflicts are well staged and all too believable.<br /><br />Now, there are many political debates to be started from "Children of Men" (none of which will I engage in here), but what I admired about the film's screenplay is how focused it is. Without being preachy or engaging in unnecessary "speechifying," this film plays as straight action. And while there is a "revelatory" moment near the end that almost goes too far (but is understandable within the context of the film), "Children of Men" allows you to draw your own conclusions. It just presents the story and leaves much of its interpretation up to the viewer. That, to me, is always a satisfying choice. Whether you view this film as action, sci-fi, political allegory, or a combination of all three--it's a worthwhile and entertaining film. KGHarris, 03/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I'd been waiting forever, it seems, to see this film.  True to trademark Cuar&oacute;n artistic flair and drama, it was gorgeous.  The entire premise of it was palpable and frighteningly prophetic.  Most telling was the scene in which mother and child finally emerge to consummate silence from warring factions, all of whom reverted instantly back to war as soon as she had passed.  Telling, that.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>After the triumphs of Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN and his two excellent movies for children, I guess I had high hopes for Cuaron's version of CHILDREN OF MEN, and to a certain extent he overcomes the basic torpidity of its source material, PD James' futuristic 1992 novel warning of the upcoming infertility epidemic.  Cuaron plays the concomitant anti-immigrant hysteria thick and it becomes pretty much the dominant theme of the film, together with the use of torture and unjust captivity.  This leaves a few holes in the plot--or rather in the mise en scene.  In the world we see, the UK has embarked on a "Britain for Britons" political campaign in which people from every other country in the world are systematically denigrated in order to better capture and eliminate them.  In such a world, would "Baby Diego" become a natural hero--an Argentine?  Wouldn't the media focus be on the youngest-born British baby?  And yet we find out that Baby Diego is revered in England same as Princess Diana, people bringing flowers and spreading them out at Hyde Park like they did for Diana, choking up at his baby pictures as they did for Harry and Wills.  Somewhere there's a disconnect, although Cuaron's restless, inventive cinematographer rarely lets his camera rest long enough for us to ponder such subtleties--yet I think they manage to stick in one's subsconscious, burrs under the saddle, that somehow interfere with our reception of the film's many strong points.<br /><br />And those include . . . Cuaron's fluid direction, so that in the middle of epic battle scenes his camera will flutter and follow the progress of a single piece of cloth torn from a dead man's shirt across the dirty Bexhill Camp brickyard, or the scene, which could have been so groan worthy, where Michael Caine explains to Kee and Miriam what happened between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore years ago (the entire exposition), while Owen listens in, his face a rugged mirror for his pain and his unwilling rise to activism.  For in some ways it's a terribly written scene, saved by some great staging and acting, in other ways, we feel like we're watching cinema being invented all over again.  I wish Pauline Kael were alive to describe the exhilaration of watching, not a film about Abu Ghraib, but a film that dares invoke the spectacle of Abu Ghraib directly while "pretending" to be about how wonderful children are and how the sight of a human baby can reduce hardened battle veterans to genuflecting and making the sign of the cross.<br /><br />The boat thing, the baby thing, the rays of "hope" that punctuate the second half of the movie don't ring true, they aren't earned in the same way as the totalizing action of anti-immigration forces in the first half.  But that's just me and others will see this very differently.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Starting off well, I was settling in for a nice, old-school dystopia movie.  Although having some nice characters outlined, the movie really never went anywhere and just got bogged down in recyling violence after awhile.  Most shockingly was the cop-out ending that couldn't even give a face to or a creative explanation for the "Human Project" or whatever it was called.  Quite disappointed they couldn't even put a mildly stimulating story behind the idea (well, they couldn't even give a reasonable explanation for the TOTAL sterility, that was lame too).</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>That's what some bonehead film critic actually said about this dud!  Are you kidding me???<br /><br />The basic story is intruiging enough - In the year 2027, a disease of infertility has overcome the planet and there hasn't been a child born in eighteen years; that is, until a young pregnant woman is discovered and she must be protected at all costs.<br /><br />Like I said, interesting premise, but we are offered no history or explanation as to how and why the world ended up like this in the first place.  This is absolutely infuriating when the entire film is based on this premise.  The apocolyptic state of Britian in the future and the way it is filmed is hardly original or impressive either.  One need only watch 12 MONKEYS, V FOR VENDETTA, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK or even A CLOCKWORK ORANGE to see where the original ideas came from.<br /><br />And finally, as for the critic's opinion that CHILDREN OF MEN is "Blade Runner for the 21st Century"...what exactly was this person smoking when they said that??  To even come close to the genius of BLADE RUNNER, there would have to be some special effects which depict a city of the future.  There are none.  In the future, Britian is nothing more that a huge pile of garbage!<br /><br />One positive note I can make about this film is its homage to classic rock!  A cover version of The Rolling Stones "Ruby Tuesday" and the original version of King Crimson's "In The Court Of The Crimson King" are played.  And in a scene between Clive Owen and Michael Caine, there is a background behind them which clearly pays tribute to the album cover of Pink Floyd's "Animals".</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>I agree with J. Sorsby's review.  This film was simply aweful, and I don't say that often about films, as I usually find something good to say about the films I watch, because I am very particular to the films I'm interested in.  Subject material (or genre) is usually the only criteria I care about.  If I'm interested in the subject material, I'll check out the film.  I generally like sci-fi and/or apocalyptic films, so I checked this out because this film was billed as the "new Millenium's 'Blade Runner'".  Hogwash.  The only thing that would make this in the vein of "Blade Runner" would be the noir dystopia post-apocalyptic setting.  If you've seen the TV series "Dark Angel", you get the gist of the environment this is set in.<br /><br />However, here's the deal with this film (and story).  Instead of Blade Runner's Replicants, this story deals with the infertilization of human kind and then the sudden miracle of a illegal immigrant being pregnant and then giving birth.  Of course the police state is very fascist, and the heroes need to smuggle this woman and her baby to some sort of human experimental organization.<br /><br />The film is only 110 minutes long and only 10-15 minutes of the film near the end is worth watching.  The action scene in the streets and buildings of a bombed out city block or two.  But that's not what really ticked me off about the film.  Believe it or not, it's one of the extras on the DVD.  The 27 minute featurette "The Possibility of Hope."  This featurette features about every prominent European leftist telling the viewer just how bad and evil individualism, globalization, capitalism, and ownership of personal property is.  One of the main speakers is a "Philosophy and Culture critic".  Now if that don't tell you something, nothing will.  Someone paid to come up with and say anything and everything about how bad humanity is.  It was a disgusting piece to put on a DVD as an extra.  Even though it supposedly tied into the film somewhat, the piece was totally one-sided.  That's propaganda folks...and I ain't buyin'.  Not one voice of dissent in the piece.  They basically blamed every ill that plagues mankind (and on the earth, ie. global warming)...on mankind.  I couldn't hardly watch it...in fact, I didn't.  I just let it play in the background as I did something else.  This kind of thing happened once before with a DVD release.  The Running Man-SE had a left-wing hit piece on it that dealt with something, I can't even remember what, but it featured Ramsey Clark, one of America's most infamous America-haters, who takes the side of America's enemies every chance he gets.<br /><br />I'm gonna say right now to all these DVD companies, if you're going to put a featurette or documentary on a DVD that has political referrences, you better make it "fair and balanced".  DVDs aren't the place for propaganda hit pieces.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>Hippies save the world from "evil fascists" (TM).

This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context.  Not my idea of good story telling!<br /><br /> I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!<br /><br />What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the moviegoing public!<br /><br />What messages is the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The world, except Great Britian, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course,  be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, "they just want respect!" (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an artform: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record!<br /><br />I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men.

Bombings, violence, and terrorism are common, apparently all due to the fact that several years prior, and this is the crucial idea, women stopped having babies.<br /><br />That's all just set-up though, as we haven't got to the plot of the movie, which is where Clive Owen's character, Theo comes in.  Theo is cynical about the world, and seems to be okay with just letting it go to the wayside, until his ex-wife meets up with him, and trusts in him a girl, more specifically a pregnant girl (which in a world without babies is pretty rare).

Society has collapsed in various parts of the world and, I'm about to use the dreaded "S" word again- somehow, London is the only place that soldiers on. Somehow, in the wake of all this infertility, a woman has miraculously gotten pregnant for unknown reasons. Thus ensues a ridiculously unrealistic story that almost never takes off.<br /><br />There, I've summed up the film, I can stop using the word "somehow" for a while.<br /><br />This film is well shot, I'll tell you that. It is interesting to look at, with its gloomy and depressing look that plays a character. That's really all I know I can say about this film that isn't negative. This film is just flat out awful. How it manages to get all these rave reviews baffles me. It's even in the IMDb Top 250, FFS. There's a good amount of cameos from good actors, yet they get killed off 5 minutes into their screentime to save money. There are tonnes of unrealistic coincidences that happen. I know it's a science fiction movie, but gimme a break.<br /><br />Like I said the movie is visually pretty, and makes good use of the blue hue (so if you put on a pair of 3D glasses and close your left eye, no you won't get anything). It's hard to believe people praise this pretentious pap.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I found Children of Men to be slow-moving, predictable, overtly political, and unoriginal to the point that I turned it off.<br /><br />And you can see by the way the army of leftist fanatics are spamming the negative reviews that this is a very political movie. You are warned.<br /><br />I don't care for Bush, but I dislike propaganda more.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>and i don't know why people, critics or viewers, would give this movie a such high praise. through out the whole movie, so many old cliched scenes appeared in other futuristic movies, blade runner, the fugitive, the witness...and lot of others have sneakily churned and mixed into this clueless movie. in 2037, people are still driving 30 years ago old car, the weaponries used to fight each other are still the same. the only difference in 2037's england, the rebels are mainly naturalized or illegal arabic muslins? human beings lose the ability of fertility and one black young woman got pregnant and it's a miracle and the only hope of human beings and civilization? why england and all the other countries fall into chaos, why? just because nobody can have kids anymore? what a ridiculous scenario is this? why almost all the futuristic movies only painted the future so hopeless and so dark? the guy's ex-wife is an activist, a rebel, but for what? against what? how the h..l that black woman got pregnant? why a group of the rebels at first want to save her and later want to kill her? what is the purpose of michael cain's hippy role? owen escorts the pregnant woman running away from....?<br />then hit by a bullet in the last escape scene, dies in the small boat, then a ship named 'tomorrow' appears in the fog...well, symbolize the human civilization still has hope, just by one kid? does it mean only this black young woman could conceive and she would produce more babies? why 99.9999999...% women lost the ability of pregnancy? does it mean that all the men cannot produce sperms anymore? or all the women cannot produce eggs anymore, they lose the periods, the menstrocycle pregnancy would totally lose around 2037? what caused it? or is it possible that only all the women except one have lost their fertilities but all the men still got their sperms produced normally? or all the men and women have both lost their abilities to produce their next generations? if just one woman and a man could bear child, where's that man? because without that man, that woman could only have one child, either male or female, she or he still cannot produce off-springs. but if that man could be found and could keep that woman pregnant many times, their children then had to commit incest to produce the next generation. if all the other women lost their pregnancy ability and only that woman still has the fertility ability, and all the men still have the ability to produce sperms, they could make and keep this woman continue to pregnant, there still got the incest problem ahead in the future. but if you believe we were all came from adam and eve, then we have to accept the fact that we are all the product of a long history of incest. can you accept such fact?<br />the other logic question i'd like to ask the screenwriters and the director is this: if all the men and women lost their abilities to have kids, they definitely would have lost their hope and would have definitely lost the urge to fight, because why people fight? why people become so selfish and so greedy? because they would like to and have to accumulate more money, more belongings for their next generation, the more, the better. if without children, without their offsprings, what's the purpose of doing anything? becasue their lives would be the last existences on earth, there would be no sense of trying to do anything anymore albeit fighting against each other or one another, it would be totally senseless and meaningless.<br />this is such a stupid movie based on an absolutely illogic premise and scenario. to think how great, how meaningful this movie is would just prove that the way of your think is illogic and senseless.<br />as to this movie itself, you better think about it again, there's nothing new but cliched scene after scene, chasing, fighting, escaping, riot, bombing, bloody gory...so just tell me what else is new? eh...well, you see, the only hope of the human beings is saved by a group of more sensible and generous arabic muslin immigrants. other than this, there's nothing worth mentioning here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I don't think I've ever seen a movie work so great and yet be so mismanaged and marketed. With movies that become unlikely successes like the Blair Witch Project or Big Fat Greek Wedding then you see the error of how Children of Men was marketed, it feels criminal. Alfonso Cuaron's follow-up to the well-praised (even though I wasn't that over-ecstatic about it) Y Tu Mama Tambien is just an all around well-crafted film and a chilling idea about where the world could be headed.<br /><br />Set in 2027, women around the world inexplicably have become infertile and unable to bear children. To make matters worse, the youngest person in the world was killed when he refused to sign autographs. Main character and former activist Theo knows its a horrible world but he's in a kind of "oh well" state of mind. His ex Julian, who is still being an anti-government activist, comes to him with a favor: safeguard a woman named Kee. Special thing is she's 8 months pregnant and in this world, she would make a perfect bargaining tool and political stronghold so Theo has to escort Kee to the "Human Project" which will help her and the baby.<br /><br />What the film does right in presenting the future is it doesn't take the Blade Runner approach and just simply go nuts with technology. There's been some advances but there's also been some regression and England has been reduced to a graffiti-covered hellzone and in one nice on-going joke, Theo keeps trading old shoes and clothes for other ones because he has to rather than just walk into a shoe store and get a new pair. And the notion that the entire female population becomes infertile seems almost sci-fi but then you go "well, if that and that happens, you never know...".<br /><br />While it's primarily a drama, it's arguably got 2 of the best action scenes of the year and strangely, they're all in the same movie and all done in one take. One (which had to be supported with a big camera rig) takes place in a car while another has us follow Theo through the streets as everything is getting shot at left and right. What makes these work is not only do they work production-wise when you think about it (6-8 minutes at most with one mistake making you redo 8 minutes over again), but dramatically they work as well and they're not just cool camera trickeries just for the sake of showing off.<br /><br />Then of course there's the acting and our anchor is Clive Owen. To be honest, he was kind of bland in Sin City (probably because the voiceover was that way) but here he really shines, playing a troubled man and one who isn't some action-hero all of a sudden. He makes mistakes and his accomplishments are that much better. Julianne Moore plays a pivotal-but-small role as Julian while Michael Caine plays Theo's friend Jasper. He always works in every film he does but giving him an almost hippie quality doesn't gel as much. His "pull my finger" routine and weed smoking seems slightly out of place.<br /><br />While not being graced with a good cover and having some light features (a documentary on the state of the world is insightful but featurettes looking into the making-of as a whole would've given more depth would've worked) it's still a wondrous film people should definately check out.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>CHILDREN OF MEN is a deep, dark, dreary, and dynamic film that offers the possibility of hope in a dystopian future.  It is a moving and thought-provoking film, full of social commentary and could very well be Alfonso Cuaron's best movie, yet.<br /><br />The movie takes place in Britain in the year 2027.  The film opens with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) purchasing coffee at a local shop as the television broadcasts the death of the world's youngest person: an 18-year-old boy named Baby Diego (Jaun Gabriel Yacuzzi).  For eighteen years women have been unable to bear any children.  The government sponsors all sorts of activities to promote sex and promiscuity, but it has been to no avail.  As Theo leaves the coffee shop and walks down the trash-filled streets, a bomb goes off destroying the very shop Theo had just left moments before.<br /><br />Needing a break Theo takes the day off work and takes the train to visit his friend Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), passing caged illegal immigrants along the way.  Jasper was an award-winning political cartoonist married to an award-winning journalist.  However, when the chaos began his wife was captured by the government and returned as a vegetable.  Jasper cheers Theo up and offers him a perspective about the whole thing.  The next day things seem "normal" but as Theo is on is way to work he is kidnapped by the terrorist group FISH.  He soon learns that the group is being led by his wife, Julian (Julianne Moore).  The group wants to transport a young refugee to the coast so she can be picked up by a ship.  The girl, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), needs papers and Theo has connections.  However, Theo is also one of the only people that Julian trusts left in the world.  Theo is able to get the papers, but he has to escort Kee.  Along the way the group is attacked and has to take refuge.  Theo learns that Kee is pregnant and that Julian had very serious reasons for only trusting Theo.  Knowing that the hope of the world lies with Kee he sets out to escort her to the coast where she can meet the Human Project, a secret organization that has supposedly a safe haven and is working on a cure for the human infertility problem.<br /><br />The acting of CHILDREN OF MEN is top-notch.  I've only seen a handful of film Clive Owen has acted in and I've enjoyed them all.  He is a classy actor and one whose star will continue to rise.  I really like Julianne Moore and even though she isn't on screen for a very long time, her presence lights up every scene she is in.  Michael Caine is another actor who makes every film he's in just better by being in it and he works his magic in CHILDREN OF MEN (it's also kind of funny seeing Caine make fart jokes and rambling about weed).  Claire-Hope Ashitey is virtually a newcomer to the bigscreen and in her first major role she shines brightly.  The rest of the cast of CHILDREN OF MEN is multi-national and each actor and actress is excellent in their roles.  No one, not even the extras, seem out of place or abnormal.<br /><br />The cinematography in CHILDREN OF MEN is amazing.  Cuaron does some amazing things with the camera.  There are two long, one-camera shots that particular stick out to me:  the car scene was done all in one-long take with one camera and the scene where Theo is escorting Kee out of a building where the terrorists are fighting the government forces was all done in one camera in one take.  These are incredibly long shots (the car scene is almost five minutes in length) and to have them turn out so effectively with so much going on is almost unheard of.  It requires incredible direction and foresight to do such shots, let alone do them effectively.<br /><br />CHILDREN OF MEN is an incredibly dark film.  It's probably too dark and bleak for some people to deal with.  There is a lot of violence, but much of it occurs off screen; people are shot but we only see them falling down from a distance or they are killed off screen with only a spot of blood speckling the camera lens to illustrate what has happened.  The movie is also an incredibly deep social commentary.  Racism, illegal immigration, terrorism, national security, sanitation policies, sex education, euthanasia, media manipulation, and the importance of life are all issues that the film deals with.  Some might be mistaken to believe that the film is anti-government and pro-terrorists (or insurgents).  This isn't the case because the film clearly shows that neither the government nor the terrorists are completely right or wrong; they are fighting a circular war that won't end until one is able to wipe out the other.<br /><br />Despite this bleak view of the humanity and the future, CHILDREN OF MEN is a movie full of hope.  The world can be an incredible dark and dreary place, but hope remains and that changes everything, something I have been reminded of several times lately.  There are some who will not like the film's ending because it doesn't seem to bring closure.  However, in the mood and tone of the film it fits and it doesn't end in despair, but in hope.<br /><br />I found CHILDREN OF MEN to be an incredibly moving picture.  At times it was almost brutal to watch.  Throughout it was a fascinating and riveting piece of cinema.  There are several scenes that have stuck in my mind and I find myself dwelling on during the day.  For instance, in a short, but important scene in the film Theo is having lunch with his cousin and is trying to convince him to get him the papers he needs to escort the girl to the coast.  Sitting at the table is his cousin's son.  The boy is in his mid-twenties and though physically he might be a man, he is really a boy.  He sits at the table eating with one hand while using the other to play with an interactive electronic device attached to his fingers and head.  The boy is so absorbed in what he is doing that he has no idea what is occurring around him, he doesn't even realize that he is eating and his father has to yell at him to get him to put his fork down and take his pill.  The scene is ironic because Theo's cousin has been doing everything he can to save and restore the world's great pieces of art and culture.  Theo asks him why he does it when in thirty years none of it will matter and he replies that it doesn't matter because he doesn't think about that.  There is so much in that scene that can be taken away; so much to think about.  Theo's cousin might not think about the future, but we need to.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Unrestricted levels of violence and brutality, realistically portraying a society in a downward spiral.  It's very intense and thought-provoking.<br />*Camera style, even though is free-handed, is still very smooth and slick (meaning that it doesn't shake around too much).<br />*Many action scenes use very long cuts, showing off the actors' and director's mastery in timing, acting, and details.  The logistics of these scenes are complex, so it is very impressive.<br />*The film's color greatly adds to the dismal atmosphere.<br />*Strong ethnic influences literally teleport the viewer into a unique setting.  To me, the British refugee camp resembles the streets of Iraq (thus making it relevant to today's current events).<br />*Some scenes stick out vividly in my head (in particular, the ending scene where everybody stops fighting and bows down to the newborn baby...).<br />*What few special effects the film has are very effective.  I couldn't even tell that it had any.<br />*The characters are fairly well developed.  Their deaths are quite tragic.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br />*Good production design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some people may find the violence and brutality a bit much.  Overall, it is a bleak film.<br />*They never did explain how people became infertile (then again, I think it's a minor point).<br />*Didn't really want certain characters to die...<br />*Not sure how close it is to the original novel.<br /><br />This is one of the only few movies that makes me feel depressed (second only to "The Passion").  Aside from the intense brutal violence, the film serves as a shadowy mirror to modern-day society.  It effectively portrays rampant terrorism, human cruelty, and injustices of worldly powers.  The filming of it is excellent in its own right, with slick camera work and very complex action scenes.  But it is not like a typical sci-fi blockbuster; it's focus is more on artistery, thought-provoking ideas, and emotional impact.  I think it is very effective, and is a definate eye-opener into what the future could possibly be if things continue to go as they are.<br /><br />DVD includes some fascinating featurettes; one that analyzes modern-day society, and one that shows the making of the film.  And then there's the trailer.  Pretty good deal.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Though there are an awful lot of political sentiments thrown in the movie that you may or may not agree with, as a movie, this is a well made film.  While I do not think this is the best science fiction movie I have ever seen, at least it is written intelligently and rises above the generic action movies that usually dominate the field.  I wish Moore had more of a part in the film.  I think she is an incredible actress and her appearance is way too brief.  A lot of the how's and why's are left untold in this film.  Some find that interesting, many others want everything spelled out for them.  I would say this movie is for people who enjoy reading and enjoy something deeper than "Total Recall".</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Director Alfonso Cuaron has two remarkable films on the "Children of Men" DVD -- the dystopian feature and a startling half-hour documentary that explores the macro-global issues raised by the movie.<br /><br />"The Possibility of Hope" doesn't have much hope in it. Cuaron rounds up a half dozen philosophers and futurists who see overpopulation, economic repression and global warming sending the planet into a new dark age. These guys make Al Gore look like a gushing optimist. Future editions of "An Inconvenient Truth" should have this as a kicker in case anyone is cheered up by the Melissa Etheridge closing number.<br /><br />"It's not a matter of people surviving," says scientist and philosopher James Lovelock. "It's a matter of civilization surviving. ... It can easily degenerate into a dark age again. It's quite possible that will happen."<br /><br />The apocalyptic future always eluded filmmakers, but many tried, including the mighty Kubrick ("A Clockwork Orange"). None of the films felt truly possible, probably because the filmmakers overworked their visions. "Children of Men" succeeded by Curan's insistence that all scenes from his 2027 "show me the reference in real life." The movie -- about a world in which no babies are born -- easily holds up against all Oscar contenders for best picture. Clive Owens, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine star.<br /><br />"Children of Men" looks fine on Universal's single-disc release, the grit, grain and grays of the film all intact. The 1.85 widescreen images are enhanced for 16x9 monitors. (There is also a full-screen version.) The front-centered audio is Dolby 5.1 only.<br /><br />Other extras include an analysis of the film by philosopher Slavoj Zizek, who curiously calls it a remake of "Y Tu Mama Tambien"; a trio of deleted scenes, including one in which Clive Owen and Danny Huston wander nonchalantly amongst the great artworks of the lost civilization; a discussion of Curan's technique of long, "incredibly choreographed takes"; and a special effects study of making the film's miracle baby.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>A horrid futurist nightmare that couldn't be better described by the title of the famous rock song from Black Sabbath's album, "Master of reality."<br /><br />If "Soylent Green" in the early seventies, became a cult movie due its powerful bitterness around the utopist solution of food for an overpopulated world, this somber film deals with an interesting and even sharp proposal; the question of infertility in the mankind, and the way the children are considered as a transcendental fact.<br /><br />The whole social body is mentally messy. All the world has collapsed, except Great Britain in which the conditions of life are far beyond the poorest nation of the Third World. Misery, hunger, hungry, fear, desolation, hopeless conform an apocalyptic frame in which the violence appears as the final result of antagonist forces. Terrorist cells, occupation forces, and the presence of two curious antiheros: an old, caustic and outlaw man, wonderfully featured by an unrecognizable Michael Caine and a man who works for a department who once was engaged with a woman who has become a terrorist leader Julianne Moore in a very brief but powerful performance with the only mission: to preserve by all means a young mother to come.<br /><br />An acidic gaze respect the post industrial future, that it may sin of being extremely awesome but pretty original in what concerns the exposed issues of an unthinkable reality.<br /><br />.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I thought this film looked interesting from the trailers, and it was something to behold when I saw it today. Even the critics can't praise this movie enough.<br /><br />The film is very bleak and actually quite violent at times. Clive Owen and Michael Caine are both fantastic here, as are the many weird characters we meet along the way. The 10 minute action scene towards the end is like something out of Saving Private Ryan, and it is all shot in one take. There is no editing during the action scene as the camera follows Clive Owen around. How did they coordinate all the explosions and extras without saying cut? Freaking amazing! I still can't wait until the highly reviewed Pan's Labyrinth comes to my town, but for now Children of Men reigns supreme.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>When going to see Children of Men, I had little to low opinion upon it.  The trailers did not at all do this justice, painting it instead as some sort of typical dystopian sci-fi action thriller with lots of chase scenes and explosions.<br /><br />What I got instead was not only brilliantly acted, but incredibly gritty and realistic, and save for the light leap of faith required in believing that all people would become infertile within 20 years, completely realistic.<br /><br />Clive Owen (Theo) is absolutely perfect as the 40-something man who sneaks scotch into his coffee and carries it around all day, uses Baby Diego's death (youngest person on earth, 18) as an excuse to skip work and hang out with his buddy Jasper (Michael Caine), and has virtually nothing left to live for after his daughter's death and his divorce, who gradually becomes a man with a purpose to get Kee (the pregnant girl) to Africa, where the Human Project awaits her.<br /><br />The scenes which show the dystopian future are elegantly done to show just how far society has fallen as infertility rose among the world, without lingering too much or being overly brutal on the senses.  Seeing rioters hurl stones at a moving train Theo is in, or a bomb go off in a London coffee shop is so unthinkable in this day and age and yet shot so realistically it's almost as if watching it through a documentary camera.<br /><br />It's interesting and somewhat disturbing to see the way immigrants to Britain are treated, strikingly similar to the way of Jews in Nazi Germany, and yet with the same tone and anti-immigrant sentiment in the country as modern-day United States, as when Theo and the others sneak into a refugee camp, Kee's friend is brutalized by the British guards for not following orders fast enough, and taken outside with a burlap sack put over her head.<br /><br />The last scene in the movie, the battle sequence in an immigrant camp building, shot all in one take, is the most powerful scene of the whole movie, and I had tears in my eyes watching it, just seeing the reactions of the people on screen, and the emotional power and brilliance of the scene.  The cinematrography, the sound, the picture, the acting, everything was just perfect.<br /><br />All in all, Children of Men was in my opinion the best movie of all in 2006, and it's a shame it didn't win any awards of importance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Children of Men (sci-fi, drama)<br />Directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n<br />Starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Chiwetel Ejiofor<br /><br />Universal Studios | 2006 | 110 min | Rated R | Released May 26, 2009<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />German: DTS 5.1<br />Italian: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Mandarin (Traditional), Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />If you have ever seen The Road, or 28 Days Later, you'll recognize the look of Children of Men. It's set in the future in a world that looks familiar, but it's dirtier, grittier and less safe than the world you're used to seeing.<br /><br />The movie is set in Britain in 2027 and Theo Faron (Owen) learns through a newscast that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18. Doesn't that sound odd? Have you ever heard a report that sounds anything like that? It immediately alerts us to the fact that something is wrong. We find out that all humans are infertile and no child has been produced for more than 18 years.<br /><br />If people are no longer born, how long would it take for the world's existing population to die? What would happen to those already here, knowing that they will be among the last of their species?<br /><br />Theo visits his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), who hides away in a house in the woods. Illegal immigrants are everywhere and government messages urge people to report them. Theo is abducted early in the story by Julian (Moore) who is his former lover. Movement within the country is restricted and she wants Theo to obtain transfer papers so that her group can take a young woman, Kee, to the coast and safety.<br /><br />It's a brutal existence and Theo eventually finds himself as Kee's only hope. She's one of the most important people on the planet, but only a small group of people know why. Theo guards her to the best of his ability and attempts to get her to safety using a contact of Jasper's to help them. He accepts help whenever it's offered.<br /><br />Some of the street scenes would be more at home in a war movie. It seems that the military regularly clashes with civilians and every group has an agenda. It's a crazy existence where law and order is virtually non-existent, and it would be frightening to experience. Do the people have any goals at all that don't involve killing and stealing what they can from others? The military prefers to shoot first and ask questions later.<br /><br />It impresses me that even though the world is a chaotic place and full of danger, the plot remains coherent. The audience is never in doubt about Theo's intentions; just his ability to succeed. The resolution won't make everyone happy. It's not clear what will happen in the future. This is a snapshot showing one key event in a seemingly hopeless situation. When it's all over, we are left with hope, and that's enough.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Although the setting is grimy, the presentation is clean and detailed. The desolate world is often presented in shades of gray, but that's no fault of the transfer. Blacks are clearly defined and colors are accurate. Scenes shot in the forest look vivid and full of detail. I didn't detect any noise or print damage and the overall look is very pleasing.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />There aren't many scenes in which the action dominates, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix rises to the occasion when it has to. An early explosion is startling, while the sound of bullets zipping past in the final act is effective. The mix is a little front-heavy, but everything works and it sounds effective. There are quite a few songs included in the mix and that's where the presentation really shines.<br /><br />Special Features 3/5<br /><br />The additional features all appear in standard definition:<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (2:22) - Three additional scenes that add very little to the story.<br /><br />The Possibility of Hope (27:16) - Philosophers talking about the future and what will happen if we pursue our present course.<br /><br />Children of Men Comments by Slavoj Zizek (5:44) - Explaining the background scenes and themes in greater depth.<br /><br />Under Attack (7:36) - Director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n and some of the cast and crew talk about how one of the best action scenes was shot using a single take.<br /><br />Theo & Julian (4:40) - Owen and Moore talk about their characters. Julian was the reason Theo got involved and we learn how he's considered an ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />Futuristic Design (8:38) - Describing the differences between the decay of existing infrastructure and new technology such as car styles.<br /><br />Visual Effects: Creating the Baby (3:06) - Deconstructing a scene to show how special effects are used.<br /><br />U Control<br /><br />BD-Live<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directed arguably the best of the Harry Potter movies, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and he's created a thought-provoking movie. One of the things that struck me is the level of detail involved in predicting the future world without children. His world is believable and I found myself nodding at some of the details. It's a brutal place to visit, but a rewarding experience. The Blu-ray presentation is very good and fans of the movie or Clive Owen shouldn't hesitate to pick it up.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>CHILDREN OF MEN (director Alfonso Cuaron, 2006) is one of my favorite films, and shows just how far we've come thanks to films like it. It wasn't that long ago I saw this, was stunned by its originality and celebration of life. I've wanted to review this for so long, but it vanished so quickly, I only saw it once, thus I could never recall its name or who was in it!<br /><br />Thelonious "Theo" Faron (Clive Owen) is a sort of alcoholic numbskull suffering from shattered dreams and 20 years of lonely misery. It is circa 2028, very clever because the terrible blight on humanity began in 2008. Theo, who lost a daughter that he had with fellow radical activist Julian (Julianne Moore), is interested only in drinking.<br /><br />Suddenly, Julian contacts him. She wants him to escort someone out of England (presumably - it's a murky storyline and that is not good). Before he can agree or disagree, he's up to his neck in the transportation of a young Ghanaian immigrant named Kee (the beautiful Clare-Hope Ashitey) who is I believe 18 years old.<br /><br />This is a future without children, a totalitarian, mean, rotten future that deserves to die off - Britain's borders have been closed nearly a decade, and immigrants get the NAZI treatment. The women all suddenly became barren - and no one knows why. Kee is one of the last teenagers on earth AND an illegal immigrant. Everyone else is, well, over-the-hill and either British or illegal.<br /><br />I know the feeling, and can commiserate with the illegal immigrants.<br /><br />Our sweet young Ghanaian, Kee, is pregnant. This is not only a miracle, it is unbelievable to the characters. (Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is, and for a brief, tense moment, she teases him and says there was no father. Hilarious!)<br /><br />There is an important new group of radicals called the "Fishes" - they ought to have been called the "Fish" because an individual is called a "Fish". Native-born British women are called "Cod". Headed by the semi-villainous Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Fishes are fighting the totalitarian government. What they really want is Kee's baby to use almost as a weapon.<br /><br />The rest I will not spoil. This film is stunning not only for its socio-philosophical depth; the effects are a marvel no other director has matched. Sine I paid no attention to credits, I assume Cuaron shot much of this as well as directing. It is the best, most mind-boggling cinematography I've seen. Cuaron weaves, ducks and runs with the camera like an on-the-spot disaster report, but he does it so naturally, so smoothly, that there isn't even any vertigo. Your eyes will follow this naturally.<br /><br />My HUGE pet peeve with all modern film is the damnable 'wobbly-camera' syndrome. Cuar&oacute;n has something to teach the world about using this technique CORRECTLY. Where he picked it up, I have no idea - all I know is that Cuaron is jockeying to become one of our greatest directors. I think we can take that to the bank.<br /><br />The cast of this film is a delight: Michael Caine does a cameo as Theo's ancient hippie friend Jasper (I love the running joke about Jasper's latest invention: "Strawberry Cough" marijuana) -  note this was a kind of comeback for Caine. The gorgeous Charlie Hunnam is Patric, one of the Fishes and a nasty one at that. Pam Ferris is Miriam, a New Age nun who travels with Theo and Kee, and this is a very interesting character I quite loved.<br /><br />Danny Huston as (the instrumental cameo) Nigel, Jacek Koman as Tomasz, and the great Peter Mullan as Syd round out this terrific cast. Now ... don't go looking for a whole lot of background explanation or in-depth dialogue. The clues as to what is occurring are all around you, very little referred to in dialogue which I think is brilliant - but it can be a headache since nothing is clearly explained.<br /><br />Usually with this in-the-near-future type story, we want to know how that future descends from our time. Rarely do we get it. At least here, Cuaron ahs given us a one-line explanation: women are barren and no one knows why. The effects of that are catastrophic, as you will see abundantly in this brilliant and sadly forgotten film.<br /><br />Aside from some action-violence (should be studied in film school) and if you can somehow tune out the occasional swearing, this is a great family film (definitely not for the very young, teens on up, I think). It's so gorgeous and thought-provoking that you have to have the violence ... otherwise, how can the lesson be taught?<br /><br />One last thing: while the religious people (there are few) are either New Wave or Catholic, there is no special significance to the prayer/greeting "Shanti, Shanti, Shanti". "Shanti" is Sanskrit/Hindu for "peace", so it is like saying "Shalom". The New Wave folk pray the ancient Hindu Shanti prayer (for so it is) - and that's all. Make of that what you will. Interestingly, the Catholics cross themselves.<br /><br />Get this and enjoy it over and over - it is a classic you'll regret not buying.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>In 2027 the Earth is in its final days. A pandemic infertility plague has wiped out any hope of a future generation of offspring. The world has responded by tearing itself to pieces w/ terrorism, war, and a new world disorder. England is the only place left w/ somewhat of a functioning government, and it is a fascistic police state. There is no hope. Or is there? CHILDREN OF MEN is a story of mankind's hope in spite of utter hopelessness. Even in the face of certain extinction. Right in the midst of the murder, desolation, and complete anguish, a young woman carries the (tiny) possibility for man's salvation. As apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers go, CHILDREN is up there w/ 1984 and SOYLENT GREEN. Highly recommended...</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Alfonso Cuaron's bleak yet surprisingly moving vision of the future features brilliant performances and equally brilliant action sequences.  Children of Men, freely adapted from the novel by P.D. James, stars Clive Owen as Theo: a one-time activist that is coerced to transport the last fertile woman on the planet to safety; all the while outside forces attempt to use her for their own means, and the world as a whole seems to crumble around them.  Cuaron's filming techniques are what make Children of Men so good, as his vision puts the viewer right in the middle of the chaotic action sequences that follow.  Owen is great, while brief turns from Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Chiwetel Ejifor are small miracles as well, and the lacings of political and social commentary that abound, along with a hopeful light at the end of the tunnel, all combine to make Children of Men a memorable and spectacular film.  All in all, if you've missed out on Children of Men, you are doing yourself a great disservice, and you should definitely give the film a much deserved look.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Children of Men' is one of those rare `important' films, one everyone needs to see.  It's heartbreaking, eye opening and most of all heartwarming with its depictions of hope shining forth from the bitterness of the present.  In `Children of Men' we encounter a torn London, savaged and broken down with despair and hopelessness.  The world has collapsed in the few short years following the infertility epidemic and now, resting in the year 2027, all seems to be lost.  The film does a brilliant job of capturing the feeling of hopelessness and apathetic attitude that forms in the hearts of earths residents.<br /><br />There is no reason to care anymore because humans in general have no future.<br /><br />This is where we meet Theo Faron.  Theo's life is all but dead to him.  Clive Owen masterfully displays the utter desperation that plagues this mans soul.  We can read this across the crevasses of his face, the saddened expression in his eyes, the downward slant of his brow and then sulk in his step.  Even his words struggle to find themselves as he speaks to others in attempts at communication.  This is the first thing that I noticed about Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece.  Clive Owens performance beautifully compliments the ravaged setting he inhabits.<br /><br />Theo finds himself kidnapped and violently escorted to a secret meeting with his ex-wife Julian, the leader of a rebel activist group.  She is requesting his assistance in transporting a young woman, a refugee who has a secret, a very important secret.  He soon finds out what that secret is when he meets young Kee, a Fiji born woman who is, believe it or not, pregnant.  Thus begins a harrowing journey to transport Kee to meet up with `The Human Project', an organization willing to help her.  Theo meets much opposition along the way, some expected, some not, but the journey is worth any cost.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron was unfairly snubbed a directing nomination last year.  He brilliantly crafted this film so that the audience can take this journey alongside Theo and Kee, feeling every emotion and even stirring some new ones in the pit of our souls.  The film is expertly executed and completely absorbing to watch.  The sets are so real, so authentic, so engrossing that I could feel the concrete floor against my feet and breathe in the thick air.  The cinematography is orgasmic and it's an utter shame that it lost the much deserved Oscar.  As the camera swept through each scene I found myself inching closer to the screen to take it all in.  The sound editing, the visual effects, everything about this film is effortlessly maneuvered to linger in the minds of the audience.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is ultimately a film of hope and survival.  It wisely establishes a bleak reality before coming forth with glimmers of a better tomorrow (in fact the boat Kee is trying to reach is rightfully named `Tomorrow').  It cements itself in the hearts of the audience so much so that it draws on raw emotions.  There are moments that brought me to tears especially as the film comes to its climax.  Being a new parent I was moved deeply by this film, a film that proved what we all know, that children are our future, our only future and without them life is not worth living.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>The film opens, the youngest person on the planet was just killed.  He was 18.  The second youngest person is a woman only a few weeks older...and there have been no children since.<br /><br />Britain seems to be the one place that everyone wants to go and the UK Immigrations people have an illegal alien problem that'd put the TX border to shame.<br /><br />"Fishes" are a group of radicals who want every British immigrant to have equal rights.<br /><br />The one pawn in this game is a young Fiji woman who is pregnant.  Radicals are trying to sneak her out of the country onto a mythical ship called "Tomorrow" where human reproduction is being studied.<br /><br />The story's fast-paced and fascinating.  You really didn't dare get up to get a drink or lose attention or you'd miss an important detail. The acting was particularly good-Michael Caine as an aging hippie type was wonderful.<br /><br />I definitely need to read PD James' book so I can understand some of the concepts better.  In many ways, I wish I had seen this film in the theatre--yes, it's worth full price.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>There's little to be said that hasn't been included in the "Spotlight" reviews. I bought the DVD because of the universal acclaim, as well as the fact that I enjoy good sci-fi. Well, this isn't so much sci-fi as much as a warning (as is most sci-fi); it could be a great argument for pro-life, and the repercussions are well examined. Clive Owen is absolutely perfect, a man who knows his limits but is caught up in something that his own sensibilities can't fathom. He doesn't know what's happening around him, but he has a solid sense of right & wrong. To try to explain more would be redundant, since previous reviewers have nailed the power of the film. The art direction is amazing in its bleakness, and the stunning cinematography can't be equalled. I've thought of this film many times since I watched it, but it may take a few days before I watch it again. Some of the images are in my head forever. This film requires concentration. I wish I could've seen it on the big screen. The DVD extras are plentiful and insightful. An amazing film achievement. Bravo, Senor Cuaron.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>Clive Owen plays Theo, a man that has to help an illegal immigrant.  What he finds out is that this young woman is pregnant.  The first pregnancy in 18 years.  We don't find out exactly why women stopped being able to give birth but this movie does not explain a lot of things.  You would think it would go into what people are going through knowing that human life will not exist soon.  Well it doesn't show you that because you can imagine what people are going through with 18 years of no childbirth, and the women crying at the beginning of the movie because of their fascination of the youngest person in the world being dead explains enough.  Don't expect this futuristic world to have space ships and all kinds of imaginative new technology, expecting anything but grimness will only lead to dissapointment.<br /><br />The explosions were by far my favorite part of the movie.  Though set 20 years in the future, it is as good of a depiction you will ever get of guns and their devastating effects.  As commented before there are some parts where the director does not say cut after explosions go off.  Be prepared for some of the most amazing realistic action scenes you will ever see.<br /><br />Michael Caine was very funny in his limited role and his friend Sid is just as hilarious.  The whole cast was very good.  Don't go into this expecting it to be a great movie but it is quite good and may surprise you.</p></br></body></html>

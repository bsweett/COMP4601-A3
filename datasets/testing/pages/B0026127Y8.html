Granted, this is sensitive subject matter, something that you have been hearing about repeatedly in movies and television specials over the last couple of years.  This movie is about human trafficking--in other words, stealing young girls, rendering them helpless with drugs, and then selling them into prostitution to the highest bidder, usually in a foreign country.<br /><br />With that said, Bryan (Neeson) and former wife Lenore are divorced.  Lenore has remarried a rich businessman.  Bryan and Lenore's daughter Kim is now 17 and lives with Lenore.  Bryan sees Kim when he wants but Lenore is kind of icy toward him, still apparently blaming him for the years he wasn't there for mother and daughter.  As a now retired CIA field operative (apparently well thought of and quite proficient in his job), Bryan wants to get to know his little girl better now.  The movie begins as he reminisces about Kim's 5th birthday and subsequently takes a present to her 17th birthday party at the mansion.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Bryan helps a few of his CIA buddies with a side job as a bodyguard to a singer at a concert and befriends her when he saves her life.  You see Bryan's well choreographed protective moves as he puts down the offender and your confidence level in Bryan's abilities soar.  The singer offers to help Kim get a start singing (if she is as good as Bryan says).  Excited to tell Kim, Bryan is mentally slapped in the face when he finds that Kim wants to meet with him over lunch only to get his signed permission to go to Europe with her girlfriend.  Reluctantly, he agrees to sign and off she goes, with conditions to check in daily on the cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />No sooner does the plane land in Paris, than the girls are greeted by a 2-legged snake who is part of an Albanian trafficking ring.  Peter offers to share a taxi with them (to split the expense).  Finding out where they live, he is able to contact the thugs who show up to grab them.  Kim is talking to her father on the cell when she sees the bad guys grab her girlfriend from a window and it is a chilling moment when Bryan says "You will be taken" and to leave the cell phone on.  A few moments later, my heart sank as they grabbed Kim, screaming and thrashing and drug her from under the bed.  Bryan tells the kidnappers to turn her loose and he won't kill them.  Of course, the ego-driven, invincible bad guys tell him something similar to "good luck". Well, the Albanians just unleashed their worst nightmare! Bryan, with all his training and skills in tact, is quickly on a plane to Paris on a hell-bent mission to get Kim back, no-holds barred.<br /><br />This is a kick-butt movie, full of intense action, stunts, car-chases, and killing.  While I'm not normally big on watching people get killed, I have to admit, the bad guys and their crimes were so despicable that I did enjoy seeing them get taken out, one by one.  There is edge-of-your-seat action as Bryan hunts down the bad guys one by one and weaves his way through the network of filth to try to find his little girl.<br /><br />Although extremely unlikely that he would have ever found her, it was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Considering the subject matter, it was done fairly tastefully, too.<br />From what I remember, you did not actually see the sexual acts or the girls getting drugged.  A lot of people do get shot and someone does get tortured to find out needed information.<br /><br />Quite possibly, more of our teenagers need to be sensitized to the facts that these things do happen.  Although no one should live in fear, young women do need to exercise sufficient caution about where they go and who they go with. I hope this film will both entertain and educate our young people.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>Last year we had RAMBO and this year we have TAKEN.  In both cases some older guys show today's younger action heroes how it is supposed to be done.<br /><br />Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.<br /><br />But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.<br /><br />There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.<br /><br />Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with.  Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think "everything will be OK, people are inherently good".<br /><br />With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).<br /><br />With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).<br /><br />In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.<br /><br />I wonder how many viewers of these movies get the underlying message and how many only see these as tough guy action films ?</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, "Taken" is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.<br /><br />"Taken" plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.<br /><br />What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.<br /><br />It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.<br /><br />The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.<br /><br />The moral of "Taken" is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.<br /><br />Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. "Taken" pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious "No Country for Old Men" a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.<br /><br />The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Taken" is great! This is how the story goes: Former government operative Bryan Mills begins the longest 96-hours of his life--and the hunt for the fearsome organization that has taken his daughter Kim. Mills had only recently given up his government career as what he calls a 'preventer' to be near Kim, who lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore and her new husband. To make ends meet, Bryan joins some former colleagues for special security details (like guarding a pop diva), but most of his time and energy are spent re-connecting with Kim. Bryan's familial goal is nearly derailed when Kim requests his permission to spend time in Paris with a friend. All too aware of the dangers that could lie ahead for Kim in a foreign land, Bryan says no, but Kim's disappointment leads him to very reluctantly relent. Bryan's worst fears are realized when Kim and her friend Amanda are suddenly abducted--in broad daylight--from the Paris apartment at which they've just arrived. Moments before Kim is dragged away by the as yet unseen and unknown assailants, she manages to phone Bryan, who begins to expertly piece together clues that will take him to the darkness of Paris' underworld, and to the City of Lights' plushest mansions. He will face nightmares worse than anything he experienced in black ops--and let nothing and no one stop him from saving his daughter.<br /><br />The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan) is great! The directing by Pierre Morel (who also directed "District 13" (2004) & the upcoming "From Paris With Love" (2009) is great! The story and screenplay by Luc Besson (who also produced) (who also produced the upcoming "From Paris With Love") & Robert Mark Kamen (both who also wrote the stories and screenplays to "The Transporter 1, 2, & 3" (2002, 2005, & 2008), also co-wrote the screenplay to "The Fifth Element" (1997, with Besson, who also directed), also co-wrote the screenplay to "Kiss Of The Dragon" (2001, with Besson, who also produced) is great!<br /><br />The music by Nathaniel Mechaly is great! The cinematography by Michel Abramowicz (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming "From Paris With Love") is great! The film editing by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Thoraval (who also did the film editing to "District 13", "Angel-A" (2005, which Besson also wrote, produced, and directed), & the upcoming "From Paris With Love") is great! The casting by Ferne Cassel (who also did the casting to "Monster" (2003) & Nathalie Cheron (who also did the casting to "The Transporter") is great! The production design by Hugues Tissandier (who also did the production design to "The Messenger: The Story Of Joan Of Arc" (1999, which Besson also directed, co-wrote the screenplay, and co-produced), "The Transporter", "District 13", "Arthur And The Invisibles" (2007, which Besson directed co-wrote the screenplay, and produced), "District 13 - Ultimatum" (2009, which Besson also produced and wrote the screenplay), & the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" (2009) & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War" (2010, both which Besson directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplays) is great! The art direction by Gilles Boillot (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War" (both which Besson directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplays) & Nanci Roberts is great! The costume design by Olivier B&eacute;riot (who also did the costume design to "Unleashed" (2005, which Besson also produced and wrote), "Arthur And The Invisibles", the upcoming "Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard" & "Arthur And The Two Worlds War", & "The Transporter 3") is great!<br /><br />This is an great action-thriller that keeps you thinking and your heart racing. This is an excellent role for Liam Neeson. One of Luc Besson's best movies of his career, produced and story wise. This is one of the best action films of the new year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I simply did not think this would be as good as it was--and I have NO idea why I thought it would be that way, but I was wrong--BIG TIME. I like Liam Neeson, but putting him in the same category as Jason Bourne, James Bond or Jack Bauer? I don't think so...well guess what? Liam was awesome as a father bent on undeniable, raging vengeance after his one and only daughter is abducted shortly after arriving in France.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes of the movie sets the stage for what follows, and when the rubber hits the pavement, man oh MAN hold ON! We see all the behind the scenes set-up you'll need to accept Liam as a divorced father who spent way too much time away from family, ultimately paying the price as he finds himself divorced, complete with a relationship with his daughter on life-support. He clearly regrets missing out on quality time with his little girl, and attempts to forge a closer bond with her when she deceives him into granting her permission to fly to Europe to tour museum's when its nothing more than a ruse to cover her desire to hop from one country to another seeing one concert after another.<br /><br />When his daughter fails to call him at the appointed time, he desperately tries to get in touch with her, and when he finally does, he discovers that she is moments away from being abducted. He fights back the urge to fall apart and gives her some valuable advice and sets out to find and then punish those responsible.<br /><br />What an adrenaline RUSH. The film quite literally flies by so fast that before I realized it, the movie was over. At first it felt like I had been there barely an hour, but it was longer than that--it just flew by quite rapidly. I seriously doubt that Liam will receive any acting awards for this roll, but I honestly don't care. His acting was superb (as usual) but this type of film is usually ignored at award shows anyway, so no big loss there, right?<br /><br />In short: if you enjoyed or really loved any or all three Bourne films with Matt Damon, give 'Taken' a shot, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised at how honestly GOOD it is. Personally, I loved it, and can hardly wait to see it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>We can negoti....booommm !........ This is one brief movie, so full of fights and action, you end up feeling they left in every kick-butt scene and took out some of the dialogue ones which could have given this movie more depth but hey, I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with a good dose of butt-kicking, specially when it's done this greatly, by terrific actors and for reasons you end more than caring about. Sure, everything goes just right for Neeson in his quest (it seems even Rambo would have more trouble reaching his objectives) and he definitely can't seem to be hit by any of the dozens of cars driving the opposite way or even by the hundreds of bullets shot at him but then again. Who cares ? My only 3 real complaints: 1) After substantially reducing Paris' population it seems hard to believe Neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist. 2) Who ended steering the boat when Neeson took out every living soul on it?, 3) How did the Sheik know exactly which of the 3-4 girls was Neeson's daughter ?<br />7-9-09 An additional couple of complaints: 4) Liam Neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment, and listening to his daughter screaming out "oh my God, they took her !", when in reality she yelled this out loud before Neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5) Neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport (prior to them both being photographed by the creep) is not there.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>Don't bother buying this version of the DVD as all you get is two versions of the movie--the theatrical release and unrated version. There are zero extras.<br /><br />Having said that it's an entertaining thriller in which Mel Gibson...oops, I thought ALL movies where the dad gets angry and seeks revenge as a one-man team by himself starred Mel...it's Liam Neeson in this one.<br /><br />Huge plot holes and improbable one man vs. everyone where (it's Hollywood, 'natch) all he suffers is a hurt wing in the entire movie but takes out approximately 9,555 Albanian (yes, Albanian!) criminals in Paris (yes, set that movie in a foreign locale to boost that overseas box office).<br /><br />The dumbest plot device (or non-device) is the fact we are introduced to his three other ex-CIA buddies who now work security for a pop singer. Now, to me, rather than going it alone to Paris given he has only 96 hours to save his daughter from a life of white slavery, he only enlists one guy to do some research on the criminals who may be involved with the kidnapping of his daughter. You don't think these guys would take 96 hours out of their lives to help their buddy, if asked?<br /><br />I just didn't get that. Why introduce these guys as his friends and have them bond at a backyard barbecue then on a job working security, then say bye bye. Did they not have enough in the budget to pay them all to fly to Paris?<br /><br />Anyway, there are some cringe-inducing drugged out scenes of horror as young girls are forced into prostitution so fair warning those who don't dig needles, disgusting room conditions and the whole world of human trafficking. Other than that plenty of bad guy fu, explosions-a-go-go and all around non-stop action.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>So says the films protagonist Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson)talking to his daughter's kidnapper over the phone.If you like your action straight up,no chasers,then Taken,released in Feb.2008 and put onto DVD in /09,is THE film for you.Once the action starts,it's a hold-onto-your-seats thrill ride that never lets up.<br />The plot is pretty straightforward.An ex CIA special agent Bryan Mills is attending his daughter's birthday party.From the get go Mills we see is meticulous in his personal habits,all stemming from his background training.His CIA days are behind him but he still keeps in touch with some of his former close associates.His daughter Kim's(Maggie Grace)mother Lenore(Famke Janssen) has remarried and Bryan's relationship with her is quite strained.When Mills meets with his daughter and ex for lunch,Kim asks for his permission to go to Paris with her girlfriend.He is reluctant and he thinks about it.He eventually comes around and Kim is away,with a few stipulations her dad has made on her.<br />The two arrive in Paris and head for their rented flat.On the way they meet a nice looking young man who they arrange to attend a party with later on.While the two are unpacking some unknown men enter the apartment and Kim's friend is taken away in a big struggle.Kim has been talking on the phone with her dad and she describes to him in detail what is taking place.Frightened and barely hanging on, all due to her dad's calm demeanor/training,she hides in an adjacent bedroom under a bed.He tells her she will be taken but to leave the phone open as long as she can and,most importantly,he will come for her.<br />Kim is dragged away as Mills listens.Springing into action he contacts not only her mother but his old associates who offer some technical skills in obtaining background info on the kidnappers.Mills only positive lead is that he has heard the sound of one of the kidnappers.He flies to Paris and clandestinely enters the girls apartment.He tenders the help of an old Paris police detective which leads him nowhere.From the memory card of his daughters smashed telephone he garners a picture of one of her kidnappers.He tracks him down at the airport and just when it seems he has eluded Mills he gets killed by a passing truck.<br />Mills knows that an Albanian gang,specializing in human trafficking,is the group responsible for taking his daughter.This leads him to a construction site which also houses a brothel run by the gang.He puts a temporary stop to the place by almost completely demolishing the operation but in the process gets a lead in the form of a heavily drugged girl who has his daughters jacket.He takes her to a motel and dries her out and gets the address of the place Kim might be at.He poses as a French policeman there to renegotiate his "fee" to keep quiet about their operations and enters the den of the Albanian traffickers.While there he fingers the man whose voice he heard briefly on the phone and after some further"negotiations", leaves with his man.<br />Using some plain old fashioned torture,he gleans the info that his daughter is now in the hands of a wealthy Parisian socialite who specializes in the sale of human flesh.Mills attends that function and poses as a waiter serving champagne.While in the small room with a buyer he finally sees his daughter,which he forces the buyer to obtain.While leaving the room to get his daughter(with the buyer in tow)the security there gets the best of him and his is held downstairs to be executed.Before they can do him in he is able to get free and turn the tables.He rushes out after his daughter who is now aboard a yacht owned by a wealthy Sheik.Through a car ride to beat all car rides he tries to catch up to the boat and eventually is able to jump aboard and overcome most of the security with all the usual lightening fast moves he has so far displayed throughout the film.He finally comes face to face with the Sheik holding his daughter at knife point.At the very moment the Sheik is about to negotiate with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.<br />Daughter Kim safely back in his arms,they both fly home.<br />Famed French writer,director Luc Besson(The Fifth Element)uses a deft hand in his control here.The editing is top notch;no filler and all meat.The action once it starts,is breathtaking to watch as Mills' former "training"/"special skills" are something to behold indeed.Neeson is right in the zone throughout which adds that much more to the believability and intensity of the proceedings.The supporting cast is great and the stunt work wonderful.<br />Technically is the film has been transferred onto DVD in its original 2:40:1 a/r,and is clear and crisp.This version has both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.There is commentary,the trailer and a making of featurette.There is however something the buyer should be aware of and it is in the making of the DVD itself.There is a scene where Mills enters the Albanians lair(behind the red door).He presents a card to one of the kidnappers.At that moment there seems to be a layer change and the film briefly stops ans starts.This is a common thing but here the sound actually goes out of sync with the actions/mouths on screen.I have checked this on a couple of players and it does it on both.It's a manufacturers glitch and should have been taken care of but of course these things never are unless the release is successful enough to warrant a future re-release.Gotta love this industry don't you?<br />All in all a top notch effort by all involved.Neeson is the intense protagonist who you just KNOW is going to get his man,or in this case his daughter.We know the ending before it really gets going but the trick is to sit back and enjoy the ride,and what a ride it is.4 1/2 stars,recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Fueled by Pierre Morel's vigorous direction, Liam Neeson is the whole show in a preposterously entertaining action-thriller. "Taken" (2008) starts slowly, but once the kidnapped-daughter plot takes over, it's full speed ahead with plenty of gunplay and fisticuffs along the way. Neeson acquits himself impressively as a no-nonsense action hero. The unrated director's cut remains preferable to the studio-imposed PG-13 edit. Produced and co-written by Luc Besson, who will reunite with Neeson for more bone-crunching mayhem.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>First before I start off with a review, I want to say Taken is all about a man's struggle to rescue his daughter from a European sex slave ring. The human sex trafficking industry is absolutely atrocious, and unfortunately it's very real, and it's big business. It's a worldwide industry too. Any research into the industry will reveal the absolute worst of humanity, with the poor women kidnapped and trapped in the industry treated like animals, human cattle all for the sake of a making a buck. The torture and abuse the women experience at the hands of these animals is simply unimaginable. To add insult to injury the poor women trapped in that industry who try to escape, then have to worry about having their family members killed. These women are kept in the most inhumane living conditions, worked up to 16 hours a day, starved, sleep deprived, beaten, tortured, etc. Man's inhumanity to man, and to animals (pit bull fighting rings, whale, seal, shark killing, animals used for cosmetics testing, minks tortured for their fur etc.) is enough to make me think that maybe we are due for a big extinction level event. The experiment has failed, time to wipe it out and start over. That may seem like an extreme view, but there is so much inhumanity and violence in this world that I really don't think humans deserve the right to inhabit the earth any longer. We pollute and torture the planet, torture fellow man, and torture the other animals who inhabit the planet with us, that I think the good in humanity is far outweighed by the bad. I don't know where we are headed as a civilization, but an extinction level event may be just what's called for to end the evil in this world, and maybe start over with a new model of man.<br /><br />Okay, now that I'm done with the heavy, preachy stuff, on to the movie. Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor, there is nothing I've seen the man in that I don't like. Taken really could have ended up being just another action movie were it not for Liam's fine acting. Make no mistake though, Liam is a one man army in this movie, killing his way through overwhelming odds, and always winding up on top. I shudder to think what the headcount was in Taken. The subject matter is treated with great respect, and the horrors of it aren't down played at all. It's a brutal glimpse into the world of sex slave trafficking, and is not for the feint of heart. The movie has a very simple plot, a former CIA paramilitary has to use all of his skills to rescue his daughter, who becomes kidnapped while in Paris by a sex slave ring. With much trepidation he allows his daughter to go to Europe with her best friend, but he becomes visibly pissed when he finds out she actually went to follow U2 around Europe for the European leg of their tour. We learn pretty quick in the film, Liam's character is no one to mess with, as he very quickly and efficiently disarms a knife wielding attacker while working security at a concert for a big pop princess. While I enjoy shoot em ups as much as the next guy, I'm always more interested in what the hand to hand combat will be like. I have trained in the martial arts for many years, with the majority of those years studying the Filipino art of Kali, which is a weapons based art. So I'm very versed in the realities of knife fighting and empty hand combat in close quarter situations. To my great surprise, the empty hand choreography in Taken was fantastic, equally as good as the empty hand work in the James Bond film Casino Royale and the follow up. The fighting is in close, with short, but powerful strikes, and quick trapping/disarming techniques. Really well done close quarter fighting choreography.<br /><br />The acting in Taken is very good, but really this is not a drama, it's an action movie, and the director wastes no time getting going with the action. I would say 15 minutes into the movie and fun begins. This is a movie where you will really root for Liam's character, just because of the heinous nature of the villains he is fighting against. It's a joy watching him dispatch the human animals one by one, in many different fashions. My absolute favorite is a scene with a particularly nasty trafficker tied up to a makeshift electric chair and forced to give up information. I loved watching Liam flick the switch, and the end of the scene is just great! I won't give away the ending, but I will say anyone with any experience in the action movie genre, should know from the beginning how it's going to end. I just really liked Taken, it's a well done action flick. It doesn't require much thought, but it leaves you entertained from start to finish. Liam elevates the movie by his presence, and I'm not sure how well it would have worked without him. If you enjoy action movies with good acting, exciting hand to hand combat, cool technology, and a very fast pace, Taken is for you!</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>I'm a fan of both Besson, and Neeson, and while TAKEN may not be the very best of either's work, it's great fun to watch. What I liked best was that the fight scenes were coolly efficient, and much more believable than the acrobatic hyperbole in most action films of late- although I am a bit tired of seeing firefights in which the only person capable of shooting straight is the hero. This was a nice, taut, vengence-driven, violence-filled pic that was definitely bumped up a few notches by the effortless believability of its star. TAKEN is a perfect popcorn pic for guys.</p></br><a href="../users/ALLIGF5OZM1I6.html">ALLIGF5OZM1I6</a><br/><p>TAKEN<br /><br />STARRING: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Holly Valance, Katie Cassidy, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Pierre Morel<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 30 January 2009<br /><br />There is almost nothing more rewarding in a film, than one that can entertain you and stimulate your brain on current events simultaneously. Taken is marvelous at this because its premise is not only something that makes for a great action thriller, but is also a huge problem in the world today, often overlooked by many: human trafficking.<br /><br />Liam Neeson gives a balls-to-the wall performance as ex CIA operative Mills. Neeson may not look like an angry stud like Willis, Schwarzenegger or Stallone; but trust me, after seeing him here, he's more than convincing. I enjoyed seeing him play a ruthless villain in Batman Begins, and he takes that same dark edge and brings it to our hero in Taken.<br /><br />Mills has lived a vey fast paced life and seen action in numerous global conflicts to include Afghanistan. All that is behind him now though, as he has made plans to mend his tattered relationship with his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Between the hurt feelings of several missed birthdays and Christmases due to the excessive travel of his job, and Kim's mother's new insanely rich live-in boyfriend; Mills has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />At 91 minutes, Taken is a very short film, especially for its genre. But it never seems short and it gives us everything we need early on, to care for its characters and the events that happen to them. The relationship between Mills and his daughter is crucial to the story and had it not been believable, the film would have suffered. It is believable. He cares for her more than anything in the world and wants nothing but for her to be happy.<br /><br />So naturally, when his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and Kim need his permission for Kim to leave the country, to follow U2 to France with a friend, Mills wants to oblige them. It's painstakingly hard for him at first, as he is more than aware of the dangers that face a young girl traveling without adult supervision in Europe; but we already know from the film's title that he will let her go.<br /><br />Mills is super-smart however and exceptionally well prepared. He buys her a universal cell phone, and only agrees to let her go if she will in turn agree to calling and checking in with him at his approved times.<br /><br />On the first day in France, Kim witnesses from across the hall, her friend being kidnapped. The film's pivotal moment is a phone call between Kim and her father as she explains to him what is happening.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer, I thought Mills was in on it, by his freakishly calm comment to his daughter, "They're going to take you." But the only reason he is so calm is because he realizes he only has a few precious seconds to tell Kim what to do, before these heinous men take her. He tells her to hide under the bed and to shout out every detail that she can about her captors, and that he will come for her. The suspense builds from there as one of them actually picks up the phone, and Mills delivers some of the best one-liners in any action film of recent years. The scumbag's response? "Good luck."<br /><br />Having obviously recorded this conversation with hi-tech spy equipment, Mills uses sources in Langley to assist in narrowing down the list of suspects. A nice little game of `I told you so', and an immediate plane ticket to France from his ex-wife and her rich boyfriend, and he's off.<br /><br />Taken could have easily been over the top and unrealistic but Neeson plays Mills so genuinely, that we never doubt he'd be capable of pulling any of these things off. Yeah, there are a few one guy takes on several guys action sequences, but they are executed well and initiated with Mills' brains, rather than bronze. His wits and extensive training allow him to infiltrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.<br /><br />I have no idea how they pulled off a PG - 13 rating, but they did! The action is intense and in your face and the suspense could shatter bones. Mills has no mercy in this film and we love him for it. Watch for the scene that takes place at a dinner table, while Mills visits an old friend. You will never see what he does coming; you'll know the one I mean.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the actors they cast to play the villains in the film as well; you really want to see them suffer for what they've done to these young women. In case you are unfamiliar with the term human trafficking, let me simplify it for you. They kidnap young women, drug them, and sell them to rich men to use as sex slaves. Many of them as is the case with Kim are minors and virgins, and they go for the most cash. Make no mistake, this may be a big Hollywood movie, but this goes on every day in our world.<br /><br />I've read some skeptical reviews on the film from writers who seriously doubt that this world exits to the extent that the film portrays. I'm more than convinced that it's not far off. I've seen some truly evil people in my life and I've seen how money can corrupt people too. Give evil men money and power and what do you think they'll do with it? No-one can deny that these women go missing, so where are they going then?</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>The tension will be heightened if you watch Hostel 1 before watching this movie and 13 Tzameti informs the local color of the Parisian underbelly.

If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek - Next Generation," you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in "Alien," you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in "The Devil Wears Prada," you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.<br /><br />From "Darkman" to "Star Wars" to "Taken," Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.<br /><br />In "Taken," we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for "Taken," you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.<br /><br />This is where "Taken" takes flight in a "Bourne Ultimatum" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter, and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.<br /><br />Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  "Taken" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.<br /><br />Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the "Bourne" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.  This is far from a feel-good movie - you get the sense there are no winners here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>'Taken' is a fast paced action film that doesn't waste anytime getting to the point. The set up is simple and Liam Neeson shows he can play a bad A$$ as good as the next guy. What I enjoyed about this film is that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's under an hour and a half and Neeson is terrific as a father on a mission to save his teenage daughter.

The daughter wants to take a trip overseas with a friend, her father objects but relents with conditions that she ignores.<br /><br />Lucky for her she keeps the phone he gave him and at about the 27 minute mark when she is taken he gives his ultimatum to the man on the other line, his daughter or his life.  As the movie progresses it is clearly established that like the villain in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2FX8">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)</a> he chooses poorly.<br /><br />At this point he is no longer the weaker link in a family squabble, he becomes John Wayne in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008CMR4">Big Jake</a> without Maureen O'Hara or sons to back him up.  The locale is different and his foes are not looking for his cash but the quest is the same, the girl alive OR them dead, each and every one of them, but he makes a slight alteration; the  OR becomes an AND.<br /><br />Like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YIGND6">Trade</a> we see the inhumanity of the modern slave trade and the indifference of those who practice it.  Unlike trade we get a movie that is meant to entertain and does.<br /><br />It may be less realistic but the results are immensely more satisfying.  He proceeds with no mercy to anyone who would hinder him, it is that lack of mercy or honor that makes this movie even better.<br /><br />If you are a Wayne or Eastwood fan you will enjoy this movie particularly the last half of it.  If you are a Michael Moore fan you will not.<br /><br />Simple as that.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Sure, TAKEN is about eight feet over the top and soundly jumps the shark when Neeson's Super Dad/Super Bad character lands on the evil sultan's yacht (and those of you who have seen this film will know exactly what I'm talking about), but who cares?  TAKEN is not for Sundance audiences or art houses; it's grand edge-of-your-seat escapism that takes the viewer on a wild, bumpy ride as former CIA agent (at least, we assume he's former CIA) Bryan Mills goes to Paris to kick some serious bad guy arse.<br /><br />After grudgingly giving his teenage daughter (who lives in the lap of luxury with her mother and ultra-rich stepfather) permission to spend the summer in Paris with a friend and the friend's "cousins", we are not surprised to see the daughter get violently kidnapped by Albanian thugs running a sleazy prostitution ring.  Well, they picked on the wrong teenager, as agent Mills (Liam Neeson plays this delightfully close to the vest) is about to show them all who's your Daddy.  Putting all his clandestine skills to task, Mills mows through the Paris underground like a weedeater on acid, doing mega damage to all who stand in his way.  Of course, his relentless, cold-blooded, calculating pursuit ultimately pays bloody dividends and last-second heroics, making TAKEN one fun ride--even if none of it is believable.<br />--D.

You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. Watch this one today!<br /><br />(P.S. I heart Liam. He ROCKS in this movie!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Remember last year when you seen NOTHING but previews for this film?  I remember this VERY well.  The hype this movie received was almost too much to take!  It got to the point where the hype alone was turning me off.<br /><br />Well it's been a year later, and I watched Taken tonight for the very first time trying to forget about those annoyingly repetitive commercials.<br /><br />I started out VERY disappointed.  I have to be honest about that.  The very beginning of the movie shows the single father having memories of his daughter's birthday party from when she was just a little girl.  We've seen the same thing a MILLION times in other movies.  I was preparing myself for a very overrated and predictable film.  Some of the scenes even had a low budget feel to them.<br /><br />The next 20 minutes didn't win me over either.  The father goes to his daughter's birthday party (he wasn't dreaming about it this time) to bring her a gift.<br /><br />Then the fathers ex-wife enters the picture.  The two of them start talking and obviously they don't get along (filled with sarcastic little shots in between of course!)<br /><br />Of course, her new husband enters the picture as well, pretends to be friends with the daughter's father, but you know very well they could never be friends because they talk in a way where it's plainly obvious they don't care about each other in the slightest, and then the father leaves the birthday party and returns home.<br /><br />That's the first 20 minutes of film- horribly predictable story-telling we must have seen a million times.  So it's VERY important to keep watching past those 20 minutes.<br /><br />When the actual story kicks in concerning the daughter having to get her fathers approval to take a vacation to France (by way of a signature signing taking place in a restaurant) *this* is when the plot development really gets interesting.<br /><br />The father is reluctant to send his daughter to a foreign country for safety reasons, but eventually he gives in.  Otherwise he'd been considered a horrible father.<br /><br />When the daughter arrives to France with her one friend, you see them having fun and dancing around in a hotel room.  The daughter walks into another room, and through a window she sees her friend being attacked and kidnapped by three or four strange men that walked into the room.  She panics, so she hides under a bed.<br /><br />This is where you have to take into consideration the storyline is fictional, because the daughter calls up the father while hiding under a bed, and tells him what's going on with her friend.<br /><br />The father then calmly and precisely gives his daughter instructions on how to handle the situation.<br /><br />I was like "Are you SERIOUS!"  Most fathers would become emotional, confused and worried if such a situation were to present itself.  Apparently this father thought he was some kind of superman who not only knew how to tell a darn good well-prepared speech, but also had an ability to remain completely calm over the phone WHILE the daughter was being taken away by the bad guys!<br /><br />How is this possible?  Only in Hollywood.  Besides those little problems, the rest of the storyline is rather amazingly action-packed and features lots of shootings, violence, and killings, which is the norm for these kind of films.  I really enjoyed the movie after getting past all those predictable and impossible to believe moments.<br /><br />So the film is great in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Possible spoilers<br /><br />Action films when done right can be a great form of escapism, (The "Die Hard" Films, "Face/Off") however some are just plain bad, ("Wanted" anyone?).<br /><br />"Taken" is a very and I mean very bare bones action flick that stars Liam Neeson ("Les Miserables" "Batman Begins") as Bryan Mills a retired government agent who goes to look for the men who took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, "The Fog" and T.V.'s "Lost") while she and a friend were on a trip in Paris.<br /><br />Mills finds out from a longtime friend of his that these men take young traveling girls and sell them as prositutes on the black market. So with this information and a ticking clock off Mills goes.<br /><br />After the first 30-35 minutes, the film is mainly one action sequence after another as Mills' search for his daughter takes him all over Paris and other parts of France, I'm guessing at least since a lot of loactions were never fully specified.<br /><br />There's a really cool chase scene throughout a construction site where some men are holding some of the girls. Almost every action portion involves Mills using skills he learned over the years (basically how to kill) to get information and take down people to get his daughter back.<br /><br />The action is great, fast paced and of course mostly ridiculous. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly throwaway characters and stereotypical bad guys, though Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills ex-wife and of course is Kim's mother.<br /><br />Personally as silly and goofy as the film can be and is, it's a ton of fun and flies by quickly though given the 85 minutes running time it's not suprising. If you want non-stop bare bones action pick up "Taken" and enjoy. 3.5 out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AW1493ZQTQ2ET.html">AW1493ZQTQ2ET</a><br/><p>This is a lively action movie designed mainly to entertain, not enlighten.  As such, the plot does stretch credulity at many points, but you won't really notice if you avoid critical thinking and just go with the flow.  There's plenty of violence, though it's not over the top.  Most importantly, an action movie should succesfully create and maintain suspense and tension, and this one does that.<br /><br />Liam Neeson does an excellent job playing the lead good guy, and his performance is perhaps the greatest strength of the movie.  Sterotypically, the bad guys are almost exclusively foreigners.  And the portrayal of the main daughter character is also weakened by stereotyping.<br /><br />Overall, I can recommend this movie if you're looking for some decent action-oriented entertainment, and not expecting anything that will expand your horizons.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Taken / B001TODCII<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I think it's probably safe to say that no one is going to be terribly surprised or thought-provoked by "Taken". The movie is straightforward and simple, almost quaintly so in an era where we've come to expect every movie to have a dramatic twist ending in which it turns out that an ancillary character (the best friend? the aging husband? the bitter wife?) was the actual mastermind behind everything. "Taken" has no such twists, partly because they've become a bit overdone in the movie industry, but mostly because such a twist would have undermined Neeson's hard-earned 'I told you so' as well as the (probably unintentional) movie subtext that pretty young women should never leave their fathers' homes - or for that matter the motherland.<br /><br />Indeed, it's difficult to say how much of the movie is meant to be a searing attack on women... Neeson's ex-wife palatably drips evil and malice, and his darling daughter is almost a caricature of the stereotypical spoiled brat - throwing a temper tantrum that would shame a three-year-old when Daddy doesn't instantly sign off on an exotic European getaway. When the daughter and girlfriend are kidnapped into white slavery for being imprudent enough to flirt with an attractive stranger on a busy street in a foreign country, the sexually active girl dies almost immediately and is never mentioned again in the film. Neeson's daughter, on the other hand, is a pure-as-the-driven-snow virgin, allowing him a crucial extra few hours to try to save her as she is shuttled off to the expensive and exclusive 'virgin auction'. Although I'm probably reading WAY too much into the movie with all this subtext - after all, this is supposed to be a fun, mindless shoot-em-up, not a dissertation on the evils of society.<br /><br />All tongue-in-cheek aside, "Taken" is a fine action movie if you're just looking for people to get blown up, shot, and run over by cars. Quite a few of the characters fail to act sensibly (like the slave-trader who is uncooperative for no reason at all except as a method to work in a torture scene), and some of the action feels a bit too pretentious - like a deliberate attempt to push the envelope. For example, when Neeson shots innocent people in order to get their loved ones to cooperate - the action doesn't make sense and simply doesn't fit the character, but we're out to push buttons here, not build a believable storyline. I recommend "Taken" for a fun, mindless action movie to pass the time, but I wouldn't waste too much time trying to find sense in it - this is a spectacle movie, not a philosophical one.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>This is perhaps the best action-thriller to come along since the BOURNE movies.  It has a good, straight-forward plot, characters that we care about and action sequences that may, at times, get a bit "over the top," but never to the point of being ridiculous.<br /><br />Liam Neeson stars as a retired CIA agent, working an occasional security gig, who is forced back into action when his teenage daughter is kidnapped by white slavers while she is visiting Paris with a friend.  Liam knows that he has only 96 hours in which to find the girl before she disappears forever, and the French authorities are no help whatsoever.  In fact, many of them, are corrupt and on the payroll of the kidnappers.<br /><br />Like DEATH WISH, Taken is one of those movies where you actually cheer when Neeson kills one of the bad guys...and he kills a lot of them.<br /><br />The DVD contains both the theatrical and an extended edition.<br /><br />?

Neeson played the part of a father trying to establish a relationship with his estranged daughter very well. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat. I enjoyed it. The movie wasn't Shakespeare: the dialog was kept to minimum. The torture sequences were hard to watch, but there are movies out there much more violent. The movie didn't make the protag<br />onist a superman, but a middled-aged man with very good fighting skills.<br /><br />I don't know if I recommend buying it, but I definitely would watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Excellent DVD movie, And A Good Moral lesson for the adventurous types, Who think the world is just one big safe place.

I WILL Find You. And I'll Kill You." You do NOT want to be the guy that Liam Neeson says that to in Taken.<br /><br />If you thought that Liam was bad (and by bad I mean gooood) as Ra's al Ghul in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E">Batman Begins</a>, wait 'til you see him as an ex-spy whose daughter is abducted while visiting Paris. Unfortunately for the abductors, Neeson was trained to "prevent bad things from happening." So when you combine a loving, overprotective father whose daughter has been abducted with a ruthless cold-blooded "preventer of bad things from happening," you'd better not be in his way.<br /><br />While some of the scenarios in Taken go a little over the top, the action is thrilling to watch, and Neeson is flawless in his role. I don't mean this to be a Neeson love-fest, but the fact is that the movie is 90% Neeson; he's on-screen in at least 90% of the scenes. It is indeed Neeson that takes Taken from being an average movie to being a really good movie.<br /><br />You won't fall asleep watching Taken. Surprisingly the movie is PG-13; even the Unrated Extended Cut doesn't cross the PG-13 line (as far as I remember anyway). There's lots of action. Good acting. A simple plot. Taken worked for me...I'd highly recommend it for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>If this was 1987 or 88, this would have been a star-vehicle for the likes of Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. But they have moved past their heyday, and in Arnold's case, even past acting. But would anyone ever have pictured a mild mannered characther actor to deliver as stunning a performance as Liam Neeson does in Luc Besson's "Taken?" Step back and be prepared..."Taken" gets almost everything an actioner could get perfect.<br /><br />Neeson steps up to the plate as a retired special operations soldier/spy who feels like he needs to be a better dad. What could be a better way to prove your worth than to rescue your daughter when she gets kidnapped by a sex-slave ring? While Neeson tends to deliver deep character studies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PALGG">Kinsey,</a> this time he goes all "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L5SRJE">24</a>" on us and starts busting up the baddies. At the same time, he shows his anguish under all the bravado, elevating "Taken" from the generic.<br /><br />Writer/Producer Besson is no stranger to this turf; he all but perfected it when he introduced America to Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJEE">Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)</a>. What he does with "Taken" is make you remember that even Jack Bauer types are family men, even as they manage to dodge the bullets of Middle Eastern gangs with an arsenal of M-16's. If it weren't for Neeson's take on Spy-Dad Bryan Mills, "Taken" could have easily devolved into a random revenge flick. Economical, tight and loaded with whupazz, "Taken" shows that an action film can dish up both brains and brawn.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>While watching "Taken", the first thing that crossed my mind was: "Wow, this could be the story of fictional TV character Jack Bauer's retirement years!". Considering the success of 24, suffice it to say that I mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Basically, the plot of this film centers on Liam Neeson's character, who is estranged from his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) and really has no way back into her life anymore. Though tenuous about her decision to travel to Europe for a summer with a friend, he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them, so he allows it. Of course, her and the friend are immediately targeted by European slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment, sending Neeson into action to try and get them back. The kicker, though, is that "Neeson", now retired, was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of "CTU" of "24" fame (at least that is how it is described). As a result, Neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughter's abductors for the remainder of the movie.<br /><br />What really separates this movie from other action fare, though, is the character development at the very beginning. Where other pure action films (Eagle Eye comes to mind) spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters, the entire first 30 minutes (out of only 90 total) of "Taken" really fleshes out the father-daughter relationship. This makes you the viewer root even harder for Neeson cause when his daughter is taken.<br /><br />The acting is also very solid, albeit in a subdued fashion (at least from Neeson). Whereas Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer emotes wildly and often, Neeson's take on "government agent" is much more simmeringly intense. We understand how badly he wants his daughter back, but he doesn't have to pitch a fit to convince us. Also, Grace ("Shannon" of LOST fame) transitions from well from small to big screen, as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the film.<br /><br />Thus, while this film is not epic in any sense of the word (hence the four-star rating), it is still very entertaining in a straight-forward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should: developing characters, creating emotional attachments, and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward. If you are a fan of the "thriller" genre, please check this movie out...it may not shoot straight to the top of your "favorite movies" list, but you will also likely not be disappointed, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I'm sorry but I had no problem with this movie it's great.

I'll say for a PG13 film it's hardcore. Basically Liam Neeson plays a retired government agent or CIA something in that order and just wants to spend time with his teenaged daughter Kim who has wants to become a pop star. She has a friend who wants her to go to Paris with her while in Paris Kim and her friend Amanda are kidnapped and basically she's on the phone with her dad. and he records the phone call he goes to Paris he only has 4 days to find his daughter.It's a race against time and because his daughter is in a human trafficking ring and has to find her.

The horrible crime of sexual slavery is addressed only to get the plot moving but isn't used to prick anyone's conscious, just provide a story of rescue.</p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>A former goverment agent is over protective of his daughter and does not want her to go to London. He eventually agrees to let her go but wants her to check in as soon as she gets into town but she forgets and he worries. The daughter and her friend meet a guy who seems nice but you know he is up to no good. We soon find out he finds American girls and kidnaps them and forces them into prostitution. Anywho, the agent is thrust back into work and vows to get his girl back at any cost. He goes all James Bond or Jason Bourne and goes to Paris (I cannot remember the country or city) and all hell breaks loose. The film is pretty much to the point and the action is non-stop and satisfying. It was over sooner then I expected but there was nothing left to do, every ground seemed to be covered. I highly recommend this to any action movie lover or anyone looking for a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>The setup in concept and execution is brilliant.  Even the trailer made not apologies about the type of movie it was going to be.  Someone takes Bryan's (Neeson) little girl Kim (Grace), but doesn't realize he is a very dangerous man capable of some serious damage when provoked.  The rest of a movie is a chase to find Kim, where Bryan uses his vast array of skills acquired as a former FBI agent to track down the evil criminals involved in her abduction.<br /><br />Before allowing Kim to go on vacation to Paris with a friend, Bryan insists on precaution.  He's hesitant in the first place, denying her initial request; however, he eventually relents but with a few requirements.  Kim gets a cell phone and must stay in constant contact with her father.  Off she goes to Europe away from daddy's protection.  Within a single day, but not too quickly, his daughter calls her father.  While on the phone she sees her friend get kidnapped, and her father lets her know she is also going to be taken.  Dad is not pleased, informs the bad guy as much, and the bad guy's reply, "Good luck."  The hunt is on.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, get in Bryan's way and you'll be punished.  If he has time, and you pose a particularly burdensome obstacle, you may even die.  For the most part he drops various bad guys with single head shots.  Other than Captain Kirk's infamous neck chop, there has not been such one-punch precision in the history of combat.  Every criminal element involved is essentially a punching bag, rag doll waiting for the coup de grace.<br /><br />Will he get to his daughter in time?  The power of this movie is the suspense, not knowing if he'll make it in time to save Kim from danger, or if he'll find her at all.  Great action movie, something that goes from zero to sixty in no time at all, and never takes pressure off the throttle.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Taken" is essentially two lines of dialogue - "I will find you. And I will kill you." - stretched out into a 90-minute film. The speaker of this line finds his man. And, boy, does he kill him. And then he finds more people and kills them, too. And before he found the guy he was looking for in the first place, he found some other guys. Guess what? He killed them.<br /><br />This is not a subtle film. It's not all that bloody, either, this tale of a CIA agent (Liam Neeson) whose estranged daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by sex trade smugglers, thanks to a PG-13 rating. But nuanced? No. Luc Besson ("The Fifth Element," "The Professional," The "Transporter" series), who co-wrote the screenplay and more or less breathed life into this thing as producer likes his action scenes big, and his hit men sentimental-yet-efficient.<br /><br />And Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is certainly that. He's divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) for logging too many hours in hot zones for the CIA, and since she's remarried to, of course, a billionaire (Xander Berkeley, not the villain, if you're guessing), Bryan has idealized his gangly, selfish daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and transformed her into his Reason For Living.<br /><br />But Kim cons him into signing a release so she can go to Paris with her slightly older, sluttier friend. It's only Bryan's zeal for worrying about every little detail - she forgets to call him upon landing in France, so he calls her - that allows him to hear his daughter getting kidnapped by Albanian slave traders.<br /><br />Inexplicably, her kidnapper picks up the phone. That's enough for Brian and his connections at the CIA to start the manhunt.<br /><br />The second and third acts of "Taken" are, frankly, one mass killing after another, each unlikelier than the last. In the background, we see the pale, starving figures - some alive, some not - of other kidnapped girls. At one point, Bryan looks for his daughter in what appears to be a giant Port-A-Potty divided into tiny rooms by cloth curtains with a bed, a slave and a client in each. Bryan eventually finds the Albanians' home base, which is a hive of, well, drugged-out women and presumed venereal disease.<br /><br />The movie is structured almost like a video game, with a number of bosses to kill and levels to complete. Brian's most daunting challenges lie in the bowels of a Paris brownstone at a million-dollar auction and aboard a ship headed for the Middle East. Whether Maggie is there, and whether he saves her, I'll let the film reveal.<br /><br />Let it be said that Maggie Grace, a veteran of the "Lost" TV series, was 25 years old when she filmed the movie. She's lost any useful clue on how to play an innocent 17-year-old, and thus turns in one of the more embarrassing performances of the year. There is a way to pout - Kim is required to do it in just about every scene - and a way not to, and it's a mark of Grace's inelegance that she never carves out an ounce of chemistry with Neeson, whose Bryan is risking more than his life, his moral compass and years in prison to save her.  And, unfortunately, she is also not cute, as a scene near the end so drastically points out. You'll know the one, and you'll be asking yourself, "Her?"<br /><br />Neeson slips nicely into the role once given to Harrison Ford. His Bryan is sharp and ruthless, and the movie's key "find you/kill you" monologue is delivered with menace and precision. You'll want to watch it twice. Janssen and Berkeley have bit roles, as does the excellent Leland Orser as one of Brian's CIA buddies.<br /><br />A subplot involving a pop singer is so extraneous and unnecessary that I think it exists to be extraneous and unnecessary, as if to show the audience a modicum of 1980s decency. Everything in "Taken" - the Eurotrash baddies, the body count, the "heart's on fire" hero of steely resolve but pudding heart - feels stolen from 1986. In other words - good for a pizza night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I was skeptical when I heard that this movie would be produced by Luc Besson (The Professional, La Femme Nikita), the go to man or the French Joel Silver of action movies since some of his films have been hit and miss.  This turns out to be a hit (it's already grossed $143 million thus far) thanks to the casting of Liam Neesom (Schindler's List; Rob Roy).  A physically imposing actor of great presence, Neesom brings this physicality to the role of an retired CIA man brought back into action when his daughter is kidnapped in Paris.  What ensues is 97 minutes of breakneck action and Neesom is totally convincing in this role.  It may lack the complexity of the Bourne series but if you like your action movies to be lean and mean--this is the flick to see!!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>One of the most exciting and interesting movies to be released in the first-half of 2009, TAKEN is a thrilling movie about one father's journey to rescue his daughter from Eastern European kidnappers who intend to sell her as a sex slave to the highest bidder.  Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired CIA special ops man who has recently moved so that he can be closer to his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) who is living with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and her wealthy stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan loves his daughter deeply, but feels disconnected from her and because of the posh lifestyle she is currently living. He is concerned that she might be loosing her way.  When Kim is presented with an opportunity to travel with a friend to Paris for the summer, Bryan is against the idea.  His work with the CIA have taught him how dangerous it is for young women to be traveling alone across Europe. Besides that, Kim is underage and her protective mother and stepfather have been overprotective and sheltered her from any knowledge of the real dangers of the world.  However, after being reassured of Kim and her traveling companion, Amanda's (Katie Cassidy), supervision by a family in Paris, that there would not be any globe-trotting alone, and Kim's promise that she would call her father every day, he consents to let her go.  It is only later that he learns the girls aren't going for any sort of educational reason, but to be a band groupie following a particular group on their European tour.  Bryan is furious, but is still trying to reconnect and against his better judgment allows her to go.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Paris, Amanda & Kim are met by a handsome, young Frenchmen who invites them to a party later that night and rides with them to the place where they will be staying.  Kim is a bit unsettled by the many, but Amanda is smitten with lust. Upon arriving at the residence Kim is shocked to discover that Amanda wasn't being completely honest with her either because the family they are to stay with are gone for most of the summer and the girls will be left on their own.  Shortly after, while talking to her father on the phone, Kim watches Amanda being abducted and sees the men coming for her.  It turns out the man at the airport was the frontman for a group of individuals who make a fortune from kidnapping young foreign women, addicting them to drugs, and then selling them as sex slaves.  Bryan tells Kim what to do and she obeys his every command right up until the point she is taken herself.  Knowing that he has right around 48 hours to find his daughter before she is lost from him forever, Bryan begins calling in some favors and takes a personal jet of his wife's husband to Paris and begins looking for his daughter and hunting down the criminals who have taken her.<br /><br />TAKEN is an action-packed movie that doesn't really stop once it starts.  The first 15 minutes or so of the film are expositional in nature to introduce the audience to the characters, but from the moment that the kidnappers break into the Paris home until almost the very end of the picture, the movie is non-stop action.  Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor and I have yet to see him give a bad performance.<br /><br />Besides just being a good action movie, TAKEN also examines some subject matter that most Americans are unaware but should become more familiar.  There are some coincidences in the movie used for dramatic purposes, but the portrayal of how the women in the movie are abused and victimized isn't just startling, but is also quite accurate.  The kidnapping and selling of women as sex slaves is something that does happen and in some parts of the world has almost become common.<br /><br />Overall, I found TAKEN to be a very good movie. There are certain parts of the plot that are predictable, but the movie is action packed and makes for an afternoon or evening of enjoyable viewing.  It's also a movie that any parent with a daughter should watch.<br /><br />The two-disc version of the movie includes both cuts of the movie (PG-13 & Unrated versisons), two commentary tracks, a making of featurette "Le Making Of", a video of the movie's premier entitled "Avant Premiere", a featurette that illustrates how some of the action scenes were made, and some trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>This is a classic Luc Besson film - it's got his fingerprints all over it, even if he only co-wrote and produced it.  No-nonsense, gritty in-your-face action - old school torture and interrogation and subterfuge...this is the film that Quantum of Solace should have been!  Make Liam Neeson James Bond please.  But seriously, it's such a punchy thrill-a-minute film that it makes you almost long for a sequel.  Great direction by Pierre Morel (and a million times better than the dreadful "Transporter") - the only thing better than this was probably the original Nikita.  I'll say it again: SEQUEL!!<br /><br />The story was especially poignant because it involved family.  While watching this, I also couldn't help feeling sorry for Neeson - who just lost his wife.  RIP Natasha Richardson.<br /><br />Here's to Liam's future.  Great job.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>"You live into a bubble; don't know how the world is". These are the last words after an unpleasant discussion between this veteran of Intelligence service and his ex-wife about giving permission his daughter of just seventeen to make a travel for Paris.<br /><br />Written by Luc Besson and directed by a young director, Peter Morel, this thriller is told according the basic rules of this genre. It carves in relief the state of things in which the daughter of a divorced couple plans to make a trip to Paris in company of her friend Amanda (secretly they have decided to follow the musical schedule to U2), but his father who worked into the Intelligence Service is well aware about the dangerous situation.<br /><br />Liam Neeson (an actor of multiple artistic skills who should be more requested) makes a very credible performance acting like the avenger father who will travel to Paris breaking any kind of law to find her, because he just has 80 hours to avoid she was sent to other destinies.<br /><br />Full action, marvelous car chases, brutal violence and bloody scenes make this movie an admirable vehicle of entertainment.<br /><br />Somehow this movie made me remind that psycho thriller of the 80's Frantic directed by Polanski and acted by Harrison Ford, in which his wife is kidnapped, in Paris.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>Retired CIA agent, Bryan (Liam Neeson) must call on all of his past job skills when his teenaged daughter (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by people traffickers, while on vacation in France.<br /><br />I really enjoyed "Taken". It is a really dumb film with "violence solves everything" as its central message (and the incongruously heavy themes of drugs, prostitution and slavery, but lets not dwell on those), but in spite of these things (or perhaps because of them), it was exciting, fast-moving and a really fun movie to watch. Although starting to look a bit on the old side, Neeson does a commendable job as a former spy called back into action and surprisingly he makes this piece of far-fetched fluff seem somewhat believable...somewhat.<br /><br />The script of "Taken" is co-written by Luc Besson, who is among my favourite writers, and although not of the calibre of "Leon - The Professional", or even "Taxi",  Besson is still a better writer than most action film writers out there and as a results, this film is well worth your time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A retired CIA agent lets his ex-wife twist his arm into letting their daughter round all over Europe.

I really do wish that were the case.  Unfortunately, the opposite is true:  the plotline is about as accurate to what happens as a plotline can possibly be.  It sheds a light on a crisis of growing proportion in the world, yet one that gets all too little exposure:  human trafficking.<br /><br />Bryan (Liam Neeson) is an ex CIA spook whose daughter is ambushed / kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.  Luckily for her (and unluckily for her captors!), his skills give him an unexpected advantage in tracking down the thugs who took her from him.  Bryan takes on the HT network with all the grace of a wrecking ball ramming into a 100 year old building!<br /><br />Kidnapping for ransom is something that tends to only happen to the wealthy.  After all, kidnappers who are after $$ have little incentive to kidnap people who are of a modest financial worth.  Human trafficking, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  It can happen to anyone, anytime, as selling the person to a 3rd party is the objective, rather than selling the individual back to their family / friends.<br /><br />For this reason, this movie is a must-see as it sheds a much needed light on an all too frequent egregious practice.  It points out how the culprits operate in preying on "soft targets" who are far from home.  I can honestly say that viewing this movie could actually save lives in the "real" world in which we live.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Wow!

In it Neeson plays a man who use to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and finds himself embroiled in trying to find his teenaged daugher who has been kidnapped by maniacs working for an Albanian sex slave operation in France.<br /><br /> The film is not for the weak: the torture scenes are violent, graphic, nail-biting, and extremely hair-raising which is why some of the scenes in the original version had to be cut in order for the film to receive a PG-13 rating. Those scenes that were cut are available on this two disc edition.<br /><br /> "Taken" is a well-acted, fast-paced movie that will not only please fans of actions movies, but fans of Liam Neeson; it's nice to see he finally has a huge hit on his hands. "Taken" took in over $222,000,000 at the worldwide boxoffice on a $19,000,000 budget with DVD sales raking in more millions.<br /><br /> In June of 2010 Neeson announced that he is in talks to do a sequel to "Taken".</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>My favorite Clint Eastwood line from all of his movies was from the film "Absolute Power" when he says "when you went after my little girl, well that was completely unacceptable"  Every daddy of a daughter, I think can relate that there is nothing that would be off limits in getting your daughter out of similar circumstances as portrayed in the film. Most of us would lack the skills and resources to pull off the heroics, but not the resolve.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is  still a great action hero, my wife and I have loved him since we first watched "Rob Roy" many years ago, and he is flawless here as a retired agent who wants nothing as bad as having a relationship with his daughter before it's too late.<br /><br />"I was a preventer."<br />"What what did you prevent?"<br />"I prevented bad things from happening"<br /><br />This is a great action movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A9NCQGVV5W8N0.html">A9NCQGVV5W8N0</a><br/><p>This is strictly by the numbers, and is as clich&eacute;d as all hell, but it's still extremely enjoyable nonetheless. It's also about three different films in one, as it starts off in the vein of paranoiac American "Europe is a hotbed of evil and degradation" thrillers like Roman Polanski's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305133476">Frantic</a> and Eli Roth's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>, then becomes a gritty examination of sex trafficking in Paris, before entering decidedly Bondesque territory for a denouement which sees the protagonist cutting a swathe of destruction through an embassy party wearing a dinner jacket. What raises it above the level of your standard brainless action fare is Liam Neeson's turn as a character who is absolutely relentless, completely unapologetic and refreshingly lacking in political correctness in the way that he goes about tracking down and eradicating the Albanian gangster clich&eacute;s that have abducted his daughter. I actually turned to the other half towards the end and informed her that early nineties dancemeisters, 'Pop Will Eat Itself' had written the soundtrack for this film in the form of a song entitled "Get The Girl And Kill The Bad Guy". I loved it because it's exactly the kind of nasty, brutal, unreconstructed, fascistic, old-school revenge fantasy that Hollywood has been promising us for years, but has been too frightened too actually deliver - the awful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U97I">Death Sentence (Unrated Edition)</a> being the most recent catastrophic misfire which comes to mind. By its very nature, the revenge thriller is not a politically correct genre and it's a mistake to try and make it one. 'Taken' is nasty, it's violent, it's actually quite racist when you think about it, and it's also completely enjoyable. Complete tosh, but tosh done correctly for once, and as someone who has grown increasingly sick of seeing action movies watered down for a PG-13 audiences, I say god bless every uncompromising, bone-snapping R-rated minute of it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>I find it amazing that you have to scroll through so many pages here to find anyone who is reviewing the blu ray disc and when they do, they just say that it was exciting and that they liked it.  Sorry, that is not a review. Once again, with Amazon's now downloadable viewing there is no separation of reviews of the downloaded versions, which are highly compressed, the standard def versions, and the blu ray versions.  Amazon would do us all a huge service by separating these 3 different formats of viewing.<br /><br />I don't give plot summaries or my opinions of the movies, the acting or any of that nonsense. If I didn't initially like a movie, I certainly wouldn't bother to buy it.  I will admit that when I first saw the film, my only complaint was that it was too short.<br /><br />Thus, this review focuses, as do all my reviews, only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.<br /><br />The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and makes good use of the front sound stage with appropriate panning across the screen.  Not a whole lot for the rear channels in terms of discreet channeling as they are mostly used for ambient sound but not necessarily discreet foley effects.  There are many scenes where the rears could easily have been used for such but this is typical of theatrical releases who are stingy with their audio budgets.  Even an old movie like 'Air Force One' made great use of the rear channels so ' Taken' certainly could have.<br /><br />The video transfer is good.  Not great.  No grain, artifacts or any image issues and there are details in the shadows.  However, the overall color images are rather soft when, in many places, they really could and should have stood out more.  This is the reason why I lowered the great pop corn movie from 5 to 4 stars.  I don't believe that, if you already have the 2 disc version on Standard Def DVDs, that you will notice a truly significant enhancement between the two.  Not much, if any remastering was done here other than reformatting the film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />Lots of wasted space on the blu ray with trailers for other movies and not much else other than the usual commentaries that can be found on the SD DVDs.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of help.

Considering the success of 24, suffice it to say that I mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Basically, the plot of this film centers on Liam Neeson's character, who is estranged from his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) and really has no way back into her life anymore.  Though tenuous about her decision to travel to Europe for a summer with a friend, he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them, so he allows it.  Of course, her and the friend are immediately targeted by European slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment, sending Neeson into action to try and get them back.  The kicker, though, is that "Neeson", now retired, was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of "CTU" of "24" fame (at least that is how it is described).  As a result, Neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughter's abductors for the remainder of the movie.<br /><br />What really separates this movie from other action fare, though, is the character development at the very beginning.  Where other pure action films (Eagle Eye comes to mind) spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters, the entire first 30 minutes (out of only 90 total) of "Taken" really fleshes out the father-daughter relationship.  This makes you the viewer root even harder for Neeson cause when his daughter is taken.<br /><br />The acting is also very solid, albeit in a subdued fashion (at least from Neeson).  Whereas Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer emotes wildly and often, Neeson's take on "government agent" is much more simmeringly intense.  We understand how badly he wants his daughter back, but he doesn't have to pitch a fit to convince us.  Also, Grace ("Shannon" of LOST fame) transitions from well from small to big screen, as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the film.<br /><br />Thus, while this film is not epic in any sense of the word (hence the four-star rating), it is still very entertaining in a straight-forward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should: developing characters, creating emotional attachments, and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward.  If you are a fan of the "thriller" genre, please check this movie out...it may not shoot straight to the top of your "favorite movies" list, but you will also likely not be disappointed, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson proves he can play the action hero as well s anyone in this action thriller.he plays the father of a 17year old who has been kidnapped while in Paris.with very little to go on,he races against time to find her kidnappers and save her.oh,and he has a very particular set of skills.in short,they messed with the wrong guy.what follows are some very intense fight scenes,which are very well choreographed.but this is not just an action movie.there are certainly some dramatic moments and the movie is tinged with sadness,as some of the events in the movie mirror reality.of course being a Hollywood movie,you pretty much know how it will end,although it didn't end completely the way i thought it would.all in all, a very entertaining movie,that also makes you think.for me,Taken is a 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>I wouldn't advise watching this movie just before you go to bed; it is a visually disturbing movie. Yes, there is a lot of exciting action, great chases, one on foot, and plenty of the bad guys getting what they deserve. That, for me, was not disturbing. I did watch the unrated version of the movie, not the theatrical version; it may be that some of the scenes which I found most disturbing are not in the theatrical release.<br /><br />The disturbing part to me was the picture of young people, especially young women, taking chances that can ruin their lives. The old saying that teenagers had better do what they're going to do while they're teenagers and still know everything seems to fit this movie all too well.<br /><br />A number of scenes showing the depravity of the slave trade are very saddening. Young women, imprisoned as prostitutes and chattel, graphically show the dangers that can lurk in societies today.<br /><br />One lasting impression is that there are too many really evil people out there today. I'm afraid that too many Americans have no notion of how bad things can sometimes get; they seem to believe that bad things only happen to someone else.<br /><br />I may watch the theatrical release later and see which scenes were deleted. The scenes in the unrated version made a convincing case for all of the actions taken by the father as he attempted to rescue his daughter.<br /><br />One of a number of issues that were glossed over was the lasting psychological impact of the experience on the daughter even after her rescue; she would never be the same again and would, I suspect, require extensive counseling to have any hope of resuming a normal life. Post traumatic stress disorder would be as much a problem for her as for any soldier; it could take years for the negative effects of this experience to be overcome. In that regard, the ending was much too much Hollywood Pollyannaism.<br /><br />If you can set aside your reason and just take the movie for what it is, it offers a fast paced, action packed movie that won't let you go; at 91 minutes it's relatively short and is over rather quickly. With the caveats mentioned above I can recommend this as an exciting action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Since this film is approaching 3 years of age, there is no hesitation on my part to reveal spoilers--because you have to hear about all these, if you haven't seen this movie, in order to really make you want to see it. If you've seen it, maybe I can convince you how much better this film is than you already think it is!<br /><br />The best thing about this film is that it was shown on the heels of the awful, overrated "Casino Royale". This film has Liam Neeson at his level best, and I wondered after watching it why Neeson wasn't picked to be the next James Bond. He sure delivers in this film. Other than looking a bit thin and haggard, Neeson is brilliant.<br /><br />Story: it is what all film ought to be, clean, solid goal-oriented, no distractions. It's essentially a remake of Steven Segal's horrible 2003 offering "Belly of the Beast"--an ex-CIA operative finds his darling daughter has been kidnapped by a prostitution ring, while on a trip to Paris. Same as Beast, except no Segal, no silly mysticism and no Thailand. I loved that this film was pure Neeson.<br /><br />In "Taken", Neeson SHINES. This man starts out the film as a poor schlmiel, divorced from his wife, competing with his wife's powerfully wealthy new husband--a man who is stealing the daughter's attention and affection. The way Neeson is left standing around makes one ache for him. His deep love for his daughter transcends all boundaries and anyone with a daughter will resonate. Neeson has a common-man tenderness and sincerity about him that few actors have.<br /><br />It is not immediately apparent that he was ever anyone of significance: he dresses like Dustin Hoffman. He seems to slouch; no Indiana Jones bravado for him. He can't, because no one is supposed to know exactly what he did before he retired. We get a few clues at first when he gathers with pals for a barbecue. Later he tells his inquisitive daughter, rather warily, "I was gone so much because I worked for the government."<br /><br />But when he vows to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter, Neeson and this film are all business--the best kind of business. Neeson is relentless and unstoppable. He shows what CIA and Langley AFB training is really about: when he shoots, he shoots to kill and does it with one bullet. No rookie aerosol hails of bullets; one target, one bullet, as training dictates.<br /><br />The kills are immediate and thorough, so no one springs up later to try another pot-shot at him. He wastes no resources, and since his time is never wasted, the viewer's time isn't wasted. Neeson is playing American, so I'd like to add that his accent, pure and basic, never slips once.<br /><br />Neeson is believable because the film is believable. "Taken" is well acted, well written and, yes, it got a bit silly (it strove for a PG-13 rating so it occasionally approaches an almost Disney-esque air). I recall it was hyped somewhat, then dropped dead. Can't imagine why, since '08 was a rather distracted, uneven year for film releases, much like the following year was.<br /><br />This film is terrific because it is for the action fan and faint-hearted alike: Neeson does no idiotic stunts, he flows as if he's dancing, and there is little in the way of graphic garbage so common today (except for the harrowing phone call with his daughter while she's being abducted, and of course the scene in which he tortures a man for information, CIA style--that was a political statement and not a gruesome exercize...hardly graphic nonsense).<br /><br />The kills are so very realistic, I had to point it out to my wife who merely said, "God, that was fast!" It is like it happens for agents in real life, I was able to use those scenes as examples for my wife in case she ever has to defend herself (God forbid), and that is why I highly recommend this film as a shining example of the U.S. goverment agent/CIA/spy-on-a-spree genre. It is all quality, all action, and an unforeseen yet perfect Neeson vehicle.<br /><br />Even if Neeson got nothing out of it, buy it and cherish it as the best you'll ever see in retired-agent's-child-is-kidnapped. Neeson is better than Segal and Daniel Craig any day, in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2008's extremely violent thriller "Taken" features Liam Neeson as Brian Mills, a retired spy whose daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by white slavers from her apartment in Paris.<br /><br />Mills puts the skill set of his former employment to work.  He is prepared to rescue his daughter by any means necessary.  What follows is a thrill ride across Paris, through streets, cellars, apartments, offices and bridges, as Mills methodically and ruthlessly wrings information from various felons and follows the clues to a final showdown on a barge in the Seine River.<br /><br />The action is fast, furious, and fatal, as Mills leaves a trail of corpses behind him.  The good news is that they all had it coming.  The bad news is the PG-13 rating should be taken seriously.  The short running time (90 minutes) and almost continuous action cover up some gapping plot holes, while leaving little room for moral ambiguity.  "Taken" is highly recommended to those fans of action movies who still miss "Dirty Harry."</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>4 of 5 stars for the action movie Taken and shout-out for Liam Neeson in the lead role. Neeson plays a retired spy, Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter. The daughter and her girlfriend leave on a trip across Europe against the better judgement of her dad (Neeson). They barely land in Paris when they are kidnapped by slave traders. With few clues, Daddy goes to Paris to recover his daughter. Simple plot idea, extremely well executed (hence my shout-out to Neeson). This is a violent and tough movie; Neeson's body count is around 50 and most with graphic and quick kills. Don't shoot at him, you'll only make him mad! Impressive how he follows from clue to clue. If you don't mind the violence and the graphic underworld plot, it is a great movie. I do recommend it and will watch it again in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson does an unexpected about face from his usual touchy feely roles and makes an inhuman turn for the best in this ultraviolent yet strangely touching action film.<br /><br />Brian Mills is an ex-CIA agent/ex-Marine/ex everything, I guess, who has spent most of his life doing very undercover dangerous James Bond things.  At the beginning we see a lonely man who, to all outward appearances, seems very gentle and attempting to make up for lost time with his gorgeous daughter, Kim.  Having spent his life dealing with dangerous people and preventing "bad things" (where was Brian Mills on before 9/11? Couldn't a guy like this grab Osama Bin Laden in five seconds?)<br /><br />Anyway, against his advice, his daughter goes to Paris with a few of her friends.  Brian is concerned because he is aware that there are people who are into selling young girls into a slave trade for high class criminals.  And, of course, his daughter gets kidnapped.<br /><br />Neeson does a superb job of turning within the course of about fifteen seconds from a concerned father into a walking, barking, unstoppable killing machine.  The reason the film is believable is because of Neeson's blank facial expression, his ability to switch off his emotions in a deadly second, and his ruthlessness.  Whoever trained the actor in whatever martial art/self defense skills did a good job.  And Mills is no angel.  There are scenes in which he way too far.  There is nothing sentimental about it.  He wants his daughter and nothing going to stop him unless it's a very well placed bullet.<br /><br />Though some of this might strike the viewer as a bit far fetched, it is Liam Neeson's performance that makes it worth watching.  A riveting, chilling movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Great storyline and a unique set of skills that should make a kidnapper worry.

Now he has a quiet existence and works moonlighting as a part time body guard for a pop stars. His daughter goes to Paris with a friend and within hours of arriving is kidnapped by Albanian pimps who sell young girls in to the skin trade, and Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she completely disappears forever. This springs him in to action and where the action starts. Many action scenes and bodies later, you have a satisfying conclusion. This movie ended quite accidentally on my DVD queue because I generally steer away from movies about the skin trade and terrorism, two genres I feel have been killed mindlessly. I watched this movie and was pleasantly entertained. Okay, this is not the most fantastic storytelling but the 96 minute running time passed quickly for me. Liam Neeson finally delivers a audience friendly movie which is instantly derided by critics. They would rather have you make mindless drivel which is only understood by them than a movie that endears you to the masses. If your movie becomes a success, they will then start accusing you of selling out. I think this movie will be enjoyed by all; you will be taken not by the script but by the treatment. 3 1/2 stars 111909</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Neeson is excellent as a government operative who is divorced and is still trying to make amends to his teenage daughter for not being there for her during many of her formative years.  He is very protective for her because of his training Thus he is extremely adverse to his daughter going with a friend to Paris for a vacation.<br /><br />At first he totally refuses to give her permission but is pressure by both his daughter and ex-wife to sign the permission slip.  Of course the actual plans that the daughter has once she gets there is different.  She and her girlfriend let a stranger ride with them in a cab from the airport and it leads to a bunch of men breaking into the apartment where she is staying.<br /><br />The daughter manages to call her father as the men break in and her tells her what is going to happen but if she follows his instructions, he will hopefully be able to find her.  The men take both girls and one actually taunts Neeson on the phone.  Neeson promises the attacker that he will track him down and kill him.<br /><br />Neeson then dons a "Jason Bourne" personna and goes to Paris to find his daughter.  He is in a desperate race against the clock because that he is told that if he doesn't find her in 96 hours, it will be impossible to ever locate her.<br /><br />Great action scenes and Neeson is relentless in his chase.  Though this movie has a lot of predictability it is still fun and Neeson does a good job playing his part.

"Taken" is trash cinema in the best sense.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the film's premise was pitched.  Ex-CIA operative trying to rescue his comely teenage daughter in Paris after she's kidnapped by an Albabian white slavery ring.  Probably the honchoes listening to the spiel were sold at mid-sentence.  What makes the film palatable is the prescence of Liam Neeson.  Neeson does his "Schindler's List" best to elevate this project above it's pulp roots.  Neeson and the film's makers keep you in their grip from start to finish.  After it's over though you realize that what you've seen is preposterous.

Retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) hopes to restore his relationship with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and reluctantly agrees to let her travel to France with a friend. When Kim and her friend are kidnapped by slave runners, Bryan must resort to his special skills to scour the French underworld before she disappears forever. Though not a groundbreaking movie, "Taken" is an amusing action-packed thriller from director Pierre Morel (The Transporter) and producer Luc Besson (The Fifth Element). It was released in France in February of 2008 but was released in the United States in January of 2009. With $145 million in the North American box-office, it was one of the first successful films of 2009. The story is straight forward with a few twists and character clich&eacute;s. Neeson's performance further drives the drama and the action sequences are a total blast.<br /><br />Despite a few early lackluster releases, 20th Century Fox has certainly deliver some fine looking Blu-Ray titles and "Taken" 2-disc Extended Cut is no exception. Both the 91-minute theatrical cut and the 93-minute unrated cut are presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. With a splendid level of detail and rich lifelike colors, the picture quality is indeed impressive. Its DTS-HD audio offers top quality clarity, dynamic surround effects and some good bass. Its special features include two audio commentary tracks by the film's director and crew, the "Black Ops Field Manual" option that allows viewers to follow the progress of the story, footage of the film's premier and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Le Making of & Inside Action: Side By Side Comparisons). Overall, "Taken" 2-disc Extended Cut scores a "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the non-nonsense hero of Luc Besson-produced "Taken," is someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Commando" without one-liners. He is a gentle father (and retired special agent) who turns into an invincible war machine that no one can stop. After his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped in the Paris apartment, he flies to France and starts his "investigation" on his own.<br /><br />Using the knowledge and skills he had learned in his former career, he chases every suspicious guy and corners him. To save his daughter, he runs and drives in the Paris streets (sometimes in the wrong side of the road); he beats up and shoots anyone who stands in his way. He's got only 96 hours before it is too late, and as I said before, this Jack Bauer-like former spy is played by Liam Neeson.<br /><br />The 55-year-old Oscar-nominee veteran Liam Neeson, whose previous roles include Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler, is cast against type as the star of this tense action film. He is surprisingly convincing as a vengeful retired agent trying to rescue his daughter. Well, maybe this is not surprising because Liam Neeson is no stranger to action movies, previously seen in such films as "Darkman" "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" and "Batman Begins." He has worked with Sam Raimi, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, and this is a quite impressive list.<br /><br />"Taken" wisely focuses on Liam Neeson's character. His charisma grabs your attention immediately, and with his riveting performances, some nice fights and the slick direction from Pierre Morel ("District B13") the film is never boring. Supporting actors, however, are unmemorable or just annoying. Famke Janssen as Kim's mother and Bryan's separated wife only stands and looks worried before the camera. Maggie Grace ("LOST") plays the spoiled daughter Kim, who is so irritating.<br /><br />As far as the major plot holes go, few films can beat "Taken" (the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, a writing team for three "Transporter" films). This is a guilty pleasure you can enjoy only by suspending your disbelief. (Some characters seem to believe Bryan, who doesn't even speak a single French word, is a French police detective.) "Taken" is 90 minutes of fast-paced, unapologetic escapism and as such it delivers.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Bryan Mills is a retired CIA operative whose seventeen-year-old daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of Albanian white-slave traffickers the moment she arrives in Paris.  Instantly, Mills launches into secret agent mode, utilizing all the tricks-of-the-trade he picked up during his years in the service to single-handedly track down his daughter and bring her abductors to justice.  Clearly, James Bond has nothing on this guy.<br /><br />As action thrillers go, "Taken" is considerably less plausible than most (which is saying a great deal), filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity, but director Pierre Morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping - which, let`s face it, is all one really asks for from a high-octane popcorn movie such as this one.<br /><br />To make the movie more "relatable" for the audience, screenwriters Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which Mills has quit his job and moved to California so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter, only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection.  But all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and - good news for action fans - once the movie hits the throttle, it never lets up.<br /><br />The European tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film - and, seriously, all of this just to get some rich guys laid?  Don`t they have just regular old call-girls in Paris anymore? - but the commercial success of the movie has been nothing less than a godsend for Liam Neeson's career and pocketbook.<br /><br />With "Taken," a new action hero is born.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>If there were EVER a film for dads, this is it! Especially for dads with daughters! The action is continuous without being overbearing and it's got some great dialogue ... for an action movie.<br /><br />For those who don't know, "Taken" is about a ex-CIA agent who has retired to spend more time with his teenage daughter. When his ex-wife and daughter convince him to let her go to Paris, he's wary of it, still the usual overprotective dad, but agrees to let her go. Of course, she gets kidnapped and he has to go find her and save her. Simple plot, lots of action, lots of cool, revenge-driven dialogue, and one of my favorite actors Liam Neeson.<br /><br />THIS is the Father's Day gift that any dad (especially for ones with daughters as I can speak from experience) would appreciate. My only problem with the story is the very ending. I can't really say too much without giving it away, but all this stuff happens and then at the very end, SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT: Neeson and his daughter carry on almost as if the trauma never happened. It just seemed a little rushed and unrealistic to me, but, then again, it is a movie. And a damn good entertaining one at that!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Liam Neesen is terrific as a retired agent who becomes a one-man wrecking crew when his daughter is snatched.

A keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This was much better than I expected it to be. Liam Neeson is a teriffic actor of that there is no doubt, but my fear was that this would just be another formula action movie, which would give the makers an excuse to have a lot of explosions and car chases.<br /><br />In fact its a decent thriller, which at around an hour and a half doesn't outstay its welcome. The first half of the movie is surprisingly well controlled, giving you a chance to both sympathise and get frustrated with Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) already difficult relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />The movie changes up a gear at the halfway point and for me this doesn't quite work. The plot gets less and less beliveable and our hero avoids thousands of rounds bullits. However, its still better than a lot of formula actions movies. This is mainly thanks to Liam Neesons fine acting (as always) and the good use of locations in France. Its always great to see a film shot outside of the U.S.<br /><br />Overall then if you suspend belief this is a fine action movie. Its not in the same class as the first Bourne film, but there are many many worse films out there.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson as "Bryan Mills," reminded me of Denzel Washington's role in "Man On Fire."  In that film, Washington played a relentless-and-brutal bodyguard who did what he had to do to get kidnapped Dakota Fanning back to her parents.  Here, Neeson does the same to get his daughter "Kim" back from kidnappers/sex trade slimeballs.  An ex-professional killer in retirement, "Bryan" travels to Paris and shows the bad guys who they're messing with!  Neeson is very good in here.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a little far-fetched but it's a fun hour-and-a-half that's guaranteed to entertain and a no-nonsense, shoot-first film that always satisfies. It also looks good on Blu-Ray. Beware though: this is another "shaky" hand-held camera deal on the action scenes, which can be tough on your eyes at times.<br /><br />One last thing: it's not "non-stop action" as some have said. This movie starts slowly and builds up. It's the last half hour that's non-stop violence, not the whole film.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's very suspenseful. The action is non-stop. The emotion is raw.<br /><br />The dialogues between  Bryan Mills and his wife are heart-wrenching and bitter even though they did not talk with each other much. Most of the times, his wife blamed him of neglecting his family. He did not answer to these words but I saw pain on his face.<br /><br />The weakness of this movie is it has big logical holes. For example, in one of the scenes, Bryan was handcuffed to a pipe. Yet he somehow, swiftly and miraculously disengaged from the pipe and killed the bad guys.<br /><br />Overall, it's rivetingly entertaining. It's the first good movie I've seen in 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>This title won me over with one of the best guilty pleasures I have encountered on a Blu - and it was an awesome film.<br /><br />I have read a plethora of reviews covering the story, and honestly it is simple enough in that of a dad looking to rescue his kidnapped daughter. The quality of the Blu had loads of opportunity to fail with all of the close quarter hand to hand and nighttime action, but they did quite well. There is some hints of grain here and there but it seemed relevant to the scene. Otherwise - a nice transfer. The DTS was superb and bolstered Liam's resounding voice properly. The outer channels did not get used as much as I had hoped, but fortunately they did not score this film where voices and action get drowned out.<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff. I watched the extended version (1:33:25 vs. 1:30:55 on the rated) and turned on the Black Ops option. Two things occur here: 1. A semi-decent trivia track that provides some relevant facts regarding human trafficking and 2. A body count meter, time remaining watch (the 96 hour window) and a miles traveled listing. I loved it. This option finally answered those nagging questions (in an action movie like this) of did that bad guy really die or not, or is he coming back to wreak havoc. For instance, when a car crashes did it really kill every bad guy in the back seat or are they coming back in the next scene - killed meter clicks up 2 spots - answer is no. Spoiler: final count 33 dead, 13 wounded, 12K miles traveled in exactly 96 hours. The only drawback is it removed the subtitles to play the tracks, so you lose all of the French conversation translations. Most of the rated/unrated version differences are towards the latter half of the film (violent half) as at 41 minutes there was only a nine second variance.<br /><br />2 of the commentary tracks are exclusive to the unrated, the side by side documentary provides comparison on the actual shooting stock to the final film cut, a 20 minute making-of provides some nice insight, but then I was hit with a rare emotional moment on a BD supplement. There was a nice film premiere documentary with interviews of cast and crew on the carpet, but most noticeably some very touching footage of Natasha and Liam. Some brief but genuine moments that speak for themselves.<br /><br />An incredibly worthwhile Blu to own, and I rank Liam's performance as a believable action star right at the top.</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson is a government retiree who has devoted his life to his work. His ex-wife has since devoted herself to a new husband, and now Neeson attempts to reconnect to his teenage daughter. We get a glimpse of his prior life when former colleagues coax him into a security detail for protecting a pop star. With cat-like reflexes and skill he quickly dispatches an attacker and gets his star to safety.<br /><br />Cynical about the world he worked in, Neeson is pressured by his daughter and ex to allow the girl to take a chaperone-free trip to the City of Lights. He is torn between his fear for his daughter's safety and losing a relationship with her by saying no.<br /><br />The trip soon turns ugly when her daughter sees her friend being abducted from another room. She knows she is next and quickly calls her father on the cell phone he gave her. When the abductors find her she leaves the cell phone on and it is picked up by the abductor. The father offers a carrot and a stick. If they leave his daughter alone, he will forget their crime, otherwise he will find them and kill them. The abductor is foolish enough to say, "good luck!" before he hangs up.<br /><br />When he arrives in Paris, the action really begins and there is a spike in metropolitan crime with what he does and what he learns.  A father is out to rescue his daughter and there is no time to spare. It leaves him no room for subtlety or diplomatic courtesies. The dialogue is intelligent and fast-paced, and Neeson is always convincing in whatever role he plays. In fact, you even forget the others except for the French inspector.<br /><br />If you like to see death by Kleenex, where one person dies slowly over the course of the script, this is probably not your cup of tea. "La Chocolat" it is not. However, if you like to see a lot of strangers die violently throughout the movie than hold on to your black belt, because this is right up your alley.<br /><br />"Taken" should be borrowed or bought and watched. I've even watched it twice.<br /><br />Take some time for "Taken."</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>While watching "Taken" I was reminded of several other "Lost Child" films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Commando." Specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like. Liam Neeson outshines Arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayal.<br /><br />The film's plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience. I could go on and on talking about Neeson but I want to say a few things about this movie. Following path of revenge Besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity. It doesn't present nothing new, but the way the whole movie was filmed, with amazing action scenes (some of them brutal like electricity torture) and great actor in main role, you gotta' be satisfied with final outcome. The film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but Neeson's charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segments.<br /><br />And yes, you know that he's going to save everyone but then again Seagal also saves everyone but 95% of his movies are sort of dense. That is the magic of this movie cause Besson didn't present anything new. You just need to have passable script, good, young director, be European and have good actor in main role. All I can say is that you will still be taken by Liam Neeson!</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Taken is a very well paced thriller about an ex-CIA field agent who shoots his way through Paris looking for his kidnapped daughter.

In recent years the action genre has really gone downhill. And even action flicks made outside of Hollywood feel as if they were made by Hollywood. Taken does sort of feel like that at times, but this is the type of movie Hollywood once made when the produced quality movies.<br /><br />Taken isn't the most original movie ever made and you've seen variations of the plot done many, many times and maybe it's just me, but Taken also sort of had a feel of the TV series 24 in tone and in some of the scenes and in the main character. As much as it is an action movie Taken is also a suspense flick and both these elements work very well.<br /><br />The screenplay by Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen was well written, but not without its flaws. The lead character Bryan Mills played by Liam Neeson is a former CIA agent and due to that he has connections that allow him to track down the people who abducted his daughter, but the problem I had is things come a little too easy. Bryan gets a little too much done too easy and certain aspects of the plot aren't developed enough, but despite that Besson and Kamen do a solid job. Bryan Mills is the main character and really the only character that truly matters.<br /><br />And Besson and Kamen do a bang up job with the character. He's well developed and is a take no prisoners kick butt character. The rest of the characters are just sort of there and not given a whole lot to do, but in no way does this hurt the movie. Luc Besson has made some movies under Hollywood, but most of his flicks are French productions, but clearly geared at American audiences, but his movies are just a whole lot of fun. They might have a Hollywood feel, but they work better than most of the junk coming out of Hollywood these days. Robert Mark Kamen best known for the first three Karate Kid movies often works with Besson and both these guys work very well together. In general you may not get a cinematic masterpiece, but you do get your money's worth and Taken is by far their best work to date as writing partners (and possibly even on their own).<br /><br />Director Pierre Morel does a solid job even if sort of by the books. The pacing is solid and early on it moves slowly, but steady and is interesting and none of the scenes feel like fillers. The action sequences are highly enjoyable even if they lack some originality. Quite a few times I couldn't help, but think of 24, which I suppose is more due to the script, but some of the scenes feel like something done on 24. But despite some lack of originality, Morel does an excellent job and shows some potential as a filmmaker. Taken is well made and moves at a very nice pace and always remains interesting. Even if the action scenes lack originality at times they are again highly enjoyable and there are some scenes that are highly suspenseful. Also don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off. A lot has changed in cinema and movies that would once be R-rated get away<br /><br />What really elevates Taken is the performance by Liam Neeson; Neeson is one of the most talented actors of his generation and is one of the few actors that can pull off any role and do it great. Here as Bryan Mills he delivers one of the best if not the best performance of his career and is without a doubt one of my personal favorite performances of 2008. Anytime I write a review for an action flick I always mention how the action stars out there now really leave a lot to be desired. Gone are the Stallone's and McQueen's of the action genre. Liam Neeson though makes for the perfect action star; he has the no nonsense persona done perfectly and is also a great actor. While there are many actors who have done action flicks and gave excellent performances most of the time it isn't about the actual performance, but Neeson plays the tough guy role perfectly and also delivers one hell of a performance.<br /><br />Maggie Grace as Kim gives a slightly awkward performance; I haven't seen a lot of her work outside of The Fog, which was simply a put a pathetic waste of time, but I thought Maggie did well with horrible material and showed some potential. At the time this movie was made I guess she was about 23 maybe and she just didn't fit playing a 17-year old girl and actually the character comes off a lot younger than 17. It's very common for actors in their mid 20s and in some cases late 20s too play teenagers and some pull it off and some don't. Maggie Grace doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but slightly awkward. Again she wasn't bad, but just didn't fit the age of the character and came across younger than 17, but some of that is more on the writing and directing, but again it was just awkward.<br /><br />Famke Janssen, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin are solid in small, but vital roles and Katie Cassidy was good, but not given a whole lot to do. All the performances are mostly solid, but like I stated before its Liam Neeson that takes center stage here and really elevates Taken. Without Neeson, Taken would have been an enjoyable flick, but Neeson takes the material and makes far more out of it.<br /><br />Overall Taken is a solid movie that just slightly falls short of being brilliance, but when all is said and done the movie works on pretty much every level and again I have to state it's Neeson that really elevates the movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is quite solid in terms of picture and sound; the action sequences sound amazing and the picture is sharp. I haven't gone through all the extras yet, but they all seem to be solid.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson plays the lean hard guy surprisingly well in this efficient if brutal thriller.<br />He is divorced and has given up his career as a government agent of some description, to be near his 17 year old daughter, who lives with his ex-wife and her new rich husband.<br />When she is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, all his expertise kicks in to get her back.  And really, that is about it - in an era of sophisticated thrillers with labyrinthine plots, the narrative here seems very simple and told in straightforward linear fashion, with few if any surprises.<br />And yet, it works - because it is lean and fast - the action is brutal and frenetic in close up Bourne style, and once events kick off it really does not let up until the unsurprising conclusion.  Neeson is lithe and believable as a trained killing machine, giving the film a huge boost of credibility.<br />There is it has to be said a mean streak in Neeson's character at odds with the family man, as he mercilessly kills off any and everything that gets in his way.  In fact, it becomes almost unpleasant that the film is purporting an American has a right to do whatever he likes in Europe to protect `his own', including torture, on the spot assassinations, and untold collateral damage.<br />However, watched as a straight action flick, this is entertaining enough, as long as you have a strong stomach for the unpleasant underbelly of Paris dying as faces are smashed into hard objects, bullets shatter limbs, and others die in... well, let's say shocking ways.  It's like an urban Rambo invented for a new generation!</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Taken" defies the viewer's credulity as Liam Neeson dispatches scores of the Albanian Mafia in the quest for his kidnapped daughter. He's a tech-savvy, hand-to-hand fighting expert trained in security work by the U.S. government. It's a violent movie with some vicious, gory moments. If some U.S. security experts operate the way this guy does, we are in deep trouble.<br /> The movie is well-made, well-acted, and it grabbed me because I'm a sucker for clever detection and suspenseful plots. The motivation behind this kidnapping plot is far-fetched, but don't let that stop you. The car chase scenes are well-executed even if they are incredible. The movie's beginning will get your attention. Early on there's an exciting scene with Liam saving a pop singer from harm as a part-time security man.<br /> At times Neeson seems to have super-human powers, a super-hero impervious to bullets. Why are the bad guys after firing off fusillades of firepower unable to hit their target? Bad aim? Neeson's car is riddled with countless bullet holes, yet he emerges unscathed. He's Superman without the tights.<br /> I think you'll get carried along even though it's hectic, bloody and kind of goofy. The Paris background is absorbing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor who draws you into the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is thoroughly out of touch with his 17 year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).

He is very much in touch with the too-real world of crime being a retired 'fixer' for an undisclosed US government agency.<br /><br />Bryan gives Kim grief when she wants to spend vacation in Paris with an older friend.  He signs her parental permission to go out of country with a long set of stipulations:<br /><br />1. call when she's landed<br />2. call every night<br />3. call when she's ready to take off<br /><br />Yet, the minute Kim sets foot on French soil, she's doomed.  She's not there a day before Albanian white slavers kidnap her and her friend.<br /><br />Luckily, Kim's on the phone with her Dad when the kidnappers strike.  She gives Dad who has 'a particular set of skills' enough description that he's headed for Paris to get his daughter back and he's got 96 hours to do it.<br /><br />"Taken" shows you a very hard man with a very human side. Neeson's depiction of Bryan Mills is what makes an otherwise stereotyped impossible odds film very real and compelling. All through the white-knuckle suspense, you are rooting for Mills and Neeson just does not disappoint.<br /><br />"Taken" is not a film for really young kids.  It just barely comes in with a PG-13 rating, but it's definitely a film that teenaged girls could benefit by watching.  And action fans are going to love this one.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2009</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. As the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture.<br /><br />The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite "Special Activities Division" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, tell you everything you have to know: "I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you." The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.<br /><br />Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clich&eacute;s while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately want to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>"They kidnapped my daughter!" I can't remember how many action movies start that way, including flicks with Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, and just about anyone else you could name. It's one of the most heavily used jumping-off points for getting the story going. So, since the basic premise is so well worn, what really matters is where the movie jumps to.<br /><br />Neeson, with hair color not quite matching the lines in his face, does a great job as the wrong guy to mess with. He pounds his way through the seamy side of Paris with grim inexorability, from its grubby underbelly to the highest ranks of society and authority. As you might expect, the bodies of bad guys stack like cordwood. For all that violence, there's remarkably little visible bloodshed, but one or two moments seemed gratuitous. (Was that 'flesh wound' really necessary?)<br /><br />If you're looking for a macho fantasy of righteous wrath, carried out by an implacable and seemingly indestructible loner, you came to the right place. You'll have to suspend disbelief for a while, but this movie's suspense repays the effort.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters</p></br><a href="../users/A34KBK8ORA5GRV.html">A34KBK8ORA5GRV</a><br/><p>BLU-RAY VERSION IS WORTH BUYING.

COLORS ARE STUNNING AND SOUNDS GREAT.</p></br><a href="../users/A363QRXP83K8ZE.html">A363QRXP83K8ZE</a><br/><p>This movie seems to be a big DVD hit, and for good reason.  Taken is a return to some 1980s-type revenge movie antics, with Liam Neeson fitting into the hero role where we often expect a more musclebound star.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailer...you know where it's going.  Neeson is some kind of ex-CIA operative, a "preventer", whose daughter is kidnapped about 10 seconds after landing in Paris.  Using some spare info she gave him on a long distance mobile phone call, he travels to Paris, and within minutes is cracking heads.  The villains are a band of Albanian kidnappers who grab travelling girls and sell them into prostitution.  Neeson single-handedly takes down a good portion of the crew in the course of this film, wiping folks out with chops to the throat, bullets, and even a makeshift electric chair.<br /><br />The movie is pure audience manipulation, and you'll be rooting for Neeson to bash heads with glee.  The daughter and her airhead friend are helpfully stupid, immediately talking to strangers who work for the kidnappers, Neeson's ex-wife is appropriately awful, and the ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman cliche is amply employed.  The movie is very brisk, has several action set pieces (including at least two car chases filmed like car commercials, of course), and knows that you know it's getting ridiculous but not letting up.  Neeson is very convincing as a calm, collected, demolition man who knows all sorts of random, McGuyver-esque tricks and barely breaks a sweat as he chases cars on foot, takes out a dozen guys in a minute, and breaks all manners of bones and heads, while wrecking parts of Paris, to track down his daughter.<br /><br />The American version was surprisingly rated PG-13, even with Neeson taking out about 30 guys, and with the plot of international prostitute smuggling cheerily explored.  The Extended, Unrated version adds some more gunshots and chops in, and indeed is less jerky since you could tell things were cut to get the softer rating.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.  They'd be crazy not to explore Neeson whooping some other gang-du-jour in a prequel or new episode where his puppy is kidnapped.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>One recent moment of great humor for me was watching 72-year-old Charles Bronson destroy bad guys and outrun automatic weapon fire during the fifth installment of his ever popular "Death Wish" series. That movie, made in 1994, was the end of the line for fans of that particular series. While Charles Bronson apparently wasn't available to play the lead here, "Taken" seems to have, ahem, taken up the mantle from "Death Wish 5" with ridiculous levels of action and heroism.<br /><br />If you've been living in a cave somewhere, the plot of "Taken" is Liam Neeson's 17-year-old daughter goes to France with her teenage friend -- over dad's objections -- and is almost immediately kidnapped. This happens while she's on the phone with dad, a former security expert, who ends up talking to her kidnapper and vowing revenge.<br /><br />Having apparently no financial worries, Neeson flies to Paris, almost immediately finds out who did the kidnapping, finds the guy and chases him to his death on a freeway ramp. This begins a lengthy discourse in ultra-violence and bloodletting rare even for this genre of film. You probably can figure out for yourself without seeing the movie the sequence of events and ending, so I won't bother with them. Suffice it to say the body count is high and the action plentiful.<br /><br />I found myself both involved in this movie and laughing through much of it. There is no indication the filmmakers were trying to create a parody and the leading man certainly does nothing to generate laughs. He is completely serious throughout in the same way the steely-eyed and thoughtless James Bond of Daniel Craig contrasts to the cool, tongue in cheek and sophisticated superagent portrayl of Sean Connery.<br /><br />If you like action, revenge and/or violence, you should watch this film at your earliest opportunity. It's pretty good as these films go with fine production qualities. Neeson's characterization, while not credible because of a flawed script and lack of vision, is compelling nonetheless. You'll probably root for him whether you like the movie or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Taken: 6 out of 10: Taken comes this close to being great. It had an admittedly rocky start with Liam Neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 year-old teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy. (Dude get your own girlfriend... really)<br /><br />Speaking of which; swarthy bad guys, who clearly have never heard of Nancy Grace, are kidnapping Rich American Girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to Arab Sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not.<br /><br />So ex-CIA estranged father Liam Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is 'gone forever' deflowered and then burkaized apparently. 'A Fate Worse than Death' you can almost hear the characters thinking.<br /><br />It's as if Charles Bronson was guest starring in an Ilsa the Wicked Warden film located in George C Scott's Hardcore and the entire enterprise was PG-13. And yet the film still works two thirds through. Liam Neeson is more than fine. He is kicking ass on all cylinders. It's the bad guys that drop the ball.<br /><br />First a rich French guy starts quoting the Godfather. 'It's not personal it's business' For starters the quote isn't even in context. He might as well have told the gun toting Liam Neeson 'may the force be with you' for all the sense it makes. Second of all you can't quote the Godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place. Any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishes.<br /><br />The second slap to the head is an Arab Sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940's Bugs Bunny cartoon. Honestly I don't know where to begin on this silly stereotype. Why is he the film? Why does he have a knife to the white virgin's throat? Who would Oscar Schindler shoot????<br /><br />The last point seems important since the Arab is basically a Juden in a dress. Same large noses, same aversion to pork, same living in ghettos in Europe (Or/and having all the money), same secret organizations paying off French politicians, same affinity to despoiling white Aryan virgins... The more things change the more the stay the same I guess. (They didn't have the Arab cook and eat a baby. I guess they are holding that back for the sequel)<br /><br />Overt French xenophobia aside, Taken is a fun ride for most of the trip. (The dinner with his French policeman friend and Frenchman's wife was a particular highlight) And as I did mention Liam Neeson does kick ass.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>Whew! That's entertainment! "Taken" has to be the most intense, exciting Liam Neeson movie to date! Like Tchaikovsky's music for Swan Lake, this film begins very quietly and continues to smoothly, evenly ramp up a cresendo to absolute ferosity. The energy and suspense of the ending might even leave you breathless. Opening on a child's birthday party, this film opens slowly, delibertly building back story. You get to know Bryan (Neeson), his history as a spy, how he has been affected by the disolusion of his marriage and his estrangement from his daughter. You meet some of the people with whom he used to work and the frienships he's maintained. When his daughter wants to go to a trip to Paris with a friend you understand his reaction - and why he gives in. Everything is nailed down in the first act. No loose ends are left for later. The avantage of this unusual but obviously deliberate approach is that, as the cresendo continues and the action begins, there is nothing in the way. It's a straight line from what's this about to Whoa! I can breathe again. This would be a great action thriller by any measure. But, with Neesom at the top of his craft, he pushes this film into a realm of something else. I hope my thoughts are helpful!

If you were satisfied with the pure straight Balls To The Wall action style that Leon offered, look no further than Taken, with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace! Taken is an action movie that just is pure energy and action from beginning to end.<br /><br />In "Taken", Liam Neeson plays Bryan, an ex-CIA agent who is divorced from his wife, yet still sees his Daughter on a regular basis. His latest thing he's done is protect a repressed pop singer from a violent riot that happens after a concert of hers. Later, he learns that his daughter wants to go to Europe with her friend, and he very reluctantly lets her. Within the very first hour of their arrival in Paris, they are both captured by two people, and Bryan, being the overprotective flake he is, learns that these two people addict the girls they capture to drugs, and eventually, within 96 hours, they become prostitutes in the European Sex Slave Trade. Bryan travels to Paris to save her. He has 96 hours to find her and get her to safety or it's too late!<br /><br />More effective than an energy drink, this movie wastes no time and just gets straight to the point right away. There's lots of great action, and the finale on the boat is a total "WHOA" moment. The only problem I had with this film is that even though I loved it, I had the feeling as if I had seen it before somewhere. Usually, with these types of action films, you've seen one, you've seen it all.<br /><br />But overall this is a great, fist-clenching action thriller, very well made and a great way to spend 90 minutes.

It is also a much better movie. I hated the gore in Hostel. Taken was much more serious. Unfortunately, despite the good message it could have had, it was full of too many impossible situations. But in any case, I am glad I didn't see any of these three movies before going to Europe on my own at the age of 22.<br /><br />The father (the former spy) is concerned about his daughter going to Paris. Understandable. He seemed a little over-protective. But he was totally balanced out by the mother who was completely unconcerned about anything and went so far as to help the daughter lie about her plans! "She just couldn't tell him the truth," the poor girl. So museums aren't for everybody. Personally I find sculptures and ancient relics much more interesting than paintings. But I must ask: why would ANYONE travel to a foreign country just to pick up the first hot guy they see and follow a rock band around and go to parties and do other things they could just do at home? Oh yeah, ditzy teenagers.<br /><br />Well, lo and behold, the daughter gets kidnapped, just like the father feared. And she happened to be on the phone with her father at the time. How lucky that he could record the incident! The movie wasn't bad up until this point but shortly afterward all the unbelievable things started to happen. Suspension of disbelief is one thing. But the guy was a former spy, not Superman.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />The father goes to two different places where they are holding girls to turn into sex slaves. Naturally his daughter is not in either. He kills everyone he comes across and never gets one little scratch. Then he starts attacking everyone in his path just to get by them. He shoots this one guy's innocent wife just to get him to talk. He goes on this crazy car chase down the wrong side of the highway. Yeah, risk the lives of another innocent 50 people just to save one. Sorry, that's just wrong. Finally he finds his daughter. She wasn't at the other places because she was one of the special ones who was being sold to an individual buyer. Not just that, but they were "saving the best for last." Gee, what are the odds? Why, exactly? Well, she's American, and speaks English and French. Come on, she wasn't even that pretty. I think he didn't find her until the third place he looked because they needed to make the movie longer. Anyway, they capture the father. But even with his hands tied up, he manages to kill another ten bad guys. Yep, a Superman. So a little more drama, and then they come home, and all of a sudden he has his arm in a cast, even though he killed like 60 people without ever getting a scratch. This could have been a much more interesting story, if only it had been better executed. Or if it had been a superhero movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Taken is definitely one of my favorite movies ever!

You gotta check this out! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Taken" combines elements of the James Bond films with the tale of a father's attempt to build a relationship with a daughter for whom he was never there in her younger years.  It is a fast-paced, exciting action thriller made with style and polish.  If analyzed too closely, its preposterous and coincidental events would strain any reasonable credibility.  But never mind.  "Taken" is a neat, roller-coaster ride of a flick.<br /><br /> Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his CIA job and relocated in order to be closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who lives a life of wealth and privilege with her mother (Famke Janssen) and stepfather (Xander Berkeley).  Bryan reluctantly gives his consent for Kim to spend the summer in Paris, on condition she call him every day.<br /><br />At the Paris airport, Kim falls under the charms of a handsome young Frenchman who is actually part of a ring designed to kidnap young, foreign women for sale to Arab sheiks.  Kim is conveniently on the phone with Bryan when the kidnappers arrive.  Bryan immediately contacts his former friends in the CIA to piece together evidence he has culled from the brief phone call, which he had the foresight to record.<br /><br />The balance of the movie follows Bryan as he attempts to track down Kim in Paris.  During his quest, we see that this quiet, soft-spoken man has an entirely different side; he is a highly trained field agent who knows his way around self-defense, weapons, bribery, interrogation, torture, and forgery.  Working mostly alone, he takes on a bevy of bad guys and scurrilous types as he follows the trail to his daughter, dispensing with a good deal of civility along the way.<br /><br />"Taken" is not a great film, but the kind that draws you in and holds tight for ninety minutes.  Director Pierre Morel has staged some exciting set pieces, a nifty car chase, and explosions, and tossed in a collection of surly thugs and rich, well-dressed villains to spice things up.  We root for Bryan because his use of violence is directed only against those who deserve it.  He is ruthless and doesn't subscribe to the unwritten cinema rule that the good guy must be fair, upright, law-abiding, and moral at every turn no matter how difficult the going gets.  Bryan has no compunctions against knocking off anyone who might have had any part in his daughter's abduction.<br /><br />Neeson is an interesting choice for an action hero.  He looks more like a college professor, and that's the point.  When he springs into action, it is unexpected and his proficiency is startling.  He refers to his former occupation with the government as a "preventer," but it soon becomes clear that his job involved more than polite roundtable diplomacy.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan thinks in nanoseconds, sizing up his immediate surroundings, assessing the degree of danger he's up against, and determining his offense or defense.  We, the viewers, are often surprised by his swift, efficient moves.<br /><br />Michel Abramowicz's photography enhances the film's action sequences and Frederic Thoraval's editing makes scenes shot piece by piece look seamless.  This is especially evident in fight scenes, which are abundant.<br /><br />It's surprising that "Taken" is rated PG-13.  Its violence, sexual content, plot references to drug use, and strong language would seem to justify an R, but strange are the ways of the MPAA.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a retired and divorced ex-spy, who now lives only for his estranged daughter.  The trouble is, while she seems happy enough to see him when he manages to meet her, usually she won't give him the time of day.  She's got all she wants from her enormously wealthy stepfather, and all she wants from her real father is permission to go to Paris.  He's reluctant because, as an ex-spy, I guess, he knows that Europe can be much more dangerous than most people think, especially for a naive young woman.  It turns out he's right, because the moment his daughter arrives with her friend in Paris, she's targeted and kidnapped by sex traffickers.  She manages to get a phone call off to her dad before she's abducted and immediately he's on the case - figures out who they are and plans do do much more than kick butt on his way to saving her.<br /><br />Directed by Pierre Morel, this film has all the marks of its producer and writer, Luc Besson.  Mills is a classic Bessonian hero - who does what he does without remorse, and ruthlessly, but all in the service of good old-fashioned family values.  Luc Besson's heroes tend to be jaded professionals, highly competent at killing but without direction in their lives until they discover that they are meant to save some innocent, to fix some kind of family crisis.  It's a weird mix of visceral violence and sentimentality.  He takes on anyone who gets in his way, anyone who threatens his daughter, anyone who even refuses to help him on his way, and, according to the bizarre but effective Hollywood action film logic that Bresson distills to its essence, it's all okay, it's all morally acceptable, and it all comes out in the end.  The basic principle is that the ends always justifies the means, especially if family is at stake.  In films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O77SRC">Die Hard</a>, there's something else at stake (lots of innocent lives, money, national security), but family is at the heart of it, and in this film that becomes the whole of it, sex trafficking merely becomes the vehicle, the focus for a father's rage.  Of course if you stop to think about it, you have to realize that this guy is a psychopath, and that there are proper channels for a reason, given the number of innocent lives he puts at risk on his quest to stop the bad guys - even though most of the bad guys he actually dispatches are truly bad.  Still, it's strange how easy it is, watching a film like this, to buy all that, and how hard it is not to.  It's a precise, taut, effective, action thriller, and Liam Neeson brings just the right mix of emotional intensity and ruthlessness for the audience to care about him and his emotional quest in spite of themselves.</p></br><a href="../users/A228JH8V9Y700G.html">A228JH8V9Y700G</a><br/><p>An urban legend comes to life!  Young girls (and boys) should watch this as a precautionary tale to anyone who is going to travel abroad or domestic, or when you meet a stranger here or there.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays a semi absentee father who has been working as a highly trained operative on missions around the world.  His time away from home cost him his marriage, now his teenage daughter has asked through his ex wife to take a trip to Europe.  At first she tells him that they will be going to museums and doing touristy things, but he finds just before she leaves that they are really going to travel across Europe to see U2 on the European leg of their tour.  Reluctanly, he agrees (even though he is angry that his daughter and his ex wife lied about it to him) and signs the papers to allow her to travel.  In typical law enforcement manner, Liam demands that his daughter call and let him know where she is at all times.  His daughter and her friend, however, being the stereotypical flaky teenagers they are, say hello to a random stranger they meet at the airport.  He seems friendly enough, offers to share a cab to their destination, then gets their phone number.  Little do they know they are being lured into a trap.  And what a trap it is!  In a panic, his daughter tells her father on the phone that they are being kidnapped.  Liam immediately jumps onto a plane and heads to Paris to track his daughter down from the sex slavery ring she has been lured into.<br /><br />The older I get, the more I see the signifigance of a story like that.  Having traveled abroad and been hassled and hustled by many a suave European man, be cautious.  You never know who is going to take you for a ride.  They may not be pulling you into sex slavery, but they are looking for something else.  And it also happens right here in the US, in your own backyard.  I have several friends in law enforcement, they question everything and anything I do.  "DO you know that man you were talking to over there?" "Yes, I know him from ___".  Paranoid?  It has merit.  A stranger is not just a friend you haven't met, you must be very careful with people with what you do and say, because you simply do not know what others are capable of or what they are after.  As a kid, you do not believe that people will treat you like a piece of meat, but they will.  Just wait until it happens to you.<br /><br />Some words of criticism?  It was a bit hoaky that Liam would actually find his daughter with all the hoops he had to jump through.  Granted, he plays a spy who had access to certain information that the average person would not otherwise.  But, after all, this is entertainment about a not so pleasent subject.<br /><br />Be warned, kids, the world is a crazy and dangerous place.  Be tough, street smart, and keep up a shield.  You will need it.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>This review might seem a little contradictory to anyone who recently read my `Quantum of Solace' review.  These two films are virtually the same movie (not plot wise, but in the idea that they are all action, very little character development) and yet I'm giving this one an extra star.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, as anyone who has read my review of `Quantum of Solace' knows, I expected a lot more out of that film.  In fact, `Taken' delivers exactly what I expected it to, and in some areas even more; yet, while `Quantum of Solace' basically offers me the same thing it fails to live up to the hype spilling over from `Casino Royale'.<br /><br />`Taken' tells of a former spy Bryan Mills who has given up his former life in order to try and regain a relationship with his teenage daughter Kim.  His ex-wife Lenore makes that extremely difficult by constantly degrading him and purposefully keeping him out of reach of his little girl (well, not so little anymore).  When his daughter wishes to go to Paris with a girlfriend Bryan feels it is a mistake, but under immense pressure from Lenore he gives in and allows Kim to go only to regret the decision almost immediately when his daughter is kidnapped in order to be sold into prostitution.  Bryan then embarks on a mission of his own to track down and kill the men responsible for this crime and rescue his daughter.<br /><br />The film is brisk and exciting and always engaging; filled with one action scene after another.  While this is nothing special or extraordinary, it never lets one down.  The thing about `Taken' is that it actually delivers what it promises.  No one going into this is expecting a drawn out character study, and while they know that Bryan is worried about his daughter they are not expecting a father/daughter bonding film.  They are expecting things to blow up, people to get shot and their attention to be kept.<br /><br />`Taken' delivers on all fronts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is a surprisingly adept action star (he should do more films like this one) and he carries this film from beginning to end.  He is intriguing, attractive and heroic; all the qualities needed to make a film like this work.<br /><br />In fact, `Taken' is so good at what it does that I was tempted to give it an A, if not for the last three minutes or so.  Yes, an action film that for once appeared virtually flawless falls to ridiculous pieces right before the final credits begin to roll.  I won't spoil the films ending for you here, but I will say that it is not what happens but how it happens that upset me.  The film had a real sense of gritty realism, even if the majority of the action sequences were highly implausible.  The thing is, the films handling of the emotional reaction to this type of tragedy was beyond ridiculous and almost insulting.<br /><br />Like I said, it's the last three minutes.  Until that point, the film works wonderfully.<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this one despite the ending.  It is one tightly woven action film that delivers the thrills it promises and then some.  Liam is perfectly cast (and I was iffy about that one going in) and Pierre Morel's direction is impeccable.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M6RVUVZOQZLB.html">A3M6RVUVZOQZLB</a><br/><p>I usually enjoy movies like "Taken"--violence with purpose and edge-of-your- seat action--but this time, I was too aware that I was watching a movie, not experiencing the story, and unable to suspend my disbelief. Bottom line: Although the story is plausible (a slaver underworld run by "foreigners" is rife in Paris), I couldn't get past the fact that this was a movie.<br /><br />First, I appreciate that Liam Neesom had the opportunity to play this character. In an interview some years ago Denzel Washington explained his role in "Virtuosity." His son was a little embarrassed that HIS father had not performed in the role of an action figure, thus the film with Russell Crowe. I suspect Neesom had reasons, too, to step out of weighty roles into a vengeance seeker. And he is certainly allowed!<br /><br />However, here are things that took away from my 5-star commitment:<br />1. I'm sorry but Neesom is too old to do all the physical things he did. The viewer should have been given some clue that Neesom was still physically fit, e.g. working out in a gym, playing handball, something. Showing him wax nostalgic on his sofa over emotionally losing his daughter through years of job-related neglect made me think the opposite: uh-oh, couch potato in early retirement. Also, the tricky camera shots usually in a darkened atmosphere made it easy for a body double to do the stunt work in those one man against many fights.<br /><br />2. His daughter Kimmy was impossibly silly. I will leave it at that.<br /><br />3. The mother allowing two teenage girls to track a rock group across Europe was impossibly silly. What was the woman thinking? What world does she live in? Oh yeah, the world of the rich and pampered. I congratulate Neesom's character for not saying, I told you so, at the end. Justifiably, he could have!<br /><br />4. Where did that bag of fluids come from that he used on the poor girl he "took" out of slaving? I don't doubt that he has done that before (put in a drip), but how did he get it? Just one of those things he was carrying in his duffel bag? That seems really far-fetched.<br /><br />5. And the girl!! What happened to her? Does he just leave her? Note: I just learned that the girl is left at a safe house. Thank goodness!<br /><br />6. And the worst: When Neesom is finally caught and suspended from a pipe, how he escapes is really too much!<br /><br />7. Somehow I find it difficult to believe that even a retired "government worker" could leave Paris without being detained. There were too many dead bodies after Neesom rampaged through Paris. We know he didn't leave Paris without seeing some doctor. His arm was bandaged when he stepped off the plane.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are many believable points: totally devoting himself to salvaging his relationship with his daughter, saving the rock star and earning her undying gratitude, killing without remorse in the cause of rescuing his daughter, unflinching violent action when needed, forging ahead fearlessly. It's these kinds of things that make or break an action movie. Because of Liam Neesom's commanding presence and talent (not fully utilized in this movie), as well as the points listed in this paragraph, I DO recommend the film with a nod of acknowledgment to what I consider less than perfect components.<br /><br />New point: Kimmy didn't know the nature of her father's work, making their alienation caused by long-term absences more real. On the way to the airport, he told her he was a "preventer." By movie's end she saw exactly what he did--up close and personal--and had a new appreciation for her dad. That alone is worth the ticket price!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Critically Acclaimed writer/producer/director Luc Besson ("Taxi", "The Fifth Element", "La Femme Nikita", "The Transporter" and many more action films) returned with an action-packed film which was released in France in early 2008 and released in the US in Jan. 2009.  Besson known for giving crew members opportunities, gave his cinematographer for "The Transporter", Pierre Morel his first major International film with "Taken".<br /><br />Written by Besson along with writing partner Robert Mark Kamen ("Gladiator", "The Karate Kid 1-3', "Taps", "Lethal Weapon 3' and many more), "TAKEN" would feature an all-star cast which includes Liam Neeson ("Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace", "Gangs of New York", "Batman Begins", "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), Famke Janssen ("X-Men" films, "The Wackness", "GoldenEye"), Olivier Rabourdin ("La cour des grands", La face cachee", "La Clef) and Maggie Grace ("Lost", "The Fog").  "TAKEN" which cost around $25 million to make, was financially successful as it grossed over $220 million worldwide.<br /><br />"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is featured in an "Unrated" extended-cut version which includes two extra minutes over the theatrical feature (which is also included).  There is a two disc version which includes a digital copy file on the second disc.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"TAKEN" is featured in Widescreen (aspect ration of 2:40:01) and where many films tend to show the beauty of France, Director Pierre Morel wanted to show the real France, which include the seedy areas where prostitution and European gangs are located.  So, you get the gritty side of France and overall, picture quality is pretty good.  Granted, this is on DVD but I can imagine that on Blu-ray, this film's transfer would be wonderful with the amount of detail, outdoor scenes and action scenes involved.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is featured in English 5.1 Dolby Digital  (Spanish and French audio tracks in Dolby Surround are included).  This film sports a lot of action scenes.  From a car chase, many gun and machine gun shots, a pop concert and crowds galore, this  film utilized all 5.1 channels.  I was very impressed that I can only imagine how much immersive the Blu-ray DTS-HD Master Audio would be. Overall, the DVD's audio is well done at Dolby Digital 5.1.  I also watched the film in French and was very impressed by the quality of the voice acting!  Well done!<br /><br />Subtitles for "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" feature English, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" features the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Pierre Morel, Cinematographer Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne (Unrated Version Only) - The commentary is featured in French with English subtitles.  How they were impressed by Liam Neeson's performance, how complex the construction scene/chase scene was to do and how certain scenes were shot and information on scenes with explosions.<br />  * Audio Commentary by Writer Robert Mark Kamen (Unrated Version Only) - Robert Mark Kamen talks about his 15-year writing partnership with Luc Besson and how they work together.  His impression of the film going from a R rating to a PG-13 rating and also his thoughts on the film and the people cast.<br />  * Le "Making Of" featurette - (18:20) Interviews with Director Pierre Morel, the cast of "TAKEN" and how it was like working on the film, filming in Paris, working with a Director who wants to do the camera work and how Liam Neeson did a lot of his stunts with the exception of the high jumps and more.<br />  * Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons of - Six scenes featuring the actual film and the perspective from the filmmaker's side which shows the cameras and crew while filming the movie.<br /><br />*Peter Dies<br />*Bryan Escapes Construction Site<br />*Good Luck<br />*The Interrogation<br />*Bryan at Saint Clair's<br />*Boat Fight<br /><br />  * Avant Premiere- (4:36) The premiere of the film in France and interviews with Luc Besson, Director Pierre Morel and Liam Neeson (accompanied with his wife, Natasha Richardson).  The three talking to the press, to the audience and then audience interviews of how they felt about the film.<br />  * Trailers - No trailer for the film but a trailer for "NOTORIOUS".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"TAKEN" is a magnificent, action-packed film!  It was also interesting to have a action-based International thriller that is not centered around terrorism but a real life problem of human trafficking and kidnappings of young women forced to take part in prostitution and forced into a life of drug addiction.  "TAKEN" features a perfect blend of action that is not overdone but most importantly, a well-written storyline that complimented the action scenes.  Director Pierre Morel who is very experienced as a camera operator knows what kind of shots he wanted and Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen together again for another well-written action-packed thriller.<br /><br />I also have to say that I was surprised when I first heard that Liam Neeson would be the action-star of this suspense/thriller.  Even listening to the audio commentary, the writer Robert Mark Kamen was surprised but realized that Liam Neeson is a tall and fit actor, and Director Pierre Morel felt Neeson was perfect for the job.  Granted, we have seen Neeson fight before in films like "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" but his performance as a Jack Bauer-style agent who will do whatever it takes to find his daughter was impressive.<br /><br />Personally, I want to see more of Neeson as the character of Brian Mills.  I think there are a lot more storylines that this character can take part in and similar to a film like "DIE HARD", I really hope the planned sequel is just as action-packed as this first film.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performance of Maggie Grace.  Having enjoyed her performance in the first and second season of "LOST", I was surprised to see the popular blonde from the show as a brunette.  But Grace did a wonderful job in playing an older teenager who seemed quite reserved but most of all, hitting her emotional scenes effectively.<br /><br />The special features were quite interesting, especially learning how Director Pierre Morel likes to be behind the camera while he directs but also hearing the enthusiasm by the people involved with the film and the audience in France.  Also, it was very touching to see Liam Neeson together with his wife, the late-Natasha Richardson and how loving the couple were and even having her share the same stage with him during the press photography with both Besson and Morel in France.<br /><br />Overall, "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is an action-packed film that takes you on one heck of a wild ride.  Well-done job for second time director Pierre Morel, beautiful cinematography by Michel Abramowicz, well-written screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen.<br /><br />Also, wonderful performances by Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast.  But combined with a DVD featuring an immersive and aggressive soundtrack with well-done utilization of all speaker channels, "TAKEN" is an action thriller worth owning on DVD and having in your collection.  I'm guessing that the film is much more impressive on High Definition for Blu-ray, so if you have a Blu-ray player and want an excellent action film, "TAKEN" is title worth checking out.<br /><br />In the likes of James Bond, Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer, I definitely want to see more of Brian Mills!  "TAKEN: EXTENDED CUT" is highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>Whoa!  "Taken" written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel moves quickly through its 94 minutes with the assuredness of a film that makes no claim to be anything than what it is--pure adrenaline producing action that entertains.<br /><br />Don't expect any hidden political agendas or veiled messages about the state of the world.  Don't analyze each and every segment thinking that every "i" will be dotted and every "t" crossed.  Just sit back, buckle an imaginary seatbelt and prepare yourself for a wild ride driven by the pathos of a loving father whose winsomely innocent daughter finds herself at the mercy of the big bad world.<br /><br />"Taken," starring the ever-endearing Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative whose one-track mind seems rooted in the desire of seeing Kim, his gangly, albeit charmingly so, seventeen year old daughter maturing happily and comfortably under his meticulous auspices despite the fact that she lives apart from him with her rather angry mother (Famke Janssen) and rich stepfather, shoves the nasty demimonde of crime organized to feed the exploitive tastes of rich degenerates in our faces.  As horrific as all this is, the quick pace of the story, forces us to react as quickly as Neeson does as he forges along through his once familiar stomping ground foiling the plans of an Albanian gang intent on human trafficking when they snatch the virginal Kim during a vacation in Paris.<br /><br />Neeson takes no prisoners.  He is a one-man killing machine.  Ludicrously, the bullets fly, the fists slam into faces and kidneys with the same lethal accuracy displayed by celluloid hero, Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon but without Bourne's robotic nonchalance.  Papa Neeson's face bleeds with anguish raw enough for the audience to warily sense like some automatic hormonal discharge that one can smell and taste and rawer still to barely interpret as something so distressful, lingering on it for too many seconds would shatter the rationale to a point of being unable to function.  Neeson conveys this reaching of his emotional limit and his need to turn away from dwelling on it to perfection.  As he stumbles through a tented makeshift whorehouse on a construction site, pulling back curtain after curtain revealing one stoned and under-aged girl after another, we see the pain in his eyes.  The images flash with such feral brutality and stark intensity that we know he must push them from his mind to achieve the goal of finding his girl. Neeson works this part with such emotional nuance, that when he flattens each of his adversaries, there is no question in the audience's mind on how he did it.  We simply believe it.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "Taken" follows the Bourne trilogy school of rapid-fire action cinema.  Its fun, escapist fare and Liam Neeson hones his part like a master craftsman as a concerned papa looking out for his only daughter.  Some grisly scenes of torture, adult themes of sexual slavery and stereotypical Eastern European and Middle Eastern bullies abound. Nevertheless, recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>Certianly nothing new or original here. The plot is contrived and predictable. Neeson makes the file worth watching, however. Once you get past the first 30 minutes where they make a poor attempt and developing the characters and building conflict, the movie kicks into high gear. At least they don't make any lame attempts at making the movie more than it really is: 60 minutes of Neeson taking out everybody who gets in his way. Nothing cute or clever here, just methodical execution of all the bad guys.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Were it not for the fact that Liam Neeson is in the starring role in Taken, this film from French action/trash producer Luc Besson (The Transporter series, The Fifth Element) wouldn't really be too worthwhile otherwise. Having an actor of Neeson's stature lends a certain degree of credibility that Taken wouldn't oterwise have, and that alone makes the film worth seeing. Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-spy trying to reconcile his estranged relationship with his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). When Kim goes to Paris with a friend, and subsequently gets kidnapped, Bryan springs into action to save her, and breaks many bones along the way. There are some genuine surprising moments to be found in Taken, amidst the gaping plot holes, leaps in logic, and overall incoherency. Still, Neeson is magnetic here, and as said before, had Taken starred a lesser actor, the film would be all the worse for it. All in all, fans of flashy action will get a kick out of Taken to be sure, but for the rest of us, the film is worth seeing for Neeson alone.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>TAKEN (2008) Directed by Pierre Morel.<br /><br /> Starring Liam Neeson and Famke Janssen.<br /><br /> When a group of Paris based Muslim Barbarian White Slavers kidnap the daughter of a former secret agent of the US govt, he gives them one chance to return her or he will kill them all. The Muslim Barbarians choose unwisely.<br /><br /> Some minor observations. It appears, based on this film, that the French are having second thoughts about allowing a horde of savages to take up residence in their country and yet the film portrays these same French being in league with said savages while the film's hero is an American who disregards the French, engages in genuine torture and generally leaves bodies in his wake. It appears the French have some issues to work out.<br /><br /> Other than the above, this is a simply wonderful and highly entertaining film, easily one of the best of 2008. Besides the fact that it is extremely well done in almost every respect from an emotionally charged script to a sold cast doing fine work, the film is also quite original and more than a little brave. Not only does it have Muslim Barbarians as villains but they are actually Muslim Barbarians acting LIKE Muslim Barbarians and not the Hug Me Elmos that Hollywood usually churns out. What is more.... this must be the first film about the horrific crime of White Slavery made since...When?? THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL in 1940??? If even half of what this film dramatizes is true then Hollywood should cut it out with the movies about Global Warming fantasies and all the rest of their rubbish and maybe consider a few more on this subject.<br /><br /> I was greatly impressed with Neeson's work here and have generally decided that the actor......whom I never liked much.......has truly become great as he has aged. The relationship with his ex-wife played by Janssen and especially his daughter is quite touching and real. The action and suspense are top notch and reminded at times of an old Republic serial. In spite of the violence and the horror of the subject matter, this is still a highly positive and ennobling film and left this viewer thoroughly pleased. The film even contrives to say a few kind words about Britney Spears/Jessica Simpson/Shakira albeit a fictionalized version!!<br /><br /> While 99.99 percent of modern films are really without worth, every now and then something reminiscent of how movies used to be slips through the cracks. This is such a film.<br /><br /> Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>The plot of this film is a third person sanitized version of "Lilja 4-ever."  Bryan Mills'(Neeson's) teenaged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Europe where she is stolen and sold into the sex trade.  The film was rated PG-13 but its content, vaguely glossed over for the most part, is anything but.  Quite graphic, the film relies on assumption, bloodless gunfire, and knife fights to push home the point that some people will justify any action to make money. The light treatment of such a horrific crime is somewhat an insult to the film's message. Given its themes the film would have been stronger if it had gone with an R rating, or at least more artfully hinted around disturbing content.  As it was it fell flat in engaging the audience into exactly what was going on, choosing to focus on pyrotechnics and paramilitary posturing.<br /><br />Neeson is not on his game in this role, though he delivers a powerful, decisive father whose drive to save his daughter rivals the darkness of those he pursues.  This is the real story.  What is happening to his daughter is an afterthought, as is his own emotional involvement with what's happening.  That lack is why the feasibility of the story falls apart.  Grace portrays seventeen-year-old Kim more as if she was fourteen, rarely taking a step that she isn't skipping and pouncing like a puppy.  The need to convey her as being innocent and naive is overdone.  The only thing missing was pigtails.  Between the vague content and the over-acted archetypes of powerful father and innocent daughter, the result is this film turns a traumatic experience into an action-oriented thriller, his daughter's story largely lost beside his campaign for conquest.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>As if the lousy economy isn't enough of a reason to say "Hells to the no!" when your kids plead and beg to go on a European trip, here comes TAKEN, a film which you can show on a back-to-back-to-back screening marathon along with the HOSTEL frightfests. That should make the kids waver a bit. And I bet those poor souls in HOSTEL were wishing for a parent like Liam Neeson. My favorite part of TAKEN may well be the low key yet very ominous promise Neeson makes on the phone to the kidnappers who had just snatched his daughter. I got de shivers of anticipation up and down the spine, watching him make this little speech in the film trailer; in the actual film, it resonates with even more power.<br /><br />- Liam Neeson's character: "I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have... are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you."<br />- The response: "Good luck."<br /><br />Oh, it is so on now, brother!<br /><br />Plot, simple: Ex-black ops agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) retired so that he can spend time with his neglected 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), although nowadays Kim doesn't really have much time for him. But she manages to guilt him into signing his permission for her to go holidaying in Europe. Mills doesn't like it one bit. He knows how the real world works, but his daughter just wants to follow a rock band as it tours across Europe. Mills' worst fears surface when Kim and her friend are promptly kidnapped in Paris. But Bryan Mills isn't your ordinary dad and he immediately leaps into action.<br /><br />Clocking in at slightly over an hour and a half, TAKEN is a stripped-down bare-knuckled thriller, doesn't try to be fancy, doesn't overcomplicate the story. It's about a father, trained in espionage and combat, willing to do whatever is needed, willing to take on anyone in his way, to get his daughter back. And that's it. Above all, this movie works because it's Liam Neeson propelling the story. Neeson is a first-rate actor and the man can convey seething rage and righteous fury like nobody's business. And, for someone in his 50s, he brings such big physical presence to the screen that you buy into his character being this dangerous and capable and ruthless.<br /><br />A geriatric version of Jack Bauer? Yes - this man does not eff around. Some of the brutal things Mills resorts to has him straddling the fence between good guy and villain. But I tend to forgive him, given what's driving him. But, heh, it's pretty much a given that his friendship with his French contact is now effectively ruined.<br /><br />Holes in the film? Yes, some. Although it's just about a given that Mills is able to survive hail after hail of bullets; that just seems to go with the territory, in these films. But Bryan Mills, impressive spy skills aside, does get by some on preposterous sheer luck (especially with the jacket). And then, after wreaking so much havoc in Paris, he seemingly is able to get out of France with his daughter fairly easily. See, father and daughter reunite and hug it out in Paris. Next thing you know, they're strolling in L.A.X. (although, okay, for all we know, they may have spent frustrating weeks in Paris swimming thru red tape; the movie doesn't indicate how much time has elapsed). My biggest gripe lies in the shakedown scene, when Mills accosts the Albanians in their HQ and pretends to be French authority - while talking in English with not even a French accent, much less actually speaking in French. And the saps buy this? Unless, of course, Mills pulled the old Jedi mind trick on them. In which case, it all makes sense.<br /><br />But I'm just nagging. Liam Neeson is so good an actor that for the most part he sweeps you into his character's obsessed hunt. Irregardless of plot inconsistencies and action movie cliches, TAKEN turns out to be a lean and mean thriller, and worth watching. And Liam Neeson, he runs this joint.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Liam Neeson is one of those actors that although you will admire their work, Taken is a movie you could never expect them to be the lead in.

The film has its drawbacks, but they are all massively outweighed by the better parts of the film.<br /><br />The film focuses around retired spy Bryan Mills (Neeson) whos daughter is kidnapped whilst on a trip to Paris with her close friend. He's a man who wasn't there for a lot of his daughters life due to his job, but is trying to make up for lost time with overprotective, suffocating fathering. Kim (Maggie Grace) and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian human traffickers whilst Bryan is on the phone to Kim. He tells her not to be scared and he will find her, he also tells the Albanian kidnapper who taunts Bryan on the phone. This leads into a series of events where Bryan is investigating the human traffickers in France using vigilante methods, but this is at the displeasure of the French authorities and an old friend of Bryans who simply want him out of France. He promises his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janseen, who quite frankly creeps me out) that he will return her safe and sound, at any cost but the only drawback is he has 96 hours.<br /><br />This is a really good and fast paced action movies that has some excellent chase and combat scenes. Neeson seems to hold his own well and can display some excellent ability when it comes to those action scenes (although I'm sure a stunt double was cleverly placed in those scenes). Some of the dialogue is quite cringe worthy especially when Neesons character is on the phone to the kidnapper and he tells him that he has experience and he will be coming for them. It's something very clich&eacute; and annoying in some respects but quite cool in another. The other gripe I had about it was the accent of Neeson. I'm not sure where his character was meant to hail from but it certainly wasn't American born and bred, or at least I hope not. Neeson's a good actor but he really needs to work on his American accent because it just destroys any role he's in when he's meant to be an American but his Irish accent clearly shines through.<br /><br />It's a great film overall though and I would strongly recommend it to any action movie fan. He's good in this role, but I can't see him doing another role like this ever again as although he held his own, he seemed at times to be quite uncomfortable in what he was doing. The supporting cast are OK but nothing to shout about, the story is well done and seems to be quite intelligent in what it's talking about when on the subject of human trafficking. But what do I know, maybe this is the most inconsistent movie I've ever seen. If it is then it certainly hid it well. I just have one request to any future movie makers, please don't cast Famke Janseen, she's just weird.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / FOX / Region A<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / BD+ / High Profile 4.1 / Seamless branching<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />Running time: 1:33:25 (Unrated) / 1:30:55 (Theatrical)<br />Feature size: 27,97 GB<br />Disc size: 41,32 GB<br />Total bit rate: 39.93 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 32.03 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  3861 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3861 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  448 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  448 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 448 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  224 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps<br />DTS Express  English  96 kbps  1.0 / 48 kHz / 96 kbps / 24-bit<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 24<br /><br />#Audio commentaries (Unrated version only)<br />#Black Ops Field Manual (Bonus Vuew - Unrated version only)<br />#Inside Action: 6 Side By Side Comparisons (HD - 11m:05s)<br />#DVD Digital Copy</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>Unfortunately, your thinking is all about how farcically preposterous the whole thing is.<br /><br />To be honest, there is nothing that Liam Neeson's character does during any 4-second interval of the film that is not believable.  Taking all his actions together, though; that's where the absurdity comes in.<br /><br />One might argue that this is meant to be a fast-paced thriller that will provide a couple of hours and entertainment and nothing more.  But for my part I couldn't lose myself in this movie on account of being unable to believe that Liam Neeson could be this sort of man, or that anybody in the world had such a skill set.<br /><br />I wonder what the French thought of this film:  it was almost an insult to their culture.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The stars are for Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace, but not so much for the film.  It's a standard action/international thriller--nothing that has not been done a thousand times before.  Shooting an innocent woman in the arm to make her husband talk does not make me admire the so-called hero in the story, and neither does his leaving a man to be electrocuted repeatedly until the power eventually goes off.  Yes, I get that he is trying to rescue his daughter, but if it were so easy, there wouldn't be so many women still hidden away, as they are right now.<br />There's also no indication that he was going to notify the French police or Interpol about all the captive women he saw.  Sure, they could be moved, but at least there would have been some leads and perhaps DNA left behind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>The story line doesn't come close to being plausible.

It just didn't feel real at all.  Second he was so earnest and good that he's not a believable character.  Never really gets angry...he's just this warm ray of goodness in all he does.<br /><br />Then the action ramps up.  Some of it didn't excite me; in particular there's a car chase that really bored me.  I also wish he would have been more passionate in disposing of the bad guys.  If I were slaughtering the men that stole my daughter, you can be sure I would have enjoyed it.<br /><br />The whole time I was imagining how much better say...a smart-allecky Bruce Willis would have fit the bill.<br /><br />I do have to say...there is one REALLY good "Oh ****!" moment that I won't spoil for anybody.  Man that was great.  But it doesn't make the film for me.<br /><br />And then the end...not to give anything away...but it just seemed pointless, tacked on and hokey.  The emotional core of this film just isn't there.<br /><br />If you're really desperate for some gunshot wounds and broken bones then this will do.  But I can't recommend it to anyone...except my parents.  They're a sucker for any thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Were it not for the fact that Liam Neeson is in the starring role in Taken, this film from French action/trash producer Luc Besson (The Transporter series, The Fifth Element) wouldn't really be too worthwhile otherwise.  Having an actor of Neeson's stature lends a certain degree of credibility that Taken wouldn't oterwise have, and that alone makes the film worth seeing.  Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-spy trying to reconcile his estranged relationship with his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  When Kim goes to Paris with a friend, and subsequently gets kidnapped, Bryan springs into action to save her, and breaks many bones along the way.  There are some genuine surprising moments to be found in Taken, amidst the gaping plot holes, leaps in logic, and overall incoherency.  Still, Neeson is magnetic here, and as said before, had Taken starred a lesser actor, the film would be all the worse for it.  All in all, fans of flashy action will get a kick out of Taken to be sure, but for the rest of us, the film is worth seeing for Neeson alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>A word of advice: if you plan to kidnap a man's daughter in order to sell her into forced prostitution, make sure that the father is not a trained professional. Or else, he'll hunt you down and kill you. That is the primary storyline of "Taken," a fascinating, action-packed thrill ride about one man's search for his kidnapped daughter. Liam Neeson, one of our greatest actors, proves his action mettle, taking out one thug after another, while also showing tender love for his daughter, the reason he goes on a rampage. There's some great action sequences, fine storytelling and a fine supporting cast. Fans of action-thrillers will find much to enjoy in "Taken!"<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Who would have ever thought that Hollywood would attempt to include an important topic to serve as the basis for one of its typically generic, yet entertaining action films? Generally these films are created to provide mindless escapism along with a hefty dose of guns and fist-fights, or just to be another brainless vehicle showcasing the action star of the moment. In the case of "Taken", a much more serious topic, the trafficking of women, serves as the catalyst for all the mayhem that ensues over the course of the film.<br /><br />"Taken" is the story of a young girl named Kim (Maggie Grace), who takes a trip to France with a friend for the summer; however, what should have been a trip filled with good times and fond memories, turns horribly wrong when they are kidnapped for the sole purpose of being sold into a dark underworld of sex and drugs. What the kidnappers didn't count on was that Kim's father, Bryan (Liam Neeson), is a man of rather "special" talents that he learned during his time spent working as a spy for the United States government. With his daughter's life in jeopardy, Bryan must call upon every deadly skill he's ever learned to track down those responsible and save his daughter before it's too late.<br /><br />Filmmaker and writer Luc Besson ("Transporter" series) has made a career out of delivering to audiences bone crushing, overly stylized and over-the-top action movies that entertain us, but don't really give us anything new in terms of story or emotional range. With "Taken" Luc Besson, along with co-writer Robert Mark Kamen ("Transporter 2"), imbues the story with a much more serious, emotionally charged backbone. The seedy underworld of kidnapping and trafficking women for sex is one that exists without a whole lot of attention being called to it, thus making this film's message all the more important. The story is wisely written in such a way that it gives us just enough of a glimpse into this world that we become more enlightened as too some of the new threats out there, but not so graphic that the film is too shocking for most people to see. By handling the subject matter in this somewhat delicate manner, some would say it just glossed over the evil done in this so-called "business", but the message is able to reach a much broader spectrum of people than a harder edged movie would have been able to. For those feeling that the film didn't do enough to expose the despicable nature of this world, I do agree, but I understand why it was a better decision not to go too far with it. Because to go too hard and gritty with this movie by being too explicit, you run the risk of limiting and/or alienating your audience, which is not something you want when dealing with such a serious topic.<br /><br />Even with the much heftier subject matter, "Taken" still could have run the risk of being just a slightly above average action movie if not for the considerable talents of star Liam Neeson. Liam brings to the character of Bryan a gentleness and an obvious love for his daughter in the early portion of the movie, so that when the rubber really hits the road, the actions he takes to find her, and the ferocity in which he acts is completely believable. Regardless of how brutal Bryan may act towards these undeniably deserving adversaries, he never becomes inaccessible to the audience. This is because Liam's gravitas and at times emotional performance keeps the audience invested in his character and his mission. Sometimes in an action movie, the action can become too front and center that the how's and why's of the story (no matter how important and central they may be to the action) get forgotten about until the very end when they are conveniently re-introduced to the audience as a reminder. For "Taken" this is not the case, as Bryan's love for his daughter and unwillingness to give up on finding her always remains front and center, even during the action sequences.<br /><br />Other members of the cast included Famke Janssen ("X-Men" trilogy), Maggie Grace ("The Fog"), and Leland Orser ("The Bone Collector"). Each of these supporting actors and actresses do a good job with the little time they do receive onscreen. Primarily this movie belongs solely to Liam Neeson, while the supporting roles are nothing more than glorified cameos, which suits this type of film perfectly. Out of the supporting cast, Maggie Grace probably gives the best performance, because had it not been for her emotional connection with Liam in the film's early scenes, the audience wouldn't have been able to connect with him as much later on. Sure, the story would have still impacted us in some way, but by having their relationship feel so realistic, it made our connection to him throughout the remainder of the film all the more palpable.<br /><br />Lastly, first time director Pierre Morel brings his keen eye for action to the proceedings with great effectiveness. Pierre's work as Director of Cinematography on the action film "War", starring Jet Li and Jason Statham, clearly served as great preparation for his work on this film. While I didn't enjoy the aforementioned film all that much, the action scenes were handled very well, much the same way as they are here. Unlike many of writer Luc Besson's action films, "Taken" contains none of his trademark over-the-top, overblown action sequences that while incredibly fun to watch, are completely unbelievable. Instead, Pierre opts to keep the action realistic and up-close and personal, while still providing plenty of hard-hitting, fast-paced (somewhat stylized) fight sequences, that don't really feel all that unbelievable or obviously choreographed.<br /><br />"Taken" is a great action film that offers plenty of violence for the action junkies, while at the same time providing some solid acting, and a story that shines a light on a dark world that needs to be exposed and put to an end.<br /><br />"Taken" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>I'm not a big fan of action movies. They tend to focus on violence and killing as many people as possible in the most original ways, but a select few have more depth. Taken falls into the latter category.<br /><br />Why is it so good?<br /><br />If you had told me that a 56-year-old actor would make one of the best action movies I've ever seen, I would have laughed and thought how bad Roger Moore's version of James Bond was in A View to a Kill and Octopussy. Action movies often feature actors who look the part, but who can't really act. Arnold Schwarzenegger springs to mind. Liam Neeson changes all that with this one performance. He doesn't look like he could take on the world, but his acting ability is so good that he convinces you that he's capable of everything he does in the movie.<br /><br />Bryan Mills (Neeson) used to work for the government as a CIA operative. He still associates with friends from his previous job, but he's given up that career in an attempt to get closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). She lives with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her rich stepfather. When Mills takes Kim a thoughtful gift on her seventeenth birthday, her stepfather gives her a horse. Mills doesn't seem to have a chance of winning her respect. What's more, Lenore apparently hates him.<br /><br />Mills is given another chance to make a connection with Kim when she asks him to sign a consent form so that she can leave the country for a vacation. As she's 17, she needs the permission of both parents. Mills isn't happy about the idea. He's seen a lot of criminal activity in his former line of work and understands the dangers involved. Is he just being paranoid? His dire warnings seem exaggerated, but we soon see that they are justified.<br /><br />Kim goes to Paris with her 19-year-old friend and trusts everyone she meets. The day she arrives, an Albanian gang take her and her friend captive. We learn that they intend to control her through drugs and turn her into a prostitute, or perhaps even sell her to a willing buyer.<br /><br />Perhaps the best moment in the movie is when Mills talks to Kim's captor on her phone:<br /><br />"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you."<br /><br />He says it with absolute conviction.<br /><br />I won't give away any more of the story. That setup takes around 25 minutes. If I have done a good job, perhaps you can understand why Taken is different. Mills is real. We understand his motives for giving up his job. When Kim is taken, we start to see some of the skills he claims to possess.<br /><br />If she was your daughter, how would you react? What if you had the requisite skills to seek her out yourself? Is there anything you wouldn't do to save her?<br /><br />Director Pierre Morel doesn't waste a single minute. At 93 minutes, the movie is lean and the action rarely allows us time to breathe once Mills kicks into action. He's a relentless killing machine, but, unlike most action heroes, his abilities seem authentic. To make things seem even more urgent, we experience everything from his point of view. Expect to see plenty of fast cuts during chase scenes, just as you would in The Bourne Trilogy.<br /><br />It's easy to root for Mills because of the strong characterization. Neeson excels in this role and carries the movie throughout. I wonder if we'll start to see other good actors cast in action roles as a result? Taken is an enjoyable thrill ride with almost endless replay value.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Remembering Liam Neeson in "Schindler's List", this picture is several notches down for him.  The plot is mindless and the writing amateurish.  For openers, the character of his daughter is portrayed as a selfish, unappreciative, spoiled brat for whom I would have trouble leaving the house to rescue.  After his rich characterisation of Oskar Schindler, Neeson's speech over the phone, threatening the kidnapper, is embarrassing.<br /><br />As a whole the picture is contrived, predictable and completely unbelievable.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>Taken is an action flick that's both efficient and absurd, and so it's often entertaining -- but only up to a point.

He is relentless, fierce, methodical and cold blooded as he dishes out the same level of pain and punishment practiced by those he pursues.<br /><br />'Taken' is not a film I would suggest for an evening of family entertainment, but if you have a group of guys together who want to see fists flying this is the one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Well, it is safe to say that this is Liam Neeson as you never seen him before--as a death-dealing, super James Bond field agent who comes out of retirement to rescue his daughter who has been kidnapped into the international sex slave trade.

It's an opportunity for Neeson to play a super-cool secret agent who can hand out more death and mayhem in one day than your typical American company on the skids can hand out pink slips on a Friday afternoon. Who's to say which is deadlier? :-)<br /><br />Well, for now I'll go with the mature Neeson as he sends dozens of Euro-nasties to an early grave in this unabashed, rock-'em, sock-'em revenge thriller that is sort of like the AARP meets "The Bourne Identity."

The latest addition to the category, "Taken", treads on familiar ground, but succeeds in breathing fresh life into the concept through the unusual casting of Liam Neeson as a retired special ops agent; eschewing glamor for gritty determination, Neeson is so good that the film becomes a homage to not only the genre, but to a father's devotion to his child in an increasingly dangerous world.<br /><br />Neeson is clearly a dinosaur, not only among the flashy, media-savvy operatives of the intelligence community, but as a parent, as well; his over-protectiveness of his daughter is scoffed at by his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and his ongoing surveillance has a nearly creepy quality. Yet when his instructions are ignored, and his daughter is abducted by a white slavery ring in France, Neeson quickly proves himself to be their worst nightmare, a relentless, unforgiving adversary.<br /><br />While a legitimate argument can be made that the story's resolution is too 'sugar-coated' and pat, it does provide an optimism that is too often lacking in recent films, and I enjoyed it...<br /><br />"Taken" is a terrific suspense film, and certainly worth owning, especially if you're a Liam Neeson fan!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Former CIA Agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has 96 hours to find his daughter who has been kidnapped and who may be forever lost.

Mills then goes into hyper drive working to find his daughter, reaping vengeance along the way.<br /><br />Neeson is very strong and the mood of his intensity is set from the beginning.  He has friends who he was worked with in the past that give us a view of what he was like before he retired to be close to his daughter who lives with ex-wife (Janssen).

Liam Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, a retired government employee who has moved to California to be closer to his daughter Kim, played by Lost's Maggie Grace. Bryan is hesitant when Kim says she is going on a trip to Europe with her friends, but agrees to let her go if she promises to call. Kim does call from Paris, and while she does, Kim witnesses her friend Amanda being kidnapped. Suddenly, Bryan isn't retired anymore. He goes into "government employee mode" and tells Kim that she is going to be kidnapped and that he will come and save her.<br /><br />While working for the government, Bryan was a "preventer." He prevented bad things from happening. You get a picture of what those skills were when he begans encountering and dispatching with thugs easily in France. The action is fast paced and brutal, but not overly gory since this is a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />Bryan's CIA friends tell him he only has 96 hours to save his daughter. Neeson effortly displays the passion and desperation of a father about to lose his daughter. The villians are solid, and Maggie Grace is good as Kim.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and believe it did so well at the theaters because it is about a father saving his daughter. It is about good versus evil. There is no gray area, if you are bad, you are killed by Bryan Mills, angry father and killing machine. There's no message in the film about the environment or terrorism or anything else that many big movies try to slip in to appease the critics. It's a simple movie where you know right away that all the bad guys deserve to die and you'll feel good when they do.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>When Taken was finally released in North America, after already playing in Europe for a year, it became a surprise hit. Not bad for what is essentially a B-movie revenge story starring an A-list actor. The film was produced by French filmmaker Luc Besson, who's responsible for action classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008ZZ9E">La Femme Nikita (Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJEE">Leon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)</a>. He also produced and co-wrote the popular Transporter films so he certainly knows what audiences around the world want to see.<br /><br />The film delivers exactly what it promises: an excellent and entertaining thrill ride with no frills. It is as single-minded as its protagonist's mission and plugs in exciting car chases, fight scenes and gun battles. And yet, you are still emotionally invested in Neeson's character - you care about what happens to him and his daughter. The result is a truly satisfying and engaging film.<br /><br />You have the option of watching the theatrical version or the unrated cut.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Pierre Morel and cinematographers Michel Abramowicz and Michel Julienne. They decided on two distinctive looks for the film: sunny and vibrant colours for Los Angeles and a darker vibe for Paris. They talk about the differences between American and French film crews. They also praise Liam Neeson's ability to play a loving father and a deadly killing machine. They also talks about the challenges of working in a city like Paris.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by co-screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. He mentioned that he's been writing for 30 years with 15 of them with Luc Besson. They met on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GVJE4">The Fifth Element (Ultimate Edition)</a>. He worked with the filmmaker on creating a production company in Europe writing "low-impact action movies." Kamen says that the premise of the film was based on a story Besson heard from a French cop. Kamen also talks about how he writes with Besson and praises his "cinematic vision."<br /><br />"Le Making Of" is fairly standard if not engaging press kit material with the main cast talking about their characters and the story with clips from the film. There is plenty of behind-the-scenes footage of some of the film's exciting action sequences being shot.<br /><br />"Avant Premiere" features footage of the film's world premiere in France with Neeson, Morel and Besson doing interviews on the red carpet. There is haunting footage of Neeson and his late wife Natasha Richardson who was also in attendance.<br /><br />Finally, there is "Inside Action: Side by Side Comparisons," which takes a look at six action sequences being filmed along with the finished product.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>TAKEN is a fast paced, well designed and choreographed action thriller that details the return to duty of an intelligence man, whose career distanced him from his family, when his own daughter falls victim to the crime syndicate in Paris. The driver of this well written (Luc Besson! and Robert Mark Kamen), well directed (Pierre Morel) film is the non-stop violence filled mission of a desperate father whose skills at getting to the heart of a matter have not been diminished by his 'early retirement'.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is in grand form as Bryan Mills, the skilled and committed father who can out kill and out wit even the most vicious of the Albanian forces against whom he must struggle to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold into human slavery to an Arab sheik. The film moves so rapidly, with the skills of cinematographer Michel Abramowicz, that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity (Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Maggie Grace et al).  The violence is constant but due to Bryan Mills' skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesn't linger  There are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing, but again the camera doesn't pause long enough to make them gruesome.<br /><br />This is a fine performance by Liam Neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein.  It is a wild ride, but a very fine one.  Grady Harp, May 09</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>"Taken" is one of those action thrillers with a main character who is or was a double-dog secret government wreaker of mayhem.  Written by Luc Besson, who also made "Leon: The Professional", "La Femme Nikita" and "The Transporter," you go into this film expecting that there will be several scenes featuring our hero single-handedly taking on a room full of bad guys and, as my Granny used to say, whuppin' the tar out of them.  Actually - he does more than whup most of them.  Most wind up looking pretty dead, although no one stops to check for a pulse once the bodies start piling up.<br /><br />The distinguishing characteristic "Taken" has over its brethren is the star.  Instead of Jason Statham or The Rock (20 years ago it would have been Steven Seagal or Jean-Claude Van Damme), "Taken" stars lauded Irishman Liam Neeson.  The guy who played Schindler brings a degree of gravitas to a role not yet earned by most action stars.  There's a reason he provides the voice of Aslan in the Narnia films.<br /><br />In this film he plays Bryan Mills, who spent most of his married life on the road doing secret C.I.A. stuff, and enjoying it, but neglected his wife and daughter.  As a consequence Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) is now his ex-wife, and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace from "Lost") lives with mom and new step-dad, a super-rich businessman.<br /><br />Bryan regrets not being a better Dad and husband, so he has retired from the agency and moved near Kimmy, but when Kim lives in a mansion worthy of an NFL owner, it's tough for Bryan to compete for Kim's affection.<br /><br />Kim is invited with a friend on a Paris vacation and Mom pressures Bryan to sign the necessary forms so that Kim can leave the country.  After years of dealing with the world's shady characters, Bryan is reluctant, but signs the forms after giving Kim a few rules - mainly to stay in touch with an international cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />Kim is in her opulent Paris digs for all of about an hour before Albanian drug and prostitute slave traders break into the apartment.  Dad is on the phone chastising Kim as the bad guys break in, and Bryan is able to piece together a few pieces of information when he tells Kim to give him as much description as she can before she is kidnapped.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of Bryan tearing apart Paris, one room of bad guys at a time.  At least four times he strolls casually into a situation surrounded by four or more baddies, and after the first few times the Mrs. and I would turn to each other and predict "I think THOSE guys are about to have a BAD day" each subsequent time he encountered more eurotrashy guys.<br /><br />At an hour and a half, Besson and director Pierre Morel keep the pace at a level that barely gives you time to catch your breath.  It's entertaining in a Bourne kind of way, and it makes me feel better seeing a man ten years my senior able to whup the tar out of a hundred bad guys.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>TAKEN shouldn't be any good.  It should be boring and predictable, with more plot holes than a slice of Swiss cheese riddled by machine-gun fire.  It should be a dull popcorn piece of entertainment and nothing more.<br /><br />But it isn't.  Instead, it's an edge-of-your-seat adrenaline rush from opening to close, a barrage of bullets and kick-a** moves that leaves you reeling.  Sure, it's cliched, and sure, almost all of the stunts here are theoretically impossible, but the amazing thing is that you never really care.  Liam Neeson's quest to save his daughter from the world of sex slave trafficking is a rollicking ride, fueled by Neeson's acting chops (finally, an action hero who uses his brain as much as his fists, and not to mention some silver-tongued threats) and director Pierre Morel's sense of style.  (Let's also not forget writer/producer Luc Besson, who's brought us such contemporary action classics as "The 5th Element" and the genuinely awe-inspiring "Leon, The Professional").  TAKEN isn't necessarily an action movie with brains; it's more of an action movie where you don't care if it has brains or not.  It has gravitas (in the form of Neeson, and let's face it, that was probably one of the best and most surprising casting decisions of the past decade) and skill, and will leave you gasping for breath and cheering for a genuinely likable hero who has "a certain set of skills" and knows exactly how to put them to use.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>I missed this flick in theaters but saw it last night on BD (UK ed). Fox presents an adequate transfer (unfortunately rather rare for the studio), but the DTS sound was a pleasure. It was watched on a 42" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. Given the extensive fighting, shooting, and other action scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DTS treatment. The picture was grainy in some dark shots, but overall very crisp.<br /><br />Though some reviews across numerous sites have remarked that Liam Neeson was an odd cast for this highly physical film, I disagree. In order to take on an underground women prostitution smuggling ring, singlehandledly, a mature, seasoned and perfection-driven type would need to be cast. He portrayed the girl's father and his skillset in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The pace of the film is very fast, and was a bit too fast for me, in rushing along the character development. The acting was a bit robotic in parts, especially of the daughter, who seemed overly excited and hysterical in normal scenes (not after she had been kidnapped, obviously). In parts it seemed like the director or actors "tried too hard" to create drama, and whether in the script, or the execution, it was a little "over the top". The story was over the top, of course, and quite dramatic, but the delivery seemed a bit overblown.<br /><br />Still, I can see how this was dubbed one of the best action movies of the year, as the centerline story of a dad fighting for his daughter in a very dangerous situation is a very powerful concept for humanity. The story was relatable and fast paced. Highly recommended!</p></br></body></html>

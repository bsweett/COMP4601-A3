Ever since the first time, it has been a tradition for me to watch this film at least once or twice every year, preferably on a dark and stormy night. Jack Nicholson does an excellent job as the psychopath who tries to do away with his wife and son, after succombing "cabin fever". Shelley Duvall is both effective and annoying as Jack's mousy little wife. Ah, I love it all. Who cares if it strays from the book? They are both great on their own terms, and you should just look at it that way.<br /><br />I read that Kubrick would leave the film "Eraserhead" playing on the set to create a sense of dread in the actors. Awesome!<br /><br />How I miss the Kubrick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>This is by far up to this point in time Jack Nicholson's masterpeice movie wise.  The way the director film it was stunning and will make your mouth drop open from the scenes of the layout of the land when they are driving into the hotel.  Yes this movie as a cult following due to the great actors in it and the great job by the director.  Plus no matter what it will forever have one of the best one liners in motion picture history "Heeeere's Johnny".  The only scene that made me jump was the weapon to the chest of the black actor in the movie that was the cook at the hotel.  But I never get tired of the movie and I will forever keep watching it time and time again when I am in the mood for some good horror.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is the introspective version of the story, unlike the later version that King preferred.  It is the story of a family down on its luck, so the father takes a job as caretaker of a remote hotel that is supposed to be on some kind of ancient Indian burial ground.  Strange murderous things happened there before, but no one knows exactly what.  The mother and boy feel the tension vis-a-vis the father, who is a recovering alcoholic boiling with the most terrible anger.  He clearly loves the boy, but the mother blames him for a violent action he had made when drunk.  This is all understated, in the background but every detail of what unfolds fits in with this psychology.  It is a masterpiece like cut crystal.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is at the height of his powers here, young and still with a spirit to experiment with his roles rather than walking through the blatant commercial ones of his later career (however well he did them).  He is a troubled father and stalled writer, on his last legs in many ways.  You feel this just by looking at him, every gesture of the character consistent with his mental state.  He looks frightening, but there is love in him, too, as the thing begins to struggle for his mind.  Shelly Duvall, his wife, is is absolutely amazing, as she watches, the terror mounting inside of her until she can barely speak.  Finally, the boy - with supernatural powers of extrasensory communication -  calls for help.  The boy and his mother know something is coming, as the visions mount and strange occurrences begin.<br /><br />Nicholson is haunted by visions and begins to drink.  But it is clear that he has been under pressure the entire time they have been isoated there.  When Duvall discovers that something is wrong, it is one of the most terrifying moments in cinema that I have ever seen, but what does it is her acting, her demeanor of hysteria and despair.  I totally believed her.<br /><br />There are also many mysteries in the film, strange clues that remain unexplained.  My favorite is the appearance of Nicholson in an old photograph, leaving it to the viewer to interpret.  It is a one wonderful detail among many that enter the careful viewers' imagination to fit in with all the other parts of the film.  It is brilliant and perfect, just like the way that the boy escapes.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  One of the best I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>The Shining is a classic horror movie that actually caused me to lose some sleep when I first saw it back in the '80s. I'm glad that it is available "On-Demand" so my son and daughter (now that they are old enough) could see this with us.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall put in great performances as "Jack" and "Wendy", respectively, and young Danny Lloyd plays a very creepy Danny\Tony. This is an adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name, while it is not as accurate as the later TV movie, it is every bit as creepy and even somewhat more disturbing.<br /><br />Even though this is an older movie and book, there will be no plot spoilers from me: The story centers around a family (Jack, Wendy, and Danny) who take on the winter upkeep of a mountain hotel in the "off season". Jack is hoping to use the time to write a novel, while Wendy and Danny are left to their own devices. Like many King stories, the location and history (both explained very early) of the hotel are key plot elements. Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly going insane is truly brilliant and some of the lines are very memorable.<br /><br />Many of the scenes are often spoofed on popular modern shows, which is why we wanted our teens to see it. I should note that there are a lot of disturbing and gory images all throughout this movie, including some full frontal nudity that I honestly hadn't remembered was in it (likely because I first saw this on "Network" TV). While not a traditional family movie, there are obviously some scenes that can be somewhat awkward.<br /><br />Even with all of that, this is still a fantastic movie that has become part of our popular culture.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>At times Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining feels like Home Alone with jokes (Macauley Culkin's "Oh no!" expression even originates in young Danny Lloyd's reaction to seeing the caretaker's twins), with Jack Nicholson doing the screen's most prolonged Bruce Dern impersonation while a helpless little boy outthinks him and lures him to his own destruction. Nicholson's constant clowning certainly does the film few favors and makes Jack Torrence more standup comedian than fearsome killer, setting the scene for three decades of comedy improv slashers. Many of the film's most effective moments, such as the conversation with the dead caretaker in the men's' room or the conversations with Joseph Turkel's ghostly barman, tend to work in spite of the star's grandstanding rather than because of it. He's at his best in the early scenes or his the genuinely unnerving moment where the sleep deprived Torrence unemotionally and less than reassuringly promises his son he'd never hurt him, but by the time he's broken out the fire axe all that's missing is the hockey mask and the striped sweater. It doesn't help that child actor Danny Lloyd isn't terribly good either (his croaking "redrum" scene makes you glad Warners turned down Kubrick's offer to direct The Exorcist), but he isn't quite disastrous either.<br /><br />Yet the film still manages to hold the attention, even if it is often more of a display of technique and Kubrick's visual precision and fascination with the possibilities of the constantly prowling Steadicam rather than a visceral rollercoaster ride: the polite and accommodating Joseph Turkel is easily one of the most memorable spectres in screen history while the ever so formal Philip Stone as the late caretaker with distinct ideas on disciplining children is an almost equally intriguing creation. And with the novel's original ending that saw the various animals carved out of the maze's hedges coming to life impractical with the special effects of the day, Kubrick's solution is very satisfying even if he does steal one shot wholesale from The Last Hunt. One striking thing about two of the Overlook's permanent residents, however: if the place does still contain echoes of all the bad things that have happened there over the years, that must mean that one particular guest must have got the worst oral sex of all time from the guy in the Pluto costume!<br /><br />Although still cut by three minutes after its premiere, the 146-minute American cut on the Region 1 NTSC DVD works better than the European version that Kubrick himself cut down to two hours. While many of the cuts are pure exposition, with much of the initial tour around the Overlook and all of Anne Jackson's part hitting the cutting room floor, as did part of one of Turkel's scenes, the longer first half of the film means it takes longer for Nicholson to go whacko (in the European version they've barely had time to unpack before he starts slicing up the ham in extra-thick slices). Unfortunately the stereo remix on the DVD tends to dull some of the film's best sound effects, such as the memorable sound of Danny's tricycle as it passes over carpet onto hardwood floor, and the new letterboxed transfer loses detail from the previous fullframe version that Kubrick approved (the overhead shot of the maze in particular).</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>For being 27 years old, this movie has never captivated me more. Letterbox has opened this up to a whole new level, and the detailed picture and sound only enhance one movie that was truly made for blu ray; I have seen this dozens of times, but this was like a religious experience in many ways; I heard and saw things I never had before; This was my first blu ray, so I can't imagine how something more recent looks!! It was almost like certain sequences were in 3D; The ballroom and hedge maze sequences were just jaw dropping, and Kubrick's bizarre color schemes suit the incredible picture quality perfectly. The eerie music sounds even more menacing!!! Great extras, too!!! Finally somebody gave this movie the treatment it always deserved!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>During the period of the late 70s and early 80s, several slasher horror movies were released, such as Friday the 13th, but The Shining generates its horror through psychological means which keeps the viewer guessing throughout the movie.<br /><br />Using a script based on the novel by Stephen King, director Stanley  Kubrick has created a story with menacing settings and excellent performances by Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, and Danny Lloyd.  Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, who's come to the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker.  Duvall plays his wife Wendy, and Lloyd stars as the Torrance's son Danny.<br /><br />At his interview, Jack is told about a former caretaker named Delbert Grady, who murdered his wife and two daughters.  Soon, Jack is experiencing his own psychological changes.  The Overlook soon becomes Jack's personal playground of terror as Wendy and Danny are forced to fight for their lives against Jack.  Will they survive, or will Jack succeed in killing them as Delbert Grady did to his family?<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Nicholson's performance is first-rate, and his "Here's Johnny!" line has become legendary.  Shelley Duvall does a fine job as the scared wife, and Danny Lloyd's performance of Danny, who has psychological powers, is very good as well.  I highly recommend this thrilling and scary film.  Watch this movie and experience terror without all of the blood and gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>This version was actually scary! Ended the way a horror film was suppose to. This is very moody and has alot of atmosphere. Very Scary too. This is a must see. The Shining (1980) is creative director Stanley Kubrick's intense, epic, gothic horror film masterpiece - a beautiful, stylish work that distanced itself from the blood-letting and gore of most modern films in the horror genre. (The film waits until its climax to provide the typical catharctic bloody violence of most traditional horror films.) The film's source material from science-fiction/horror author Stephen King's 1977 best-selling novel (his third novel under his own name) by the same name, bears little resemblance to Kubrick's creation. But his version was so much better. Come on Stephen King, just face it, this guy's version was scarier!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>While it's definitely not Stanley Kubrick's best film, "The Shining" is a definitely good movie. However, it's not quite up there with the likes of "The Exorcist" or "Evil Dead." The story, based on Stephen King's novel (though King hates the movie), is about the Torrance family moving to the Overlook Hotel to tend to it during the winter. The father Jack slowly begins to lose his mind and is soon chasing after his wife and son, which eventually goes outside into one of the scariest, most haunting chase scenes ever. The movie gets a little boring at times, with shots going a little longer than needed, but the story is very thick and we care for the characters. Jack Nicholson steals the show, however, in a role that will almost have you rooting for him, the villain! While it doesn't really mess with your mind, it still delivers the goods and is occasionally very, very scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining is more of a reimagining of of Stephen King's bestselling horror novel than an adaptation. In my oppinion this is better than the book. It's scarier, and has more suspense in it. Blood? Yes there is blood, but it helps the movie, not detracts. The Shining is terrifying--but not in the way fans of the novel might expect. So any negative reviews are from book purist, or somebody who wants people to think he/she is tough, so see this movie. It is long, but it is worth you time. This is one of the scariest movies of all time! WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>C'mon.

It's scary and funny (for those of you with a sick sense of humor) at the same time! It doesn't get much better than this!<p>But there's only one problem; This DVD [is not good] what's up with the fullscreen format here? Not much bonus stuff either! The cover doesn't tell you much about the film and should be replaced.<p>Well, that's about all I have to say, but hear this; This movie is great, so produce a special edition to go along with it...</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>This film may not be scary, but it has chills and thrills!

However, "The Shining" is filled with horror and it actually scared me, which is rare.  It is about a writer, Jack (Jack Nicholson), who decides to live in a hotel during the winter, with just his son and wife, and no one else in the hotel.  Jack's son can read minds and sense ghosts, which comes in handy because the hotel is filled with ghosts and supernatural beings.<p>  As time goes by, Jack starts to grow crazier and crazier, developing writer's block, while Jack's family is starting to fear him.  During their stay at this haunted hotel, the family is constantly scared by ghosts of people that were murdered in the hotel.  Also, later on, Jack tries to murder is family with an ax!  I am not goin to give away any more of the film, I will let you go and rent it yourself.  Any horror fan will love this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>The Shining is as still frightening today as it was when it was made. Not as much, but it still is. Jack Nicholson plays one of his best performances as Jack Torrance, winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel along with his wife (Shelley Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a special gift (The Shining) that can allow him to see things others can't and talk to people without moving his lips. In addition, a cook also has the Shining. <p>The film proudly shows the style of the late Stanley Kubrick everywhere in the film: Scenes that take place in a bathroom (Three as a matter of fact), very clean rooms with white floors, three-way conflicts, long shots, up-close shots, and a story of dehumanization. It also shows Kubrick's sense of humor, which includes sarcasm (When Jack talks about Danny's knowledge of cannibalism "...You see. It's okay. He saw it on the T.V!") and black humor (A butler with a head injury holds up a glass and says  "Wonderful Party, isn't it?" There is also a seen before HERE'S JOHNNY! when Jack says "Honey, I'm Home!")<p>The Shining is one of Kubrick's best films and one of the great horror films of all time. If you haven't seen it, you're missing a wonderful party!</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>The late Stanley Kubrick made some of the best pictures we have ever seen. His 1980 project, The Shining proved to be a big hit with the critics, and also proved that Stanley can do anything: comedy, drama, thriller, war, and in this case, terrifying and classical horror.<p>An exceptional script from Stanley and his impressive co-writer are one of the key elements in this movie. It's engaging, it's intriguing and it has never been done before, making it a truly original film as well as a horrifying one. The actors are quite amazing, Jack Nicholson in particular in the most underrated performance of his career, and kiddo Danny Llyod manages to be believe every time, he follows Kubrick's instructions expertly as expertly as Scatman Crothers, an underrated actor with something about him that makes his characters so immensly watchable. The only actor who was pretty miscast was Shelley DuVall, who jumps on everything Nicholson says and comes off more as a child awaiting her suspension from school than a trapped, terrified soul. Other than that, Kubrick's direction and Nicholson's shouldering of the film make it one of the most engaging horror films of all time.<p>The Shining is a must-see for all Kubrickian's, as well as most horror fans who look for more in films than just gore and jump-frights.<p>The Shining: A</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>I liked, The Shining it's scary and very weird my, favorite part is  &quot;Here's Johnney&quot; man it's a good horror film, I liked it enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CFNHYZG6WS8.html">A27CFNHYZG6WS8</a><br/><p>Kubrick's best films have always, thematically, had much in common with horror films - e.g. the mental and physical decline of confident male heroes; the intrusion of the past on the present; the preference for cavernous interiors - so it is surprising people found his choice to make 'The Shining' an odd one.  It is only odd if you define the term horror within limited boundaries - a formulaic narrative in which everything is reduced to sensation.  <p>Kubrick parodies these boundaries by throwing in every old horror cliche as 'explanation' for the events in the Overlook Hotel (e.g. horrific crime committed there in the past; built on Indian burial grave; the horror narrative as a sublimated account of Jack's marriage, fear of aging etc.).  All these threads are plausible, and do what the horror film has always done - created a mythic or symbolic space where crises, fears, anxieties, repressions etc. are played out, and normality is in some manner restored.  <p>And 'Shining' is deeply satisfying on all these levels: it is, for instance, the best metaphor for marriage since Beckett's 'Happy Days', a heightening of a very real situation - two people forced to spend all their time together, wearing each other down, making each other feel small until the only release is in violence, child abuse, murder etc.  This is a condition for millions of couples around the world, Duvall's voice only a little more grating, Nicholson only a little more mad than the norm.  <p>The film can also be seen as an allegory for America's past, the spirits of African slaves and massacred Indians come back to haunt a nation on the brink of the Reagan years.  it is a film about what happens to man when this Indian period, the Western, is over, and he must turn inwards, must domesticate himself, become female (Jack is a caretaker, his job is to look after a house).  And it is a film about creative failure, writer's block, where inspiration flows everywhere except that white page.<p>'Shining' could be about all these things and stay within the confines of the horror film.  Kubrick, of course, has never been interested in confines, and 'Shining' plays as the third film in a trilogy that includes '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon', culminating one of the major achievements in the cinema.  As in those films, Kubrick moves beyond mere genre by displacing narrative, with its linear move towards crisis and resolution.  Instead of the past returning to haunt the future, the past, present and future co-exist in a temporal labyrinth, which is reflected in a narrative labyrinth composed of 'reality', dreams, visions, flashbacks, flashforwards etc., with each narrative development repeated or foreshadowed in an endless loop, and physically reflected in the garden maze, whose walls seem to move with Kubrick's camera, and whose model Jack peers over, like a God, or a writer who's just got an idea for a book.<p>As in '2001' and 'Lyndon', Kubrick conflates time and space in 'Shining', so when Jack walks physically in space, he is also walking through time.  'Shining' often feels like '2001', those endless Steadicam shots like voyages through vast, empty, unpopulated space - the film's opening, with its chillingly articulate officials and large lobby hint at a terrifying voyage ahead.  The use of architectural space and the collapse of narrative into dream logic, with the hero forced to confront his various selves in one time, also echo that film.  <p>Like '2001', 'Shining' is unexpectedly, blackly comic, yet also curiously moving - the Gold Room sequences are among the most resonant in all cinema.  The pay-off is unparalelled and devastating.  Confines indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>This scary movie is not your typical one, but its interesting and compelling all the same. Stephen King's horrific bestseller has not entirely been adapted to the screen, and some of the changes that director Stanley Kubrick makes are strange yet they work all the same. If you read the book, which in my opinion is about equal, then you may not agree. Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall give two glass-breaking, over the top performances but Danny Llyod and Scatman Crothers give two great performances here.<br /><br /> The film centers around a caretaker, who is watching over the spooky Overlook Hotel in the Rockies for the winter. But what he doesn't know is that the hotel is filled with ghosts, not pleasant ones either. Nicholson slowly begins to lose his mind [although it seems strangely quick on screentime] The ghosts are scary, yet not your traditional transparent things. The camera work, the editing, and just the feel of it all though is what makes this a modern horror classic.<br /><br /> My advice is to read the book first for better understanding of the story, but never fail to catch this movie alone at night. One thing it never lacks is thrills and spooks! By the way, don't ever watch the horrible 1997 remake, and don't get the titles confused either. This may not be entirely superior to the horror master's novel, but when compared to 98% of the other &lt;a style='text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 3px double;' href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=23&k=horror%20films" onmouseover="window.status='horror films'; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;">horror films&lt;/a>, this one is the King.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', judging by its cult reputation over the years, and its high rating on this website, has become a classic. It has gained a notorious reputation among film lovers. It was horror movie made by Stanley Kubrick, a director who arguably has had greater polarization than any other filmmaker in history. It has a legendary performance by the legendary Jack Nicholson. It has several scenes that have scared the crap out of people, most notably the 'river of blood' sequence. Does 'The Shining' deserve the reputation that it gets, or is it yet another confusing Kubrick film that is overrated?<br /><br />The story is loosely based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It is about a family of three who have to take care of an expensive hotel for the winter. Jack Torrence (Nicholson) is a struggling writer who is the main caretaker. His wife and his son accompany him for the winter stay. What happens during their stay is a series of terrifying events that leads to a tragic conclusion. What is most interesting about 'The Shining' is that it horror film that not like most other horror films. It follows a formula of creating tension, rather that blood and gore. Although there is violence in the film, it is not as explicit or gory as other horror movies. This is a good thing and it is not surprising that Kubrick followed this formula.<br /><br />Kubrick, once again, shows his masterful craftsmanship for film-making. The lighting, editing, and overall technique is unparalleled. It can be argued that no other filmmaker could shoot a film as well as Kubrick did. But at the same time, this mastery is his greatest flaw. What he mastered in the technical side, he gave up in storytelling, character, and logic. 'The Shining' is often goofy and silly, rather than tense and frightening. It is very slow and many scenes and unnecessarily long. Two superstars exist in the film. One is Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />The other is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson gives one of his most memorable performance as a writer who goes mad at his stay in the hotel. His acting is really over-the-top, but Nicholson is such a supreme actor, we do not care because it is Jack Nicholson. Actors do not get any larger than him. Near the end of the film, when he confronts his wife by his typewriter, is absolutely awesome film-making. Nicholson is at his most brilliant. The other people in the film are simply annoying. Shelly Duvall is so annoying playing his wife, it is no wonder Jack wants to "bash her brains in". Danny, Jack's son, is equally annoying. I believe child actors should play a very minimal role in adult films. Minimal meaning they should only say a few lines and take up no more than 10 minutes. I understand Danny is at the center of the film, but do most people really think children have the maturity and ability to be in films like these?<br /><br />Another thing that is annoying about 'The Shining' is its change of subject matter. A film that begins exploring themes of alcoholism and child abuse, slowly turns into yet another silly horror movie. Yet another typical horror movie with the madman with the ax and the screaming woman. One major thing does not make any sense. When Wendy discovers what Jack has been writing for months on end, it has a logical flaw. It suggests Jack has been crazy since the first day he stepped into the hotel, and that he did not go insane over time. Why on Earth would he be crazy from the beginning and why did his family not notice? Should we be asking these deep questions because it is yet another horror movie, or should be ask them because it is a Kubrick film? This is the frustration many people feel after they have finished watching a Kubrick film. It isn't that they don't "get it", they just don't get what all the fuss was about.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In terms of classic horror films, this one is a must-watch for its imagery and quality acting.  However, don't expect to be satisfied with the plot no matter how many times you watch it.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Shining" tells the story of the Torrence family, who are assigned to "house-sit" a large hotel for the winter.  Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) begins to behave strangely, while his "special" son Danny (Danny Lloyd) and wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) must reap the consequences of that trip down insanity road for their father/husband.<br /><br />Easily the high point of this film is Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly being driven completely insane.  With the facial expressions and extreme physical moods/movements that Nicholson brings to every role, he provides the most chilling scenes of the entire experience.<br /><br />The problem, however, is in trying to decipher the overall plot of the movie.  Director Stanley Kubrick basically just bombards viewers with all kinds of different themes, but then steps back in the end to let those viewers draw their own conclusions as to what is really going on.  Unfortunately, many of Kubrick's themes blatantly contradict each other, making it impossible to ever truly "figure it out".  Some elements are borrowed from the Stephen King novel of the same name, while others are original to the Kubrick adaptation.  The mix of the two is not conducive to an understandable plot.<br /><br />Overall, I have now viewed this movie three times, and enjoyed it a little less each time.  I always enjoy Nicholson's screen time, but just get too frustrated trying to piece the plot together.  In fact, a 3.5-star rating would more accurately portray my feelings towards the film.  In all honesty, I enjoyed the King novel more, and would recommend it (if not for the brilliant Nicholson) over this Kubrick version.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>I personally wouldn't re buy every film that comes out on Hd-dvd especially seeing as how the prices haven't really come down.

Be it as lengthy as it is, "The Shining" is captivating in every second of its terrifying glory. I think one of the reasons "The Shining" is so influential is because throughout the entire movie, the characters are continually becoming developed. They grow and grow with each twist and turn of the series of events, and as the plot thickens, they still show signs of unfolding the layers of their persona.<br /><br />Another thing that makes "The Shining" such a great and influential horror movie is that it became one of the definitive movies where the location plays just as big a character role as the lead characters. In this case, The Overlook Hotel, which unfolds the dark and haunting mysteries of its twisted and murderous past, showcases that it plays just as big a role as Jack Nicholson or Shelly Duvall, both of whom are amazing actors here. The concept of the building playing a charater would later influence such great, modern-day psychological horror movies such as the great "Session 9".<br /><br />"The Shining" is a movie that gives a good reputation to horror, because it's one of those movies that you really have to watch a few times to truly pick up on everything thrown in your direction. I honestly didn't fully understand everything until the fourth time I saw it, and by then, the movie went from being a puzzling masterpiece to an utterly terrifying masterpiece! Watching it in the right mood, one can see why this movie made #6 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments.<br /><br />However terrifying this movie may be, it is undoubtedly brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly directed. In addition to all of these positives, the scenery and atmosphere are incredible and quite surreal at times, making the movie even better. It's for these reasons that make it understandable why "The Shining" is one of those horror movies that even non-horror fans can really like.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this movie is that it's not incredibly violent. Through the over two hours that this movie runs, there are only two kills. Although I do get a lot of enjoyment out of the gorier side of horror, I really like the fact that "The Shining" never became too graphic, because that would try to make the movie something that it's not. So bonus point for the movie staying true!<br /><br />Well, I know I built this movie up as much as a skyscraper, so I hope all readers out there really enjoy it! In short, if you're willing to watch a movie's that's quite long and progressive, but heightens in it's intensity and terror until the very end, "The Shining" will be a classic for you! Be sure not to hate on it until you've seen it a few times to better understand it, because if you're like me, by about the fourth time it'll have you terrified! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>Is there a creepier movie than The Shining? This much is true: You won't ever want to stay in the real-life hotels again! The Stanley in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired King while he was here in Colorado, or Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood, Oregon, which provided the exterior shots.<br /><br />In Mick Martin's movie guide, this is one of the few for which "his" review (admittedly, many of the reviews in the book are compiled from trusted reviewers) disagrees with my own in a big way. Specifically, he alleges that Nicholson's performance "approaches high camp" and that the movie itself is slow.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, appreciate the slow burn and feel it gives us time to watch Jack Torrance slip (back?) into insanity. I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Duvall but each time I watch this I appreciate how she nailed the helpless wife/mother. Scatman Crothers (head chef and fellow "Shiner") is great.<br /><br />Taking one star away for the deplorable lack of extras, although I imagine they've corrected that on the newer (Blu-ray?) release.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...but what scares me most about this movie every time I see it (once a year at least) is that I find myself sitting with a grin on my face amusing myself as the Jack-character crosses the border, and becomes more and more and more insane. And I usually would never get thrilled when there are violent scenes (as when Jack here threatens the "light of his life" and their son), but one should be able to call Kubricks' version of "The Shining" a dark comedy as well as it is an epic horror movie. Jack Nicholson carrying the movie with his strong and amazing acting, while the actress behind "his" wife, Shelley Duvall, gives an impressive and intense performance as well. The same goes for Danny Lloyd, the son. Some scenes involving all the actors here are legendary. Just watch the cover of the dvd as an example.<br /><br />A strong experience! Fantastic movie and forever to be a classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I am so shocked that this movie even received one bad review. One. Some of these reviews here say that the movie is boring, too complicated and not scary. When you see Danny riding his little troller, how aren't you hooked. When the naked girl "transforms", admit that you jumped out of your seat.<br /><br />This movie also isn't complicated, you just need to pay attention.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is one of the most creative that I've ever seen. It is said to be unfaithful to the Stephen King book. I never read it and mr. King must be a pretty cocky guy if he thinks that he can remake this movie and top it.<br /><br />This movie is perfect. No, I'm not kidding, it's perfect. Only this movie, Mulholland Drive and Psycho stand as perfect movies in my opinion. What I mean is that none of these movies have any flaws. They are 100% perfect.<br /><br />Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer, takes a job to watch over and maintain a hotel complex up in the mountains in Denver. He goes there with his wife Wendy and son Danny.<br /><br />At firs, he seems to be the perfect fit for the job but that's before he becomes mad.<br /><br />Danny has the shining, an ability to see dead people and horrifiying images. He can also maintain conversations without opening his mouth. Danny Lloyd the actor who played him gives a performance that left me speechless.<br /><br />Jack is also seeing crazy stuff, talking to a guy who used to care over the place who went really crazy.<br /><br />The movie shows Jack on the brink of insanity. This movie shows the fear encountered towards a memeber of your family. And that is trully a terrifying thing.<br /><br />The score is brillinat, going along with the pace of the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is my favorite part of the movie. It is the best of all time. It follows Danny on his troller from behind so you don't know what's around the corner. And that definitely builds up the chills.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance and one of the best of all time. He is terrifying and has so many great lines. Just look at his movements, his tone of voice, his eyes, his grimaces, he is a creepy guy. His perfromance is chilling.<br /><br />Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd also give very good performances notably Lloyd.<br /><br />The Shining is an absolutely horrifying movie, and is one of the few movies that scare me. And I don't get scared easily.<br /><br />See it now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>This 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's novel by Stanley Kubrick is a masterpiece in the macabre with outstanding performances by all involved.<br /><br />Kubrick's story follows King's setting of the Overlook Hotel perched high on the Rockies and set on what used to be an Indian burial grounds.  Jack Nicholson is hired to be the caretaker in the winter season which he hopes will encourage his writing while his wife (Duvall) and son (Lloyd) stay with him.  But the spirit world is alive and well coming to torment his son and possess him (Nicholson) to do horrible things to his family.<br /><br />Unlike most Hollywood shock horror, Kubrick uses wide shots of empty halls and high mountains to add to the feeling of isolation.  An eerie sense of the occult is felt by the playing of a synthesized 'Kyrie' mass and Bartok for incidental music.  The absence of violence in most of the film is replaced by eerie images of ghosts or awkward juxtapositions that defy common sense.  The acting of Jack Nicholson is the main attraction and this is by far one of his best performances on film: I don't see how Kubrick could have chosen a better actor for the part.<br /><br />Although some have complained how Kubrick deviated from King's story: that was the best thing that could be done.  Apart from his short stories, King is not that great at writing long novels such as 'The Shining' particularly in closing his stories.  The movies in which King was directly involved were all flops primarily because of him.  Don't be dissuaded by such reviews and see this great thriller for yourselves: you won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general. Like all of Kubrick's films, the initial reception wasn't very positive but time has been good to The Shining. Still today, it's a film that polarizes some viewers; many feel it's too cold, too slow-moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director. Now, with its availability on Blu-Ray, one is finally allowed to fully appreciate Kubrick's perfectionism. I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen. Fourteen years later, and having seen it many times since, I still notice new things about the film. Watching it on Blu-Ray, I can tell you that the iconic images that make up this film have never looked better.<br /><br />Everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker. The hotel is closed between October and May, with the 25-mile stretch of road leading to it averaging 20-feet of snow. Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel. Once they arrive to begin their stay, Danny, who has been having horrifying visions of the hotel courtesy of his imaginary friend Tony, meets the chef Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who possesses a telepathic gift similar to Danny's. Soon, the family is all alone at the hotel and as the snow starts covering everything in sight, Danny's visions become more horrifying and Jack begins a slow descent into madness.<br /><br />Few films produce so many iconic images. Audiences that haven't seen this film can identify many of them. Danny riding his bike through the halls of the Overlook, the image of the two dead girls, and the blood pouring from the elevators are some of the most recognizable moments in cinematic history. Then of course there's the legendary scene with Jack Nicholson that is featured on nearly every piece of promotional material for the film. For all of its disturbing and even violent imagery, there's less blood and gore than one would expect from a horror film of this stature. The strength of Kubrick's filmmaking is that many people remember The Shining as a violent film, which it really isn't. Even with a miniscule amount of violence, this film contains some of the most nightmarish images in all of cinema. Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying. Anyone who says differently must remember that nearly every truly iconic scene in the film comes from Kubrick, not King. The flip-side of the argument could be that, arguably, the scariest, most unexplainable, and downright creepy scene, which features a man in a bear (or is it a dog?) suit came from King's novel.<br /><br />Kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago. The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking; these are the things people take away from the film. Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying. The film's majestic, jaw-dropping, unexplained and perhaps unexplainable final shot has baffled viewers for years and given them plenty to analyze/discuss. It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.<br /><br />The characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters. Not that the characters are underwritten, but the acting is what burns them into your cinematic memory. This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film. As a concept, the hotel is terrifying but the way it appears under Kubrick's direction makes it all the more so. The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable. It's fine work by a child actor. The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening. Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity. Philip Stone gives the most oft-overlooked (no pun intended) performance as Delbert Grady. Rarely mentioned in discussions, I invite you to consider how quietly frightening his performance is and how quickly and seamlessly he goes from cheerful normality to terrifying menace.<br /><br />Then there's the legendary Jack as Jack performance. Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does. Nicholson has been equally praised and criticized for his performance, with some calling it disturbing and others comical. Jack does go over-the-top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch-perfect. He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth-gnashing, vicious performance is unmatched in the realm of performances in horror films. Jack Nicholson may not be what Stephen King had in mind when he wrote Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is not perfect. Trivial complaints are that the film begins immediately without going to the menu and the menu itself is just the special features, reminding me of older Warner Bros. DVD's. As the film began, the picture quality was not 100% perfect, slightly fuzzy. Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot. Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before. Warner Bros. has a habit of double-dipping with Kubrick films (and by double, I mean I've purchased four different editions of The Shining on two formats) so you may want to wait and see what happens before buying the Blu-Ray, but don't think for a second that you'll be disappointed. I'm sure even Kubrick himself would be at least 80% pleased with the result.<br /><br />To this day, The Shining is criticized for pacing issues but this complaint is all about audience response. I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element. The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing. It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come. Its images still terrifying even with familiarity. It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a writer looking for some time to get away from the hectic humdrum of modern life so he can focus on writing.  Hearing that a a Colorado resort, The Overlook Motel, closes for the winter because of extremely deep snow but needs a maintenance person to stay there during the winter months to prevent major damage, he signs up, bringing along his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd)...<p>My Comments:<br />I remember seeing this on TV (edited obviously) when I was younger, but I didn't remember much of it by the time I watched it again, just a few shots of Jack Nicholson's crazed face.  I can only guess that I tried to forget it as a child so I could sleep.  This must be a very disturbing movie for children seeing as how Danny's father, one of the people he is supposed to be able to trust, is trying to kill him.  <p>Of course, I'm no longer a child and my opinions have changed.  Watching this as an adult I found the movie to be absolutely entrancing.  There are some problems, of course, but nothing particularly major.  First, as the movie worked its way into the depths of Jack's mania my wife and I were discussing what we believed would happen (I really couldn't remember the plot, so this was a fair discussion).  It wasn't that hard to guess based upon the setup - ...  But despite knowing pretty much what was going to happen, there were still a number of unpredictable surprises.  I found the delusional conversations with people out of the past of the motel to be particularly engaging.  <p>The other problem I had with the movie was Shelley Duvall.  Is she not the biggest whiner and wimp you have ever seen?  I think it really came out in the 'making of' featurette that she is all about getting attention; she's like a spoiled child.  Perhaps this worked perfectly for her role, her constant crying and giving in to Jack, but just the story itself and the performance by Jack Nicholson were probably enough to guarantee that whoever played his counterpart would be good.  Not that I can really question Kubrick's decision, it did, after all, work very well, but Duvall is still whiney and annoying.<p>One final comment about the special featurette on the DVD... Though the behind the scenes shots included in the featurette were very interesting and gave a nice additional perspective to what was going on, Vivian Kubrick is not Stanley.  Apparently she hasn't tried to hard to follow in her father's footsteps, thank goodness.  I don't know how you could really spoil the 'making of' featurette of this movie because pretty much everything about the movie is fascinating, but the way she arranges the clips and includes some bizarre shots is more distracting than entertaining and educational.  There isn't really much of a need to be overly artistic with a 'making of' video.  <p>Overall, I don't think I would recommend this movie for children.  However, after having seen it I think I'd like to visit the 'real' Overlook Motel (the outside shots were of Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood in Oregon) to get a pictures; I drove through Fargo, ND for the same reason.  It's a great movie with a classic performance by Jack Nicholas.  If you want to be entertained by a classy thriller, see The Shining.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XVRCU5DQBULH.html">A2XVRCU5DQBULH</a><br/><p>While it's definitely not Stanley Kubrick's best film, "The Shining" is a definitely good movie.

Of all of Kubrik's work, this so far stands as my personal favourite.<p>The film doesn't follow the story too closely to the book.  There are many scenes from the book that are missing ("Stephen King's The Shining" is a closer adaptation).  But it still follows the basic story about a family who takes care of the Overlook Hotel and confronts ghosts.<p>Kubrik's adaptation offers much to think about.  The way the scenes are established still makes me wonder if all the hauntings are real, or are part of the character's imaginations.  The source of the film's horror stems from a psychological kind of aspect and to me alludes to a greater kind of dark force.  That is to say that the horror of the film is not in the ghosts, but in the characters' growing insanity and darkness.  The madness of the characters is real, and is very well portrayed (especially by Jack Nicholson).<p>For all its brilliant acting and provocative cinematography, this film captures the sheer horror of Stephen King's original novel and shoves it deep in the human mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Okay, there has been much debate over this film because of how it doesn't exactly ring true to Stephen King's book. I think it's just as good either way. King should be happy. This is one of the better film adaptions of his books(the other good ones being "Stand By Me" and "Misery"). Jack Nicholson stars as family man Jack Torrance. He gets a job as a caretaker for a large hotel that's closed for winter. He brings his wife and young son along with. The eerie hotel is filled with possessive spirits. Little by little, day by day, Jack begins to go mad as the spirits start to take him over and turn him into a crazy, murderous psychopath, who turns on his family. Sound scary?. It is. There's nothing scarier than when something evil is after you and there is no escape. You can run, but you can't hide. The actors are over the top brilliant. Nicholson. What can I say?. He is one of the greatest legends we have. This is one dandy of a teriffic, classic performance. Nobody else could have done this role. NOBODY. He is creepy and mad, and will get under your skin. There are a few classic(and often hilarious)lines and scenes here. Nicholson delivers them in a pitch perfect portrayal of a normal guy driven to insanity. Shelley Duvall, as his victimized wife, is very effective as well. Director Stanley Kubrick really filmed this classic very well. Establishing the hotel and it's creepy inside was filmed just right. It's long, empty, silent corridors and rooms. Oh lord. It's scary just thinking about it. Some people have problems with the movie. That is too bad. Some others think Nicholson's performance was pure ham and was really overacting. Some times, people, what seems like ham and overacting is what's best. It's acting. Some people don't understand that. All in all, this is a good, well made movie. A classic!.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>I really liked this verion but I watched the mini-series on Sci-Fi the last few nights I noticed few things, like Jack (Steven Weber) doesn't say "Here's Johnney," but I liked the 80's verison but the 1997 is better have a good summer.

Adapted, as we all know, from a Stephen King book of the same name, the legendary director of such classics as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Barry Lyndon" created a picture here that leaves a chill running down your spine long after the credits roll. Too bad King never liked the picture. It's been well documented in the intervening years how the author blamed Kubrick for fundamentally altering his vision. I saw somewhere that King believed that Stanley Kubrick thought his novel was inferior material that needed to be elevated on celluloid. Well, everyone has an opinion. For my part, I don't think Kubrick thought it an unfavorable book even though it is. I read "The Shining" and really didn't care for it that much. It is, in fact, one of my least favorite Stephen King novels. Only "Cujo" ranks lower--and in that case the film version didn't ride to the rescue. King is a great novelist capable of producing fine work, but long after he is gone people will forget his novel and remember Kubrick's translation. Of course I could be completely wrong, but I don't think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the Torrance family--father Jack (Jack Nicholson), mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and precocious son Danny (Danny Lloyd)--driving out to the Overlook hotel for the winter. Jack took a job there as the winter caretaker, a big task considering the resort sits high up in the mountains where heavy snowfall virtually assures his family will be snowed in for months. A struggling writer and recovering alcoholic, Jack sees this opportunity as a great way to churn out a novel. It's not as though he has much else to do in the hotel: there aren't any guests loafing about and the staff isn't around to hassle him. All he's got to do is keep the lights and heat on, call in to a ranger station on the radio every few days, and he can sit back and collect a paycheck. Problem is, spending five months cooped up in a hotel in the mountains can bring on a powerful case of cabin fever resulting in...well...bizarre behavior. It happened before at the Overlook, actually, as Jack learns during his job interview with the manager of the hotel. One previous caretaker took an axe and slaughtered his entire family. Fun! Jack doesn't think such a gruesome event will present any problems for him or his family.<br /><br />Boy, is he mistaken! Jack Torrance has absolutely no idea of the supernatural horrors that lurk in the bowels of the Overlook hotel, but his son Danny does. It seems Danny has the ability to "shine," or read people's thoughts and see things that the rest of us don't see. And what he'll see at the Overlook hotel would give the stoutest among us a massive coronary. Suicides from years past, rivers of blood pouring out of the elevators, and the deceased daughters of the aforementioned caretaker appear as if by magic in front of the terrified Danny. One of the worst horrors resides in room 237, a room a departing employee named Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) tells Danny to avoid like the plague. Hallorann has the ability to shine as well, and is fully cognizant of the powers the Overlook can unleash with ease. As the days turn into weeks, Jack descends into total insanity, terrorizing his stricken wife and son even as he falls under the spell of the spirits in the hotel. There's no sense in dragging this out except to say that the movie unfolds like a relentless, evil dream. "The Shining" isn't so much a film as it is an experience to savor--for those who can stand the terror, that is.<br /><br />Goodness, where to start! The movie fires on every cylinder. Jack Nicholson is sublime as the mentally unbalanced Jack Torrance, capable of menacing subtlety and raging insanity at the drop of a hat. His line "Hereeee's Johnny" is arguably one of the best-known movie quotes in the history of cinema. Those who hate the film usually cite Shelley Duvall as the primary reason, claiming her whiny and weak personality mars an otherwise acceptable film. Horse hockey. Duvall is supposed to be in a fragile state largely because of her husband's past history and her concern about her son's odd psychic abilities. And when she sees her family falling apart again, she cracks under the pressure. I think she did fine. As amazing as the performances are, however, they pale in comparison to the look and feel of the film. "The Shining" is a cold, detached movie like most other Kubrick films. The dread is a palpable presence in every single frame of the movie, whether we're following Danny's big wheel through the halls of the hotel or watching Jack converse with evil spirits. So many great scenes rise to the forefront of my memory as I write: the chase through the maze, that last soul shattering shot of Jack Torrance, and Wendy's discovery of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" all exquisitely torture the audience. This is a frightening film, and its one that never loses its impact with subsequent viewings.<br /><br />The DVD? Surprisingly, we don't get much. The picture quality is quite good, as it should be for a Kubrick film, but extras are lacking. A lengthy documentary about the making of the film with commentary from Kubrick's daughter Vivian does help, yet I can't help but wish for more. I could go on and on about how wonderful a find "The Shining" is for the horror fan, but you probably already know all about this film. If you are one of the roughly five people in the world who haven't seen the movie, I pity you. Get out and see it now!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>Even though I've always had the highest regard for Stanley Kubrick's work, I do have mixed feelings for "The Shining". Even from the first viewing, I never felt that it terrified me as much as it should have.  But it is a film I do re-watch from time to time simply because visually, like most of Kubrick's films, it is so satisfying and the Blu-ray version is even more so.  I won't dwell on the screenplay or performances except to say that they are sometimes yes, sometimes no.  But the Blu-ray disc does bring out the technical achievements of the movie.  The cinematography is excellent as one would expect, but the frequent use of the Steadicam, being used here by Kubrick for the first time, does begin to call attention to itself.<br /><br />I'm glad the BD was released in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio since I'm  quite certain that it was presented in theaters using a 35mm print in 1.37:1 aspect and masked in the projector to get 1.78:1 or something close to it.  In the early aerial shot of the hotel as shown in the 1.33:1 DVD, the blades of the camera helicopter are clearly visible at the top of the frame.  I'm certain Kubrick would never have allowed this, given his attention to detail and I don't think that by 1980 there were many theaters in the U.S. showing movies in 1.37:1.  The video quality of the Blu-ray release is impressive in its clarity, color balance and freedom from graininess and the helicopter blades are nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Somehow I get the impression that the musical portion of the soundtrack is a little too much of a good thing having been, I believe, remixed at a higher volume level relative to the dialogue track for this release.  The music for this film was taken mostly from existing concert pieces by Bartok, Ligeti, et. al.  To have the greatest effect for this film, the music, in many places, should be rather quiet and needling rather than intrusive or overbearing as it often is.  Playing this film in a totally dark room and at a lower than usual audio level will help provide the feelings of uneasiness that the viewer should have.<br /><br />This release makes me pine for a Blu-ray release of Barry Lyndon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>Kubrick made this a masterpiece. More times than not, Stephen King's books are made into a joke on the big screen. This adaptation was definitely not. Kubrick was thought to be a genious... The Overlook Hotel somewhere in the hills of Colorado - what better place for Nickolson to strut his absolute  best work. Shelley Duvall was an excellent choice to play the scatterbrain  wife with the wide popping eyes at all the right times. The flashbacks and  things little Danny sees really set the stage and without being graphic or  gross - totally horrifies you. A few memorable scenes... 1. The Interview,  2. Nicholson is interrupted by Duvall while typing, 3. Nicholson chasing  Duvall up the stairs and cornering her in the bathroom, and 4. the chase in  the snowy cold garden labyrinth. Do not watch this film alone at night.  Classic horror/suspense film that belongs in any movie buff's library.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>The real villian is the OVERLOOK. The use of the steadicam is amazing as  it glides through the magnificent hallways and lounge. Music by Wendy  Carlos is very effective.(I swear that during the maze chase at the end  they used music from 2001!-listen and you will see what I mean).Best scenes  is where Jack is having conversations with the ghostly Lloyd and Grady(who  was the caretaker!).Film is full of those classic trademark Kubrick  elements(steadicam use, slow pullbacks, etc.)This one is a lot better than  that made for tv version which was simply too long.(even though that  version was closer to the book)</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Was the book better than the movie?  WHO CARES!  This movie's got JACK!  Seriously, one of the most psychotic performances in screen history.  Nicholson WILL scare you, and if he doesn't Kubrick will, with his  collection of whacked out special effects and sound effects.  Shelley  Duvall was perfectly cast as the dullard wife in this movie and the kid,  &quot;Danny&quot; gives a chilling performance.  This may not be the same  as adaptation as King's, but one thing is for sure, the Shining will scare  the pants off of you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"The Shining" was an interesting choice for director Stanley Kubrick to tackle.  Generally, when you think of Kubrick's choices they deal with larger themes and you would not think that he would engage himself in a discredited genre such as horror.  When this film was released in 1980 to lukewarm critical and audience reaction, some feel he didn't engage himself in it very well.  What is this film? Is it horror? Is it dark comedy? A hybrid of both? To my mind, whatever it is or whatever Kubrick intended it to be it works.  The movie is about Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson), a blocked writer, who takes a job as a caretaker at an isolated mountain resort for the winter with his wife, Wendy(Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny(Danny Lloyd) in tow.  As the onset of winter presents itself, the pressures mount on Jack and he starts to slowly go beserk by seeing things real or imagined and decides to turn on his family.  Now, alot of people point out that Nicholson telegraphed his insanity early in the film by playing his character broadly from the get go.  But considering the demands that Kubrick put on his actors I believe this was purely intentional.  Duvall also gives a frenzied performance, but legend has it that she was a sensitive soul who cracked under the pressure that Kubrick exerted.  The Overlook hotel set also works as a character in the film, with it's long hallways and cavernous rooms used to terrific effect.  The snow-covered exteriors and in particular the hedge maze that was created for the film enhance the horror.  Stephen King was on record as saying that he despised this film, that Kubrick gutted his novel.  He so disliked this film that he approved a made-for-television adaptation that stuck more closely to his book.  I've read "The Shining" and found it more silly than scary.  I think this film has held up remarkably well and that Kubrick made the correct choices.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.<br /><br />But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.<br /><br />Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.<br /><br />Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.<br /><br />What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.<br /><br />The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.<br /><br />I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.<br /><br />When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.<br /><br />The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.  Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.  Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>I'll put this in perspective: the only other Kubrick film I've seen is Clockwork Orange which I didn't like all that much. So I guess in a way it's perfect for people inquiring about this film since I'm not a "anything director touches is gold" idea. I've never seen Dr Strangelove or 2001 so I'm merely reviewing this as a movie fan and not a Kubrick one, even though the film is quite good.<br /><br />Jack Torrance is a teacher/struggling writer and a job as an off-season caretaker is just the trip he needs to clear his head. Off to the Overlook Hotel with his wife and son, he takes up residence in there only to find that they're not exactly the only occupants in the place. And Jack starts to find himself changing by the day.<br /><br />Earlier I posted a review for the Exorcist, another well-made horror film and another thing felt familiar: the parody of the scenes. Maybe because they're parodied and lose their shock then many of the images in this film weren't scary but more unsettling. But still, love those parodies(All beer and no TV make Homer something something).  The images however are memorable: the twin girls, the blood getting off the elevator and a guy in a bear suit, qualifying for the biggest "what the hell?" moment in film.<br /><br />One thing that did irritate me about the film was the music: it was a bit too overbearing. It's almost as if the music was going "be scared, hurry up and be scared already!". Music in essence shouldn't do that, it should supply it without you being conciously aware of it. While it does its job of being very unnerving and being "scary movie" music, it felt a bit too loud at parts. Another thing the film had which you I can understand is a large amount of tracking steadicam shots. There's probably at least 15 or so in the entire film.<br /><br />With good performances, memorable scenes and good tracking shots(although really used excessively), it's not the most scariest film ever, it's just a really well-done thriller movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This film is powered by 2 things, Nicholson's performance, and the creepy atmosphere set up by Kubrick.  I have read the book, and Kubrick certainly deviates from it, but he does create an effective horror that builds nicely.  I can't imagine anyone else being able to effectively pull off the lead role other than Nicholson.  He transitions perfectly from a regular guy into a madman.  This version improves on the audio and adds a few extras.  Worth getting for any fan of thrills.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>This is going to be a fairly short review.  I'm not going to delve into summarizing the story or critiquing Kubrick's direction.  Frankly, this film has been so heralded and around so long that if you need to be recapped you haven't been paying enough attention.  Long story short, this is one of (if not THE) best haunted house film ever, made by one of the most influential directors in history.<br /><br />Which leads to the question of why I'm giving it a four star rating instead of five?  I'm knocking it a star for the DVD not just EXPLODING with extras.  It's, basically, packed with nothing.  A short half-hour documentary, a commentary by Kubrick's daughter, and a trailer just isn't enough to do this justice.  Where's the commentary by Nicholson or King (who famously didn't enjoy this version)?  Where's the retrospective on how this film impacted the industry?  Where's the reflection by the cast on their experiences on the set?<br /><br />This is a film that should have been an education to dive into and an opportunity to pay homage to a brilliant film-maker.  Warner Bros, however, seem to have decided this wasn't important to us.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>First of all, I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the 2 film adaptations.  Everyone out there seems to think that you need to hate at least one of these, but I don't.  Certainly, this version doesn't follow the novel closely at all, but this isn't an inherent flaw in the film.  It is what it is, and how closely it follows the source material is really neither here nor there.<br /><br />That aside, I just watched this movie for the first time in a couple of years, and I was surprised by how well it has held up.  Actually, I definitely like it better now than I ever did before.  Lotsa people, particularly King himself, have criticized this film as being a well-crafted, great looking film with no soul.(A common criticism of Kubrick's films in general, as a matter of fact.)  I think they have something of a point, actually- I don't like any of these characters much, and they are really quite flat and underdeveloped.  But, the striking visual and atmospheric qualities more than make up for a relative like of human interest.<br /><br />Lots has been made of the changes of the changes that Kubrick made to the general story line of the novel, particularly how the supernatural elements of the story have been downplayed somewhat, and how Jack Torrance is much more imbalanced and hostile from the outset.  I've read a fair bit of analysis/criticism of the film, and come across many laughable interpretations as to why the changes have been made.(Such as the suggestion that the hotel isn't haunted at all, a theory which holds no water whatsoever) Personally, I don't think there really is much of a thematic reason for the changes: Kubrick just needed to condense the story in order for it to fit into a 2 1/2 hour time frame, while adding in a fair number of his own episodes.  More significantly, Kubrick's approach to the material is completely opposite.  Despite the supernatural nature of the story, King's tale emphasized character, using innumerable internal monologues as the characters considered their various plights. Some people seem to act as if the decrease in supernatural activity meant that the psychological depth of the film is greater than in the novel, but this absolutely isn't true. The film version is externally concerned, as we never get to see much into a character other than Jack,(and we still can't really understand why Jack acts as he does) Wendy is reduced to a mere doormat, who rarely says anything more than bland pleasantries and platitudes, while Danny rarely says or does much of anything at all. I actually think this is necessary for the sorta of mood Kubrick seemed to be trying to achieve.  The film is icy, and inhuman- having warm, full human characters would reduce that feeling.  The film doesn't really seem concerned with how or why things happen, but simply on how they are shot.  This is definitely a valid approach,  and the film manages to have genuine amount of discomfort at pretty much all times, even when not a whole lot is actually going on.<br /><br />As with virtually all of my favorite horror movies, `The Shining' has stunning music and visuals.  The music is largely avant-garde classical stuff, from Ligeti and Bartok and others.  It's not the sorta thing I'd likely enjoy listening to it by its self, and it used to rather annoy me, but it's quite startlingly effective during the film.  I particularly like the song used during the opening scenes.  "Dies Irae' I think it is.  Visually, this isn't quite like anything else I've ever seen.  It was made shortly after the creation of the steadicam, and Kubrick apparently fell in love with this new apparatus, illustrated by the near perpetual use of tracking shots.(If anyone ever moves from one part of the hotel to another, you can rest assured that you will get to see them walking there.)  I'm not really sure why the steadicam was used to  extensively, but it really works, establishing a visual motif to the film, and giving us a sense of the size and isolation of the Overlook, as well as illustrating the monotony of life their via numerous similar camera angles/movements.  That, and I just think that smooth, steadicam shots are, well, cool.<br /><br />`The Shining' has quite a few powerful images, even if some of them don't really seem to be here of there.  The famed blood-flood coming out of the elevator in slow-motion is extremely cool, and actually kinda creepy, I think.  The twin girls are quite creepy  as well, particularly when Danny sees them in the game room, and they somehow manage to seem to be floating, only semi-corporeal.  His final encounter with them is quite stunning as well, particularly the tight tracking shot of him rolling through the surreal, dollhouse corridors of the hotel.(Though there `scary ghost voices' don't quite work)  The final chase is quite excellent and nightmarish as well.(The hedge maze is very cool in general, as a matter of fact)  The absolute best shot would have to be just after Jack here Danny scream in the kitchen, and rises up from below the frame, nastily grinning.  Sadly, the encounter in 237 is totally botched.  It's just.... stupid, for the most part.  Kinda gross, no doubt, but pretty silly and it hurts the atmosphere of the film as a whole. But, the rest of the film is good enough that  it doesn't matter.<br /><br />The acting is more than competent, though nobody other than Jack Nicholson really does all that much.  Nicholson's performance is generally loved or loathed, but I come down somewhere in the middle.  He's pretty damn over the top much of the time, but well, he IS supposed to be crazy, ya know, and some of his other scenes are a bit more nuanced than many of the critics would have you believe.  He's definitely entertaining, and quite menacing at times, particularly in the very last act, after the main encounter in their apartment.<br /><br />Well, that's it.  Definitely one of my 10 favorite horror films.  I'd recommend you read the novel first, partially because I like it a lot, partially because the movie likely won't make a whole helluva lot of sense to someone who hasn't read it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>The box-blurb for this digitally renewed version of Kubrick's 1980 Masterpiece claims that this is the &quot;first epic horror film&quot;, at least according to Newsweek's Jack Kroll.<br /><br /> Now, not to be disrespectful to Mr. Kroll, nor indeed to belittle the movie itself (over which I am about to wax lyrical), but he seems to have forgotten William Friedkin's seminal meisterwork &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, released some seven years previous, and before that, Bela Lugosi's throbbing, heaving, sexual, meaty 1931 performance as Dracula, in the movie of the same name.<br /><br /> But if that was the first epic horror movie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; the second, then Kubrick's &quot;The Shining&quot; comes a very, VERY close third, and in many ways, beats those other masterpiece works of cinema at their own game.<br /><br /> First of all, &quot;The Shining&quot; is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, but is not altogether similar to the book, so to satisfy the book-lovers amongst us (myself included, a teriffic read and one of King's unequivocal best) I'll just say this: the film version of &quot;The Shining&quot; is one of those joyfully rare things where the novel loses nothing in the translation. In fact, thanks to the Screenplay's omission of several key-to-the-Novel vignettes (hedge animals, boiler, Jack's alcoholism) the movie production is able to concentrate on an altogether more frightening angle: without any apparent character deficiency or flaw, Jack Torrance is subverted anyway, to the same grisly ends, by the malevolent Hotel. It makes for a compelling comparison - in the book, Jack's troubled psyche is present ever before he sets foot in the Overlook, but here in the movie, the power of the Hotel is such that it can take a normal, angry man and turn him to... ...things. Unencumbered by such character exploration and explanation, (which works exquisitely well in the novel, a counterpoint, if you will, to the madness of Overlook Jack), Kubrick (Rest In Peace, you deserve it!) is able to weave a magnificent and nightmarish story out of the simplest, most mundane of threads, and creates in the movie a Monster which is all the more terrifying because of his apparent normalcy.<br /><br /> Now, to synopsise the plot: Jack and Wendy Torrance, and their psychic son Danny, move to the Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter. Jack's the new winter caretaker and, looking forward to having lots of quiet time and isolation to get on with his new Novel, he begins to go slowly insane, while Danny begins to notice more and more the creeping evil contained within the Overlook. To say more is to spoil it, but trust me, it's worth every damn second of screen time.<br /><br /> Performance-wise, we have Jack Nicholson playing Jack Nicholson, but here it works oh-so-perfectly-well. The indefinable sense of rage and malevolence he radiates during the scenes where he is watching Wendy and Danny through the lobby windows, and the yowling Baby Jane-esque mania of the movie's final reel bear all the hallmarks of truly great acting. We believe that this is Jack Torrance, we believe that he is evil, and we believe that he is subjected to all manner of psycho-supernatural abuse by the malevolent hotel. He is, in short, perfectly cast in his role, and gives one of his finest performances in &quot;The Shining&quot;. In her role as Wendy, Shelley Duvall is a light, a wonderful actress portraying with scalpel precision the frailty and ignorant fear of a woman caught in the middle. Her portrayal of Wendy is as accomplished as it is endearing, and of the three main leads in the picture, hers is the most developed character - the contrast between placid, sweet Wendy at the start of the movie and the unhinged, terrified end-Wendy is brought about by Duvall's exquisite ability to showcase a broad range of believable emotion in a relatively short amount of screen time. Danny Lloyd as Danny Torrance is excellent, the much-parlayed 'Redrum' scene is a gem, and he is perfectly believable as the psychic Kid with the weight of the World (or at least, the weight of the Overlook) on his small shoulders.<br /><br /> The Direction is what sets &quot;The Shining&quot; apart, but with a genius like Kubrick at the helm, what can we expect? It's like music; the staccatto, stark interior shots of the monochromatic lobby interior and sterile kitchen make for the most terrifying visual contrast with the dream-like, expansive opening sequence, and the snowy, winter-wonderland exterior scenes provide the absolute sense of isolation that the Torrence family must indeed be feeling.<br /><br /> Musically, I don't believe I have ever seen a film scored more perfectly. Shades of Max Steiner (Mildred Pierce and Now, Voyager) abound as the jangling violins and human-like guttural bellows create an ideal and perfect aural accompaniment to the already ideal visual.<br /><br /> I can't rave enough about this masterful, terrifying and altogether absorbing piece of work. It must be owned and watched, and that is all.<br /><br /> Simple, isn't it :-) ?</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I had never seen this 1980 film before because I generally avoid films dealing with the supernatural.  But now, more than 30 years later, I wanted to check out what this famous Stanley Kubrick film was all about.  Well, it sure is a horror film.  It held my interest throughout and kept me at the edge of my seat, waiting for the next surprise that this famous director had in store for the audience.<br /><br />The acting was exceptional.  Jack Nicolson and Shelly Duval star as a married couple with a six year old son who agree to be caretakers in an isolated luxury hotel during the winter months.  The child has an imaginary playmate and hears voices and sometimes he speaks nonsense in a grown-up adult voice.  Jack Nicolson seems like a well adjusted teacher who craves the isolation in order to write a book.  But he soon turns into a homicidal maniac.  His performance is nothing less than absolutely great and is certainly one that skyrocketed him to a fabulous career.  Shelly Duval is lesser known but I am surprised her name is not a household word.  She has unique looks with gigantic eyes that express the horrific conditions she is thrust into and I just couldn't take my eyes off her.<br /><br />Then there is the plot, of course, which was adapted from a Stephen King novel.  It is weird, twisting and held my interest throughout.  And yet it made no sense.  Frankly, to me, the movie was just a vehicle to watch Shelly Duval scream and Jack Nicolson gradually go insane.  Yes, the film was well crafted by one of the greats in the industry and the film has become a classic in every sense of the word.  However, my logical self yearned for a plot that made sense and a satisfactory conclusion.  But I guess that is just too much to ask for with this kind of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KLP39OKXD5P.html">A5KLP39OKXD5P</a><br/><p>'The Shining' is quite a cinematic experience powered by powerful performances from Shelley Duvall and Jack Nicholson.

But anyhow...<br /><br />So many good reviews of this movie have been written about the plot, etc.  I just want to give my evaluation and opinion of various things.<br /><br />The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King.  Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece.  I like nearly everything about this movie.  I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981.  This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing.  Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time.  Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified.  Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities.  The story and setting are very simple.  The hotel itself seems to be a character itself.  The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening.  There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel.  Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.<br /><br />The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.<br /><br />The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion.  She was totally believable.  Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.<br /><br />The electronic musical score is great and very memorable.  It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the bar scene where Jack is having a drink and talking to the bartender, the scene where Wendy discovers what Jack has been typing all along, and the chase around the maze during the snowstorm.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time.  It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies.  Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it.<br /><br />This two-DVD set contains commentary by Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown and historian John Baxter, the theatrical trailer, Vivian Kubrick's documentary called The Making Of The Shining, and featurettes called View From The Overlook: Crafting The Shining, The Visions Of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick does horror.

Homicidal rages from a formerly easy going author (typing nonstop pages of "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" is hilarious) taking orders from the ghosts and supernatural beings that in habit the hotel.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJ48SG">2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) is known for his almost maniacal style in doing take after take.  Shelly Duvall had the most number of takes ever, I read.<br /><br />The movie does have its chilling, insane moments.  I enjoyed the boy's horror but was not sure if it was "Tony" his imaginary friend talking or Danny himself.  The ending is thoughtful but a bit of a let-down (the 1921 photo).<br /><br />Overall, not a shabby movie. But really, how did Jack get out of that locked refrigerator?  Hmm?<br /><br />The "making of" was shot by Vivian Kubrick, and you really get into the heads of the cast and what they were thinking as shooting progressed.<br /><br />Other Kubrick Flix:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UJCAKO">Stanley Kubrick: Warner Home Video Directors Series (2001 A Space Odyssey / A Clockwork Orange / Eyes Wide Shut unrated / Full Metal Jacket / The Shining / A Life in Pictures)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>Any Stanley Kubrick film is difficult to review because he was in a league of his own, directing films in his own way leaving little room for comparison.  While I've never cared for the way some of his films are acted neccessarily, I've always loved the way they've looked and the way the make you feel.  This makes Kubrick a suitable fit for the horror genre.  The Shining, to me, has always been the ideal horror film, taking familiar horror elements to a new level.<br /><br />While the film strays quite a bit from its source material, the ideal ingredients for the horror to take shape are there - mainly isolation and the cold of winter.  What better way to be scared then to be locked up in a large hotel for the winter where the phones don't work and Jack Nicholson can go nuts.<br /><br />The real star of this film is the camera though.  Kubrick has a thing for long takes and tracking shots.  The best shots in this film occur when Danny is in the hallway.  The classic shot  that haunts me to this day is when Danny is riding his tricycle through the hallway revealing the forever eerie twin sisters.<br /><br />The rest of the action is fairly predictable once Jack starts going nuts, and while Kubrick doesn't really stretch the paramaters of the story, his eye for creating horrific landcapes with his lens in the all too sterile Overlook Hotel are gripping to this day.  Add to that the tense score by Wendy Carlos and you have an unforgettable horror masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference!,  Now, the Blu-Ray is out and now the film has taken another giant leap.  It makes the other versions look primitive.<br /><br />On its own - and I'm not a horror movie buff - I found it to be very entertaining and very suspenseful film. Those visuals are so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her "Olive Oyl" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.<br /><br />If you are any kind of a fan of this film, or director Stanley Kubrick's unique style of filmmaking, you owe it to yourself to look at it on this high-definition transfer.  You'll be amazed how great it looks.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>To be honest, when I first viewed this film in the early eighties, I thought that Stanley Kubrick had completely ruined Stephen King's best novel. But, now that i'm able to mentally segregate the film from the book, this is a classic horror film with a terrific DVD transfer that I saw last night. As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri-fecta at sea level. Add a secluded mountaintop hotel with a notorious past  that this trio will inhabit alone for the next six months, and you have all that you really need to know. Now, go buy a perfect stocking stuffer for the "King" residing in you.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>Stephen King's books have usually made a transition to the screen ranging from so-so to god-awful, but in &quot;The Shining&quot;, Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that is actually better than the book.  It's tight, spare, lean, mean, and spooky as hell.  From the marvelous opening, of a lone Beetle making its way up a spectacularly beautiful and utterly empty mountainous terrain, we get a sense of the crushing loneliness and isolation that eventually drives the film's protagonist over the edge, coupled with his out-of-control alcoholism.  Jack Nicholson is a diabolical presence as Jack Torrance, the frustrated playwright who takes an off-season job as caretaker of a once-glamorous hotel gone slightly to seed; after being kicked out of his teaching position at a posh prep school, it's the only job he can find to support his clueless wife and his five year old son Danny.  Danny has the &quot;shine&quot; on him, which means he has the gift of Sight, and he is able to see, as neither of his parents can, the ghastly doings that have haunted the old hotel where he and his family are trapped for the long winter.  Jack's descent into madness and his wife's growing panic are wonderfully portrayed in the film.  Probably nobody else could have played this part as effectively as Nicholson; with his peaked eyebrows and sardonic, twisted grin, he even looks devilish.  Shelly Duvall as his wife overdoes the shaking and quaking in some scenes, but she is very good as the wife who just wants to protect their son and get them both out of this possessed hellhole alive.  The only disappointment in the film was the diminished role of the cook Hallorann, who understands Danny's gift because he shares it; although Scatman Crothers was very good indeed in this part, we saw much more of him in the book and we should have seen more of him in the movie.  The cinematography and the music are both excellent and effectively contribute to the film's atmosphere of haunting isolation and insulation.  King must have been glad when he saw this movie that at least one of his books came out right on film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I, for the first time, saw this film this weekend and I have to say that it was truley terrifying.  They just don't make horror films like this anymore.  It's very hard to find a film that chills your bones and gets under your skin like The Shining does, and it's equaly hard to find a villian who haunts you long after you've seen the film like Jack does.  Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.  My only complaint it the overly obnoxious acting on the part of Shelley Duvall who played Jack's wife.  She was really annoying.  Danny Lloyd who played the son Danny (it's funny how both Jack and Danny play charactors named Jack and Danny) was frightening.  I rest my case, little kids are creepy as hell.  The whole redrum scene where he's in his mothers room and he's repeating 'redrum' over and over in this demonic voice, I was cringing...It was so nerveracking.  That poor woman...no matter how annoying she was, she had to deal with a crazy husband weilding an ax and a crazy psychic son.  The scene where she locks Jack in the storage room and he's pleading with her to let him out...where he was like "you hurt my head real bad" I mean, that was acting genious.  This film proved what people have been saying forever...Jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.  Watch this film.  While it may not follow the book to a T Kubrick is a cinimatic master and with Nicholson as his main attraction with is a show worth it's weight in gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6OI36USYOU1.html">A3D6OI36USYOU1</a><br/><p>Hard to disagree with Stephen King himself on that point. Highly disappointing if you're a King fan, but if you're another robotic Stanley Kubrick worshipper you will probably love this thing. <p>There's nothing scary or terrifying here, except Danny's constant spastic shaking and drooling, unless of course you're one of those people that has a habit of looking under your bed at nite to see if the boogeyman has paid you a visit. Boo!<p>And if I was stranded on a mountain in a haunted hotel, no doubt that Scatman Crother's would be my first choice for a rescue. haw haw Some semi-haunting and nifty visuals as you might expect but the story doesn't gel, and people...you'll want Shelley Duvall to be disposed of in the most gruesome manner possible. What were they thinking casting her in the part of Wendy? <p>Nicholson was great in his prime, but this movie could have been so much better. King's best work gets the chop on the altar of artistic creativity. Two Axes.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>This classic remains a sensational, psychological thriller over 25 years later.  The story remains the same but now it comes in fantastic high definition.  Stanley Kubrick's vision was different from how Stephen King originally wrote it.  Although it's Kubricks vision that makes this movie so enjoyable.<br /><br />Set in beautiful Colorado the story is dark in a bright environment.  Jack Nicholson plays an average father named Jack.  Jack has been unemployed for a few months and is trying to be a writer.  To further his writing he takes the opportunity to move his family to a desolate resort in the Rockies.  The resort closes during the Winter and hires Jack to be a caretaker during that period.<br /><br />Jack's son Danny has begun to exhibit abnormal behavior by making an imaginary friend out of his finger.  This friend tells Danny things that seem to exhibit a special ability.  Jack's wife Wendy just seems to want everything to go right in their lives.  Unfortunately the move to the resort is the worst thing that can happen.<br /><br />Most of the acting is excellent in this movie and the scenes are still scary at times.  Even though movies have become more action packed and fast paced The Shining still shines.  That is why movies like this get even better with time.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is okay.  The remaster is not the best I have seen for an older movie.  The picture is more defined but still not what I would like to see.  I am not going to mark down the score since this movie is too good for that.  The picture is better and the price is right.  For people who want to add a wonderful classic to their Blu-ray collection, The Shining is quite the movie to have.  For the price it can't be beat.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.<br /><br />But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.<br /><br />Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.<br /><br />Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.<br /><br />What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.<br /><br />The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.<br /><br />I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.<br /><br />When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.<br /><br />The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.  Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.  Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>To me, THE SHINING has to be looked at from several different angles. First, as a horror movie THE SHINING is a classic in the same league as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN,  and ROSEMARY'S BABY. Then, I look at how it stacks up as a Stanley Kubrick movie. In this regard, it's also a classic, with it's isolated / desolated atmosphere, and cold, vast set-pieces. Next, I judge THE SHINING against other Jack Nicholson films, and yep, his Jack Torrence role is up there with his take on the Joker in Tim Burton's BATMAN and his version of Satan in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK. This is malevolent, crazy Jack at his best! Lastly, I ask myself how good THE SHINING is as a Stephen King movie. Well, it's right along-side of CARRIE and THE DEAD ZONE as far as I'm concerned. I loved King's novel and have read it many times. I just see the book and the movie as two completely separate entities that can be enjoyed on their own merits. So, I give THE SHINING it's due as a chilling masterpiece...</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>No longer scary by today's standards, but The Shining is still a great thriller. The obvious reasons for it being so good are because of the acting talents of Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack makes one creepy looking dad, even when he is sane. The script is just so well written and the actors do so well, how can you not be sucked into the movie? Being a Simpsons fan, I can't help but think of the parody they did of the movie years ago. This is just a classic film that may not be as scary as it once was, but it is still a great movie, and that will never change. Other remakes of the film have tried to capture the power of the original film, but nothing can touch this</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>It starts off slow, but once it gets going it is a journey into the mind of a psychopath. It is definitely a horror classic. To this day, it is still one of Jack Nicholson best rolls (in my opinion). It is great to see what rolls actors will pick up when they are trying to get discovered or trying to make bigger names for themselves. Anyway, I'm sure you have all seen it, but if you haven't, isn't it about time you rented it?</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Shining" is a strange horror story based on a novel by Stephen King.  When watching this, you need to remember Stanley Kubrick is the director and he tends to have a lot of "white space" or time for artful like scenery.  Much of the first part of the movie has scenes of long winding roads, driving miles and miles up a mountain to a beautiful hotel.  There are also scenes of a young boy riding a three-wheel trike through long halls and empty rooms of the hotel.  A garden maze is also featured with tall green bushes cut in at least an acre of ground that the young boy and his mother navigate as the main character seems to watch above a model inside the hotel.<br /><br />At the beginning, after a three hour drive for a job interview, most of it up the sinuous mountain road,  an aspiring novelist, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has an interview for an off-season job at a enormous Chalet-Type Hotel isolated in the Colorado mountains.  Jack, his wife (Shelly Duvall) and his young son (Danny Lloyd) move in for the five winter months, with the agreement to maintain the elegant hotel.  They will be isolated as the road to the mountain top is not cleared during the heavy winter storms.  Jack is told of the scary history of the hotel, which included murders by another custodian that they feared got "cabin fever" from being alone so long.  Jack laughs off the possibility he will get cabin fever, he just wants to be alone to write, and this job fits his needs perfectly.<br /><br />Sinister powers begin to seep through the hotel and then flood it with chilling horror.  With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>You've probably seen this movie before. Either that or you've at least heard of it somewhere. Yes, Stanley Kubrick's loose adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" has become one of the most famous horror films of all time. It's been praised by critics including Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin, and has been parodied in music videos and TV shows such as The Simpsons. It may not be loved by Stephen King himself, but I, including millions of others, love it. It's not your typical Hollywood-style horror film, and it doesn't want to be like one. It doesn't have any loud "jump" music or annoying teenagers or underdeveloped villains. This is a very unique film that stands on its own. It's not the blood and gore that make this film very special, but the eerie atmosphere that is present throughout the film. It also delivers some haunting images and iconic performances. Now I do like a few recent horror films such as Saw, Event Horizon, and House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Shining remains as my #1 favorite in this specific genre.<br /><br />Like many other Kubrick films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Full Metal Jacket, critics and audiences have analyzed the entire movie. There have been film critics and college professors who always discuss everything from the opening aerial shot to the photograph right before the end credits. I don't think that's really necessary, because The Shining isn't supposed to be fully analyzed. It's up to us to decide for ourselves what the story is all about. For some, it could be the effects of isolation and how it transforms into insanity. For others, it could be how the spirits that dwell in the Overlook Hotel are messing with these people's minds. For me, I would go for the latter. True, a few scenes seem like they come out of nowhere, and have no relevance to the plot (the man in the bear costume, for example). But the images themselves are so grotesque and so undeniably scary, that you can't help but be amazed by them.<br /><br />But aside from the ambiguous story and some terrifying images, I think the strongest elements in the film are not only the eerie atmosphere, but also Jack Nicholson's performance. Nicholson is without a doubt a fascinating actor; he knows how to play crazy. Here, you can see some fine examples. Nicholson was rightfully cast as the lead character; he knows how to be frightening and intimidating when he slowly becomes psychotic. It's a very effective performance, and one of his greatest in his entire career. The other performers do extraordinarily well themselves. Scatman Crothers is believable as the chef Dick Hallorann, while Danny Lloyd is surprisingly good as Danny. Shelley Duvall, despite all the complications during filming, really pulled it off with her character Wendy. Her fear and desperation look genuine. I don't think anyone else would have done a better job than her.<br /><br />At least 95 percent of the reviewers here have nothing but praise for this movie, and I am part of the majority. I won't say much about The Shining, since it'll probably make this review look like a short story, but I will say that it's one of my favorite films, and my top favorite horror film of all time. Kudos to Kubrick, Nicholson, Duvall, Crothers, etc.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a caretaker during the winter months at an elite isolated hotel in Colorado that is closed down for the season. At this hotel (way up in the mountains) only he and his wife and son live, and what follows are weeks of hell as Jack (the name of the Nicholson character) becomes almost possessed by outside forces. He becomes arrogant, verbally assaulting, and violent, as he attempts to kill his family. Shelley Duvall is heartbreaking as the desperate wife who tries to escape this hellish hotel with her son. The film (based on the Stephen King novel) was directed by genius Stanley Kubrick who also co-wrote the script. The movie was not without its problems during production: Nicholson was not pleased with the many times in which the script was rewritten, sometimes minutes before the scenes were shot. He eventually quit memorizing pages the night before, instead memorizing the lines given to him before the camera rolled. Shelley Duvall suffered exhaustion from the emotional aspects of her character. For the baseball bat scene Kubrick demanded Shelley do it over and over for a total of 127 takes!. Duvall eventually suffered severe hair loss. When "The Shining" was originally released to theatres in 1980 the movie was pretty much forgotten, only becoming a modest success. Most critics even panned the film. However, over the last 30 years the movie has become a true classic thanks to the home video market and huge DVD sales. Truely a scary film with excellent performances, especially by Nicholson, I watched this one three times in one weekend. Very rarely do you get horror films with this kind of acting. In one word: excellent. This two disc set also contains the trailer, behind the scenes footage, commentary, and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Shining starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall is a solid horror film from start to finish.

Jack Nickolson's character "Jack Torrance" - an aspiring writer suffering from writer's block takes up an odd winter job where he has to act as a keeper for the Overlook hotel during the peak winter months when it closes down as the roadways that lead to the hotel get blocked with snow during the winter. So Jack's job is to just stay at the hotel and do some small maintenance activities that require some manual intervention. So Jack moves in with his family (wife and son) to the hotel. The Hotel has a bad and spooky history of an earlier caretaker who was on the same assignment as Jack but ended up slaying his wife, 2 daughters and himself. It was explained as a spree of killing which was caused by the intense isolation caused by being cut of from the rest of the world staying at the hotel when access to the surrounding areas are blocked out by snow , and the depression that this isolation created for the caretaker. Jack then undergoes the same symptomps as he slowly falls into the madness that his own mind creates and ends up hunting down his wife and his child. This is a real frightning and freaky movie with non existent gore save for the few illusion seens when Jack and his child see the slain ghost people. This is a cult classic that sends shivers through your spine. Best to be seen all alone when no one is in the house and after dark. And the main fuel of the movie is the spooky acting of Jack Nicholson. You are genuinely scared of the character "Jack Torrance" that he plays. He brought such a realistic madness to the role. Kubrick and Jack Nicholson make this film work.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>I mean, he's as psyhchotic in the beginning as he is in the end.  Jack is talking about the people who ate each other in the olden days, a story he is telling to his son on the way to the hotel. His face and voice, however, look and sound just as freaky as they do at the end of the film. It's almost a little too hilarious. <p>The Shining is a masterpiece, a classic, yadda, yadda, you already know since all about since nearly 400 hundred people have already reviewed it. If there is an impossible chance that you know absolutely nothing about this film, you will find a great horror film about the mental breakdown of a man, only in Kubrick's version we can't really begin to see when Nicholson goes nuts. <p>NOTE TO VIEWER: There are a number of hilarious parts in this film, the scene where Nicholson is staring aimlessly out the window for one. There are, as it should be, a few very freaky parts too. Look for the boy going nuts, it's very freaky. Also, the segment about the dead lady in the tub is scary. <p>WATCH THE MAKING OF THE SHINING, it's enough to make you pee your pants in laughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson is one my favorite actors (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,A Few Good Men,Anger Management and his latest  coming soon,The Bucket Trip). I will admit The Shining stands as a movie in which horror comes alive thanks to Jack's role as Jack Torrance. He delivers a solid performance as the caretake along with his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall) and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd). A good beginning but the action picks up when cabin fever begins to set in on Mr. Torrance and, well, you have to find out for yourself. Just be careful if someone carries an ax around the premises!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>One cannot deny that Kubrick's vision of THE SHINING is brilliant.  The atmosphere is eeery, and while not entirely scary, can be difficult to watch late at night in the dark! The story focusses on a family who go up into the mountains to look after a hotel which is shutdown during the winter months.  Jack Nicholson is spot on as the father who is slowly going mad. Is it from the isolation, or is it from the evilness of the hotel itself?  Shelly Duvall plays his wife, and while I think they could have chosen someone better to play this role, she pulls it off adequately.<br /><br />The marketing of the movie itself has a life of its own.  In the UK, it got poor reviews from a test audience in 1980, so Kubrick edited the film for international audiences down to a 113 minute version (in a sense a forced "Director's cut"). This version is what all DVD's outside of America now feature. At least Kubrick made the cuts, and not Warner Bros.<br /><br />Not having seen the longer 143 minute version, my concern is that the edited version does not answer many questions. I have read that the US version looks at the father's alcoholism, whereas the international version overlooks this.  One Aussie reviewer states that the edited version is "nicely paced with more energy". To me it just feels like something is missing from the international cut. It would have been nice of Warner Bros to add this additional 30 minutes as deleted scenes to the international DVD's.<br /><br />Aspect ratio - originally filmed in 1:66 format, and transferred to DVD as 1:33 as requested by Kubrick. Best viewed on a standard TV. Kubrick was not a fan of widescreen movies.<br /><br />Best advice to anyone considering buying this, is to grab the US DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Brilliant, creepy horror from Kubrick, with mesmerizing camera work and bizarre, arresting set pieces. Nicholson is a marvel to watch as his character evolves from a slightly odd but functioning adult to raving psychopath. Scatman Crothers is also memorable as the hotel's only other resident. Based on Stephen King's book, the film has Kubrick's slightly twisted genius all over it. Look for those wild tracking shots as Danny rides his tricycle indoors.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is an assualt of isolation similar to the equally great 1982 remake of the Thing. This movie weaves it's web of terror slowly and digs its claws into you. Jack Nicholson is way over the top in this movie but I don't think it takes away from the film in fact it adds a little sense of camp to it. The hotel itself is the star of this movie though, and the cinemotography is top notch. Stanley Kubrick always tended to be somewhat mechanical and detached from the emotions onscreen as it is in the Shining, but the coldness adds to the bleak terror of it. The book is a lot different in the tone it sets and is also excellent. This movie version stands better on its own than as an adaptation of the novel. REDRUM.</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>This film is disturbing and scary. It kept me on the edge of my seat for almost all of its two and a half hours running length. In Kubrick's tale things start to get spooky at a remote Colorado hotel, and as the characters discover they are trapped, so we discover we are trapped with them, shut up in an amazing labyrinth with an axe-wielding madman we have suddenly found out we cannot trust.<p>Music (mainly by the Hungarian composer Bela Bartok) and camerawork are the chief contributors to the atmosphere of a film which is one of the few genuinely frightening I have experienced.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>I don't think anyone looked more-forward to this movie than I did when it came out in the summer of 1980.  "The first epic horror film" was its tagline.  I'd read the novel and ate up the hype and saw it opening day...and then left the theatre a little confused: it didn't scare me.  At all.<br />The critic for Newsweek said that THE SHINING made THE EXORCIST look like ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET BEELZEBUB.  Really?<p>I will say that THE SHINING is probably the most beautifully photographed horror film ever made.  The scene where Jack Torrance sells his soul for a glass of beer to the patient, creepy Lloyd the bartender hints at the evil behind the Overlook Hotel.  Satan closing that simple deal in the cavernous ballroom is one of the film's highlights for me.<br />But the movie never gets any momentum.<br />I've read as many Stanley Kubrick biographies as I can find (some good, some really bad) and I believe the reason THE SHINING doesn't work is fairly simple: Kubrick never believed in an afterlife.  He believed in evil in the world, evil in human beings, but the idea of Satan, ghosts, the supernatural eluded him.<p>Stephen King said in an interview back in 1980 that Kubrick would call him at all hours to pepper him with questions during production.  Questions like, "Do you believe in God?"<br />(In the Argosy article back then, King said that he told Kubrick that he didn't.  Since his horrible accident, King now tells the same story--except that he now says he told Kubrick he did).<p>And, in my opinion, when you keep this in mind while watching the film, you understand that Kubrick's normally razor-sharp perceptions as a filmmaker appear a little vague and out of focus.  The emphasis shifts from a malevolent haunted house to one guy losing his sanity.<p>The DVD is worth it for Kubrick's daughter's documentary, "The Making of THE SHINING."  As a lifelong Kubrick fan (DR. STRANGELOVE is, in modern terms, still Da Bomb), I'd never heard the reclusive director's voice until this DVD came out a few years ago.<br />What I really missed though was the second trailer from 1980, the one they played on TV just before the film was released.  The DVD includes the first trailer--the single shot of the elevator opening to release a tidal wave of blood in the hotel--but does anyone remember the TV commercial?  Wendy Carlos' throbbing main title plays as different shots from the film roll.  No dialogue.  And one of the last shots is Jack with his face pushed through the shattered door--but not the shot from the film!  It's some alternate take (and there were a slew of them).  He's laughing hysterically, his face locked in satanic glee, all teeth and eyebrows...and his eyes are dead with evil.  Somebody, please dig that out!  Over 20 years later and I still remember that!</p></br><a href="../users/AT7W1EXT0PF2Y.html">AT7W1EXT0PF2Y</a><br/><p>Ok. Anybody that's seen this movie knows about that scene at the end where there is this man in a dog/bear costume. It's the scariest scene in this movie or any other movie for that matter. Some reviewers, such as Howard Tuttleman assume that there was a lot of cut footage that explained the whole dog/man legend. I doubt it though. But the truth may be a lot more terrifying. There is a Scientology book by L. Ron Hubbard called the Creation of human ability. It is a book for high-ranking scientologists but you can find it on ebay sometimes. The cover of this book has...a man in a bear/dog costume. Just one problem this book was written long before the Shining was made. 1954. Just what the hell is going on here?! So I read the book but there is nothing about the man/bear/dog thing on the cover. Is this false advertisement, or is Hubbard trying to tell us something? Or perhaps the director of the shining is trying to tell us something. Maybe the guy just walked on the set that day in the cosutume and he is trying to tell us something. I don't know the answer but there is more to this man/bear/dog thing than people are letting on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>The Shining is just a great ghost scary movie that has it all from start to the very end!!!!!

No recent filmmaker has more effectively depicted ideas and created movies that literally defined generations; such films by Kubrick include "2001: A Space Odyssey," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dr. Strangelove," and most recently Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in the psychosexual thriller "Eyes Wide Shut." Twenty years ago, this infinite artist completed "The Shining," one of the scariest movies ever made. The film, based on the similarly horrifying novel by Stephen King, is vivid in its characters and overpoweringly haunting with its terrifying undertones. Stanley Kubrick co-wrote, produced and directed this thriller that is well worth the view.  Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies. He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation. One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.  Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company. But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the "shining"), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel). And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac.<br /><br />Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, "The Shining" has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie. The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible. Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror. While grand in scale is its beauty and terror, it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. Jack Nicholson extensively defines Stanley Kubrick's horrific masterpiece. His performance is outstanding, easily the best of his career. He intelligently depicts a character of intensity and raw barbaric depth. Also perfectly cast is Shelley DuVall, performing with fright-inducing intricacy. Danny Lloyd, best compared with today's Haley Joel Osment, is top notch as well.<br /><br />Although "The Shining" is a precarious, well-portrayed adaptation, its conclusion is disappointing in the highest regards. With such an effective first and second act and superior character development, we come to expect more than a lazy, disagreeable closing like this; "The Shining" does not execute the climax in which it builds.  All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  Certainly one of the most engrossing and interesting films of the genre, "The Shining" will always be adored by some and scrutinized by others; it is this kind of enigmatic triumph that makes cinema so grand and so disappointing in the same breath.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Shelley Duvall is just plain weird, and Stanley Kubrick morphed Stephen King's bestselling novel into something almost unrecognizable, yet THE SHINING stands the test of time and continues to scare generation after generation of wide-eyed viewers because the one-card-shy-of-a-full-deck Jack Torrance is so aptly and believably played by a demonically grinning Jack Nicholson.  No other part has been so tailor-made for Creepy Jack, who fits into the lead role like wiggling fingers into a well-worn glove.<br /><br />Kubrick supplies the heady visuals:  a luxury mountain resort, about to be abandoned for the long winter, with its whispers of the past, labyrinth of hallways, and dark shadows.  Duvall and Nicholson supply the tension:  a struggling writer about to go off the deep end with his wife and small son living as caretakers at the resort, while the wife watches helplessly as her spouse unravels.  The hotel plays its part helping Jack Torrance descend into maniacal madness, giving Nicholson the vehicle he needs to grin and grimace and scream and shout as he terrorizes his family with flesh-crawling creepiness.<br /><br />Sure, there are plenty of flaws; the film becomes silly and disjointed as it rushes towards its climax, some of the visual gimmicks (gallons of what looks like cranberry sauce spilling out of the elevators) are lame, and Duvall was definitely a weak link, but it doesn't take away from THE SHINING's ability to terrify.  I don't know what it's like firsthand to watch a man become violently evil, but Jack Nicholson in this movie gives me a pretty good idea.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A1VZLLDNLURGJB.html">A1VZLLDNLURGJB</a><br/><p>Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING is one of the films that I have not changed my opinion on over the years. In fact, like most Kubrick films, I find that it gets better with each screening. It was an unqualified five star film experience because of the master direction of Stanley Kubric.<br /><br />I didn't even know when invited to see this film by a friend that it was a Stanley Kubric movie and went to see it on a week night.  Needless to say I told my wife about it the moment I got home and asked her to see it that weekend.  Even though this film was not terribly true to the King novel we both felt that it was another wonderful Stanley Kubrick movie.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the performances of both Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall. Jack Nickolson said during an interview that he really wished that he could have been in another Stanley Kubrick film.  Shelly Duval stated during her interview that Kubrick was merciless, but did help to bring out her very best performance.<br /><br />I saw this film when originally released in Connecticut in 1980.  A few days later I overheard two ladies speaking about Jack Nickolson's performance in the mall and tuned in to hear what I thought would be great praise for both the actor and director of THE SHINING.  I was very surprised to hear that they thought Jack Nickolson should be ashamed of himself and that Kubrick had some nerve to release another such film in the United States (I assumed they were talking about CLOCKWORK). I guess they thought that Kubrick brought out the very worst in Jack.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I love The Shining and I saw it for the first time when I was 9 or 10. It scared me back then. Now, being 24, it still creeps me out, but as a whole, it really isn't a frightening movie. Thats not to say it isn't a good one. It is. The 2 little girls in the hall...There is no scarier image. It has been ingrained in my mind ever since I first saw it. The tense atmosphere certainly helps the movie out and the climax is quite suspenseful. The true reason this movie is rated so high is because of Jack Nicholson. He created this perfectly creepy character and people still quote him years later. He is the reason the movie succeeds in being a horror/thriller. Great actors make great movies, well mostly. Obviously over 20 years old, the movie look dated and bland at times, but it still stands the test of time and that is the most important thing. If you are looking for real scares however, look somewhere else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>(4 1/2 *'s) After all these years, I hedged at the prospect of watching `The Shining`.  Having seen the snippets of Jack Nicholson's skillful performance, I partly dismissed the movie.  In my mind, thinking of his famous line, "Here's Johnny!" the film seemed a novelty, something entertaining in a way it wasn't intended.  Between Stanley Kubrick's amazing direction and Nicholson's and Shelly Duvall's excellent performances, first impressions can be misleading.  Watching `The Shining' is a real treat.<br /><br />Most people are familiar with either the film or the Stephen King book or both, so I'll be brief about the plot:  Jack Torrance (Nicholson) is a former Vermont school teacher, transitioning as a novelist.  He interviews as a hotel keeper during the off season in Colorado's high country with the prospect of bringing his family to the empty domain.  During the interview, his new employer delicately lets him know about a tragedy at the hotel several years ago:  A former caretaker became unhinged by cabin fever and had slain his entire family with an axe.  Unfazed by the history, Jack signs on the dotted.  At home his son Danny has rough times.  A visionary of sorts, his other personality picks up on future ominous events, making the boy dread their new venture.  At the hotel, they meet the head chef, Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who picks up on little Danny's perception with an ESP type awareness.<br /><br />Both the story and Kubrick's masterful direction make 'The Shining' a horror classic.  From the start we get vertiginous mountain views and all of the visions seep into our unconscious core, making the deep winter mountain adventure chilling indeed.  Seldom have I seen such an effect of going around the bend.  Whether from the point of view of boy on a Big Wheel ? or in an outdoor labyrinthine evergreen maze, the suspense of danger around every corner is palpable.  Foreshadowing is amply present, constantly building up every scene to each chosen climax.<br /><br />While nearly a flawless horror movie, there are a few objections.  Jack makes some connections to the horrible past in ways that are meant to be authentic, but break some of the mood of the movie.  While the time frames are well connected between present and past, the execution leaves something to be desired as Jack finds a key player in the past.<br /><br />Despite this minor objection, `The Shining' is a thriller.  The aftermath of my latent viewing is awe for Nicholson's creepy performance as the slowly transforming Jack, and Duvall's portrayal of growing terror is unnerving and frames Nicholson's performance perfectly.  Like Linda Blair before him, Danny Lloyd is perfectly believable as the little boy.  Happy Halloween! -JP |:>[</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This is one of my favorite horror/suspense movies of all time. I recall that when I watched it when it first came out and I was younger, Duvall's character 'Wendy' irritated me so much I was begging Jack to 'give her the axe' (I know, what a thing to say). Watching it at an older age, her character doesn't irritate me for some reason. Jack Nicholson's antics always amaze me and I never seem to tire of them. I was surprised to learn in some trivia that Stephen King wasn't happy at first when he was chosen for the role.<br /><br />When an alcoholic on the wagon agrees to isolate himself and his family by taking a winter caretaker position at a large Colorado hotel, it seems like the perfect job, especially for an aspiring writer who hopes to finish his novel. Then old ghosts hatch a plan to tear down the serenity of the lodge and replace it with their haunted past. This movie will still keep viewers on their toes, despite having been filmed in the eighties when many advances in special effects hadn't been made. 'The Shining' is so character driven that it really didn't need all the cinematic tricks. I really miss director Stanley Kubrick and his magic.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

After watching "One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" I had high expectations for "The Shining". I am also a fan of Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />"The Shinning" is about writer Jack Torrance. He is a husband and father. One day he gets an offer at the Overlook Hotel being the winder caretaker. The reason he wants this job is because he is a writer and this hotel he will be working at is huge and isolated at night, so he can focus on his writing. While writing he would have frequent outburst when he was interrupted and having a hard time starting. His son has the gift of Extrasensory perception. Before they even move into the hotel, he has a vision of his father chasing him with an axe.<br /><br />"The Shinning" has a very complex and confusing plot line that actually takes away from the rest of the film. I think part of the reason why the plot is so complex is because "The Shinning" is based off the novel by Stephen King.<br /><br />Overall, "The Shinning" has good acting by Jack Nicholson. He is the reason why the film earns 4 stars. The plot is also good, but I think this is the case where the book is better then the film. I say this because I'm sure that in the book Stephen King can do a lot more explaining of the story.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>the shining is by far one of the best bone chilling movies. so good, so sinister, and jack nicholson is superb. stephen king does it again, what can i say the man is a genius. it doesn't hurt that jack is a great actor either. just goes to show what a little cabin fever, and an evil hotel, in an isolated mountain can do to a person, and a family. what is real what isn't. who can you trust, where do you go when you're all alone? just imagine yourself in a huge hotel, where no one can hear you scream, where no one can find you, where although you're alone, always feel that someone is just right behind you. where things far worse than even your worse nightmares are real. what does it take to make you lose your mind. it's everything about this movie that will make your skin crawl.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>there is no other word that can describe this movie once it is over.

While containing small aspects of what the book wished to convey, there is nothing believable about this movie, unlike the totally  engrossing novel. This movie tends more to concentrate on the effects of  blood and gore, showing scenes of two little girls' chopped up bodies, Jack  sinking an axe into Halloran's heart (VERY GRAPHIC), and a possessed Danny  who talks to his finger in a voice that seems to come straight from the  catacombs of hell. Maybe that is what Mr. Kubrick wished to convey, but it  certainly does not do justice to the brilliant novel. Even the room that  Danny is warned about, Room 217 in the book, is changed to 237 in the  movie. WHY? And what is with that stupid maze thing in the garden? It makes  no sense to me. This movie as a whole doesn't make sense, but then we soon  forget that Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, made no sense either. This  is not a movie for fans of the novel, and if you want a movie that follows  the novel, then try to find the 1997 miniseries starring Rebecca de Mornay  and Steven Weber. That's the best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This is a great horror movie, no one can deny that.

Thus it contains multitudes. Embedded meanings and dark nights of the soul that underpin what is essentially a small scale story of isolation and madness in an isolated Colorado hotel. Like the novels of Samuel Beckett, the Shining strips human psychology down to the floorboards. And what is revealed is a wretched and inescapable image of terrible things that men have done in the past, are doing now, and will do again in future time.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I read Stephen Kings the Shining when I was 9 years old and the book frightened me, I could see in my minds eye the Overlook Hotel, its starkness in the winter, the isolation that the family had to endure, I always loved how King could take buildings and breathe into them a misty haunted frightening humanity of some kind. The first movie I ever saw Jack Nicholson in was One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest, and then I saw him in this, so I automatically see him as crazy, his wild eyes and forehead and that hair help with that vision greatly! Although the book explained what Shining was in more detail, Kubrick shortened it enough to get the point across, to me his films although they are visceral and sometimes leave a bad taste in your mouth, are so cleanly lit and the sets are maddeningly perfect.<br /><br /> I was certainly scared, of "that" room, the lady in the tub, the twin girls, all the blood, but what I was most scared of was how badly that hotel wanted that family to suffer and die, and how desperate Wendy was to save her child and realize that by doing that she had to kill her husband. Kubrick really got across the struggle between disbelief and the resolve to survive. The only thing I couldn't stand, and its no fault of Kubricks, or Kings, but the whole "redrum" chant to this day is a bit comical for me, because everyone copies it, holding up their finger, making their voice strange and gravely, I even do it at inappropriate times, like when I see some kid in the mall with a bowl cut. I would recommend anyone who hasn't see this classic movie, to buy it. Don't watch it on TV, because its just so edited its "Overlook Light".</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>Classic horror film starring jackie boy, and to this day some parts are still funny. I think bashing someone's brains in qualifies for "hurting" someone hehe. The most disgusting scene in this film was when he went up to the room where the woman who supposedly straggled danny was, and jack sees a beautiful naked woman in the bathtub, and she gets out and begins kissing him, and he suddenly felt that something was wrong and glances in the mirror to see what he was REALLY kissing and caressing, and it was an old women, who's body was deceased and rotting from the decomposition, and the water was all gross and her skin was falling off with huge brown patches of missing skin. And that horrible deranged laugh that was constant as she tried following him out of the room, kinda scary if you see this for the first time and don't expect it hehe. That scene makes me wanna hurl, and i think the movie the faculty copied that scene when the old woman walked into the shower room, and her skin was also loose rotting and gross, anyways lol. This film gets under your skin, no pun intended, and the parts when it showed the twin girls chopped up and bloody use to scare me as a kid. This was indeed a successful horror film, and many movies stole ideas from the shining, but werent successful anyway. I never get tired of this movie, jack nicholson is one of my favorite actors of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>This film has ONLY two things going for it. Kubrick meets Nicholson and the advent of the award winning cinematography technology - Stedicam?. True Kubrick fans will agree that this is a highly overrated, undernourished, ill-plotted and inapt adaptation of a Stephen King novel. Even Stephen King agrees with that! The film is marred by an intolerably sluggish beginning and middle act that is supposed to build up to an all out finale of mad proportions. The truth is that it had all been done before in 1979 in an equally as well known film called - The Amityville Horror.<p>The premise is simple. Husband, wife and kid move to a hotel for a snowy winter. Kid has the gift of the second sight, wife is just your average stereotypical "nicey nice" housewife, husband is working at the hotel to keep it running while the owners and the guests are away. He is also writing a book. The hotel turns out to be haunted. This slowly drives the husband insane. He then tries to kill his family with an axe and the wife and kid freak out of it in the process.<p>The Amityville Horror is the original "mad family axe man" movie. It is also the original mad family axe man novel! Both novel and film precede King and Kubrick's vision of the exact same theme, except here you have a hotel that is haunted instead of a house. No points for originality there. You would do the original owners of this theme a great disservice by giving it to Kubrick and King instead.<p>The entire film looks great because of the fluid Stedicam work that goes up the stairs, down the hall, and into every nook and cranny seamlessly. Nicholson does a great job of going insane and then absolutely crackers in the end. Everything else in this film is utterly tedious material that will try your patients to the very last thread. Kubrick did all of his "one million takes" to get that shot. Okay he got the shot, but he forgot entirely about the script and what makes a movie tick. We could say that it is all about the performances - but let us look at that more closely. The kid in this movie says very little and just usually looks scared or intrigued by something, but that is it. Shelley Duvall is the most clich&eacute;d driven character you will ever see. She does little more than attend to Nicholson's every demand in the most sterile of performances that ends up with her doing a lot of screaming. Obviously everybody was made to look dull in this film so that Nicholson's raving lunatic would eclipse their roles. Unfortunately Kubrick should have gone further and got Nicholson's performance to eclipse the entire movie. It goes nowhere near transcending the banality of its 143 minutes. The last 30 minutes is all insanity and chasing the family around with an axe. The other 113 minutes is sheer nothingness as people see a few ghosts and just visit places in the hotel. Nowhere does this film work itself out to excuse almost two hours of its pretentious, exaggerated, hollow setup - and that is all those two hours are. It is a big setup of the hotel, its haunted parts, more areas of the hotel and the family staying together in solitary.<p>Don't by into the flamboyant grandiose big names that went along with this abhorrence of storytelling. The ending, which this whole movie is based on, does absolutely nothing to justify the rest of it. When you sit through this thing from start to finish you will see through its phoniness for what it is. When you couple that with the fact that it is a rip-off, it only lowers everything even more. That is why I give this a 1 star rating.<p>As a fan of the genre this DVD goes where it should belong. Among the other awful direct to video horror movies that gather dust at the back of the shelf as testimony to the great horror films that sit in front of them for regular viewing and cover polishing.</p></br><a href="../users/AG6UYD56VHOG1.html">AG6UYD56VHOG1</a><br/><p>Amazon, again why won't you post my review?<br />Good HD DVD of a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>Jakc Nicholson was SO over the top in this movie it is embarassing. &quot;HEEERRR'S JOHNNNNY!!!&quot; I mean come ON...please. The little boy moving his finger and saying &quot;Redrum&quot; in that growly voice is also embarassing. Shelly Duvall was so obnoxious and whiny you almost wanted something to happen to her; not sympathetic at all, neither was the little boy. There were fleeting moments of tension and great photography, period. Another, later version, was far better than this, and stuck to King's original story, which needed no guilding/amplifying/re-creating. Nicholson's smarminess, Duvall's crying and whining, and the little boy with his &quot;redrum&quot; were enough to send me screaming fomr the room...not from the horror but from the embarassingly bad peformances, screenplay and direction. Love Kubrick, Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece, but this one...well, I've already said it. Stephen King is a great writer; bring his stories to the screen as he wrote them! PLEASE! When other people try to change his books, the result is almost always catastrophically bad, case in point.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>Don't get me wrong, I love Stanley Kubrick's The Shining very much. It is my favorite adaptation of Stephen King's works. But this DVD just sucks. The Shinning was shot in full-screen, so this DVD is cropped. Also this DVD is missing over 20 minutes of footage. I repeat: Steer clear of this crappy DVD.<br />Stick with the last release, because it does the film justice.<br /><br />P.S. The only one of these 5 new releases of Kubrick's films that is worth buying is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest are not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COQ2DOO1O9HD.html">A1COQ2DOO1O9HD</a><br/><p>While I could grouse about the picture and sound quality of this DVD (as others have), I won't.  Purchased as part of the Stanley Kubrick Collection, The Shining has become a favorite disc.  <p>As the title of this review suggests, the best reason to hit the Add to Shopping Cart button on The Shining is the accompanying documentary &quot;The Making of the Shining&quot;.  Unlike the usual E!-type pabulum designed strictly to hype the film, this little 16mm gem was made by Stanley Kubrick's daughter as an exuberant tribute to what her dad did for a living. Her conversation with Jack Nicholson in a bathroom mirror - she holding the camera, he brushing his teeth - is a wonderful, insightful moment.  So is the footage of Kubrick directing Shelley Duvall, the cast rehearsing lines in the cavernous kitchen set, and the various interviews with cast members.  If you want to see what Stanley Kubrick was like at work, this, sadly, is your only chance.  <p>Like Barry Lyndon before it, The Shining seems to be, in part, an experiment. As Barry Lyndon shows us what a Kubrick costume drama would be like, so The Shining answers another eternal question - &quot;What would a Stanley Kubrick horror film be like?&quot;<p>Oddly, the other Kubrick film it is most like is 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It has about the same running time; the same four-act construction; the sense of isolation; the long, wordless passages; a supernatural element; a homicidal maniac (HAL in the previous film, Jack in the latter); and a headlong rush into the unknown at the end (flying down corridors of light in 2001, running down corridors of a hedge maze in The Shining).  The clich&eacute; is true: in some ways it is a thinking-man's horror film.  <p>The Shining works on at least two levels. On the surface, we have the populist, iconic imagery - &quot;Heeeeers's Johnny!&quot;, the blood pouring from the elevator, and Tony the gravel-voiced finger-puppet of doom.  At the end, Kubrick even has fun with us by doing something we would not expect of him - the terrified wife sees visions of cobwebs and skeletons bathed in theatrical blue artificial moonlight. It's meant to be a grim joke about the genre. But like a great illusionist, Kubrick is misdirecting us, catching us off-gaurd with deft but cheap cinematic tricks so he can work on entirely deeper level. In this respect, The Shining owes more to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness than to Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th.  <p>This duality led to many critics to dismiss The Shining in their first reviews, as they responded to only the surface of the film.  It did not earn blockbuster dollars in its first theatrical run, either.  But then The Shining's second layer - the film the subconscious sees - began to take hold, and The Shining started to haunt our collective dreams.  In a quiet moment, the memory of Danny Torrance wheeling his tricycle through the corridors of the Overlook will bubble up, and bring a genuine chill we may not have even felt when first we saw it.  The Shining is most effective for its after-effect, rather than its initial catalogue of haunted-house theatrics.</p></br></body></html>

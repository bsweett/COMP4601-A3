Perhaps she was channelling how she felt about being in the movie, because the script is entirely undeserving of her attentions.<br />Not that it is completely without merit - the concept of a woman who lives the days of a week out of order giving her first a chance to know her husband is going to die, and then perhaps a chance to change it before it happens, is quite a good one.  The opportunity is wasted though, as plot logic flies through the window, along with our suspension of belief.  Apart from a brief chat with a priest, no explanation is given as to how this premonition happens, or why it would happen to her.  The plot therefore leads you on with the hook of `will she make it?' in a ticking clock sort of way, before fizzling out into a stock-heartwarming message about how we approach life being as important as death etc etc.  Not that it's a bad message, but the movie just does not decide which way it is going until the end... and it is too late to rescue an audiences involvement.<br />On the plus side, music is good - both suspenseful and melancholic by turns, and the acting across the board is good - with the exception perhaps of the husband, who fails to convince us of being the man that would hold Bullock's devotion the way he does.<br />Not a complete disaster, but neither is it worthy of a recommendation - for Bullock completists only.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Even before the negative reviews and bad word of mouth happened, I knew this film would not be a good one. It just looked like another unnecessary remake of what wasn't even a good Asian horror film in the first place. But let's face it, and I'm probably not the only guy that thinks so, but Hollywood likes familiarity. When certain films get successful, their thinking is "well the public probably wants more then". Well no, we don't want tons of remakes; we just want good movies and sadly to say, Premonition isn't one of them.<br /><br />Linda is a housewife married to Jim and has 2 daughters. One day, Linda receives the shock of her life when Jim dies in a brutal car accident en route to a business meeting. But strangely she wakes up the next day and finds out that he's actually still alive and hasn't even went on his trip yet. This continues as she wakes up and finds it a different day, husband's dead and every time she wakes up she's either seeing Jim still alive or long since dead. Can she change the future and save her husband's life?<br /><br />In the original, a man loses his wife and child in a car accident but finds it hasn't happened yet however he can also see other's deaths before they happen and even prevent his loss. Here, she's basically caught in a time warp that for some reason just likes to mess with her. It's never really explained right away why she has to experience a certain day before another but then when it is and we see how her knowledge of things helps her in other situations we don't really care since they're kind of distracting. Can she save him or not? That's the whole point but we see other vignettes such as a creepy psychiatrist, a blonde woman, scars on one of her daughter's faces that you feel like "come on already, get to the point."<br /><br />But this is a remake of a horror movie so in that basis: is the film scary? Well no, at times it's not even creepy. This is more a bad character study in how someone can grieve and experience traumatic events and whether you can change them so those of you looking for thrills and scares might look elsewhere. Of course sometimes certain screwy logic and an ever-changing timeline just makes kind of a mess of things.<br /><br />In Crash, Sandra Bullock did a more dramatic role but thanks to the awful, contrived dialogue she didn't really feel like a full character. Now, since practically every scene has her in it she can flex her muscles although you kind of wish someone else was in it since she's always been that fun gal from Speed and romantic comedies. Julian McMahon, who I really only know as Dr. Doom from Fantastic Four films, is good but he's kind of underutilized. And you can tell Peter Stormare is lazy casting; not that he's bad but he's always played off-center types from Fargo and Armageddon so casting him as a creepy doctor just felt like easy casting.<br /><br />Should you rent it? No. There are far better movies out there but if you have to absolutely see it, try it but I doubt you'll like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Sandra Bullock does the best she can here, but that's with a substandard script and lackluster direction.  This film does not feel very original or unique, and it seems as if everyone in it is trying too hard to make it plausible.  Something really funny: SPOILER!!<br /><br /> When Sandra sees her hubby's car blow up after being hit by a big rig, she is still yelling at him to get out of the car!  How in the heck is he supposed to do that?  Too funny.  But also too silly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I see plot holes sinking this ship!<br /><br />Premonition is about a woman, Linda (somewhat believably played by Sandra Bullock) who in some mysterious way is living out another time period where her husband dies about two weeks later.<br /><br />What gets me about Linda is how it takes her so darn long to figure out what is happening.  For example, she sees a bottle of lithium that was dumped down the drain in her sink and has no idea how it got there.  She looks at the bottle and it has a doctor's name on it, Dr. Roth.  Then later, when she falls asleep she reawakens in her new world, looks up Dr. Roth whom she has not met yet.  She tries to explain what's happening to her, where she believes her husband is dead but he's not really dead.  Dr. Roth thinks she's nuts and gives her a bottle of lithium.  Later in the day, she dumps it in the bathroom sink.<br /><br />Does she say to herself, "Wow, that's just like in my earlier dream!" Or say "Maybe since I've reliving this before I will see what I can do to change it."  Nope, no clue.  The audience (me) is frustrated that Linda is not figuring out any of this.<br /><br />The characters are very cardboard.  Her mom, for example, has her committed to Dr. Roth's care because of something that happened to one of her children (we don't yet know why at this point).  No real explanation other than implying Linda somehow was responsible for her daughter being cut up.  Later in the tale, when she relives the earlier time (yeah, confusing, and convoluted) her daughter goes through a plate glass window.<br /><br />Now, why would her mother call the psychs to lock up Linda if Linda had nothing to do with her daughter getting cut up.  Don't get it.<br /><br />Oh wait, gets better!<br /><br />Linda finally figures out (she's pretty slow) that she's reliving some other time.  She makes a calendar of sorts and starts to figure out what's going on, without telling her mom because of her predilection for locking up daughters in mental hospitals.<br /><br />Another throw-away scene tries to explain what's going on.  A priest she visits (not sure who or why) opens a book (which is not explained where he got it) that goes over people reliving other times and see them as warnings.  He then goes over how some people can't change this because "nature abhors a vacuum" and that if you don't have faith or love then you are doomed to your fate.<br /><br />OK, fine.  She takes this to heart.  She tries to love her husband and children more.  She tries really hard.  And then [SPOILER] the thing that she fears happens anyway, DESPITE her efforts!  Inexorable fate.  Can't change it, despite faith and hope.  Yuk!  [END SPOILER]<br /><br />Sandra Bullock walks through her part, a bit clueless and has a cheating husband on her hands who is also clueless.<br /><br />The script does not have that neat Hollywood polish of a happy ending which, frankly it really needed!<br /><br />Like Clooney's "Perfect Storm", you love the characters and yet they meet their end anyway.  The film makes you feel empty and lifeless.  Not suicidal, but almost.<br /><br />There are much, much better Bullock movies.  Skip this one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K0WBXW">The Proposal (Single Disc Widescreen)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECM6S">The Blind Side</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA1WE0">Miss Congeniality / Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (Double Feature)</a></p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I guess I'm not a Sandra Bullock fan, I don't like one movie she's in, and I don't like Julian McMahon (who is he?) either.  They both gave wooden portrayals of their characters, leaving you feeling empty inside.  Julian McMahon came across as a primadonna, all the while I was thinking "honey you're not that cute, get over yourself".  The plot was all too confusing and had me lost most of the time, and at certain points I stopped caring about whatever happened. I couldn't wait for it to end, this movie was painful to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>The hook for this film, at least for me, was Sandra Bullock.The fact that she is in a reasonably Eerie film is a bonus.<br />Watching the film is very definitely a stream of consciousness sort of event, and works like a dream ( sort of like a light version of "1408" in that respect). So I never felt I was watching it for any sort of morality event, but I guess the key component is make sure you know what you love and care for, and Love and Care for it  every day, since you never know when it will be gone, in part or in full.<br />The DVD extras are mostly light, and don't add to to the movie experience; however, Making Premonition is a fun collection of documentary like moments, and the Commentary shows some insight about Sandra ( always a plus in my view), but after you have seen the film, check out "Bringing Order to Chaos" and "Real Premonitions"; Bringing Order helps with the film, and Real premonitions show some chilling real life events.<br />Whilst PREMONITION may have been a relatively low budget film, it works well, it can be seen by many, it is not as Grotesque as the Butterfly Effect, but it is not about that sort of hard handed temporal paradoxes, it is a simple conundrum of what is the most important thing in my life. Sandra Bullock scores beautifully with a great film, wonderfully crafted.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Spoilers - ------- - - ---The main character did some involuntary time traveling throughout a certain week.  The things she learned during this week, since it was out of order, caused her to inevitably kill her husband.  However, she knew he was going to die on mile marker 220, but why didn't she tell him to not go there and definitely not stop his car there?  The main characters become total idiots at the end of the movie.  "Do you trust me? (then pull out into the middle of the highway without looking)Nice going. Unsatisfying ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway.  This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death.  The dreams are in between dreams and reality.  It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions.  In one, he's dead.  In another, he's alive. They are chronological. They each seem so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track.  As you expect, she goes through "am I nuts?" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation.  Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it?  Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?<br /><br />I found it a very interesting movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Sandra did a great job.  And the movie leaves you thinking. . . I also loved the ending.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>I watched this film tonight.  At least I think it was tonight.  But instead maybe I had a dream I watched the film, but won't actually watch it until Wednesday night.  In any case, blame it on the roses, blame it on the wind but I'm not sure I completely followed what all was going on.  Spoilers ahoy.  Read on if you've already seen the movie.<br /><br />As far as I can gather, there seem to have been multiple possible histories competing with one another for actuality.  In one possible history, Sandra Bullock is estranged from her husband and they have a crumbling loveless marriage, though he does wind up falling all over himself to give her some head.<br /><br />In another possible history, which seems not actually to have occurred, a sinister psychiatrist is drugging Bullock with... Lithium?  Did the screenwriter research this at all?  Lithium is not an antipsychotic, nor is it very widely prescribed for people whose heads are coming apart so bad they don't know whether they're Hall or Oates.  But Lithium, nevertheless, is most sinisterly prescribed.  I think the same shrink may have sinisterly suggested magnesium supplements as well, in a vaguely suspicious barely concealed French-Canadian accent no less.  Ah well.  But it was not to be, apparently.  Nor was it quite to be that Bullock gets popped into the loony bin for slicing her daughter's face up.<br /><br />However the film-makers do at least supply a blooper reel featuring an assortment of mystics culled from the north of Britain ("I sez to me Harry, I sez, Don't let's tonight... it gives me a rum go.  An' that seam night the pub caeved in on isself, teakin' the souls of thirty football supporters down wi' er."; "Yar... I seen 'im: the Loch Ness Monster, sure as'm standin' 'ere!"; "I seen the trein go off the rails, real bloody-like, joos like it duz in me bleedin' paintin's.")<br /><br />But getting back to the movie, in the end, it does seem to have seemingly come to pass that hubby gets a bionic haircut from a jack-knifing gasoline truck... though one can't be fully sure this really happened.  After all, the movie in its entirety could have been a bad dream that the viewer... I mean Bullock, yes, Bullock, had and was now in the process of being disabused of as she walks out of the theater... I mean prepares to sell the house her husband bought with that raise he got for being promoted at whatever company he worked for selling whatever it was he sold.  It does indeed seem that the house her husband bought for her didn't bring them much happiness, and the poignancy of the movie resides in this subtext of family life gone awry and no possibility of touching those we hold dear.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Okay, it's Sunday morning and Sandra Bullock suggests that Julian McMahon take the two little girls out for some Sunday fun, while she makes an emergency Sunday morning visit to her local Catholic Church.  Am I crazy or what?  When she gets to the church, it's completely deserted except for the kindly parish priest who tells her, "Haven't seen you for a while."  He has plenty of time to sit her down and tell her historical stories from his research into premonition.  Why didn't the Church have a few parishioners in it--why wasn't the priest saying Mass?  Maybe I had the day wrong, but I tore out a piece of shelf paper and scribbled a rough calendar with magic markers, every time I learned of a new terror for Sandra Bullock I wrote down what date it happened on, and my calendar as well as the screenplay, will swear in court it was Sunday morning.<br /><br />I know it was before the older little girl flew through the glsss doors and cuts blossomed over her innocent, sulky face.  I think she was expressing the pain of her mom and dad's dissolving marriage.  After THE LAKE HOUSE and CRASH, we all wanted Sandra Bullock to smile again, but this time around she's gone off the deep end into ceaseless, unyielding depression.  Her mouth is pinched, her forehead a giant frown.  her hair is limp, lifeless, and jumps around her head like the strings of a whisk broom.  She's brave, my wife said to me, for she shares a few scenes with former supermodel Amber Valletta, who's lost none of her oomph over the years, and the whole audience is figuring, of course he's going to that motel with Amber Valletta, why put up with Sandra Bullock's frowns and complaints a day longer.<br /><br />We learn from the priest that it's all about spiritual emptiness.  I think that perhaps the director, Mennon Yappo, was inspired by some of the late Ingmar Bergman's mid-period films like SHAME and THE PASSION OF ANNA and decided that, in Sandra Bullock, he had located the Liv Ullmann of our modern times, so he asked her to look glum, bought that fake bloody blackbird, got Kate Nelligan out of retirement, and hoped for the best.  In my humble opinion it's better than anything Bergman did, though let him rest in peace, in his Lutheran coffin of a churchyard.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Sandra Bullock is practically the whole show here as a woman who wakes to find her hubby dead, but then not dead. Over and over, we see her go back and forth, until it all begins to make a little sense, or does it? Little of this is realistic, even the scenes where nothing is happening, such as when Bullock climbs in the shower fully clothed with hubby after having a premonition. Instead of laughing at her and calling her crazy, he just stands there looking pensive...Hmmmm.... The whole movie goes on that way.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>It is hard to not see PREMONITION and not be reminded of GROUNDHOG DAY and BACK TO THE FUTURE.All three films involve turning back the hands of time so as to change the outcome of the future.PREMONITION is especially eerie and convoluted,but that is what makes this film so interesting.Films that question FATE-is it absolute,can it be changed,to what degree can things change if it were possible are always asking the viewer to suspend certain time-bound notions and think of outside possibilities.<br /><br />As Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) keeps reliving past and present days concerning the death of her husband.You find yourself looking for the clues as to which day she is in based on past information,such as things done and said,people met,clothing worn,the weather,stickers on a glass door(even the tint of the film that the director uses in order to show time difference...which was quite novel!...it was alot of fun).I really thrive on twisted plots!For that this film is OKAY.There is one place where the film is contrived during Linda's visit to the Parish Priest who seems to be awfully informed about her ordeal, but this scene is crucial to the eventual outcome and lesson that Linda needs to learn. All in all this was an enjoyable film that bends the mind and keeps you alert.The soundtrack is appropriately EXORCISTIC!<br /><br />I don't think that PREMONITION will ever be greatly remembered as other films that tackle FATE ,but c'mon and lighten up...it is still worth an enjoyable one viewing...I will stretch to 4 stars....and besides,the movie DOES NOT end the way you think it will....so there!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RJXK6KF3LL5R.html">A1RJXK6KF3LL5R</a><br/><p>I really like Sandra in movies.However,I did not like this movie.Why even make such a movie if it is going to end without helping anything anyway.The ending was awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>** ?<br /><br />Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) wakes up one morning and realizes her husband has taken the kids to school. She does some shores, takes a run, puts some stickers on the plate glass patio door and starts a shopping list. There is a knock at the door and a Sheriff has arrived to tell her that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon, TV's "Nip/ Tuck", "Fantastic Four"), died in a car accident on a nearby highway yesterday. He was on his way to a business meeting, he left a message on the home phone, he can't be dead. That afternoon, Linda picks up her two daughters and they instantly realize something is wrong. The next morning, she wakes up to find her husband, Jim sitting at the kitchen counter drinking coffee. But it is Tuesday, not Friday. The next morning, she wakes up and Jim is dead again, and her mom (Kate Nelligan) pressures her to make the funeral arrangements. What is going on? As Linda deals with these odd circumstances, each time she wakes up, it is a different day in the same week. One day, she meets a new psychiatrist (Peter Stormare), another, her daughter runs into the plate glass window and receives some cuts. Her husband is dead, and then he isn't. Will she go mad? Will she be able to figure out what is going on? Can she prevent her husband's death?<br /><br />"Premonition", the newest film starring Sandra Bullock, is one of her `serious' films, in which she rarely, if ever, smiles, or seems to be enjoying life. In "Premonition", the death of her husband and then his reappearance lead her to try to figure out what the heck is going on. If we were in the same situation, we would probably feel the same way and attempt to do the same thing. As she tries to put the pieces together, she learns more and more about herself and her husband, causing some conflicting feelings. But why is it that Bullock always seems so unhappy in these films? Yes, I understand her husband has died, but even before this happens, she smiles once.<br /><br />"Premonition" isn't really a time travel story, despite Linda's waking up on a different day of the week every day, and able to look back and forward into the future. That really isn`t the point. When she realizes what is happening, she tries to change the events, to save her husband. But time travel isn't part of the equation, because she has no control over that aspect of the mystery. When she wakes up, it simply IS Tuesday or Wednesday. She then has to take stock of what has already happened and what will happen and try to figure out the key is to the whole mess. What event can she change to make everything ALL RIGHT?<br /><br />Whether you like Sandra Bullock or not, and I am not a huge fan, she has an undeniable screen charisma making her at least watch able in anything she does. But Bullock is more enjoyable when she is in a good comedy, when she can make us laugh. Or in a good romantic comedy, where we can watch her fall in love in a cute way. And she has had her greatest successes in these two genres. Yet, in Hollywood, comedy is not considered a test of an actor's skill and to earn respectability, many funny comedians attempt drama or suspense, in an effort to win respectability. This is such a ludicrous concept, I can't even defend it. Comedies regularly headline the Box Office Top 10 and while this doesn't mean the film is any good, it is a lot harder to make people laugh. So, I don't understand why people like Sandra Bullock, Jim Carrey ("The Number 23"), Adam Sandler ("Reign Over Me") and others frequently delve into dramas, thrillers, etc., films they are just not as good at, and shy away from the films that made them a star. Concentrate on finding that next great comedy or romance, Sandra. That will be the true test of your ability, finding that next film. If you can't find one, take a break. You made $20 million for "Miss Congeniality 2". I don't think you are going to go hungry in the next year.<br /><br />That said, "Premonition" isn't a bad film it is just mediocre. It certainly is worth a bargain  matinee. If you have the time. But I wouldn't rush out and plunk down $11 to see it.  Why? There simply is nothing about it that is strong enough to warrant such action. The acting is good, but because everyone is so dour and unhappy, it is a bit bland. The only time we see a difference is in a flashback to Linda and Jim's wedding; they are both smiling. Throughout the rest of the film, they simply look at each other. The story is interesting, but it never quite posits a theory as to why this is happening to Linda. Is she meant to find out secrets about her husband? Is she meant to learn the meaning of a happy marriage? Is she meant to become a better mother? Does Jim die for a reason? It is never explained. We simply watch the events happen. Since we aren't participating in the story, it becomes more of a trial to sit through.<br /><br />There are some attempts to make Linda a well-rounded character. She has a friend, Annie (Nia Long), who she calls and visits and seeks advice from. They have, apparently been friends for a while, but we don't know what their connection is. Why is Annie a necessary character to this story? Bullock pretty much walks through the story, staring glumly into the distance throughout.<br /><br />Julian McMahon plays Jim, Linda's wife. He is okay, but he mainly reacts to Bullock's character and because she is less than interesting, he is reacting to this persona, and his character has little to add.<br /><br />Kate Nelligan pops up as Linda's concerned mother and Peter Stormare plays a psychiatrist Linda seeks out for help.<br /><br />Directed by Mennan Yapo, a German director who also appeared in the film "Goodbye, Lenin", "Premonition" spends some time setting up a few plot points before Linda learns of Jim's death. Then, as she wakes up on the rest of the days of the week, in random order, we see how some of these events happened. For instance, Linda listens to a recording machine message from Jim. Then she puts decals on the plate glass patio door. She talks to Annie. She starts a shopping list. The problem is that only some of these events actually have a place in the story, become a piece of the puzzle. For a film like this to work, everything, EVERYTHING, has to fit, to mean something in the final moments. After she learns of Jim's death and wakes up the next morning and realizes Jim hasn't died yet, Linda tries to piece the puzzle together and Bullock starts to rush around with a grim determination. Again, some of her actions make sense, some don't. EVERYTHING has to tie in together and it doesn't, making this film more than a little mediocre.<br /><br />The conclusion is a bit of a letdown, but to describe it in any detail would reveal too much, so I can't do that. Suffice it to say, it is simply blah.<br /><br />Early in the film, we watch another flashback where Jim surprises Linda with the house they will live in through the rest of the film. It is an interesting, unique house, but the rest of the film is almost monochromatic; the film looks grainy and doesn't have a lot of color. I am not sure if this is meant to be significant, maybe the film is set in winter, which would lend itself well to the gray look of the film. But if this is the case, it isn't necessary and doesn't play a pivotal part in the story.<br /><br />"Premonition" is a film with an interesting premise, but it needs stronger direction, stronger writing, and stronger acting to raise it above its basic cable movie of the week roots.<br /><br />Do YOU want to pay $11 to see something that should have been on basic cable?</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>"Premonition" in some ways struck me as a more modern, more action-packed version of Thornton Wilder's perennial school drama class favorite "Our Town." In Wilder's classic, life is recapitulated and lived out of order as the result of a feverish dream.<br /><br />In this drama, there is greater mystery and urgency attached to the protagonist's disordered experience of her life. We don't learn what causes the shuffling of days here.  Sandra Bullock's life inexplicably jumps ahead to a day when she is informed of her husband's death in a fiery car crash. When she is backtracked, she must race to see if she can avert the disaster.<br /><br />Whether she can or not though, she is given a different perspective on her life. She is jerked out of the train of petty household grievance and is allowed to see the bigger picture of her relationship with her husband and family. Through the jolts of these changing gears, she's awakened, sometimes to a greater appreciation of the good, sometimes to a greater understanding of the bad, in her daily interactions. While we are usually told that the secret to living a happy life is to live fully in the "now," this movie might incidentally make a case for being able to live our days as a spill of Scrabble on the table - where we have to search out the possible anagrams ourselves. Through the effort required in that back and forth and lack of linearity, there might actually emerge a greater clarity about what's truly of value in our lives.<br /><br />This movie is not a sermon on how to live happily though. While I wouldn't quite classify it the way its DVD jacket does, as a "thriller," its emphasis is definitely on the frantic suspense of - Can she or can't she? - of "Run, Lola, Run!"</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>There is always one film each year at least to me that looks like it will be a success as a film and then when you watch it...well it ends up being a failure instead and you're left surprised and disappointed. Premonition for me is just that film.<br /><br />Bullock and the rest of the cast do the best they can with what they're given; the cast was not the problem. The scenes and music also were done rather well for a thriller. The atmosphere of the film is indeed perfect. But it's the story itself that makes you lose interest eventually. Like others have said here- the bouncing back and forth of days Bullock's character goes through gets confusing and overall tiring. The pieces do come together but by the time it all does start making sense you've already made your decision about how you feel about this film and most will say it was boring, messy and the ending was oh so predictable.<br /><br />I was counting on Premonition to be a pretty good thriller, and although they set up the movie well to be one, it falls flat unfortunately. I recommend saving your money and just waiting for it to come on cable.<br /><br />2.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Thirty minutes into the movie, I kept thinking to myself "Have I seen this movie before?"

Sandra Bullock goes to sleep with a seemingly happy family of two girls and a husband.  She wakes up to find that her husband died during an out of town trip that she doesn't remember.  She then goes to sleep and wakes up to find that her husband is still alive and the days seem to be out of sequence.  Her husband's death apparently occurred on Wednesday and each time Bullock awakes it is first a day later in the week from Wednesday then a day earlier in the week than Wednesday.<br /><br />When Bullock starts piecing together what is going on with her, she has to decide if she wants to do nothing to prevent her husband from dieing or let things take her course (she learns that he may have been cheating on her).<br /><br />When all is resolved, the viewer is shaking their head, specifically at Bullocks non-attempt to alter even the smallest thing (she finds a torn out page from the Yellow Pages in a trash can and when she goes back in time she realizes that she is throwing the same page into the trash can.  She could have done a little nuance to change things by removing the paper from the trash).  The very last scene of the movie made very little sense to me and I felt that I had wasted two hours watching this mismash.  See Deja Vu instead!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>What initially attracted me to this movie, as always, was Sandra Bullock. In my eyes, she can do no wrong - apart from in the very beginning, when she was a struggling actress. Fire On The Amazon anybody? And also, Julian McMahon, more known to me as Cole from Charmed stars in it. He also gets wet in a shower. Woohoo!!!<br /><br />But the film was just not that good. I saw the ending coming. (What's so wrong with a Hollywood ending now and again?) I disagree with some other reviewers though, who's mentioned the finale was sloppy etc. I LOVED the ending, for me quite possibly the best part of the movie. (For all you cynics out there, not just because it was nearly over!) It was a nailbiting finale, but the right thing in the end happened.<br /><br />The whole plot was quite dodgy, and to anyone who quite simply can't keep track of time, it's all over the place. You have to pay attention, just to find out what day you're on, and whether Julian McMahon is actually alive or dead in this sequence. The whole affair subplot (he didn't, but he was going to, which was glaringly obvious) didn't quite fit in. He was going to cheat, he was considering cheating, isn't it the whole point that she should have kicked his butt out the door anyway? Never mind ran him over herself! And the object of his affections, is as usual, blonde, busty, young, pert, etc.<br /><br />The supporting cast are not worth my time mentioning, and Sandy & Julian are desperately trying to hold the film together, and apart from a really tender scene in the shower (Sandy fully clothed unfortunately for all her male fans), which did bring a tear to the eye, there's not much of a connection or chemistry between the pair of actors. Dare I say it, after seeing him in five seasons of Charmed, Julian is actually sleepwalking through the role.<br /><br />Over all, an interesting movie, if you're interested in premonitions etc, but messily put together and dire extras. And why does the Blu Ray edition have a better cover than this bland one????</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Premonition starring Sandra Bullock is so much better than I thought it would be. There has been so many negative reviews about this movie, I was kinda hesitant to rent it but I am glad I did, Premonition kept me interested and Bullock is outstanding as a sullen but loving wife torn apart by a tradgedy.  She plays Linda, she finds out her husband Jim has died in car crash but the next day he is still alive, and then the next day he is dead again, the film goes back and forth and I loved the ending, wow I actually saw an ending that had a message and purpose (those kind of films are hard to find!) I can't understand why everyone hates Premonition but I highly recommend checking this classy and engrossing thriller out. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Premontition' presents a family venue much in the mold of the paranormal plots these days.  The premise draws upon `D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu' and `Medium' with much of the atmosphere of  `The Sixth Sense'.  (There's even a shower scene where the seer comes upon her beloved.)  Can we change events of our loved ones if we can see in the future?  After watching this film I felt like I had been here before.  Despite some retread the movie has some redeeming values.<br /><br />First of all `Premonition' does live up to its title.  The movie opens with Linda (Sandra Bullock) listening to her husband giving a phone message into their answering machine.  Shortly after she answers the door and is greeted by a police officer.  Somberly, the man tells her that her husband was in a serious car accident, and he didn't survive.  She is incredulous.  Not merely shock, but she understandably thinks it a mistake given the context of her husband's message.<br /><br />From there we get fragmented events that make it seem like Linda is bumping into the future.  People she doesn't know address her and loved ones provide details she is oblivious about.  Meeting with her mother, who is a significant caretaker for her two children, she seems out of it, forlorned, bewildered.  Then, sleep becomes something of a portal, or maybe a change of consciousness.  When Linda awakes everything is back to normal.  Jim is alive, the children are fine, and the forbidding omens disappear.  Unlike many other films, the time frame gets shuffled, so she often loses track of what day it is and which events are meant to stay in sequence.<br /><br />Added to her turmoil is the aspect of psychiatric care.  It gives us a sense of ambiguity done in movies like 'Donnie Darko' where we have to figure out what the true source of her problems in the story.  Many of those bumps in the future feature Linda being treated by Dr. Roth (Peter Stormare), a psychiatrist.  Besides sharing with her best friend Annie, she really confides her dilemma with him.  Obviously, not specializing in paranormal psychology, he gives her a prescription for lithium instead of an outlook of the future.<br /><br />She also seeks advice from the parish priest.  He gives her good advice, but, then, Linda is on her own.  She must decide what to do with the future she's been presented.  Can she save her husband?  Do the visions give her some command of the future?<br /><br />There are many aspects to admire in `Premonition'.  The movie does keep an up to date standard of edginess.  Even though it relies on music and editing more than most, and there`s one scene that uses a shaky pivoting camera to express the strife when Linda is confronting her family.  Sandra Bollock gives a fine performance as Linda.  Through her we can truly see Linda's grief and frustration.  On the other hand, some of the other omens don't fit in the story as well.  Perhaps disasters come in threes, but when Linda is startled by an explosion of a telephone wire, a crow is killed and lays before her.  It matches an event foreseen before, but it doesn't tell us much.  And that's how I left 'Premonition'.  Surely, most people won't be angry or overly disappointed after having watched this movie, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.<br /><br />I believe the movie will appeal to the masses who are yearning for "family values" in their films.  The moviemakers' motives are admirable, but the execution of the story is so riddled with mysterious roadblocks that it made me feel like I had a long and cruel joke played on me.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>OK, I watched the film on DVD and watched til the end.I was entertained, and Sandra Bullock gave a fine performance, though not Miss Congeniality. She's morose and bothered throughout, and it's hard to figure out if she actually loves her husband. The film is generally told in the 1st person, and Bullock is almost every scene. Those scenes that don't involve her are totally out of synch with the theory of the film. Director Mennan Yapo did his best, but it was an unformed script and everything was kind of left to the imagination of the general public (those who don't see the "holes"). Julian McMahon and Nia Long were fine, and the 2 little daughters gave great performances. As I said, it was good, mindless entertainment, but not a work of art. "The Forgotten" with Julianne Moore came to mind, and that  was a better movie. Entertaining but won't blow you out of the water. The acting is so good, it almost brings a tear to the eye. That's why I can't write it off.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>She's a very good actress and especially good in comedy, but why has this actress chosen such awful films?  First it was the weird one about the Lake Mystery, which you had to watch twice to even understand, and now another weird movie about premonitions.  Oh, and how about the one where she played a witch who brought back a dead guy after she and her sister magically put him to rest.  The first part of that movie was actually very good with a very good cast, but then it turned south and sour and totally absurd.  Too bad. Sandra, find yourself a good script for a change. And please no more beauty contests either.  I have liked 2 of her films.  The Net and Two Weeks Notice. Surely she can find more good scripts like those.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway. This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death. The dreams are in between dreams and reality. It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions. In one, he's dead. In another, he's alive. They are somewhat chronological. Each "dream" seems so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track. As you expect, she goes through "am I nuts?" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation. Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it? Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?<br /><br />Some people may not like the way this movie seems to flip around a bit, but many people who have premonitions or visions do not have them like a movie.  They are often fragmented and full of symbolism.  This movie spared you the symbolism.  It does jump back and forth in the dream world part, but I believe it is realistic.  Sandra does a great job in portraying the emotions her character would probably have, including people's disbelief, and her own, too.<br /><br />I found it a very interesting movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved the end, too.  And the movie leaves you thinking. . .</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>If you didn't like the Lake House, you probably won't like premonition.<br /><br />I really liked Lake House and rather enjoyed Premonition. The great thing about Premonition is the thoughtful sub-story, of why you love, how much you love, and how it affects you for good and ill, and though this seems like a movie you don't have to watch closely, if you want to get that part of it you will.<br /><br />If you are expecting an action oriented time travel movie, you will be disappointed, but if you want a thought provoking story about deeper emotional issues, then this is a film you should enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>There is a skit in the animated program Robot Chicken where a caricature of M. Night Shaymalyn keeps shouting "what a twist" when we see little parodies of his films.  This is a poignant piece because it hints at one of the major problems in a post 6th Sense Hollywood, where filmakers feel they can woo in audiences with surprise endings and twists and turns throughout the story.<br /><br />In films like the 6th Sense, such a device is good.  But that was a carefully laid twist that didn't confuse filmgoers and the director carefully gave you little snippets of the clues that led to the conclusion.  It's an easy to digest 'twist.'  It does not work in a film like Premonition, where the twists and turns contradict logic and further confuse filmgoers.<br /><br />Premonition begins where Bullock plays a happily homebound housewife who has two children.  She takes the children to school, goes about her daily chores, listens to a voice message from her husband (where plot holes begin - I'll get to that later), and then receives the disturbing news that her husband is dead.  Next day, surprise, he's alive - it must have all been a dream because he's alive and it's a few days before the accident.  Next day (for Bullock's character anyway), it's the funeral, oh and there's a really unintentionally funny scene where she attempts to check out the casket!  Well it ends up being a lot of going back and forth and the filmakers allude that some of the things that occur must be real, but wait, if this was true, then that first day her daughter should've had scars..and didn't she end up going to a mental institution....does this sound confusing to you?  It's how the film operates.  And no - none of it makes sense.<br /><br />Films dealing with time travel or telling the future in any sort of way must set up rules that the audience can follow - or at least let us in on any known incosistencies ala Back to the Future.  This film does neither and leaves the audience wondering "huh?"  To further muddy the waters, this film has a number of unresolved subplots, including an aformenetioned scene involving her losing her children and getting commited and an alleged affair her husband may have been having.  As for the plot holes (Here be a spoiler), listen closely to the phone call from the husband in the beginning and hear it repeated towards the end.  Something's wrong.<br /><br />This film is not recommended.  I swear I have never been more upset and infuriated after watching a movie.  I don't normally rant on films like this, but films of this low quality, robbed of any logic should be avoided.  If the film is recut into some Lifetime movie or even further into a twilight zone episode, it might have some value.  But 100 minutes could be used alot more wisely than watching this jumbled psychic/time travel boggle of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>It takes alot of creative energy and work to write songs, record albums and make movies..... so one sometimes feels bad when they are compelled to warn others away from something that is REALLY bad.<br /><br />But seriously... read the other reviews on here and be warned.<br />Their criticisms are valid for this film.<br /><br />I suppose since the classic "6th Sense", everybody is trying hard to make films along the same idea (ie.. the ultimate ironic twist), but whereas "6th Sense" was unique for NOT being deceptive and actually telling you the punchline all thru the movie and STILL surprising you.......... films like PREMONITION (and many others these past few years) try to deceive the audience with false information that is simply thrown in to fool the viewer (and offers no meaning or content the the film).<br /><br />PREMONITION is based on a good concept but only has enough substance to fill a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode.<br />As a result it really gets longwinded, repetitive and downright boring by the time 2 hours and 12 minutes (and the ending) come along.<br /><br />The ending is no surprise, however the behaviour and stupidity of the characters at the end is so bad you are either annoyed -or- don't care what happens to them.<br /><br />Summary:<br />A good premise for a 30 minute Twilight Zone TV episode stretched too thin for a 2+ hour long movie... stretched so thin in fact it breaks apart into pieces the viewer probably cares little about.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.  Linda Hanson (the fabulously talented Sandra Bullock) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck) have a happy life.  Nice home, two beautiful daughters, and a loving marriage.  Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.<br /><br />But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.  But Linda remembers everything from the day before.  The film leaves you wondering which side of Linda's life is the real side, the one where she wakes up and Jim is alive, or the one where she wakes up and he's dead.  Small occurrences happen that tie the two realities together, such as a prescription from a psychiatrist and an accident with her oldest daughter.<br /><br />The suspense of the movie never reaches a gut wrenching level, and the soundtrack became annoying at times with its consistent "doom-and-gloom" sounds.  It seems as if there's a message hidden that some things are in our control, and some things are not.  The ending was a little too clich&eacute;d for my tastes.<br /><br />Overall, the movie just didn't quite live up to its promises, but the performances by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon are exceptional, carrying the weaker direction of the film.  It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>This movie was really good.  Basically, without spoiling the actual storyline, everything you see in the beginning of the movie isn't actually happening.  The question is, WILL it happen, or will Sandra Bullock be able to stop it in time?<br /><br />There's a twist at the very end of the movie that I NEVER seen coming, and to be totally honest, I don't quite understand what happened during the last two minutes of the movie.  If someone wants to explain it to me in the comment field below, please do!<br /><br />Anyway, the acting was really good, Sandra's character was in good shape, the guessing game deciding what's happening in the present time and what HASN'T happened yet is something you will be trying to figure out for yourself while watching the movie.<br /><br />Too many times I was never really sure what was happening for real and what was just a premonition of Sandra's character.  You love movies like this because you just never know if someones premonitions will eventually happen or if the future disasters that come to someones mind can be stopped in time.  This is another one of those movies, but done exceptionally well.  I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is yet another Sandra Bullock movie I wanted to like, but the movie fought me every step of the way.  She is such a likeable actress and is so enjoyable on the screen.  Why does she end up with so many of these lackluster vehicles?<br /><br />The movie has such a heavy mood that it would have to give us a big payoff to justify such constant oppression and depression.  But there never is a big payoff.  What there is one has to rationalize into it once the movie is over.<br /><br />For me the movie was a kind of blend of Groundhog Day without the humor, Frequency without the active sense of doing something about the situation (to her credit, Bullock's Linda Hanson does come to grips with what she is facing.  However, I didn't.).<br /><br />Screenwriters need to figure out that a sad ending has to be justified by either an uplift that makes it all understandable or an unsparing bleakness that cauterizes as it wounds.  This kind of dripping sadness is typified by Linda's visit with the priest.  She comes away with something that we can't really see and can only project in later, but she continues without any meaningful definition of faith nor is her commitment to God rekindled.<br /><br />The whole time continuum disruption plot device is interesting and handled with appropriate fuzziness and confusion.  Linda isn't particularly an intellectual or analytical person, so she struggles in putting the pieces together.  Julian McMahon does a fine job as Jim Hanson.  He is a work obsessed man who loves himself and his ideas of his self-importance more than his family.  He flatters himself that he loves them and provides for them so that entitles him to ignore them.  That sounds like reality for too many families!  In the final analysis, this is a film about Jim and Linda and whether they can relocate their love and rekindle their marriage before it is ended one way or the other.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but in some ways not worth the work.  Still, it is Sandra Bullock.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has become unstuck in time.  Actually the time frame is one week in which the days have been shuffled.  She wakes up and it is Thursday, but the next day it is the previous Monday, and the day after that it is the following Saturday.  This is all confusing and quite maddening to Linda, especially since Thursday is the day the sheriff rings the doorbell and tells her that her husband had been killed in a car accident the day before.  That means when she wakes up on Monday Jim (Julian McMahon) is still alive, but on Saturday they are burying him.  Family and friends are starting to think that Linda is having mental problems, and she is having problems wrapping her mind around what is going on herself.  But if she knows what is going to happen, then she can do something about it, right?<br /><br />This is one of Bullock's better performances as she takes advantage of the opportunity to do something different, but despite her best efforts this film lives and dies by the script by Bill Kelly ("Blast from the Past").  The basic idea is pretty intriguing: Linda is living the days of this week out of sequence, which gives her the opportunity to do something about Jim's death.  The script even takes a nice twist when Linda starts thinking that maybe she should not do anything and just let it happen.  However, Kelly's script suffers from two fatal flaws, the first having to deal with Linda's ability to change things and the second with the way this twisted time travel tale plays out.<br /><br />If you have not seen "Premonition" then you should look away at this point because THERE BE SPOILERS HERE and I am going to rant and rave about these reasons why I deducted two stars off of this 2007 film's rating.  If you have not seen the film and are interested in the premise and/or actress, then check it out sometime and then come back and read the rest of this review:<br /><br />My rant is because Linda does not stop Bridgette from going through the plate glass door.  That happens on Tuesday and on Sunday Linda could put the damn flower stickers and save the door.  Bridgette did not have scars on Thursday, which was "before" Tuesday, but then she did not have them on Wednesday, which was "after" Tuesday.  Clearly Linda can do something about the past (which is where the future is usually found in this movie), and even if she does not want to do anything about Jim, she should want to spare Bridgette from getting her face all cut up.  I go back to the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" when Nancy wakes up and has yanked Freddy's hat back with her from her nightmare.  Nancy knows that this is important and figures out how she can make it work for her.  Linda is given a similar cosmic clue and she does absolutely nothing with it.  I thought preventing her daughter's accident would be the catalyst on Wednesday for Linda deciding to prevent the accident, but<br /><br />My rave is that we get to the end of this film and it turns out that for all its complexity what with shuffling the days of the week and having Linda wrestle with whether or not she should prevent the accident, "Premonition" turns out to be such a variation on the old time traveling story that I have always related with the "Titanic."  You go back in time to stop the "Titanic" from hitting an iceberg, and while you are yelling, "Look out for the iceberg!" you distract the crew so they do not see the iceberg.  So Linda becomes the cause of Jim's death by trying to stop it.  Dramatic irony aside, the theoretical position here is that you cannot change the past because your attempt to change the past is already part of the past, so there.  The theological posturing at the end is too little too late, because I find it hard to believe that Linda would be able to live with what she has done.  Adding insult to injury is the alternate ending, which to me says they did not even have the courage of their conviction with the inadequate resolution of their intriguing premise.  At least the gag reel is about actually gags played on the set and not just flubbed lines, which was a nice touch, but not enough to redeem the flaws in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>The latest in a string of Sandra Bullock mystery thrillers, Premonition is a jumbled mess of unexplained time travel and its consequent inconsistencies, and while not wholly lacking in entertainment value, does raise more questions than it answers - questions like "Why is this happening to her again?" and "Why can't she change things?" and possibly "What made me watch this movie in the first place?"<br /><br />Jokes aside, on first viewing of this latest addition to the time-traveling suspense film, one has to wonder about the numerous loose ends, plot holes, and disturbingly unsatisfactory resolution. I suppose the film didn't necessarily want the viewer to delve too deep into its mysteries, but the explanation "some things can't be explained" only works when the main plot doesn't depend on any reasons. Unfortunately Premonition does and we're left holding the bag - without knowing what's in it.<br /><br />Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) appears to have the ideal family life - a loving husband, two beautiful daughters, and a brand new house. But one day after receiving a bizarre phone call from her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) she is informed by a police officer that he has died in a car accident. Distraught and in disbelief, Linda attempts to carry out the rest of her day normally, but eventually cries herself to sleep that night. She awakens the next morning to discover Jim is alive and well - it was all just a bad dream. Or was it? Each day she awakens to a new nightmare of inconsistencies traveling back and forth in time and must uncover the terrifying events that lead up to her husband's tragic demise.<br /><br />The movie begins refreshingly enough with an adequate dose of confusion and disorientation as we learn of Linda's troubling plight. But soon it becomes apparent that the plot is in over its head and more disturbing than the events surrounding the protagonist is the inexplicable direction the film is heading. After each non-sequential day passes, more questions and inconsistencies are created - so many in fact that the audience will realize that there isn't sufficient time left in the two hour flick to resolve them all. So we are left with the inexcusable "some things are unexplainable" explanation which will likely cause more frustration than the inherent inevitability of Linda's predicament.<br /><br />Premonition attempts to be ominous - and succeeds at times - but with several cheap scares and random events that don't add up, appreciation will be lost for the truly foreboding sequences. When the police officer that informs Linda of her husband's death appears on a different day, one might think a conspiracy is in the works, but no, it's just another random occurrence thrown in to add more confusion to an already convoluted premise. Whenever time travel is introduced in a story so are questions about the nature of altering the past, present, and future, but Premonition relies on the audience accepting its fixed rules without pondering their plausibility. Before there can be a "who," "what," or "where," there needs to be a "why," but you won't find one here. The film ends prematurely without divulging any reason for its "premonition" and therefore accepting the apparent inevitability of its conclusion and Linda's wanton disregard for trying to change the future and preserve her seemingly perfect life may be disappointingly difficult to swallow.<br /><br />Though Bullock admirably tries to hold Mennan Yapo's thriller together, this Premonition becomes a little too much time travel and our belief can only be suspended so far before snapping from the weight of the impossibly unexplainable - it will leave you guessing until the very end, and unfortunately quite some time afterwards. While the film traverses seven days of one nightmarish week for Sandra, only about three of them made any sense, hence its score.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Despite the rather thorough drubbing it suffered at the hands of most of the nation's more prestigious critics, "Premonition" is actually a pretty well-thought-out and tightly wound thriller, given emotion and heart by its star, Sandra Bullock.  It's not a movie I would be willing to go to the mat for, but as throwaway thrillers go, this one is really not half bad.<br /><br />Bullock plays Linda Quinn Hanson, a suburban mother of two, who receives the shattering news that her husband has been killed in an auto accident.  However, when she wakes up the next morning, she finds him, strangely, sitting in the kitchen, suddenly alive and well, benignly sipping coffee before heading off to work.  The question quickly arises, did she dream the story of his death, is she dreaming now, or is she undergoing some sort of mental crisis precipitated by the shock of her loss?  Or is she caught in some sort of bizarre time warp that allows her to jump back and forth between the periods before and after his "death,"  and, if so, might she be able to step in and alter the course of events to prevent the accident from happening in the first place?<br /><br />In both concept and form, "Premonition" is pretty much an assembly-line thriller designed to tweak the audience's brain cells for a couple of hours before sending everyone home with not a whole heck of a lot left to think about once it's over.  Still, it's intriguing enough while it lasts and only the true nitpickers among us will feel compelled to put its twists and turns in logic under the scrutiny of a critical microscope.  Despite a few weak moments in her performance, Bullock actually makes us care about the character and the very strange thing that is happening to her.<br /><br />"The Premonition" is by no means a classic - or even first rate - chiller, but those with a few spare hours on their hands and a penchant for cinematic brain-puzzlers could do worse than check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.<br /><br />The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home.  Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim.  Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy.  Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.<br /><br />The film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps.  Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her.  She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well.  No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing!

Sandra Bullock does a fine job in this tepid little tale of faith and destiny that just had to have a somewhat positive ending. It's worth a look, but don't expect to be blown away.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I was intrigued by the trailer for his film, but I was not able to see it in the theater. The trailer leads you to believe that this movie is a horror film, or at the least, a supernatural thriller.<br /><br />I'm inclined to catagorize the film with the latter description, although the "supernatural" element remains more or less a mystery and the movie does not focus too much on that point.<br /><br />It does focus, however, on the phenomenon that Sandra Bullock's character is forced to endure over and over again. This phenomenon is never fully explained, only hinted at, and that one fact left me somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />However, once you get to the end of the movie and realize it's message, that one element lacking explanation doesn't really seem to matter. The movie has a beautiful message and that message is; every day of life that we have is a miracle.<br /><br />Bullock delivers an excellent performance, as usual, and it was nice to see Julian McMahon portray a character who was actually a decent (if not troubled and confused) man rather than the megalomaniacal jerks he usually plays (such as his role in Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four).<br /><br />I enjoyed this film very much as did my wife. The picture and sound quality are both well-done. We especially enjoyed the gag reel after the film was over. It was helpful to get a few genuine laughs after such a tear-jerker of an ending.<br /><br />The reviews are pretty mixed on this one, so you might want to try giving this one a rental before you buy. Like me, others may have pre-conceived notions about the nature of this film and could possibly be disappointed. I, for one, was pleasantly surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>While this is a tour-de-force for Sandra Bullock, she alone can't hold the entire complex and convoluted film together without some serious help.  She gets fine support by all in this film including a subtle Julian ("I have weird eyebrows") McMahon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTU">Fantastic Four</a>) as her doomed husband, the ever gorgeous Nia Long (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000803BQC">Are We There Yet?</a>) as her best friend, and the always reliable and familar Kate Nelligan as her mom.  Even the children are better than most other child actors we see in films today.<br /><br />Sadly, all this good acting doesn't excuse the overly complicated script that both loses the audience at times with it's complexity and reveals itself to be quite predictable too.  That sounds like the perfect oxymoron at work.  The plot is different, even unique in some ways and for awhile the mystery is interesting if not even compelling, but once you get the idea of what is happening, everything falls into place too easily and the ending is anything but a surprise.<br /><br />I gave this film 3.5 stars for it's unique, but admittedly flawed, storyline which is, overall, entertaining, the terrifically compelling performance by Bullock, and the fine support of her co-stars.  I even have to give credit to the director for just an honest attempt at creating something different in this mind-bending, time-traveling little thriller.  I also think it is noteworthy that at the heart of this story is a woman who no longer knows what is important in her life that is worth fighting for and a marriage that is perhaps all too typical in our society today where we take others for granted and whine about the mundane aspects that fill all our lives.</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a mother of two young girls and wife to a husband who is living in his own little world, not paying much attention to his wife or her needs.<br />Linda awakes to find that her husband has been killed in a roadside car accident and is devastated----BUT-----the next day she awakes to her husband being there by her side and not dead.  The next day, dead again, the next day alive again.<br />She finally goes on a psychological hunting spree to figure out why this phenomenum is going on, and without giving away the premise of the movie, which to me is right in your face, I will just write----keep things close to your heart and love deeply, for one day it may all be gone and regret and sorrow will overbound.....</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>It took awhile just to get down what was going on in this movie, there was a real flow problem and way too much confusion for my tastes.  It took a lot just to finish this movie.  I think the biggest problem was viewer understanding of what days Sandra was in at what part of the movie since there was so much bouncing around.  The ending wasn't all that great feel-good either, left my wife a little stressed about life and not the effect she wanted.  Needless to say, this movie won't be staying in our library.  Watch if you want, just don't suggest that you buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>I think there's probably a picture of Sandra Bullock's face after she realized what a piece of poo this movie turned out to be. Premonition had good intentions. I enjoyed the trailer immensely--not enough to see it in theatres--but enough to put it in my Netflix queue. After all, I enjoy Nip/Tuck and I haven't seen Julian McMahon in awhile. I would have been better off just putting N/T in the queue and getting my fix that way.<br /><br />I think you know the story. Sandra Bullock plays a woman whose husband dies in a car crash. Stunned and saddened, she goes to bed only to wake up and, whoa!, he's alive. Imagine that. Back and forth we go through a muddled story line, halfhearted acting, and a Julian McMahon who is completely unlikeable and (shudder) unattractive. What was the point? There wasn't one. That's what you need to know. I like bad movies. I own Glitter and am not ashamed. That being said, even I wouldn't own this movie. It's that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>It's a pretty good movie. Sandra Bullock's character deliver a strong feeling of confusion that is primarily the subject of the movie. Generally speaking I think people won't feel their money wasted.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Sandra Bullock has the keen sensitivity to pick up some roles that she thinks she can create a niche and leave a mark of her acting skills. That is what interests me to see her movies. In "Premonition" - a time-tripping attempt to do for marital malaise what "Groundhog Day" did for commitment-phobia - a bored housewife named Linda (Sandra Bullock) wakes up one day, like any other day, and goes about her daily routine. She makes breakfast, takes the kids to school, jogs, does laundry - the usual. The day then takes a tragic turn when Linda learns, from an all too cryptic policeman, that her husband (Julian McMahon from "Nip/Tuck") has been killed in a car accident. Understandably, Linda takes the rest of the day to grieve and console her two daughters before passing out on the couch. The next day she wakes up in her bed...next to her husband - who is, it turns out, quite alive. Was it all a dream? Eventually (and it takes her a while to figure it out) it becomes clear that Linda is living the days of one week in random order. And, at some point, her husband is going to die. It's an intriguing concept for a film with something to say, or a character with the smarts to use this phenomenon to her advantage. "Premonition" has neither.<br /><br />In the film's early moments, director Mennan Yapo - who made 2004's appropriately atmospheric "Soundless" - does an admirable job of keeping the audience off balance - at times quite literally; his frequent swaying handheld shots produce a vertiginous effect. But as the film progresses and the audience struggles to keep track of the days, even fancy camera moves don't help. I could see what relative-newcomer Bill Kelly was trying to do with his script: he meant to say something about treasuring each day because the end could come at anytime. But the effect of jumping randomly around the days of one week as if "they were thrown up in the air like a deck of cards" is too arbitrary to produce any real intrigue and repeated trips to find her husband in the shower brought to mind a certain infamous "Dallas" season finale (I half expected Patrick Duffy to be standing there). It's clear the film is struggling to keep the suspense up when it throws in the peculiar casting of Peter Stormare as Dr. Roth, filmdom's most ominous psychiatrist.<br /><br />It's hard to dislike Sandra Bullock. Whether she's playing the lovelorn <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEE4">The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)</a> or the love-starved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004UEDQ">28 Days (Special Edition)</a>the actress has an innate charm that can make some of the drippiest material palatable. Since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GANOQ">Speed (Widescreen Edition)</a>Ms. Bullock has tried her hand at thrillers with largely disappointing results <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YUNR">The Net (Special Edition)</a>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL29">Murder by Numbers (Widescreen Edition)</a>. The obvious reason would appear to be the questionable material involved, but that's not entirely the case <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007PLLBU">Miss Congeniality (Deluxe Edition)</a> wasn't brilliant writing, but it played to Ms. Bullock's charisma). In "Premonition", I think the actress smiles a total of once in 100 minutes on screen. Granted, it's radiant when she does, but that's not enough to save the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This is overall a decent movie but is marred by some unfortunate flaws, mostly relating to plot plausibility and consistency. Well acted by the two main leads, Bullock and McMahon, it is nicely paced and has some beautiful cinematography, but it would have been so much better if not for several problems.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm not alone on many of these, but the problems I found were:<br /><br />1. Mother has daughter committed when it's obvious she's not responsible for the cuts on her child's face when she accidently ran thru the plate glass door. This just isn't explained and is contrary to the facts as presented in the movie.<br /><br />2. The scene with the priest where they try to explain her visions as a sort of spiritual uprootedness is just plain hokey. Movie thrillers aren't the best place for metaphysical and theological speculation.<br /><br />3. The menacing psychiatrist doesn't make much sense, nor does his prescribing Lithium on a first visit, a drug normally used for depression, not stress. The unsympathetic psychiatrist certainly adds to the overall stress factor in the movie but really isn't credible.<br /><br />4. The convoluted timeline with all of Bullock's flashbacks makes the movie a hard to follow.<br /><br />5. In the end, she still can't change the future despite knowing it, which has already been the subject of endless sci-fi stories and other movies. I would have tried to find a less predictable ending.<br /><br />6. The guy she meets at the lakeside seems to prefigure a future relationship with him, but when the flick ends suddenly there is no further hint of why that scene was included. This brief scene could have been edited out since it just seems to be a red herring.<br /><br />7. I agree with previous reviewer, baberufus, that Bullock's telling her husband to turn around right at the crest of the hill was just plain silly. She knows what's going to happen with the truck and should just have told him to get out of the car right away and off to the side of the road when the car stalled. But most importantly, she should have told him to just stay where he was in the first place and not turn around until the truck passed.<br /><br />Overall, though, a decent flick and thriller if you can manage to overlook a few gaffs, and the great Kate Nelligan has a good supporting role as Bullock's mother.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Gee this movie should have left this story alone since it couldn't do anything about saving it either. Yes Sandra Bullock is a decent actress. Yes it is an interesting story idea. But somewhere along the line it gets boring and by the end of the movie when we realize nothing can be done you feel as though you wasted your time. My wife and I both agreed we wouldn't watch this again. It didn't make us feel better, uplifted, or entertained. It is a argument for fate, nothing more. So if you want to be depressed by the whole movie being spent with a wife trying to save her husband but can't by all means have fun. Oh and making her pregnant after she makes up with him does not make a happy ending in my book. He's dead Jim, as is this movie. I do not recommend this movie in any shape or form. I guarantee if you see it you will wonder why you wasted the time. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is I have actually seen worse movies and this had decent acting and production values.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>Sometimes I'm amazed at how differently people can see the same thing. One person detests a work that another finds fresh and amazing.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />I like Sandra Bullock. So I think I'm looking at Premonition through that mindset. I also love suspense and twisty plots. Bullock plays a solid character like she does in each of her films - a woman facing circumstances with varying degrees of self-control and courage. Linda reminded me of Bullock's character in Crash.<br /><br />The plot had intriguing moments. Daily activities filled with quiet desperation set the scene for an unraveling marriage. Linda's realization of impending tragedy and then the cloud of surreality that surrounded her as she lived one very different day at a time made the movie clip along. The filming tended to be stark and clean which added to the suspense feel and evoked a sense of loneliness.<br /><br />None of the characters were particularly lovable, even the children took a bit to warm up to.<br /><br />The element of faith ended up being an empty platitude.<br /><br />If you hated Lake House -- don't even try with Premonition.<br /><br />If you are a mistake collector and will likely see the movie with a spread sheet and try to make all the parts create a seamless whole, I don't see how that's going to happen...so don't go there.<br /><br />If you have to have a big smile on your face when you shut off a movie...I don't think this will give you what you're looking for.<br /><br />I could call it an interesting relationship study or a suspenseful hand-holding movie that leaves you with questions to ponder.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Ever wake up, go to work, and have a co-worker ask what day it is?  "Wednesday," you tell them.  "Huh," they say.  "It FEELS like a Thursday."  Sometimes the "feel" of time throws us a little off whack, us wandering through Tuesdays that feel like Fridays, or trying to wrap our minds around the ambiguous dreariness of Sunday afternoons.  "Time is an illusion," Douglas Adams once wrote.  "Lunchtime doubly so."<br /><br />Screenwriter Bill Kelly was probably inspired by similar ideas of time when he wrote "Premonition," a thriller starring Sandra Bullock as Linda, a woman who keeps waking up on the wrong day.  At the beginning of the film, she learns that her husband has died in a car accident, but the next day, she opens her eyes to him lying in bed next to her.  And the next day he's dead.  Then he isn't.  Linda, understandably, is confused.<br /><br />You will be, too.  The script doesn't bother explaining why Linda is "unstuck in time." (I quote the recently deceased Vonnegut's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385333846">Slaughterhouse-Five</a>; the movie share's that book's ambition, but certainly not its skill or import)  There's a brief (and laughably cliched) scene where Linda, seeking answers, visits a priest who offers the standard, inoffensive and nondenominational advice that she must have faith "in something beyond yourself."  Linda leaves the church, sporting the same expression she utilizes throughout the whole movie: dull consternation.<br /><br />It's just as well; given the movie's themes, she should've visted a Calvinist.  There's a lot of hooey here about fate and determinism (hard plot points NOT to bring up when you're talking about characters who can see into the future; see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL78">Minority Report</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780631684">Final Destination</a>), but all this movie really amounts to is watching Linda try desperately to makes sense of all of the inconsistencies that you yourself will be mulling over by the time the credits close.  Because she leaps forward and then back like a kid on a time-travelling swing set, she must make sense of what has happened and what will.  The film ties some things together (the appearance of Lithium in her medicine cabinet, strange cuts on her daughter, and a dead bird in the yard), but the jagged timeline makes all of it hard to comprehend.  Even harder to understand is how Linda herself fits into the whole thing.  Does she change anything?  Can she change anything?  SHOULD she change anything?<br /><br />It's a big mess.  A great big mess.  The preponderance of plot holes (which could conveniently be sewn up with a little long-shot rationalizing) is made worse by the emotional monotony of the film.  Not only does Linda teeter on an unoriginal chasm of madness, but she's teased over the edge by a slew of characters straight out of Central Casting.  Say hello to the Patronizing Mother, the Amiable-but-Unhelpful Best Friend, the Precocious Daughters, the Sinister Shrink, the Emotionally Unavailable Husband, the Strange Other Woman Standing Behind a Distant Tree During a Gloomy Funeral Who Suddenly Bolts when She is Spotted by the Dead Man's Wife!<br /><br />There's a message in Linda's madness, true to form, and just like the characters, it pops up prepackaged and ready for sale.  It is, in fact, the final insult in a movie filled with smug, hallucinatory meandering.  I'm not talking about the climax, where all of the unstuck days finally coalesce in a chubby ball of fire.  I'm talking about, literally, the last shot of the movie, a screen-scene dripping with so much vague and vapid hope, I'm surprised the Kindly Old Priest character isn't in it.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Sandra Bullock (she was my first on-screen crush, actually), but she is lost in the morass of this mind-bender of a movie.  One gets the feeling that her Linda could've benefited from something as simple as a Page-A-Day calendar.  The rest of the movie, though, needs a lot more help.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Shades of Groundhog Day or some more sophisticated what if time travel.<br /><br />I was surprised at how tight the story is and every minute, every word, and every movement had a part in this story.

One day, after receiving terrible news about her husband Jim (Julian McMahon), she starts to have promotion - or I should say, she begins to experience things in "un-chronological" order.<br /><br />I know my review is vague, but this is all that I can say without giving away the major plot elements. But I can add these yet: 1) Sandra Bullock is quite convincing as the tormented heroine, whose uncanny ability might or might not change the course of events. Most viewers would be impressed with her solid performance. 2) The material itself is fascinating, but the execution is ineffective with implausible situations and unlikely (even stupid) decisions by the characters. 3) Perhaps this is the most important. Her premonition (or whatever it is) looks convoluted, but the film's plot itself is fairly predictable. When Amber Valletta appears in one scene, most of you will instantly detect the identity of her character.<br /><br />But what is really annoying is the attempt of the filmmakers trying hard to make the film profound when it is not. Director Mennan Yapo tries to give the film dramatic tension by introducing some elements - psychiatrist and priest - but they not only hit the wrong note, but confuse the already complicated story of the main character Linda. To make matters worse, supports are almost insignificant. Nia Long and Kate Nelligan appear, but their characters have virtually nothing to do.<br /><br />"Premonition" is built from several intriguing premises, but it is frustrating to see them wasted in the messy screenplay.<br /><br />Not to be confused with Japanese film "Premonition," which has nothing to do with this Sandra Bullock film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>German director Mennan Yapo's first English language feature Premonition is a rather mixed bag. Its not really a thriller, its not really a horror film and it comes off at times as a confused mess.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a comfortable suburban woman who at first glance appears to have everything. She lives in a great house, has at first blush a loving husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and two young daughters. One day she gets a knock on the door from the sheriff's department telling her that Jim has been killed in an accident and her seemingly normal life begins to unravel. The next morning she wakes up to find her husband alive and well. Is this a premonition that she has had or is she losing her mind?<br /><br />Bullock takes on the role quite well but the non linear storytelling gets in the way of the audiences' enjoyment of the film. Days and events happen at random and the end result is more headache inducing than thrilling. Also, there is a tacked on quasi religious theme that is really not necessary to the story. The interesting question is  posed that if one know about future events does one have the power to change them? Sadly, this story line is not well developed.<br /><br />I saw the regular definition widescreen disc. The transfer is quite good and the audio in 5.1 sound is clear and has no noticible problems. The score by Klaus Badelt is eerie and effective as is the cinematography by<br />Torsten Lippstock.<br /><br />The disc comes with an array of extras including a commentary by Yapo and Bullock, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a gag real, a making of featurette, a completely unnecessary feature that tells the story in normal linear order and a double featurette on people who experience real life premonitions. A word on the commentary: it starts quite dry but picks up as the movie goes along.<br /><br />This is not a bad package for a rental but it is far from one of the best movie of the year.

It is however refreshing to see McMahon in a movie rather than his usual Nip/Tuck series.

So, the best I can say about this is that it is watchable.<br /><br />This isn't so much a time-travel movie, just a time-error movie.  Sandra Bullock plays a woman who lives one of her weeks out of order.  She wakes up on a Thursday and is told by the Sheriff that her husband is dead.

The underlying story line is that the husband dies as he is headed out to have an affair.  So, does she let him die or does she try to save him?<br /><br />The biggest problem is that there are soooo many inconsistencies.  The biggest were some cuts on a girl's face.  This ended up occurring on the Tuesday of that week yet she lives through an entire Thursday where she didn't have cuts.  Sandra Bullock's mother is concerned because she doesn't know how the girl was cut but there were enough witnesses to the account to have told her the truth.  There was one day that started off repeating another day so I'm wondering if the writers were confused... tryng to write a new version of Groundhog's Day but instead changing it to a miss-step in time instead without changing the fundamentals of the story.<br /><br />And that is not all, but I think you get the idea:<br /><br />Flaws, flaws, flaws.  Some I can forgive but this movie was riddled with them and it just destroyed it for me and took all the enjoyment out of it.  There was so much more potential than a house-wife losing his man to another girl.  Come on!!  The writers could have come up with something better than this!<br /><br />Watchable at best, a complete time-travel flop at worst.<br /><br />Oh, it is beautiful in blu-ray.

Based on the award-winning Michael Cunningham novel of the same name, "The Hours" tells the story of three women whose lives are numbed to all feeling and are desperate to escape the private hell that enslaves each of them.  The story travels within four decades and jumps back and forth from the United States to England.  Nicole Kidman is author Virgina Woolf, who is battling depression while living in the suburbs of London with her overprotective husband in the 1920s.  Julianne Moore plays a 1950s Los Angeles housewife, apparently stifled by her marriage while coming to terms with her sexuality.  Merryl Streep is living in present-day Manhattan and is preparing a party for her longtime friend and AIDS-stricken poet (Ed Harris).  To explain how these three stories are connected would give away potential spoilers (if you haven't already read the book), but the film's performances are nothing short of excellent.  Kidman digs deep into the angst and despair of Woolf; her performance is a blazing revelation, and it excels by a nose (pardon the pun).  Moore's scenes with her young son are crushing and heartbreaking; you don't know whether to pity her or resent her for her selfishness.  And Streep, is, as ever, a powerhouse.  But the real star of the movie is director Daldry, who extracts great performances, and does a wonderful job at bringing the screenplay to life.  "The Hours" is hardly a feel-good movie, and the recurring themes of suicide and despair may put off some. But it's no doubt one of the best films of 2002.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>This is an excellent film made by Stephen Daldry.  Superb writing distinguishes it from novelist Michael Cunningham and its adaptation into film by experienced screenwriter David Hare.  In lesser hands, this delicate, poetic work probably would have been crushed.  That they utilized an ultra talented ensemble cast sealed this into solid A territory. It is about the quiet desperation that is the way we lead our lives in the hours allocated to our existence.  The only thing that ends the Hours is Death and, for some, like Virginia Woolf, the Hours become so untenable that death must be hastened along with suicide. The women who follow Woolf in the future face the same battles with The hours even though we/they have the benefits of more modern existence.  Some universals never change though and The Hours are etched in stone as a universal.  Every actor is first rate but the two to be singled out for breathtaking performances are Nicole Kidman as Woolf and Ed Harris as a dying poet.  I was able to more fully realize how talented Kidman is by not being blinded by her movie star looks.  She drastically changes her appearance so as to become Woolf and she also is the most extraordinary on showing what it is like to live The Hours.  Her scenes with a dying bird and at the train station with her husband are incredible.  Harris is just getting better and better from role to role.  Seemingly there is no role beyond him and he doesn't care how likable or unlikable his character is.  Whatever he needs to do to get the job done, he'll do it.  In this case, he is desperation and dying personified as a poet dying in New York City of AIDS under the bleakest of circumstances, who turns out being linked to all three of our desperate women in one way or another.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>A film that manages to be faithful to a seemingly impossible-to-adapt book, "The Hours" features three of the best working actress in three different, haunting roles, but the film itself deals with how meaning, passion and happiness can be found in the moments of life moreso than in its overall fabric. <p>Nicole Kidman's work as Virginia Woolf is showy, devastating, romantic and remarkable, but it's Julianne Moore's take on a housewife's day of depression and disappointment that struck me the most.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>In 1921 England, author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) has been banished to the country to recover following a suicide attempt. While she wants desperately to return to a more stimulating environment in London, the ideas for her next novel "Mrs. Dalloway" begin to form in her mind. In 1951 Los Angeles, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a loving husband and engaging little boy. But that life is unsuited to her and, finding it  unbearable, she seeks refuge in Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway". In New York City 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a party for an old friend. Her friend, a poet named Richard (Ed Harris), nicknamed her "Mrs. Dalloway" when they were young. Now he is dying, and Clarissa is left to reflect on their relationship and the life she has made for herself. <p>"The  Hours" is a character study of these three women, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham. The three women are very different in character and circumstance, but are linked, not only by "Mrs. Dalloway", but by their emotional isolation and the thoughts of death that engulf them. "The Hours" shows us only one day in the lives of each of these characters. We learn enough about them to make them interesting, but not so much as to  make them tedious. The performances by Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep, as well as the supporting cast, are excellent. Much has been made of the prosthetic nose which Nicole Kidman donned for her role as Virginia Woolf, and she truly is unrecognizable in the film. But it is her voice, which is changed as radically as her face, which transforms her into Woolf. Her performance really is impressive and may be her best work to date. Kidman easily holds her own next to the more experienced and acclaimed thespians, Streep and Moore. Meryl Streep's performance here is better than her Oscar-nominated turn in "Adaptation", so this is a must for Streep fans. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I must say that I loved this movie a great deal, and I saw it at the theater 2 times, but I saw Frida 5 times. I am very pleased with the cast, art direction, director, and oringinal score. What I was trully disappointed and even upset by was that Salma Hayek lost the Oscar to Nicole Kidman who had just one third of the movie here, and Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep not only had more screen time, but were more mesmerizing. Kidman was better in her other films including The Others, Moulin Rouge, and her breakthrough To Die For. This beautiful and artsy "heavy-duty" drama is not going to be appreciated by anyone who has sexual phobia or unsympathetic towards depressed and tramatized characters vividly portrayed here by Ed Harris, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep. If you embrace this film, you will be profoundly moved. Otherwise, you'll probably end up resenting it.<br /><br />Everyone in The Hours has something to do with the book Mrs. Dalloway written by Virginia Wolfe(Nicole Kidman) in the '30s of Richmond, England, and Julianne Moore  played a depressed housewife named Laura Brown living in Los Angeles in the '50s. Wolfe's book not only made an impact on Laura Brown, it also affected the lives of a the readers of modern day include Laura Brown's son Richard, a writer played by the scene-stealing Ed Harris, and his caretaker/ex-lover Clarissa Vaughan(Meryl Streep). Mrs. Dalloway is a character of good hostess, and she likes to throw parties for her friends, but ultimately neglects herself and becomes depressed. Clarissa gets nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by Richard, because she loves to throw parties.<br /><br />The three time periods and stories are not directly connected, by it serves the same purpose for the film, and it's edited meticulously along with appropriate scores that makes the film consistent. The film takes place in just one day in three different eras. It the beginning, Wolfe narratted a suicide note as she walked into a river after completing the writing of Mrs. Dalloway. Then it goes backward to early on in the day before when she was still working on the book. The three eras are inserted between each other back and forth as the day in the lives of three women progresses.<br /><br />In the day of Virginia, she gets a visit from her sister(played by the mesmerizing Miranda Richardson), and her children. While she was lounging with them, her mind was in the world of Mrs. Dalloway, and her sister was overwhelmed that she's still so eccentric and unstable. Later, she attempted to ran away from her husband, because she didn't want to live in Richmond anymore, and wanted to move back to London. Her husband acused of her mental sickness.....<br /><br />In the day of Laura Brown, she's heavily pregnant, and she spends the day at home with her son Richard. She reads Mrs. Dalloway, and was moved by it a great deal. She bakes a cake for her husband's(John C. Reiley) birthday with the help of Richard. Her neighbor Kitty comes over to ask her to take care of her dog when she goes to the hospital. Toni Collette is just in this one scene(about 5 mins.), and she's quite striking, especially when she engages a "lesbian kiss" with Julianne Moore. This moment she realized that she's so unhappy being a housewife, and wanted to end it. Later, Brown impulsively abandons Richard and proceeded a suicide attempt like the end of the book in a hotel room.......<br /><br />In the day of Mrs. Dalloway/Clarissa Vaughan buys the flowers herself like Mrs. Dalloway in the book. She goes to visit Richard who's dying of AIDS, and has no desire to live any longer. The party is being put together for him to celebrate his award-winning novel based on his life, with a "monster" character based on his mother, but he's reluctant to go, because he didn't want anyone to see him so sick. One of Richard's ex-boyfriend(Jeff Daniel) also came to her apartment when she was preparing the food. She breaks down into massive tears when they talked about the old memories of their relationship with Richard.......<br /><br />Other supporting roles are well played by Allison Janney(Clarissa's lover), Stephen Dillane(Wolfe's unconditional-loving husband), and Claire Danes(Clarissa's daughter).<br /><br />I was very moved by Ed Harris role and performance. He really portrayed all the pain and sadness of someone who is dying and had been abandoned by his mother when he was a boy. The scene when he committed suicide in front of Clarissa was so powerful. Meryl Streep was mesmerizing! Julianne Moore's depressed and suicidal housewife who chose to abandon her family instead killing herself may be unlikeable, but she's more outstanding, especially her scene opposite Meryl Streep when her character aged to be an old woman. The remorse and sadness on her face was flawless. As for Nicole Kidman, the scene at the train station was her best in this movie. It was a very heavy agruement with her husband. She's very meticulous with the mannerism, even though she doesn't totally looked like Virginia Wolfe. She's captivately when her mind is doing multiple thinking. Overall, Julianne Moore's crying scenes are more compelling to watch, because she's more vulnerable of the three.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>After reading THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham I took a respite from reading, so very superb was his book that I didn't want to share brain space with anything else.  Then seeing the film adaptation spurred me on to reading MRS DALLOWAY yet again.  Now the DVD is out and I rank THE HOURS with my top five movie favorites.  Cunningham's genius-quality response to Virginia Woolf's novel, MRS DALLOWAY, successfully admixes one day in the lives of three women from different times - Virginia Woolf in 1923 as she devises her novel and the characters' fates; Laura Brown a fragile housewife/mother teetering on self destruction, and Clarissa Vaughn in 2001 an editor and mother in a longterm lesbian relationship - planning a &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;-type party for her AIDS ridden poet friend Richard. David Hare has written a screenplay that seamlessly weaves these three women's lives through the hours of one day: Virginia Woolf inhales, Clarissa exhales, Laura Brown stares into the same type space as both Virginia and Clarissa.  The result is a wondrous, intimate exploration of the value of living, a value than can without censure include taking one's own life.  The dialogue is mesmerizing, a script (and book) that leaves you wishing you could memorize each word and line.  Every one of the &quot;company&quot; roles is acted (and directed) with uncanny finesse - Toni Colette, Ed Harris, Allyson Janney, Charles Reilly  - all of them.  The Phillip Glass music score is the perfect choice to meld these ingredients into an unforgetable film.  Another great joy of buying this DVD is the additional history of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, the enlightened (for once) dialogue among Nicole Kidman, Myrl Streep, and Julianne Moore, and the comments by composer Glass, writers Cunningham and Hare, and director Daldry paying homage to a project which all began with Virginia Woolf.  I cannot recommend this movie/DVD more highly. It is simply and uniquely  exquisite.</p></br><a href="../users/A319YRDK8Y39N.html">A319YRDK8Y39N</a><br/><p>One of the absolute best crafted films of 2002, The Hours flawlessly combines the stories of three similar women in different times during one significant day of their lives.<p>The women; author Virginia Wolfe (Nicole Kidman), a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore), and a modern day magazine editor (Meryl Streep), are the core of this film. Each feels trapped in a life they're not happy with, and want to find a way to improve it, or end it. This is a heavy film, dealing with suicide, sexual identity, love and happiness. And between the cross-cutting  in time, the film could have been a terrible mess. But instead director Stephen Daldry created a masterpiece. He never stays too long with one woman, knowing the exact moment to switch to another story. But each story is fully engaging, drawing you in.<p>Equally as astounding, if not more so, is the superb acting by each and every actor. If anyone stands it, though, it would be Kidman. She absolutely becomes Virginia Wolfe in a restrained, sorrowful way. She deserves the best actress win here. Moore and Streep also give powerhouse performances, but Ed Harris's magnificent supporting role as an AIDS stricken man is as astounding as Kidman's. His physical transformation is astounding in itself. John C. Reilly also turns in a good performance as Moore's disillusioned husband, but no one performs less then amazingly.<p>The subject matter may be a downer, but that doesn't make the film any less perfect. How it deals with sadness and the desire for happiness is realistic for many people experiencing depression. The world we live in is far from perfect, and this film shows how if we're not careful, it can bring us down in despair.<p>The Hours is a rare, wonderful film that deserves any awards it gets Oscar night. Though it may not be very cheerful, it is one of the best of the year. It gets my highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>Virginia Woolf is frustrated by having to live in the suburbs instead of in her beloved London to the point of being suicidal - she later DOES commit suicide after the Germans bomb her London home to oblivion - thank you, Germans; Julianne Moore's 50's housewife is trapped in the suburbs with an entitled husband and an unpleasant neurotic child who grows up to be a failed impersonator of Marcel Proust and a torturer of Meryl Streep's character who lives in Greenwich Village but creates chores for herself that make her just as suburban as any housewife with busy work that has her circling the drain instead of reaching any higher plain.  Both Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore are better actresses than Meryl Streep and have bigger roles in this film as well.  I guess Mrs. Dalloway is a nonevent.  She does have an interestingly strange face - sometimes she looks Asian.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>These three women were looking for something that none of them found.  They needed unconditional love, and in that their three lives came together.  There is such a ubiquitous sadness, and it makes one wonder if it is possible to find some sense of happiness or fullfillment in one's life, or if it is just a chimera.  Running away or dissolving your identity into somone else's or just walking into a stream is not an end, and, unfortunately is not much of a beginning either.  Are we all destined for unhappy desperation . . great talent doesn't do it, neither does a conventional housewife's existence give answers, nor, apparently does caring for someone else.  Maybe life is a haphazard set of experiences leading downward, and ultimately to nothingness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>2002 review:<br /><br />I loved this movie! I thought it was superbly done. It reminded me of MAGNOLIA in the way it intertwined the stories together, and how they all came together. It was a very moving, powerful film with EXCELLENT performances. Nicole Kidman was AWESOME as Virginia Woolf and Julianne Moore was mesmerizing. Ed Harris was PERFECT in his role. It is a film that really makes you think, and as you're watching it, you realize that at one point in your life, you have felt like these characters before. I will end up buying this one, and now I want to read the book as well.<br /><br />2010 review:<br /><br />It is clear to me upon reading many of the comments on this site, that most of the viewers did not "get" this film. To fully grasp the themes of the film, it helps to have read both Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" and Cunningham's "The Hours" in order to understand the psychology of the characters and the reasoning behind their life choices. This film is more or less about three women from three different decades, who are sublimely unhappy with their lives, and who try to cope with that unhappiness through art and creativity. All the while, they seriously consider suicide as an end to their misery, but opt to stay alive to make others around them happy. Some survive this inner struggle, and some don't. Some will argue with the film's humanist worldview, but as far as I can tell, these emotions are real, these situations are real, and they happen every day. The Hours only brings those things to the light.<br /><br />Much has been made of the "lesbian" kissing scenes in the film. The viewers who have commented vehemently on these three instances have indeed taken it all out of context. These women so desperately want to make a connection with another human being, that the kisses aren't what they seem to be on the surface. They are not sexual, by any means. Yes, there are gay and lesbian characters in the film, but there are gay and lesbian people in life, as well.<br /><br />Every time I see this film, it's as though I see it through new eyes. I always gain a fresh perspective, and this has much to do with the fact that I am older, and have gained much more life experience than when I first saw the film years ago. Everything about the film bursts with life, from the beautiful cinematography, to the acting, the Philip Glass' beautiful score. There is also an unexpected scene of forgiveness that is truly touching.<br /><br />You should come away from this film a little more enlightened than you were before, that is, if you are willing to go there...and it always helps to read the books beforehand to gain a fuller experience. Those who have claimed that the film is about "nothing" are dead wrong. This film works on so many levels. It is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>When I read Cunningham's novel, I was completely hypnotized by the story and unable to put it down.  When I heard that it was being made into a film I was very skeptical as most of the novel seems to be interior monologue.  Anyway - I don't know how they did it, but they pulled it off beautifully.<br /><br />Most of the success must be handed to Daldry for managing to make such an interior novel into a filmed, blended story.  An amazing feat, really.<br /><br />The perfomances are all exceptional.  These are actors who understood the material and respected it.  Streep, Kidman, Reilly, Harris and Colette are just perfect.  Moore is just brilliant as Laura Brown.<br /><br />This is a dark, sad melodrama- so it's not for everyone.  If that is your cup of tea, however - get it now!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>When sitting down to review this superb film, at first the task proved to be problematic. This picture is an adaptation of a prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham, which is loosely based on one of the great modernist novels of the last century, Mrs. Dalloway. In many respects, too, the film touches on the author's life, Virginia Woolf. The singular genius of the film is its fundamental structure, in terms of running all the aforementioned pieces and their themes in tandem. This is extremely clever because this was Woolf's intent when writing Mrs. Dalloway: connecting apparently disparate people and themes in a coalescent manner. Virginia Woolf was an experimental novelist, who successfully used the literary technique known as stream of consciousness. Breaking away from the conventional realist or naturalist forms used predominately in the 19th century, where the narrative was carried along by way of external action, this new technique moved the action into the characters mind, known as interior monologue. In Mrs Dalloway, we are invited into Clarice's mind, gaining access to her memories of childhood and relationships, and at the same time, her life parallels Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran on the edge of insanity. Their lives become interconnected on a level of thought and time.  In ~The Hours~ the lives of three women, existing in three different time periods, run parallel to each other, all searching for meaning, all connected on levels of thought, circumstance and time, all in one seamless narrative. <p>In many films the majority of burden is on the main character, the lead actor, to ensure the project is a success. As there are three distinct narratives in this film, and three leading actors, it would have only taken one weak performance to turn this film into a disaster. I believe the producers knew this and managed to hire probably the top three female actors in Hollywood.  Only one received the Oscar, Nicole Kidman, in the role of Virginia Woolf. However, Meryle Streep as Clarisa Vaughn and Julian Moore as Laura Brown put in outstanding performances, who more than deserved this recognition as well. <p>This is a complicated film but a beautiful one with a haunting soundtrack by Phillip Glass, which demands to be viewed more than once to discover its many nuances, allusions and their connections.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;.  The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep.  Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes.  Not exactly light entertainment!  There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display.  This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>One reason I knew this film would be good:  Meryl Streep.  Beyond the greatest actress of our time, everything else is absolutely brilliant about this remarkable film following the hours in three women's lives in different decades, each with similiar and compelling problems.  Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolfe, the depressed writer dealing with a life that is stifling her, a world that she desperately wants to escape.  Julianne Moore is superb again (also giving another great performance in "Far From Heaven") as a 50s house wife that is also living in a life that she can't bare living.  Meryl plays the modern gal, rounding out the trio and all three are drawn together in some way by the book Virginia is writing called "Mrs. Dalloway".  Both Moore and Kidman received Oscar nominations for their roles and its a disappointment that Meryl didn't receive one as well.  But nonetheless, the entire film is beautifully directed and acted.  Ed Harris does an incredible job as a good friend and former lover of Streep's character.  This is the kind of film that makes you realize how important and artistic the media  of movie making is.  Make time and see this film.  You won't regret spending a few hours with these three incredible women.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>This film is the first film in a long time where I actualy agree with the film that may or may not bring home the big Best Pic award at the Oscars. Normally that prize is given to the film that's the most showy and obvious. This film had the power to do something very few films can do today and that is, give the audiece some more credit and give them some more to think about afterwards. Everyone is wondering WHY they were so sad. In the great tradition of Mr. David Lynch I believe that we don't always need to be spoon fed the answers. Haven't you ever been sad and could not for the life of you figure out why? The human person is far more complex then to just sum things up in a neat package. It's far too easy to dimiss this film as a "chick-flick" and just say that women are too dramatic. Women are complex and beautiful creatures. They are far more keen to their emotions then men are, and that is what the film is about. I thought this was a striking film and simply one of the best of the year. But to me it does stand out just a little bit more because it had a wonderful conclusion and I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards.<p>And about the whole repressed Lesbian thing. That is far too easy an answer. The only Lesbian in the movie was Meryl Streep, Virginia Wolf and Julianne Moore did it out of a repressed longing just to be free to do whatever they wanted. It was a sign of inner rebellion. To dumb the film down into "a movie about three depressed lesbians" is an insult to the film and the three great actresses who brought it to life. Each performance was just an eye opening experience, and the cross over from past to present was very reminiscent of another great film of 2002, Adaptation. <p>In a time where movies are far too straight forward and peddle the audience with easy answers it's nice to see that film's still leave themselves open to interpretation. Lives are not so neat and easy to explain. When you can answer all the questions that come up in your life abouts sadness and joy then come back to this film and ridicule it, but if you cannot I suggest you watch it again and admire it for what it doesn't answer. <p>To the many women who live long hard hours.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Recently I viewed the movie, &quot;The Hours&quot; starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. The movie is based on the book by Michael Cunningham and follows the book's ideas about as precisely as possible for a screenplay conversion.<p>The story revolves around the author, Virginia Woolf, as she writes her story, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and how the words she writes affect two other women in different time periods. Virginia is portrayed by Nicole Kidman and she does a wonderful job showing the essence of Virginia's depression and self-doubt. A brilliant writer who involves all of your senses in her prose she succumbs to the artist's tendency to be self-doubters and insecure, possibly from all the exposure to critics at every bend and corner. The cigarettes she smokes seethe about her as she contemplates her suicide and a word to leave behind, like her soul is going up in smoke. She lies beside a dead bird and she feels dead before her time, unable to fly and stifled by depression that is never fully explained. Her end is filmed in such a way that she surrenders herself to the river's current and slowly gets swept away by nature but she seems somehow freed by her own death, floating along in time and crossing the borders that time presents.<p>Julianne Moore plays the character, Laura Brown; a pregnant homemaker in the 1950's who is struggling with what life has to offer her. She seems to exist in a blur of emotion all of which sways towards depression. She attempts to bake a perfect cake for her &quot;perfect&quot; husband's birthday and fails sending herself into a moment of panic that almost produces her own demise. She runs away from her child and stays alone in a hotel ready to take her life and that of her unborn. She reads &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and becomes involved in another's misfortune which somehow awakens her to her senses and she retreats back to the normalcy of her mundane life. I could not help but be emotional during a scene where she is preparing herself for bed and her husband calls from the bedroom, &quot;Come to bed Laura Brown,&quot; it left me with a sickened feeling. In Laura's eyes you see her sadness and her desperate need to leave but she stays, unhappily, like a servant.<p>Meryl Streep plays, Clarissa Vaughn, a modern woman who follows the footsteps of Virginia's character &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; as she spends her day catering to others. She buys flowers in desperate attempts to cheer up those around her when in fact she is the one who is in need of cheer. She tries to revive a dying man played brilliantly by Ed Harris, Richard, who is succumbing to the power of AIDS and all of its downfalls. Clarissa opens windows for brightness where all she sees is gray; she perks up the grayness with flowers but only manages to bring a feeling of hopelessness to Richard instead. His writing award seems to go unnoticed although she plans a tremendous celebration his soul just shuts down. Under all of the pressure Clarissa breaks down and experiences the sadness of the day and the reality of death. Richard falls from his own window in his desperate act of suicide and mercy. Clarissa is left to deal with all of the pain.<p>In the end we learn that Richard is in fact the son of Laura Brown. Seemingly she has transferred her loneliness and despair to the life of her own son without regret. She explains that she abandoned her family after all, needing to conduct her life on her own terms. <p>The music and the language of the film inspire creative juices, especially the scenes where Virginia Woolf is speaking. Having read the book first I was able to experience more than the film managed to contain although the film was more easily explained. I recommend both expressions for the full impact of these desperate women and the lives they lead. It will not take hours to be gripped by their needs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I bought The Hours for cheap, so I was impressed, and for once, ended up watching it within a couple of days of buying - not something I do often, judging by my "to watch" pile!<br /><br />I always watch the trailers first on the DVD, if they're available. Some people disagree with this. Personally, I like doing it. Plus, I like watching the "coming soon" trailers too - it always gives me an idea as to what DVDs to add to my wishlist etc.<br /><br />I watched The Hours with my Dad, and actually had to WAKE him up at the end - now he never falls asleep at movies. I do. What is The Hours about? Three women, with very little lives, and feeling trapped at every turn. Yes, there are also women kissing in this movie, for the guys - and girls I guess.<br /><br />I didn't identify with any of the women, I found the film quite dull, and uninteresting. It had so much promise. And I couldn't handle watching Ed Harris in his role - normally I love him too!<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie - maybe it's because I haven't read the book, I don't know. I'd be interested in reading the book, perhaps, but I still have quite a few books on my "to read" list. (Stop buying books and DVDs!) I'll still keep the DVD - after all it was only cheap, and if I ever read the book, I might give it another try again.</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>"The Hours" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique. The film (and the book by Michael Cunningham) is structured around the process of linking up three stories set at different points in time. Each story concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs, and to find a way to get it.<br /><br />The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, "Mrs. Dallaway"; which is the story of one day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in the early 1950's concerns a Laura Brown (Moore) who is reading "Mrs. Dallaway". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.<br /><br />Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch "The Hours" are:<br /><br />Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories. Woolf writes: "Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers herself" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks that sentence.<br /><br />Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess, making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating.<br /><br />Like "The Big Chill", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters. Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.<br /><br />Woolf began the book "Mrs. Dallaway" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown describes the book to her neighbor as: "Oh, it's about this woman who's incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't".<br /><br />At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her. Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those relationships do not give them what they need.<br /><br />There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs this so desperately.<br /><br />Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity. Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults around them do not seem to be aware of.<br /><br />Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed. Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are, we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our lives, becoming ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the Moonlight Graham character in "Field of Dreams" (who assumed he would have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes that it was her only moment of actual happiness.<br /><br />There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production design issue (young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set box).<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Three women.  Three different time periods.  Three different situations.  But yet, in some way, all are linked to the Virginia Woolf novel, "Mrs. Dalloway".  Each woman wakes up one morning with the anticipation of some sort of party.  There's Virginia Woolf herself in 1923, whose creativity as well as mental illness is apparent.  She's frustrated at her forced seclusion from the London she loves and is making time for her sister's visit.  There's Clarissa Vaughn, a middle-aged New York woman who is having a party for a good friend and former lover who is dying of AIDS.  And there's Julianne Moore as Laura Brown, a 1951 housewife who is planning on baking a cake for her husband's birthday.  Michael Cunningham linked all this together in the small masterpiece of a novel.  And the screenwriter, David Hare did nothing less than a brilliant job in adapting it to the screen.  I just finished reading the book and so I was particularly sensitive to the small changes, such as eliminating some of the minor characters.  But the rather introspective and sad tone of the book is still there.  And the characters spring to life in the kind of performances that will surely garner them all academy award nominations.<p>Nicole Kidman is cast as Virginia Woolf.  I was surprised at that because I think of her as a glamour queen.  However, for this role she wears a prosthetic nose, and her makeup gives her a sallow appearance.  She comes across as dowdy and homely and slightly insane.  And her acting is so good that I thought I was seeing the actual Virginia Woolf on the screen.  Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn.  She's living with her own set of life regrets.  There's sadness beneath her veneer of the perfect hostess planning a party, and it's not a surprise when she lets it come out.  And then there is Julianne Moore cast as Laura Brown, all alone in her despondency even though she seems to have a perfect life.  Ed Harris is cast as the AIDS patient who is also going mad.  They, and the rest of the cast are some of the best actors in the business, and it really shows. <p>The cinematography and sets are also outstanding and the shifts between the three stories are seamless.  There will be a gesture in one scene that is picked up in the next and this kind of overlapping editing keeps the story flowing.  There's a theme of suicide throughout.  And bisexuality.  Mostly, though its about the our need for love and the choices we make about how to spend our hours.  Much of the story is painful.  But yet, its theme is universal. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>'THE HOURS" is a beautiful movie made from a well written but ugly story. 3 tragic lives have obvious connections. In the 1920's a woman writes a novel called "Mrs. Dalloway", the author lives a sad life. She is unhappy no matter where she lives. She believes moving back to London will make her happy. When in fact she was unhappy there the first time. In the 1950's, a house wife reads the novel "Mrs Dalloway". In the more recent year of 2001 a woman is alot like the character Mrs. Dalloway from the 1920's novel of the same name. In this segment of "The Hours" Ed Harris is superb as a middle aged man with AIDS. He's a writer who after becoming ill begins down a road of severe depression. In the 1920's, Nicole Kidman stars.. In the 50's.. Julianne Moore stars, and in the present day segment.. Meryl Streep stars. All 3 stories in time are masterfully weaved together. All our characters have so much in common, tragic things and wonderful things too. Now lets bring up Nicole Kidman's Oscar. Yes she performed beautifully. However was this role deserving of an Oscar in a leading role? Perhaps not, the role was one that I feel was not large enough for a leading role Oscar, and as Denzel Washington said as he gave her the award that night. "Nicole Kidman by a nose!" I love Nicole Kidman, but I would have rather seen her win an award for her flawless work in "The Others". With that being said her work here certainly didn't hurt the movie. Just about everything about this film is worth praising. 4 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2BEU7GPGNIG44.html">A2BEU7GPGNIG44</a><br/><p>All of the women in this film give good performances.  Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job playing a whacked out sheltered Virginia Woolf.  My favorite performances where those by Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  These two women seemed to outshine Nicole Kidman in this film.  All three storylines were strong.  I really think this is a chick flick, I liked it, my husband hated it.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>This is one film that richly deserved its critical accolades, definitely worth owning, or at least repeated viewings.<p>The characters are nuanced, with multiple and conflicting drives---not the tidy and simplistic cardboard-cutouts Hollywood usually comes up with.  The three women---Streep, Moore, and Kidman---are flawlessly directed and lead three vaguely connected, but very parallel lives.  Streep and Moore's characters reminded me of so, so many women I've known, both friends and family: women who maintain a happy facade (Streep as a dynamic, cheerful socialite and Moore as a placid suburbian housewife) behind which they are desperately empty, sad, and unfulfilled.  <p>Nicole Kidman puts in the finest performance of her career---I never would've expected it, given the usually vacuous roles she plays, but her Virginia Woolf is nothing short of amazing.  You can just feel the towering genius and passion behind the eerie, unhinged exterior.  Devoid of makeup and hair coloring, and wearing a bigger prosthetic nose, she actually looks a million times more attractive, and more human, than her usual generic-glam-blonde getup.  <p>Woolf's suicide was a courageous refusal to live a life (in her case, one of chronic mental illness) that she didn't want, could not change and could not otherwise escape.  Ed Harris's character also chooses suicide, rather than watch himself die slowly from AIDS.  For them, suicide is the only remaining gateway to freedoom and wholeness.  <p>Moore's character finds the only alternative to suicide is to desert her husband and children.  Only Streep's character dangles in the middle, mired in the same deep, gnawing and nameless discontent but not yet having found a way out.  <p>What many viewers may find deeply disturbing is the subtext that true existential FREEDOM---a beaten-to-death buzzword after 9/11---is not only very precious but very elusive.  Why?  Because most of us do not pass the crucible, are simply not willing to pay the REAL price of freedom: leaving behind everything that chains us down.  Even if that means killing yourself, or walking out on your family, or coming out of the closet.  Unwilling to let go of our lives, we become trapped in the misery of this clinging cowardice, we become prisoners who can only sit and wait for Death to come and get us, counting the hours dragging by.  <p>And Phillip Glass's magnificent score keeps everything moving along crisply, despite the film's title.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>The overall story of this film is great, with great dialogue, interesting characters. Somewhat strange character in Julianne Moore...I was just waiting for her to do something really strange, but it never happened!! With this deep movie, the viewer really has to stay focused, and think.  This is a film that has really good intentions, but is very choppy. As soon as you get used to one idea, the whole story changes, and you basically have to wait till the end for the complete story to be pulled together.  Some suprises...very interesting!</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Stephen Daldry's "The Hours" is one of the more courageous and thought-provoking cinematic works of recent years. You will literally be thinking about the many themes this film covers for days to come after seeing it. While events never truly repeat themselves from era to era, there are certain experiences that remain constant. Such experiences echo throughout time but take on a new shape with each succeeding generation. <p>"The Hours" features three story arcs: the first is set in the 1940's and features author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), the second is set in the 1950's and features housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and the last is set in 2001 and features modern woman Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep). All three women project strong facades to the outer world although each of them is suffering inside. The pressures of conforming to the role of nurturer expected of them continuously clashes with the cultural and social liberation they so desperately crave. There is sadness, despair, and guilt in all of these women's lives and the cold indifference in which their male companions regard their suffering forces them to seek support physically and spiritually in other women. <p>&quot;The Hours&quot; does not directly link the three separate arcs together in any conventional narrative. The three stories exist to illustrate how events throughout time rhyme with each other rather than truly repeat themselves. This film provides unique, but indirect, insights into the female experience through nuance and metaphor. It will therefore prove disorienting to those used to more straightforward styles of storytelling. However, those interested in sampling something different will be rewarded with an emotionally powerful viewing experience. The cast is astonishing with Kidman, Moore, and Streep all showing why they are considered three of the best actresses working today. The supporting cast of Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris have enough talent themselves to headline their own film but distinguish themselves well in strong supporting performances. Mention must also be made of Philip Glass' musical score which works to accentuate the strong emotional states of the film's various characters. All in all, "The Hours" is an impressive feat of filmmaking that will not easily fade from memory.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A Film By Stephen Daldry<p>The Hours is based on the Pulitzer Prize Winning novel by Michael Cunningham.  The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and Nicole Kidman won for Best Actress.  Also nominated were Julianne Moore and Ed Harris for their supporting roles.  It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.  This is a film with a high class pedigree.  <p>This film follows three women in three different time periods.  In the end, The Hours is really telling just one story and each of the time periods contributes to it.  We have Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1923 England, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951 California, and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) in 2001 New York.  The film does not have a story so much as it deals with issues revolving around the lives of these women: depression, suicide, death, and family.  The Hours does so in a way that is deeply personal but never pushes any viewpoint down the viewer's throat.  <p>Virginia Woolf is dealing with her personal issues of mental isolation as she writes Mrs. Dalloway.  She deals with depression and a desire to die to silence the voices in her head.  Laura Brown is a housewife who has to deal with a faltering relationship with her husband and she feels a kinship with the character of Mrs Dalloway in Woolf's novel (which she is reading).  Clarissa Vaughn is living in New York City, and it seems that she is living the life of Mrs Dalloway.  The movie features supporting performances by John C Reilly, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Alison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, and Stephen Dillane.  <p>This is the type of film that is made for the Academy Awards but really only has a specialized audience outside the Award circuit.  Critics love The Hours, but it is a slow moving drama and this will not appeal to everyone.  It is extremely well done, make no mistake about that, but this is not the movie to go to if you are looking for escapism.  This is the movie to go to when you are looking to think critically about the film and what it is saying about the human condition.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>The viewer has to prepare himself before watching "The hours". This is not a common movie. It's a deep, sad, and very depressive movie.<p>There are three timelines in "The hours", and director Daldry chose to show them simultaneously; all stories are about one day in the lives of three women. I'll list the three timelines:<p>1) England, 1923 - Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway; she receives the visit of her sister; she tries to set her life straight, as she's not living the life she wanted, because of medical and psychological problems. <p>2) California, 1950 - Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a little son; this is the day of her husband's (john C. Reilly) birthday; she's reading Mrs. Dalloway; she has doubts about everything, from her sexuality to her will to go on living.<p>3) New York, 2001 - Clarissa Vaughn's (Meryl Streep) day is about organizing a party to her friend and ex-one time-lover, the poet and writer Richard (Ed Harris), who is receiving an important prize of lifetime achievment in poetry.<p>The three stories are connected; the most obvious connection is that Clarissa Vaughn is the modern Mrs. Dalloway. There are recurrent themes in the three stories, all related to Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf's life: sexual doubts, depressive thoughts, death wishes. Stephen Daldry made a movie more complex than he wanted, without knowing he did it. Uncounsciously, "The hours" is deeper and denser than its director wanted it to be. You have to get a degree in psychology to fully understand all the relationship between the women characters. <p>Although "The hours" is starred by women, a movie about women, with three of today's top actresses, their constant presence and the fact that the three of them are so sad, depressive and unresolved characters, makes the male actors' (Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly and Ed Harris) acting excellent. The best one in my opinion is Stephen Dillane's Leonard Woolf. <p>Two things I didn't like:<p>A) Meryl Streep lost herself here; her acting seemed a little bit forced and self-conscious, trying to make Clarissa a different character from other characters she's played in other movies: she couldn't do it. I've seen this same Clarissa in other Meryl Streep movies (Meryl Streep is much better in "Adaptation").<p>B) Nicole Kidman, although in good acting shape, played a character (Virginia Woolf) so sad and depressive that I couldn't care one bit what happened to her. I think the writers exagerated Virginia's depression to make the audience understand better what happened to her, but this trick completely backfired. No one can stand Virgina Woolf in the movie. And the scene with the dead bird is the oldest metaphore ever. <p>Without any doubt, the real star of the movie is Julianne Moore. As the sad and unloving Laura, she is the most complex, convincing and believable character of "The hours". <p>There are other aspects of this movie to be discussed, but this review is already too long. <p>So, to wrap it up,<p>Grade 8.7/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>If you have not read a synopsis about The Hours or Mrs Dalloway, you will become confused, overwhelmed and emotional viewing this film. The film interweaves three women's story's with a symbiotic thread. Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career  with a nose for depression. Meryl Streep's performance is like watching your best friend in her kitchen as she prepares for a party and tells you about the friend she is going to honor that night. Julianne Moore plays a mother who loves too much but not enough. We follow each of these stories as they play out and weave in and out of each other's lives. The film is dramatic, shocking, and packed with powerful performances. You will love this film, but viewing it once is not enough. You will find a need to talk to with your friends and to discuss each nuance that disturbs or surprises you. See it with friends, prepare before you see it by reading a review or synopsis. You will be entranced and disturbed, but you will be able to devine more of your feelings and emotions after reviewing this film over and over in your mind.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The Hours is supposed to be a three story film where the characters are linked by depression and suicide although they themselves may not be suffering from these ailments but are close to someone who is. The stories are interlaced by these connections and by the book "Mrs Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf who also appears as one the main characters in one of the three stories. Its heavy on despair, misery, hopelessness and death.<p>The movie has some great acting from Meryl Streep but unfortunately the other cast are not really as functional as you would have expected. The movie does go to that next level in makeup effects such as aging, changing a persons face completely and the presentation of an aids victim. Tops marks all round for these effects and costumes but do these things make a film?<p>No, they do not. Stephen Daldry is not a very good director and if you did not like Billy Elliot then you will probably not like this vehicle either. He is an up-and-coming director but his work seems very amateurish as if he is not really conscious about the material at hand and realizing his vision onto the screen. Its ends up with many loose ends and missing connections that should have be made.<p>Nichole Kidmans character of Virginia Woolf ends up saying and doing very little. In most scenes she is just standing around doing or saying nothing. Unfortunately Julianne Moore goes one step beyond Kidmans character by simply walking straight off the set for "Far from Heaven" giving up a double-dose of a helpless woman in despair. The only one of the three that stands out is Meryl Streep and her performance is to be commended. Sadly John C. Reilly is wasted by also saying and doing very little but Ed Harris regrettably overacts his character to the point of killing any realism that he once had. Surprisingly enough the movie ends up not being as moving as what it makes itself out to be.<p>In short this movie is a misfire in a lot of ways and is pretty hollow overall. It is no "Remains of the Day", "Shadowlands", "Magnolia" or "Beaches" if that is what you are expecting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Hours was pure Oscar bait--a prestigey adaptation of an intellectual novel (see The English Patient for another) with Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep for God's sake--but beneath its pretty shell the film is pretty empty; by no means a bad film, it's a decent drama that benefited from a good marketing campaign and December release.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>After and hour and I couldnt take The Hours anymore and shut it off. It's a shame the movie is so long, boring and moves nowhere. The acting is excellent, especially by Moore.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>To me, this movie is cerebral and heavy-handed.  I didn't find the courage to watch it until recently because many of my friends either despised it or that they left the cinema early not knowing how to watch it.  I know this sounds silly, watching a movie is simply sit and watch but everyone's thought process is different and work on different levels.  I'm sure that people would appreciate the beauty of this movie would not tolerate the crassness of JackAss the movie, that's for sure!  I find the Hours akin to a musical composition; it is moving with the rhythmical precision of a well-composed piece where everything fit together nicely to give us a coherent cacophony of sound.  I find it absorbing to sit through additional features such as Michael Cunningham (the author)'s talk on this Pulitzer winning book, of how he came out with the idea of writing about the lives of three women: the author, the character, and the reader.  The talks continued about the David Hare's involvement in the script, Director's decision of the choice of his casting, the difficulty that he faced in the making of this film, documentaries about Virginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway, the character that Virginia created.  Even the title of "The Hours" meant something.  Some of the things said in the movie lingered on even when the curtain drew to a close.  It's very profound when Virginia explained to her husband that sometimes, someone needed to die so that the living can appreciate and cherish their lives.  How true!  All three ladies in The Hours are deemed to be visionary, ahead of their times, not conventional in any sense of the word and because of that, their actions, things that they do are construed as out of ordinary.  As time moves on, history would judge them rather differently.  This movie is worth watching again in order to explore the many layers and depths that it contains.  For me, it's quite a journey.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>More intense and focused than the book that inspires it, "The Hours" has the presence of a gathering, angry storm, manifested in three women whose convictions, desires and wills do not entirely match, yet all find themselves wondering if their lives could have or should have more to them than they do. <p> Nicole Kidman is the standout as Virginia Woolf, the early 20th Century British novelist both ahead of and trapped by her era, embarking upon writing her book,  "Mrs. Dalloway," which she believes will fully distinguish her genius. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a 1950s  Florida housewife reading the book and attempting to prepare a proper birthday cake for her husband. Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn, who intends to throw a party for a friend dying of AIDS (Ed Harris) as he's about to receive the Carrothers Prize for poetry. <p> Director Stephen Daldry plays up the parallels of the three women, much as Michael Cunningham did in the book. In the compressed universe of a movie, these parallels are more obvious, and at times intrusive on the story, as Daldry seems to need to point and nod at his stylistic flourishes (See the flowers? Notice the dialogue?) to a point reaching irritation.<p> But the performances carry the movie past the indulgences.  Kidman, as Woolf, stalks her brooding scenes as if she's in her final role -- Daldry likes how Kidman smokes a cigarette so much, he shows it several times. Kidman, with a prosthetic nose plastered on to complete the character's transformation, holds her cards close -- Woolf is brilliant, and slightly mad, and good at concealing her moods -- until a late, angry scene at a train station, as she attempts to flee her rural England home for London, a main source of her madness. Kidman controls this performance; it doesn't get away from her like Alice Harford did in "Eyes Wide Shut." She's outstanding.<p> Moore and Streep, obviously, inhabit smaller roles. Between the two, Moore has to work harder to make us believe her housewife is teetering so much on the edge of things that she's prone to crack. I'm not sure she gets there; she doesn't have enough time to develop Laura Brown's quirks, and what time she does have she underplays. <p> Streep has her own troubles, playing Clarissa, a fiftyish lesbian -- methinks Streep doesn't exude "lesbian," hence, this aspect of Clarissa is downplayed -- who very well could have lived an entire life with her friend Richard (Harris), a brooding, mercurial genius not unlike Woolf, who once kissed Clarissa on a sand dune near the ocean and defined her one moment of pure happiness.  What I love about Streep is her willingness to let others chew the scenery -- she's a cheery team player for a superstar, ain't she? -- and boy, does Ed Harris gnaw away. <p>What the hell's gotten into this man? Five years ago, he was slogging around in "Milk Money" and hamming it up in "Stepmom." Now, with this performance and his tour de force work in "Pollock," he's redefining anger mismanagement. Harris has two extended scenes, and it's all he needs to put a sad, cruel stamp on the whole movie, like Woolf, his mind is a caged animal, bound up in ways by AIDS in he can never shake loose. You might remember him more than any of the women.<p> Inevitably, you compare the movie to the book. Daldry's version --- my guess is this kind of movie can and will be remade a different way -- holds up. Cunningham, in the novel, allows himself the ability to rustle through the minds of his characters -- all of them -- whenever he sees fit; one of the great triumphs of the book is that he keeps the reader on a clear and straight path through all the shifting perspectives. Although it contains suicides, the novel's pervading emotion is of fleeting sadness, or, in some cases regret. Daldry cranks up those emotions into a stiffer drink; an early scene with Clarissa in the flower shop, which passes without much incidence in the book, is an opportunity for Daldry in the movie to convey heavy tension. To his credit, Daldry isn't fearful to become less-than-elegant and press his camera into these women's faces. And what few special effects there are work nicely. In the end, Daldry respected the pedigree of his actresses and the novelist but worked them over a little, too, and the end result is unsettling and dramatic.<p>It was a mature, intelligent picture. It brought me to read the book, which I think might supplement the movie better than the movie would supplement the book. The book fills in the remaining blanks, but the meat of the book's power is right there on the screen.<p>"The Hours" won't let you down.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>I would have given this movie the Oscar for best movie of 2002. Adapted from Michael Cunningham's fine novel and directed by Stephen Daldry, who, as I remember, directed BILLY ELLIOTT as well, this film has everything going for it: first rate acting by everyone involved, beautiful cinematography, music by Philip Glass-- a composer I'm usually not into, but his compositions work perfectly here-- and a thoughtful plot. <p>The action covers one day in the lives of each of three women. We see Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) on the day she commits suicide in 1923. We visit Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) on a day in 1951, the day she decides not to commit suicide; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep on a day in 2001 when she is planning a party for her writer friend Richard (Ed Harris)who is dying of AIDS. The action goes back and forth among these three dates. Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn are connected to Virginia Woolf because of her novel MRS. DALLOWAY. Laura Brown is reading MRS. DALLOWAY, Virginia Woolf is working on the novel and Richard calls Clarissa &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  <p>The photography is quite wonderful here and helps to hold the movie together. For example, the same images are repeated in each time sequence. Virginia arrives at the first line of her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers, herself&quot;and proceeds to arrange flowers. Laura's husband buys her flowers for &quot;his&quot; birthday, which she arranges. Finally Clarissa goes shopping to buy tons of flowers for Richard's party. There are also images of eggs being broken as the characters prepare food, the different women in bed, the scenes of the three women washing their faces, the three women kissing other women, and finally, on each day someone arrives early. These visual images make the plot even smoother than in the novel, I think.<p>Much has been made of Kidman's false nose. Nobody would recognize her as the stunning Australian actress here as she is quite frumpy as Woolf. Meryl Streep is as alway magnificent. There is a stunning scene when she meets the older Laura Brown who makes her apology for leaving her children-- &quot;I chose life.&quot; Clarissa says nothing in words to condemn Laura. Her eyes tell it all. Acting doesn't get finer than this. As I recall Ed Harris got mixed reviews when the movie first opened. I am at a loss to understand why. He is totally believable as someone in the last stages of AIDS; indeed, some of his scenes are almost too painful to watch.<p>There are great lines in this film, some of them straight out of the novel. Woolf: &quot;Even crazy people want to be asked.&quot; She wanted to &quot;look life in the face.&quot; Richard: &quot;I have to face the hours.&quot; &quot;I have stayed alive for you. Now you [Clarissa] have to let me go.&quot; Clarissa remembers a day years ago when she and Richard were young and in love and there was such a sense of possibility. &quot;We thought it was the beginning of happiness, but it was happiness.&quot;<p>The movie says so much about so many things that are important-- death, suicide, insanity, illness, friendship and, above all, love. I don't mean to make the movie sound trite. Is is far from that. People will be watching it years from now.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>A book is not a movie. A movie is not a book. While both are visual media, in the sense that we absorb the content through our eyes, a film must succeed primarily via what is unstated but suggested, while a book must make a statement. I loved the book. I was reluctant to see the film. I needn't have been concerned. The film is faithful to the essence of the book, and that's what is important.<p>With heartfelt performances throughout, exquisitely fine-tuned editing, and great directorial skill, everything pulls together to make a series of intertwined statements about the inner lives of women versus what is displayed externally.<p>Without question, this is the best performance Meryl Streep has given in a very long time. Her Clarissa is strong yet vulnerable; she is the classic caregiver whose feelings get glossed over or put on hold while what must be done gets done. Julianne Moore is, as always, flawless in her ability to make us feel what her character feels. And the big surprise is Kidman's performance; she moves in and takes up residence inside Virginia Wolfe--haunted and driven, conflicted and yet optimistic, even in her contemplations of death. <p>Splendid as ever in supporting roles, Claire Danes, Allison Janney and Toni Collette each offer fully dimensional characters in their brief times onscreen. I was particularly taken by young Jack Rovello as Richie and Ed Harris as the poet Richard. There is something very potent both in the casting and in the roles as they're played out.<p>Altogether this is a remarkable film--one that is about women but that doesn't show them to be weak or helpless or dependent upon men either for rescue or survival. It's about struggling to get past the restrictions of society and its imposed definition of who and what women ought to be. This isn't lightweight material; it's thoughtful and provocative--just as the book was. And so the film succeeds brilliantly in carrying the message successfully from one medium to another. Not cheery viewing, but definitely enlightening.<br />Most highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Sadly, I had a real problem with this film.  I have waited a long time to bother writing a review, because I know that my opinion is not popular.  The actressing is a big deal among my cinephile friends, and yet I'm put off by the bulk of it here.  Quite frankly, this is a result of too much being heaped upon too much without the right balance.  One reviewer stated that this should have been titled `The Insane, the Unhappy and the Confused'.  I agree with this.  I have defended Daldry's directorial aesthetic in the past, considering that I feel `Billy Elliot' a towering debut and `The Reader' to be a misunderstood masterpiece, but I cannot defend this since he does almost everything wrong here.  He can't build his tone in a way that complements the film's frames.  Instead, he meshes together a group of stories that interweave in a way that bleeds a melodramatic atmosphere with almost no point.  It doesn't feel inspired or poignant or engaged.<br /><br />It merely feels sad.<br /><br />The acting is stuck in the film's mood, which isn't a compliment this time.  Harris is horrific, Moore is bland, Streep is uneven and Kidman is trying way too hard (although she does fare better than the bulk of the cast).  The rest of the supporting cast is just there, although I will admit that Toni Collette and John C. Reilly make more of an impact than that the film's nominated stars.<br /><br />I like depressing, and I like challenging and I love a film that digs at the darkness in our souls, but this film is just too drab for its own good.  It doesn't say enough to validate its poor thematic choices.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Michael Cunningham's award winning novel, &quot;The Hours,&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and was chosen as Best Book of 1998 by The New York Times. Because the book is so extraordinary, I was apprehensive about how the film, based on this complex novel, could possibly succeed. David Hare performed a miracle in writing this true and beautiful adaptation, in a manner faithful to the book, and also suited for the big screen. He captured everything, including the important literary allusions, with great sensitivity and fidelity. Stephen Daldry's direction encouraged the superb talents of his ensemble cast. Daldry has once again proven to be a master of his craft.<p>The film is a richly told, often tragic story, of the interwoven lives of three women, from three different periods in time. The common thread is Virginia Woolfe's novel Mrs. Dalloway.<p>Virginia Woolfe, brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman, is living in isolation with her husband Leonard in 1923. Ms. Woolfe has a long history of mental illness, and has attempted suicide twice. Her doctors and her husband agree that she will possibly find peace away from London. The literary couple is living in Richmond, where Leonard has set up a printing press, thinking to involve his wife in publishing. She has begun to write &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway, &quot;a woman's whole life in a single day - and in that day her whole life.&quot; Virginia is plainly fixated on death. She understands the nature of her illness, and at one point explains to Leonard that although he must live with the burden of her illness, so must she. She decides that someone in her new novel must die. When Richard asks who will die, and why, Virginia responds,&quot;...the poet, the visionary will die, so that the others will value life more.&quot;<p>Laura Brown, (Julianne Moore), is a young housewife, pregnant with her second child, in post-World War II, Los Angles. She is desperately unhappy in her marriage. Her husband, a war veteran, clearly worships her. Their young son, with a child's intense perception, senses the tension and unhappiness in his mother, that his father seems oblivious to. Laura begins reading Virginia Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, and is deeply affected by the novel. She begins to have doubts about her life choices, and despairs that suicide may be her only way out.<p>Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives in contemporary Manhattan, and is an editor and writer. She could be a mirror image of a modern Mrs. Dalloway. Her closest friend, and former lover, Richard, a novelist and poet, actually calls Clarissa, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Like Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa is giving a party, for Richard, who is about to receive a prestigious lifetime achievement award for his poetry. She sets off one beautiful morning, like Mrs. Dalloway, to buy flowers for her party. Then she visits Richard, whom she has taken care of for years. He is slowly dying of AIDS.<p>The intermingling of the three women's lives, and their struggle to find meaning, outside of brief moments of happiness, is very powerful. The visual montage of the three women, is superb and so effective. It is almost a collage at times. The musical score is haunting, and adds much to the film's mood. And the acting is superior, not just by the three women, but by the entire supporting cast.<p>The tension builds toward a powerful ending, which even though I read the book, still came as a surprise. This is a deeply moving film, about living out the hours of ones life, about love, survival, and about mental illness and creativity. I highly recommended it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>While this movie is a multi-layered masterpiece, viewers must be warned - you will be depressed. Even if you are the happiest go-lucky person before you walk in, you will feel a malaise when you walk out of the theater.  Anyone who is clinically depressed or has thoughts of suicide should not see this movie.  Many disturbing themes are interwoven into the story: depression, suicide attempts, suicide, abandonment, sexual identity confusion and persistent loneliness.<p>That being said, the acting is superb and the film is a masterful work and a great movie to study for aspiring filmmakers, actors and directors. Nicole Kidman's role tends to get the most attention due to the prothsetic nose she wears - but all the actors, from the youngest child on up are at the top of their game.<p>In the final months of her life, Virginia Woolf wrote the story of "Mrs. Dalloway," a lonely housefrau who eventually takes her life and surprised everyone... because she did it "for no reason."  Her novel reveals much of her inner turmoil - that she is a person that can be understood by no one, not even herself. Her depression so consumes her, that she cannot see clear from it. More than just consistantly mopey, she is almost devoid of any emotions, but when her emotions peak, they are of loneliness and sadness. She experiences guilt for the emotional baggage she has thrown into the lap of her husband and has such a low self-esteem that she lets her housekeepers openly mock her.<p>The film shifts forward and back in time - opening w/ Woolf's suicide, then jumping to 1951, where Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a lonley housefrau herself, reading Woolf's novel.  The film then moves to 2001 with an equally lonely divorcee, now lesbian, who is such the embodiment of Woolf's depressed character that her best friend refers to her as "Mrs. Dalloway."  Ed Harris plays her best friend and ex-lover who is in the final stages of full-blown AIDS.  He, too, struggles with loneliness and depression, as most of his so-called friends have abandoned him to his terminal illness.<p>The theme that each person is an island and that we all truly die alone is persistent throughout.<p>Like Woolf (who was sexually abused as a child by her own step brothers), all the principal characters have major sexual identity issues. They do not know whether they are gay, straight or just asexual... and this causes some extremely awkward scenes that will make you squirm in your seat. They all behave as though they do not fit in their own bodies. While they know how to "play the game" to fit in with "normal" society, they are alien to it and play with the though of death as the "great escape" from the prison of what their lives have become.<p>This is a superb film, but  it is an experience that is not for the faint of heart.  Those who have lost a loved one to suicide will find no solace in this story, and those who are suffering from depression should avoid it altogether.  As someone who is not suffering from depression, I walked out of the movie feeling like a wet dish rag. <p>Fans of Kidman, Moore and Streep will not be disappointed. Toni Collette's performance, while brief, is also powerful. This is not a film you just see - it is an experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Divided into three sections, set in different eras; yet merging at times and culminating in a stunning revelation at the end, Stephen Daldry's "The Hours" is a serious, dramatic film about three women: all involved in someway with Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway." Woolf's Dalloway is a woman who outwardly has it together but as the story unfolds we see her slowly but surely falling apart.<br />Daldry's film of Michael Cunningham's novel is audacious in it's physical design but more importantly in it's ability and assurance when it deals with the emotions involved with being a human being whether it be 1920's England, 1950's California or 2002 New York City.<br />Even though in essence, the three women in "The Hours" are radically different in temperament, focus and style, Daldry is more interested in what makes them similar. The three women he focuses on in "The Hours": Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are troubled in various ways but share a commonality that makes their concerns and situations Universal no matter from which era they come.<br />The acting in "The Hours" is of the highest order: natural, multi-colored and intense: Kidman, Streep and especially Moore are not only out for blood but for Truth as well. These are conflicted and conflicting characters, carefully and intelligently scripted.<br />"The Hours" is a rare movie. A movie with a palpable sense and understanding of it's own world and a commitment to its characters. It is a moving experience that is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>The closing lines of this film are a quote from Virginia Woolf where she wrote, "To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is.....at last, to love it for what it is, and then to put it away."<br /><br />Well, our three principle characters do look life in the face, including Woolf, but where exactly do they "love it?" What I saw were three women who lived desperate, obligatory lives, and who did so with a thinnest of success. One failed entirely, and one loved life - or in her case, "chose life" - by abandoning her world, and, most notably, her children.<br /><br />My original response to this film, a movie depicting the lives of three women who must all face suicide and delve in their own personal masquerades as well as mental illnesses, was that I was somehow swept up in awe of it all. The acting was solid, the cast extraordinary, and the music was sweeping. But then I asked myself, "So what?" I believe the film is guilty of two things.<br /><br />#1. It contradicts its point. Loving life does not equate running from it. I found the women tolerating life at best, and certainly were not adhering to Woolf's famous quote on the nature of living and loving doing so.<br /><br />#2. It takes itself far too seriously. Perhaps this was the impression that Glass' score had on me when mixed with certain scenes. I can't be totally certain. But I do know that the point the film was trying to make is lost in some of the contrived themes in the film.<br /><br />This film is not a total failure. Far from it, in fact. There are moments of delicacy and superb acting that are hard to find these days; however, the point of the film is largely lost by the contradictory philosophies stemming largely from Woolf herself. I also think Glass' music helped overcome many of the otherwise self-important elements. To seperate the music from this film would probably change many minds about its quality.<br /><br />Just my opinion. For those of you who adore this film, you can do what you will with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EI65WJC85U68.html">A1EI65WJC85U68</a><br/><p>Directed by Stephen Daldry (whose previous film was the excellent BILLY ELLIOT) &amp; Scripted by David Hare &amp; based on the book by Michael Cunningham, THE HOURS is split into three different time frames.<br />The first is in London in the 1920s with Nicole Kidman in her Oscar winning role as writer Virginia Woolf where she is writing her first novel MRS DALLOWAY, and fighting an oncoming breakdown during the process.(The film opens with her suicide by drowning).<br />The second segment is set in the 1950s where suburban housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore)is herself battling depression and reading Woolf's novel, and finding it inspirational in this difficult period of her life.<br />The final segment is set in 2001 where Clarrisa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a lesbian, is dealing with the plight of her ex-husband (Ed Harris, in an excellent performance) who's dying of AIDS.<br />These three different time zones are brilliantly woven to make a seamless whole, with the film giving vivid recreations of the different eras resulting in a slightly melodramatic but overall interesting movie. THE HOURS is a film which probably holds more appeal for female viewers, but guys won't find it totally insufferable either though it does seem a bit overlong. THE HOURS is the only Nicole Kidman movie to date where male viewers won't be drooling over her, but they won't suffer a coronary if their girlfriends insist they watch it. Interestingly, the movie was disqualified for the makeup Oscar because Nicole's schnozz was digitally enhanced to make it appear seamless onscreen. So basically how much you enjoy this movie depends on whether you are a fan of Woolf (I'll admit I've never read her stuff) &amp; your gender. In my opinion the movie is good, but seriously overhyped. Typical Oscar material in other words, though Kidman gives her best performance to date &amp; deserved her Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>It's been said that women love "The Hours" and men don't. That's a rather simplified analysis. <p>I found this movie to be simply revolting. There wasn't one single woman in the entire movie who didn't annoy me. Meryl Streep's character is a pathetic creature in love with a man who can never love her back. Julianne Moore plays a selfish 1950s housewife who can't see the world beyond her own navel, and Nicole Kidman captured the Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Wolf, the depressive and ultimately suicidal author. <p>Every one of these women is presented as some kind of victim. None of them is responsible for her own actions and all them spend their time whining. This was an extremely dreary and lightweight movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Boy, if you're feeling suicidal, this is NOT the movie you want to see- It might just push you over the edge!<p>  The film follows three different Women in three different decades: Nicole Kidman plays author Virginia Woolf in the 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a desperate housewife in 1950's suburbia, and Meryl Streep is a modern-day woman distraught over a dying friend (Ed Harris) and a cheating lover (Allison Janney).<br />Woolf is in the midst of a severe depression as she tries to write her famous book, Mrs. Dalloway; Moore's character, Laura Brown, is trying to cope with her own desperation as she reads the book; and Streep's character, Clarissa Vaughn, finds her life echoing the life of the book's title character. The ways in which these women deal with their problems are disturbing, to say the least, and I had a LOT of trouble feeling any sympathy for Moore's character in particular; Her final solution to her life's problems is loathsome and unforgivable. The performances by the three leads are spectacular, as is Ed Harris' portrayal of Clarissa's dying friend. It's easy to see why the Oscar voters bestowed so many nominations on this film. The revelation of the connecting thread between the Moore and Streep stories was a stunner; It's sitting in plain view for the whole film, but I didn't see it coming. It hit me like a ton of bricks. While not a happy experience, The Hours is certainly a rewarding one.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>If indeed there is a stream of super-consciousness that literally and figuratively transcends space and time, then such a force is manifested in THE HOURS, a powerful, gripping examination of three lives over the course of one eventful day.<p>The story is rooted in the novel, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; and its author, Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman).  Woolf, in part due to her own depression and self-deprecation, abandoned realist literature with her novel and concentrated instead on the thoughts of her characters.  In the pages of her book human fragility is exposed, and this fragility permeates two other women in two different times:  a lonely, restless housewife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a present-day career woman (Meryl Streep) who is busily planning a party for a dying friend.  This film moves superbly from one place in time--from one character's growing angst and sense of misgiving--to another, until at last the three separate stories are tied together in astonishing and remarkable fashion.<p>Kidman, Moore, and Streep are incomparable; the supporting cast (including Ed Harris in a brief, yet haunting role) is stellar.  No, THE HOURS is not a film that will cheer you up, yet its somber, moody, even dark examination of the inner recesses of the human mind will stir your soul and inspire wonder.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Hours" is a quiet, meditative piece about what makes life worth living. It unites the stories of three women- Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), struggling with suicidal thoughts, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), expecting a child and struggling with her desires, and Clarissa (Meryl Streep), who's watching her ex-husband die from AIDS. The trio of women share a self-destructive streak. Ironically, and powerfully, the movie is about living life.<br /><br />Virginia dotes on her husband, Leonard, yet she feels passionately for other women. She authored "Orlando" in honor of her onetime lover Vita Sackville-West. She is writing "Mrs. Dalloway." In the '50s, Laura is expecting a child with her boring but gentle husband (a brilliant, understated John C. Reilly) However, it is her bosomy neighbor (Toni Collette) who awakens her conflicted desires. Laura considers suicide. Realizing the unborn life within her, and reading "Mrs. Dalloway", she chooses life.  In 2001, Clarissa is caring for her ex-husband, who's suffering from AIDS (Ed Harris) She cannot understand his profound pain. Though he has a boyfriend (Jeff Daniels,in a surprisingly good turn) and she has a girlfriend (Alison Janney),they still have a spousal bond. He calls her "Mrs. Dalloway." The underlying mystery is--what links the three women?<br /><br />"The Hours" seems to glorify suicide, from Kidman drowning herself to Harris hurtling himself off a window ledge. However, it is Laura's choice for life that gives the story's three threads their essential link. Life makes connectedness possible. The hypnotic music from Philip Glass is excellent. Moore, Kidman, Streep, and Harris give luminous performances.<br /><br />"The Hours" is a contemplative masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Hours is about the profound affect that Virginia Woolf's book 'Mrs. Dalloway' has on herself, a reader, and someone who knows the reader.  This is depicted through three different periods over an 80 year stretch.  The first period takes place when Virginia (Nicole Kidman) is writing the book while going through a tough time in her life.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) represents the second period.  She is the reader of the book who can identify with the main character in the book.  The present time, and the third period, is embodied through Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who has received the nickname Mrs. Dalloway from someone who has read the book.  The cast of Hours enhances it's monumental film experience by using deep rooted dialogues tangled with periods of silence.</p></br><a href="../users/ANP3R2R4V4GAN.html">ANP3R2R4V4GAN</a><br/><p>AT first I was concerned about this movie, about whether it would sustain my interest beyond the sheer force of the actresses involved.  Watchign Nicole Kidman first appear and then vanish like a wisp of smoke into Virginia Wolff was amazing.  Since To Die For, I've always thought her talented at the art of vanishing but she proves here again that its not a trick but a conscious ability.<br />Julianne Moore as always is a woman on the verge of....soemthing.....she plays longing well.  Someone who MUST make a change in their lives and who knows it.  Of the three actresses she gets to bridge the time frames of two of the characters to interact and though thsi requires heavy makeup, it sort of works.  Not very well but it does work.<br />Meryl Streep's piece is more ethereal because she's at the center of so many people's lives and expectations and she seems like she's been maintaining distance for awhile and no one has noticed.  The ability to play someone who wants to speak up but can't or won't is pretty incredible.<br />All in all this is a great film, and as always I advise patience with the film, its revealed how everyone is connected soon enough.<br />Ed Harris who's scenes are him floating in and out of dementia are also gripping as we only have Streep's character's adore for him to project what his life was like, who he was onto the canvas of someone in their last days.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>After having read Michael Cunningham's novel, I could not imagine how a successful movie could be made from it.  With its three separate plots, I expected visual confusion and disjointedness.  Instead, I was stunned by how expertly everything was brought together.  The adaptation is both first-rate and insightful, excising the extraneous and focusing on the most crucial matters contained within the original novel.  "The Hours" instantly earned its place in my heart as one of my favorite movies.<p>The film begins and ends with the suicide of Virginia Woolf, a writer driven by madness and a passion for both life and death.  Director Daldry then jumps to the 1950's as pregnant Laura Brown wakes up to her oppressive suburban life, and then to the 1990's as Clarissa Vaughn jumps from bed to prepare for a party for her dying best friend, a poet striken with AIDS.  Just as quickly, the audience is taken back to Virginia Woolf as she, too, embarks on a new day, one which will result in her penning of the beginning of her famous novel MRS. DALLOWAY.  The beginning is probably the most confusing part of the film as Daldry establishes these three separate lives in three disparate times; however, once the first five minutes has passed, everything is strongly established and easily discerned.  The minimalist soundtrack composed by Philip Glass couldn't be more perfect for this story of variations on a theme; the music creates tension by crescendo, then retreats into its quiet repetition, leaving the audience gasping.  I'm not sure how many people in the theater realized how well the music manipulated their reactions.<p>Most of the action in this movie is psychological.  It is a film of close-ups, where a twitch or averting of the eyes tells volumes.  Because of this subtle nature, the acting must be brilliant and understated.  Fortunately, it is - and then some.  Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the tormented and brilliant Virginia Woolf is extraordinary; she IS Virginia Woolf.  Julianne Moore also turns in an expert performance, while Meryl Streep is, well, very Meryl Streep - perhaps too much so.  Claire Danes, in her brief appearance as Clarissa's daughter, illuminates and enlivens everything around her.  Allison Janney as Clarissa's lover Sally provides a competent and natural performance, although her role is more ornamentation than character.  So much has been said about the actresses in this film that one of the best performances is often overlooked:  Ed Harris as the dying poet, Richard. <p>If you hate art films or crave fast-moving plots, you'll be disappointed with the deeply psychological nature and thematic development of "The Hours." All others will be richly rewarded by this powerful, expertly constructed film about what it means to hold onto life and then let it go.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>If Oscars had a category for Best Film Casting, THE HOURS would have won hands down.  In ddition to the Oscar winning performance of Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf, the entire cast is impeccable:  Stephen Dildane as Woolf's devoted husband is mesmerizing; Meryl the Magnificent Streep once again shines as an editor throwing a party for her dying writer friend (an extraordinary Ed Harris); Julianne Moore is riveting as the depressed housewife who chooses suicide as an escape route, and what a supporting cast;  Toni Collette, Claire Danes, John C. Reilly, Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney.  They are all brilliant in a film that is compelling in its expert weaving of how these three women's lives are so parallelled.  The editing of the film is outstanding as well, the gorgeous score by Phillip Glass; Stephen Daldry's emotional direction.  All come together to bring a movie of unusual depth and sensitivity.  While certainly not a "feel good " kind of movie, THE HOURS IS nonetheless absorbing film viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>This movie got a lot of flack for being too depressing but I think The Hours starring Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf is a fascinating, intimate look at the stigma and isolation that comes from being clinically depressed. Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep also star. Moore has never been better! She nails every scene she is in, although I was very disappointed with Streep's performance, very over the top and wooden. Kidman earned an Oscar for her fragile performance of the suicidal writer. I love the scene when she tells her husband she feels suffocated and wants to go back home so she can write. Toni Collette has a small part as the neighbor of Moore, too bad her scene was so brief 'cause her scene made the biggest impact.  I highly recommend this sensitive and gorgeous film, deals with heavy issues but it is a film you'll remember. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>I've viewed this movie four times now, and there's always something different to see. The Hours is an absolutely superlative film, and is easily one of the best films of the past few years. Whether it is a meditation on suicide, a celebration of the gift of life, deference to literature, or a steadily evolving triptych of three angst-ridden women, The Hours packs a huge emotional punch. On this viewing, it is again easy to see why Nicole Kidman won the Oscar for best actress - her portrayal of the depressive, mentally ill Virginia Woolf who, on doctors orders, is banned from London and is confined to the suffocation of the country - will probably go down in history as one of the great moments of screen acting.<br /><br />Based on Michael Cunningham's book, The Hours tells of one day in the life of three women, each from different time periods. Their lives intertwine and intersect in surprising ways and it is almost as though they are communicating with one another across the eons. They are linked by frustration, despair and the difficulty they have in finding places for themselves in the world. They also share a relationship to yet another fictional woman, the title character of one of Virginia Woolf's most famous novels, Mrs. Dalloway.<br /><br />The film begins with Virginia Woolf (a riveting Nicole Kidman) narrating a suicide note to her husband. The year is 1941 and she has wrestled with madness for many years and feels another spell of it coming on. Rather than subject her husband to it, whom she says has made her so very happy, she drowns herself in a river. The story then flashes back to 1921 when she and Leonard, her husband (an excellent Stephen Dillane), are living a secluded life in rural Richmond. Virginia is terribly unhappy, and feels as though the country is contributing to her mental suffocation. This confinement is made all the more maddening when her lively sister (Miranda Richardson) comes to visit from swinging, sophisticated London.<br /><br />Virginia's story acts as the framing device for the two other stories: Housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore, who should also have won an Oscar) is living in Los Angeles in 1951. She is drowning in a sea of marriage and motherhood. She loves her son and her husband (John C. Reilly), but when her best friend Kitty (an incredible Toni Colette) comes to visit, Laura realizes that life is not worth living, and considers abandoning her family. She contemplates suicide, but before she does this, she anxiously bakes a birthday cake for her husband and restlessly reads Mrs. Dalloway. Meryl Streep plays Clarissa Dalloway living in New York in 2001. Clarissa happily lives with her lover (Alison Janney) and is preparing a party for her best friend Richard (Ed Harris), who has just one a major poetry prize and is dying of AIDS. In 1921 Virginia begins to write Mrs. Dalloway, in 1951 Laura reads Mrs. Dalloway, and in 2001 Clarissa organizes party, just as Mrs. Dalloway did in the novel.<br /><br />This circular, multi-layered narrative is held together with Phillip Glass's melodious, and unobtrusive musical score and some of the best editing techniques, which intimately inter-cut the stories by means of parallel gestures and words. Throughout the day each woman's life unfolds and the viewer soon learns that each is faced with certain choices about whether they should choose life over death. Both Laura, through her actions, and Virginia, though her writing, question why we should persist in holding on to our existence despite the pain it is sure to cause us.<br /><br />The Hours is about those things we don't say because they don't fit into words; it's a film of lost feelings, bizarre, unscrambling emotions and trying to figure out what lies beneath the surface. We are all terribly alone, and that the relationships that we do develop between people are often intransient and frequently fragile. The Hours is a grand, melancholy and uneasy film that is multifaceted and full of meaning.<br /><br />Unrecognizable in a false nose and Ann Roth's excellent costumes, Kidman has gotten a death grip on this character. The climax comes with her riveting monologue on a train station, where, with tears in her eyes, and the look of pain on her face, she desperately argues with her husband to return them to London. It's a scene of spellbinding emotional power, as we see Woolf's controlled turmoil of creativity, her all-consuming mental anguish, and perhaps a portent of the welcoming blissfulness of her death.

Then there's Julianne Moore playing Laura Brown, a repressed, depressed, and frustrated suburban mom during the 40s (and her very frightened, preternaturally `aware' young son) who begins reading Mrs. Dalloway and starts to question her own life and its goals - and wonders if it's really worth going on. And then, in modern-day NYC, there's Clarissa (named for the title role in Mrs. Dalloway and played by the incomparable Meryl Streep) acting out the book itself as she buys flowers and plans a celebratory party for her friend and former lover, played by Richard Harris, who is dying of AIDs.<br />It's a convoluted movie, and while we can easily make the connection between Virginia Woolf's life and Clarissa's NY life, Laura Brown's place in this trio is unclear until the very end, when everything ties together so beautifully that it leaves you breathless.<br />See it now. Then read the book, and of course, if you haven't already done so for some college lit course, read Mrs. Dalloway.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>This movie is so beautifully acted and made. It has a poetic resonance as it unfolds, sort of like how American Beauty portrayed. The film is stark in its ability to illustrate the truth and some people may react to the film in negativity. It is about pain, grief, choices on how to live your life or end it if you must. I think the overall emotion the film can reflect is compassion. Compassion for people who are living The Hours as they chose, not judging them, realizing they are we all struggle with pain, that life is not all pain and can be joyful. I was floored at how much this movie tugged at me. I am still reverbrating from it. Kidman, Streep and Moore were all outstanding! They made this movie an inspiration to watch. Notice how well Kidman achieves her accent and voice change. Her mannerisms are impeccable, they are not overdone, she channels her creativity it is so wonderful to watch. Streep is so honest in her acting, she becomes an emotion. Moore is subtle, very subtle and yet so effective! I was amazed at how much Ed Harris does for his roles. He is amazing! This movie is very emotional and can trigger depression. I felt a heaviness after watching it but there was also so much beauty layered within. So keep this in your mind if you chose to watch this film.<p>Lisa Nary</p></br></body></html>

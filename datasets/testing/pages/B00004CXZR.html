They look and sound great, but now I wish I'd held out for the Blu-ray versions.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I have owned this movie for years, but tonight I finally watched it all the way through after seeing the new Star Trek film! (That's another review for another time) I loved the great special effects and imagery. I still haven't seen the original series yet, but I may someday. After three Klingon ships are destroyed by an alien force, Starfleet asks the U.S.S. Enterprise to investigate it. They encounter an alien probe that takes Ilia and replaced by a robotic probe named V'ger. If you are a Trekkie, you'll love STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A24F1UX8ZT5IXY.html">A24F1UX8ZT5IXY</a><br/><p>STTMP is a dark, almost depressing film. The costumes are heinous. The new enterprise is an antiseptic monstrosity. Spock is manically depressed. Kirk is acting like a [...].<br /><br />Yet, it is one of the few films that really takes a plunge into the core of science fiction and makes no apologies. It is a totally indulgent experience, as we almost feel like we are on the enterprise surrounded by this totally alien power known as V'ger -- which, by the way, is an incredible marvel of special effects. For all of the magnificence of The Wrath of Khan, that film is exceedingly light SF when compared with this.<br /><br />Although the film is slowly paced, it almost the perfect thing for a serious Trek fan. I personally do not have any problem looking at the gorgeously redesigned Enterprise (the exterior that is) and listening to Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful, nautical score. The film is a grand indulgence for die-hard fans of Trek. But probably an utter bore for others.<br /><br />And there are many gems therein as well. Spock's scenes are fabulous. From the opening on Vulcan (now beautifully re-designed) to his exploration of V'ger, they are some of the highlights of the film. But there is much more to be loved here, nothing less than Ilia and the totally bizarre climax to V'ger. This is GOOD Trek along the lines of the old series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>There's little argument that Robert Wise's belated "director's cut" of "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" is an improvement over the original 1979 release. However, this big-screen debut represents the weakest (and slowest) of the series, partially redeemed by some awe-inspiring visual effects and Jerry Goldsmith's classic score. The camaraderie between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is sadly lacking, while the remaining Enterprise players are overshadowed by the unnecessary addition of Captain Decker (a horrible performance from Stephen Collins). Luckily, you can hit the warp-speed button during the film's several "longueurs," which Wise should have pared down even further. Though flawed, "Star Trek - The Motion Picture" succeeds as a preview of better voyages to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Welcome aboard." - Admiral James T. Kirk welcomes an old, pointed eared, friend aboard The Enterprise in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture"<p>The first of ten films in the "Trek" saga gets off to a whimper instead of a bang.<p>An alien known as V'ger with immense energy and power is on a course for Earth, destroying and absorbing anything in its path. The only Federation ship in the vicinity is, of course, the U.S.S. Enterprise. Kirk and crew are sent to destroy the being before it reaches Earth. But, when Kirk & co. find out that V'ger is more of a sentient being with human origins than alien, the crew tries to find out what V'ger wants and why, before time runs out & Earth becomes part of V'ger.<p>Overall the film is o.k. Most fans were excited to see Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the rest of the crew with The Enterprise up on the big screen for the first time in film history, no matter what they did (personally, I never saw the film when it was in theaters). <p>With the cult status that the T.V. show gathered in reruns over the years since its cancellation, it was inevitable that "Star Trek" would be revived again in some form another. Originally, Paramount saw "Star Trek" as a way to start its own television network that could rival NBC, ABC, & CBS, with the new incarnation of "Trek" being its headlining show. But, with the monsterous success of "Star Wars", studios were scrambling for any script they had with a sci-fi element. 20th Century Fox immediatelly greenlighted "Alien" with Paramount taking "Star Trek" & turning into a big screen feature instead of a headlining television show. "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" was released for the Xmas season of 1979 with mixed reviews.<p>The film isn't really that bad. It falls along one of the more medium, likable episodes from the series (say not as bad as the episode "Catspaw" but no where near as good as "Space Seed"). Its great to the see cast on the big screen, but, the problem is they've aged since the series, but, don't seem to act it. In other words there is no backstory to what has happened to the crew since the end of there original five year mission ("Star Trek II" handles this perfectly). The disco style uniforms with the Dick Tracy style communicators don't help either.  <p>The new 2 disc DVD edition is definitely worth looking at, for all of the new CGI work done to the film (henceforth, my four star rating to an otherwise three star film). Also, included are all of the deleted scenes that have info containing whether or not the scene was included in the original ABC broadcast, or if it was on the extended VHS edition, or if it was just plain deleted from the film itself. The trailers are a blast from the past with, known other than, Orson Welles giving the narrative to all trailers and t.v. ads. The featurettes on the making of the film and the restoration are great. <p>If you've seen all of the other "Trek" films (and stomached "Star Trek V") then "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Science fiction fans, as well as film historians, are aware that director Robert Wise had traveled similar interstellar waters with the classic &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. The 1951 film appears on many &quot;best of&quot; lists and coined an alien catch phrase that is forever embedded in popular culture (&quot;Klaatu Barada Nikto&quot;).<p>Some thirty-eight years later, at the helm of Star Trek's first theatrical adventure, the director presented a movie with close ties to the landmark &quot;Day&quot;.<p>Both films feature highly intelligent aliens seeking to better understand the human existence (&quot;Klaatu&quot; and &quot;Mr. Spock&quot;, respectively). Both feature then-state-of-the art special effects. Both have award-winning scores from legendary film composers (Bernard Herrmann from the former and Jerry Goldsmith on the latter). Persis Khambatta and, to a certain extent, Patricia Neal from &quot;Day&quot; are the female &quot;love&quot; interests that provide some stimulation for male characters in the film (Stephen Collins in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; and Michael Rennie/Hugh Marlowe in &quot;Day&quot;).<p>There is little action in both films, though it works to the earlier film's advantage; the protracted &quot;flyovers&quot; in &quot;ST: TMP&quot; - though beautiful to look at - slow the plot significantly.<p>Finally, the two films end on a positive note as to the future of humanity if it follows the warnings given by seemingly omnipotent aliens that could snuff us out in a heartbeat.<p>When looked at from this comparative angle, &quot;Star Trek: the Motion Picture&quot; isn't that bad a flick. It is not the standard by which intelligent sci-fi is measured, as is &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, but it is still a commendable achievement.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Director Robert Wise (West Side Story) got to helm this big screen adaption of the classic sci-fi show, and while it's certainly not the best in the series, it would only pave the way for some of the best science fiction films ever made to follow.  Captain James T. Kirk and his crew are reunited on a newly modeled Enterprise and soon encounter an entity known as V'Ger which (naturally) threatens the galaxy.  The plot has bits and pieces from old Star Trek episodes, and hardcore Trekkies balked at many a moment in the film (especially those bland Starfleet uniforms, good God...), but in the end Star Trek: The Motion Picture is still a good hearted sci-fi film that went on to be a phenominal hit (and spawned numerous sequels and spin off TV series).  This Director's Edition of the film includes some extra footage which actually helps the film make more sense, and the DVD itself is one of the few DVD's worth paying Paramount's full list price for (Paramount is famous for overpricing their DVD's and including no extras whatsoever other than a trailer) and the extras will keep Trekkies (young and old) entertained for days.  All in all, if your a hardcore Trek fan, than you most likely already have this, but if you don't give it a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Some people regard STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE as a boring, and rather dull feature film. However, I feel that this is a great film, and the pacing may be slower than other Trek movies, but this has all the ingredients for a potentially great Trek movie. The only thing missing from this particular movie is more action (meaning, more ship-to-ship battles). But otherwise, this slow-burner is imaginative, intelligent, and remarkable in the visual effects department. And, more so in this updated version, the special effects are even better. Plus, you've got the thoroughly enjoyable cast from the original series and some newcomers aboard. <p>STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is a good movie, as long as you are willing to have patience to watch it, carefully, and to realize that in the end, you can easily see why now 9 other movies have followed in the steps of the one that started it all.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>. I really enjoyed it!  It has a very creative story that rolls out very well-done, with plot twists here and there. The ending is very thought-provoking; it's what you'd call a "thinking man's sci-fi".<p> Now, it is definitely true that the movie overemphasizes on special effects.  This is VERY evident in three main scenes:<br />a) The scene in which Mr. Scott flies Captain Kirk all around the Enterprise is soooooooooooooooooooooooo long! The only thing that saves it is the beautiful score by Jerry Goldsmith, but I still have to fast forward.<br />b) When the Enterprise sloooooooooooowwly floats out of dock, once again takes forever. There's a beautiful shot of the Enterprise flying towards the camera, and slowly revealing the sun, but nothing more.<br />c) The scene where the Enterprise is flying through V'Ger, though showing off some very impressive and creative backgrounds, is absolutely endless, and I REALLY have to fast forward.<p> But aside from that, the only thing I can think of that I don't like is the uniforms: everyone looks like they're at a PJ slumberparty! (Paramount wisely threw them out and replaced them with the really cool uniforms used throughout the rest of the original movieseries.)<p> The new "Director's Edition" DVD is an absolute must-buy for any Trek fan!  The best things are the all-new special effects and sound mix.  You get to see a more clear view of the inside of V'Ger, as well as a full view of the outside of the huge V'Ger ship (which looks really cool)!  The new sound truly expresses the magnificence of Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score!  The special features are passable, but not great (mainly consisting of three documentaries).  The real gem of the two-disc set is the restored film itself...</p></br><a href="../users/A33L7G4E8CID3.html">A33L7G4E8CID3</a><br/><p>Now I am by no means a Star Trek Devotee, but I have seen many episodes of the original series and the movies as well. The first film I recently saw again and my attention was drawn to several things.<p>First, I often hear this film trashed in sci-fi circles. This movie is like a combination of the original series and 2001: A Space Oddysey. That was the intention. After the success of Kubrick's film, Star Trek wanted to recapture some of the wonder and magic that Kubrick's film stole from it. It does, at least in the special effects department, rival Kubrick's film, and there is a scene that sports space suits similar to the ones seen in Kubrick's film. Also, the similar plot device of humans put in danger from a mechanical device helps to prove this. But 2001 was a story of humanity, an epic drama that transcended sci-fi and became a purely philosophical exercise. It helped that the film left ambiguity so that viewers could find a bit of themselves in it. That is the wonder. <p>What we have here is a film about exploration. Star Trek: TMP primarily occupies its time with beautiful and elaborate special effects shots intertwined with segments onboard the Enterprise. There is much underrealized content, such as Spock's being rejected by his people, Deckard's bitterness at losing what was rightfully his command, Kirk's struggle to regain his feeling of unity with ship and crew, Bones having to leave the life he enjoyed because of his devotion to an old friend. But much is explored as well, such as loyalty, honor, devotion, friendship, and the unknown. Although it's not at all a classic film, like its sequel, it is an interesting transitionary film that kept enough to remember why we liked these people on the original series and still lays the groundwork for the epic sequel that is universally renowned as the best.<p>In spite of its underachievement, it is a watchable movie that carries a message on dehumanization and the evolution of technology, just as 2001 does. Eye-candy and witty observations on society make this a recommended pick for sci-fi fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>ST:TMP was supposed to be Star Trek's triumphant return after its ignominious cancellation in 1969.  With all the hype surrounding it, there was little chance it could live up to expectations; sadly, it didn't even come close.  The problems with the film are manifold, and it's difficult to assign blame to any one party.  It starts with the script.  The story is promising - an all-powerful alien "thing" is approaching Earth and the Enterprise is sent to stop it.  This was the premise used very successfully in many Old Series episodes ("Obsession," "Doomsday Machine," and "Immunity Syndrome" being the best), and was later used in ST IV.  However, instead of patterning the story off these episodes, the screenwriters instead chose the dreadful "Changling" as their template.  When they borrowed from Kubrick's 2001, they chose the incomprehensible (and dull) end segments instead of the wonderous science fiction elements.<p>Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.  The actors are not in character (except Deforest Kelley, who does his best to infuse some semblance of humanity into the inhumane plot).  Director Wise shares some of the responsibility for this with the actors.  In addition, the effects overshadow the dialogue, the exact reverse of what ST stands for.  Because the effects had cost so much, the studio execs (apparently) demanded they get the screen time.  It's not that the individual effects sequences are grossly long, but each one is a little too long, and the cumulative effect is to grow very bored with them. <p>Having said all that, the movie does have good points.  There are flashes of the old Kirk/Spock/McCoy triad that foreshadow better films to come.  The special effects are very impressive, if overlong.  Kirk tries his old standard of trying to talk the alien machine into self-destructing, and when that fails he switches to bluffing it instead.  The score is top-notch.  These items cannot rescue the film overall, however.<p>This new DVD director's cut is better than the original theatrical release (but not as good as the television version).  Many scenes were re-editted with different takes/dialogue, and many new effects (with CGI) were added, and they blend in seamlessly with the old.  The sound is an improvement, but there is still some graininess with the picture (apparently they chose to leave it that way, which is bewildering).  In addition to this new edit and effects, the DVD has a large array of extras, many of which are among the best I've seen.  The text commentary by ST guru Michael Okuda is like a Pop-up Video compilation of nifty facts, such as where sets were re-used in later films/TV series, trivia on the cast and effects, etc.  There are some making-of commentaries, the most interesting is a look at the aborted second series "Phase 2," including costume screen tests.  One welcome addition is the inclusion of all the old versions and cut sequences that were in the original theatrical and video cuts of the film, so we can see how they have been changed for the director's cut (George Lucas - pay attention to this when you make the DVD's for Star Wars!).<p>Therefore, I recommend this DVD for any Star Trek fan, based on the extras more than the film itself.  If you are a very casual fan, I would recommend Star Trek II-IV as being far superior (and enjoyable) films.  Hopefully the success of this director's cut DVD will inspire the release of all the Star Trek movies in this format (i.e. double-disc sets with lots of extras).</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Star Trek the Motion Picture!<br /><br />I did a rewatching of this film recently and even though I have the original VHS tape, the "special longer version" is much cleaned up from the theatrical release.<br /><br />Robert Wise directs this Alan Dean Foster story (similar but only on a general way to The Original Series ("TOS") The Changeling.<br /><br />In "The Changeling" the Enterprise was nearly hit by a high energy beam from a small probe that turned out to be a mix between Voyager and an alien probe.  It was attempting to find its Creator, a Mr. Roykirk, which it mistook for James Kirk.  Its mission was to sterilize imperfection -- when Kirk pointed out that it too was imperfect, it sterilized itself!<br /><br />We start out with Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, which was later used extensively and every TV program of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a fact I completely forgot about until hearing it.  And, the Klingons were changed to having ridges on their foreheads and looking more alien, another aspect continued through the next twenty plus years of Trek.  This was a big deal to the original fans, though TNG guys now take this in stride.<br /><br />The movie is about tension in many ways:<br /><br />Spock is conflicted between his Vulcan heritage and his desire for the stars, which we see on the barren, red hot orange planet Vulcan as he fails the Kolinar.<br /><br />Tension between Kirk and Decker who was going to command the Enterprise until Kirk came aboard.<br /><br />And the new crew member Lt. Ilia, who plays a vital role in the story.  She is a member of Delta, who need to take an oath of celibacy since their sexual superiority puts males into fits of insanity (per the novelized version).  The sexual tension is underplayed in this PG 13 film.<br /><br />Starbases are blasted, Klingons are electrified and V'ger, the huge cloud entity wants its creator and wants him/her NOW!<br /><br />The usual Kirk double-speak with alien life forms does not fly as well as in the past.<br /><br />McCoy's crankiness and large beard were also quite fun to see again.<br /><br />The "long part" with the traveling through the cloud is actually edited down in this version and from what I understand, the DVD version does even better in cleaning up the special effects, the cloud effects and such.  The Warp Drive effect is a bit hokey but that's just me being spoiled by TNG.<br /><br />Overall, a good introduction and kick-off by Paramount to get the franchise off the ground.  Thank God for The Wrath of Khan or else we would have stopped at that point.<br /><br />Great effort by Wise and crew.<br /><br />Better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKHP">Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH16DI">Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection (The Motion Picture / The Wrath of Kahn / The Search for Spock / The Voyage Home / The Final Frontier / The ...

The Original Series was defined by its wonderful characters, particularly Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. In this movie, the characters take a back seat. We still see Kirk, Spock, and McCoy but they seem muted and relatively uninteresting. They seem like accessories to the plot, not drivers of it. Even relatively emotional scenes like Kirk ordering the self-destruction of the ship had almost no tension or emotional impact. It's a shame, because the concept behind the story was really interesting.<br /><br />I will say that the Director's cut for the DVD and blu-ray does improve the film. Some of the special effects are tastefully improved. It looks good - in my opinion a visually more beautiful film than 2001.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>You may have heard the theory that "only the even Trek films are good" ST:TMP is an odd # and it is a weak ST film. It is important because it was a reuniting of the TV cast (in fact the picture almost starts like the Magnificent Seven collecting bridge crew vets), and the Big budget take on the show was worth the effort... It may take it self too seriously at times, especially in the extended cut, and the beauty passes of the Enterprise seem endless as do the V'Ger clould/ sphincter shots, and the story is sort of a recycled script (Changling)...  but I fondly remember seeing this in the theater.</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>Even after 22 years on screen, on video, on television and now released in this special edtion DVD, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is still a work in progress.  Robert Wise returns to his often muddled, too long and struggling mess of a film that relaunched the STAR TREK franchise onto the big screen - and is allowed to make the changes he wanted, add the effects that were never completed in time and remaster the score to pitch perfect quality - and even after his final seal of approval, it's still a work in progress... and it is still a wonder to behold.  It also is one of the &quot;must buy, must own&quot; DVD's for this holiday season - for both fans of the series and those new to the franchise.  The script is intelligent, the performances (a bit uneasy at the start, but well seated by the close of the film) are top notch and the added effects and the new edits to the film both tighten and expand its appeal.  Much of what was left unfisnished has been completed and added neatly into the story - we now get to see the V'GER ship as it orbits the Earth.  We get more detail and background of the cloud, we have added scenes (a whole new V'GER chamber, a CG Enterprise, a brand new Vulcan without moons, and what is perhaps the first CG Star Trek cast to make it to the screen), and we have scenes cut shorter to make for better pacing.  The audio commentary is informative and entertaining, while the text based commentary is almost overloaded - appearing and disappearing so fast that you dare not blink for fear you might miss something.  The new transfer is clean and very pretty and the second disc is packed with features, deleted scenes, advertising (how many of you remember that Orson Wells provided the narration for the previews?) and docmentaries (of which only one was too short for my taste, the PHASE II era of STAR TREK is glossed over all too quickly - but does feature for the first time the original test footage of the new Enterprise and uniforms - pick up the book: STAR TREK: PHASE II for expanded information plus the original IN THY IMAGE script), plus an inventive menu design featuring V'GER.  PARAMOUNT has finally done right by STAR TREK, and STAR TREK fans and THE MOTION PICTURE is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>Often times when a hit TV show makes the jump to the big screen, that show loses one or more key elements of what makes the show a hit in the first place.  This was exactly the case with Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br /><br />The core of Star Trek: The Original Series was its thought-provoking plots, spectacular action, subtle humor, and character developement.  This first motion picture only succeed in one of those areas.  Let's quickly examine each of those areas to see where this move succeeded and failed:<br /><br />Plot: The plot of this movie is a very well-defined script that (without spoiling anything) produces an incredible surprise ending that very few viewers likely saw coming.  Essentially, the Enterprise is sent to investigate a strange cloud-like phenomena that is wreaking havoc on the galaxies.  While invesigating, they find that the phenomena is more intimately linked to themselves than they could possibly imagine.<br /><br />Action: While this film contains some spectacular special effects, it ultimately is bogged down by long, and rather boring, periods of pure dialogue.  Though some people are amazed by the endless panning shots of the "new" U.S.S. Enterprise, I found it to be way too overdone.<br /><br />Humor: This aspect that was so popular in the Original Series is severely lacking in this first film.  The entire movie has a very serious tone that does not include much witty banter or light moments.<br /><br />Character Developement: In my mind, the ultimate success of the entire Star Trek franchise hinges on the notion of character developement.  By using an ensemble cast, the Original Series was able to develop their auxiliary characters (albeit not as much as they should have!) into important members of the show.  This movie, however, focuses too much on "foreign" characters (those not seen in the TV show).<br /><br />To conclude, while Star Trek: The Motion Picture featured a thought-provoking plot that harkened back to the days of the Original Series, it also strayed too far from the core of that show to be considered a classic film.  Even the drab grey/white uniforms conveyed a serious, non-fun feel to the entire picture.  If you want to get acclimated to the Star Trek universe, do not start your quest with this film (instead, skip to the second movie).  However, if you could care less about the cannon of the show and want to watch a thought-provoking sci-fi film, than you will likely enjoy most aspects of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) with his crew (Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, George Takei, James Doohan, Majel Barret, Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols) joined by two new members like Decker (Stephen Collins), Bald female alien Illea (Persis Khambatta) as they take a new mission on their newly reinvented U.S.S. Enterprise. Their mission is to find a mysterious alien spaceship that has wiped out a few Klingon ships before it heads towards Earth and destroys it.<br /><br />A very good if slow start of the popular Star Trek film installment which is based on the timeless TV show of the same name. The original cast is reunited after 10 years in this film event of 1979 that made audiences believe that Star Trek can live again but in a motion picture, director Robert Wise and producer Gene Roddenberry does a nice job of bringing the show on the screen. Jerry Goldsmith's score is phenomenal as it later became the main theme for "Star Trek The Generation" and the special effects were good for it's time especially the production design, yes it doesn't have much action like it's sequels but rather more on atmosphere.  But this brand new cut really improves on the film itself with remastered sound and never before seen footage plus newly remastered special effects, it still is a good beginning for the franchise as it's sequel is even better.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent picture and sound with nifty extras like three retrospective documentaries, interviews, Teasers and Trailers, TV Spots, 5 additional scenes from the 1979 theatrical cut, 11 Deleted scenes from the 1983 TV version, Storyboards, and a promo for "Star Trek: Enterprise".</p></br><a href="../users/A3L2U581LL17EB.html">A3L2U581LL17EB</a><br/><p>The first of the popular sci-fi franchise, Star Trek: The Motion Picture is also the entry that I feel most divided on.  Here is a film that strives to be cerebral and thought-provoking, a movie made with the best of intentions, but in doing so, much of the appeal of Star Trek is lost.  Yes, the warm and witty &quot;human&quot; element is missing.  The characters that are here are certainly those of the crew of the starship enterprise, but change their names and they could simply be a different crew entirely.<p>The premise is interesting, and certainly less campy than one might reasonably have suspected back in 1979.  The film opens with three Klingon bird-of-preys that are attacked and engulfed by a giant alien cloud.  Concern about this heightens when the course trajectory for the anomaly shows it's heading for Earth.  Sent to prevent this possible global-scale destruction is Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who takes back the command of the starship Enterprise from Captain Will Decker (Stephen Collins, the guy from 7th Heaven, believe it or not).  <p>On the bridge of the ship include old crew members Sulu (George Takei), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Chekov (Walter Koenig), and good old Mr. Scott (James Doohan) down in engineering.  Brought out of retirement is Dr. Bones McCoy (DeForrest Kelley), against his will, too, but eventually grudgingly tags along.  With Spock (Leonard Nimoy) the last to arrive, the crew is reunited in their journey to the mysterious alien cloud, a hostile entity which appears to be alive.<p>What I've just described probably sounds like a great adventure, and make no doubt about it, several aspects of the film are terrific, even brilliant.  But overall, The Motion Picture is maddeningly inconsistent, often poorly placed, and sloppy in terms of plot execution.  In some ways, this doesn't even feel like the Star Trek many had come to know and love back in the late 60's.  TMP is sincere in its attempts to be a cerebral saga, so director Robert Wise makes certain to take the film as deadly serious as possible; there's not an ounce of good humor to be found here.<p>Given the premise, such a concept should be taken seriously, but not at the expense of the characters or the entertainment value.  TMP does sport its tense moments, particularly in the opening scenes and later when the Enterprise enters the cloud and the crew slowly makes some startling discoveries about the anomaly's origin.  The scene where an entity seemingly made of light invades the bridge and attacks the crew is even quite frightening, simply because Wise, well, wisely knows to keep us interested by venturing into the unknown. <p>But much of the portion set in the cloud is rather tedious.  Too much of it is spent looking at bizarre images as opposed to the crew speculating on the cloud's purpose and existence.  Does anyone remember that similar The Next Generation episode, where the crew finds themselves trapped inside this black anomaly and encounter a higher being called Nagilum?  Those 45 minutes were creepier and more entertaining than TMP.  That's not to say all the material involving the alien anomaly isn't involving.  The last half-hour finally gets to the speculation and theories we expect, so it makes for a thoroughly entertaining climax.<p>The cast is about what you'd expect if you're a fan of the series.  William Shatner's acting style is a sincere attempt at being serious, and no, it's not a particularly impressive performance, but he is the embodiment of Kirk.  Surprisingly, Shatner would go on to deliver impressive performances throughout the rest of the series.  Nimoy and Kelley are good as always.  But the main focus of the film appears to be with Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta.  They've got a weird pseudo-romance going on, or had at one point.  Neither performance is very good, but Khambatta still looks beautiful even with a bald head.  <p>So it seems my appreciation for The Motion Picture lies mostly in the visual and auditory sense.  The special effects, great for their time, are still eye-popping by today's standards, if not also slightly dated.  Arguably even more impressive is Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score, a memorable theme which outdoes even John Williams' work in Star Wars.  Both aspects deserved their Oscar nominations.<p>With this film, it often feels as if though the filmmakers were just desperate to introduce Star Trek to the series, and thus didn't quite put as much effort into this as they could have.  The potential for a character-oriented epic adventure was there, but Wise left out the characters, so what we're left with is a visually spectacular saga that didn't quite reach the mark it should have.  I still recommend The Motion Picture, but at least five of the sequels would turn out to be better (or at least more enjoyable) films (First Contact, The Undiscovered Country, The Voyage Home, The Wrath of Khan, and Generations).</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Neat special effects.  Lots of cool models and lots of interesting imagery.<br />*Interesting story.<br />*Even though the characters seemed dull at first, they are all right.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very long and slow.  It resembles "2001:  A Space Odyssey" more than "Star Trek."<br />*Decker and the bald girl (and possibly Spock) serve as the main characters, while Kirk and everybody else is subdued.<br />*Some inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (like their God-awful uniforms...).<br /><br />This film is mildly interesting, but hardly does justice to the "Star Trek" universe.  It is probably better to see this as a different, original space opera than as a "Star Trek" film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>...yet the most uninteresting movie in the series.<p>The script. I hadn't seen this movie for a very long time and didn't remember much of it, just that it seemed very slow. But having seen it recently I can't believe the script. To go through the detail they went through on set design only to shoot almost an identical &quot;TV SHOW SCRIPT&quot; is odd to me. This story is a cross between the &quot;M5 Computer&quot; and the &quot;Nomad Probe&quot; needless to say, it's been done. I wonder why no one mentions it?<p>The cast. The chemistry is off and the additions to the cast are fairly weak. The way the dialogue is written is largely to blame here.<p>The sound. Finely a strong suit. Wow, this is a great s/t, and really sets the stage for further movies and TV shows.<p>The transfer/effects. Ahh, dvds are perfect... right? Not in this case, there are many &quot;glitches and scratchs&quot; on the actual film. When the scratches are not there the movie really shines, however about every 10 minutes or so you seeing a bit of imperfections here and there. This is the best looking film in terms of details. In a way it reminds me of the care that was taken in the 1st season as opposed to the runaway abandonment in the 3rd. The other movies seem more polished and less attention to lighting was taken, to me this movie shows a much more realistic view of the evolution of Star Trek. However, to accomplish this really slows the movie down, so it's not without drawbacks.<p>The ending/extras. Predictable and only fueled to mediocrity by a poor script. Nice to have the commentary, generally informative however it only serves to highlight the lack of extras on any of the other films. Since Voyage Home was the highest grossing movie in the series, why no commentary on that one? The fans deserve it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>At last! STTMP on DVD! Great details added to Klingon ships, new Enterprise and Persis Khambatta as Ilia. The newly refit Enterprise goes on a voyage to intercept a powerful cloud field to see if there is a entity within the cloud. Great score by Jerry Goldsmith with new additions. Added special effects, new sound effects, a great overhaul. I LOVE the new stuff they added.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>I think most people may not have liked the first Tek film as much as the others is because expectations were too high. It also did not have the elements of the show that the Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock had, but looking back now it is a good film in it's own right. It was slower-moving, but I takes a lot of hard work to make the transition from small screen to silver screen. Case in point: X-Files Fight The Future. <p>A huge cloud is vaporizing everything in it's path, and the only ship capable of intercepting it in time is the refurbished Enterprise, with a new captain and crew. But Kirk takes command, and brings along his old bridge officers. The takes a while to get moving, but it is an interesting first look at the movie series, and still an enjoyable experience.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>I salute Robert Wise for having the courage and determination to transform &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; into one of the finest science fiction films made in the latter half of the 20th Century. More than any of the subsequent films in the series, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; has an epic, grand quality to it. Furthermore, it is the only film which truly pays homage to Gene Roddenberry's optimistic vision of humanity's future. Wise does a a splendid job editing the film so the pace is quickened; yet it does suffer slightly from some of the wooden dialogue said by the likes of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. However, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and DeForest Kelley do a fine job portraying these three principal characters. Yet I must also commend both Nichelle Nichols and James Doohan for their acting. Both Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta are excellent respectively as Captain Decker and Lieutenant Ilia. The special effects are a vast improvement over both the original theatrical and television releases; they strongly emphasize the alien nature of V'Ger and its immense cloud of energy. Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score is now the soundtrack to a splendid film.<p>Other director's cuts have had theatrical releases too. I earnestly hope Paramount Pictures shall follow suit and release &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; soon. As much as I enjoyed watching the DVD, I realized that this a film which ought to be seen in film theaters across the globe. &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; should now be regarded as one of Robert Wise's finest cinematic achievements.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>On the surface, the plot to 1979's "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" isn't very interesting -- A colossal, mysterious space cloud called V'ger travels across the galaxy and threatens Earth; the origins of V'ger are revealed at the end. In truth, "The Motion Picture" addresses many of the deepest questions of life -- Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those that hate the film and found it boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.<br /><br />Like the Star Trek episodes "The Corbomite Maneuver" (#3) and "Metamorphosis" (#31), "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic, or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: "As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now -- empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at sometime in our lives turns to someone -- a father, a brother, a God -- and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers."<br /><br />Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).<br /><br />The fact that the film inspires such profound contemplation and emotion proves that it's not just a bad film that apologists try to make excuses for as critics claim, e.g. "It's deep and awe-inspiring; you just don't understand it." I'm not making excuses; it's simply the truth. If you are unable to accept this perhaps it's because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. (lol).<br /><br />My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: "My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did." In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained -- but put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, HA, HA!), kick back and relish the movie magic.<br /><br />Let me add that "The Motion Picture" was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit -- a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home," ST:TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that ST:TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films "Alien" and "Apocalypse Now," both released the same year (1979).<br /><br />I should add that, although this film is an "Grade A" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of "The Cage" (#1) than "The Doomsday Machine" (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like "Zathura" or even "Star Wars" (giggle). Just joking.<br /><br />The viewer will note that "The Motion Picture" is truly the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of "2001: A Space Odyssey." Actually, "The Motion Picture" is LEAGUES better IMHO. "2001" lacks characters whom the viewer truly cares about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences (but, don't get me wrong, if "2001" trips your trigger, that's great). "The Motion Picture," by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.<br /><br />Say what you will, but "The Motion Picture" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>When &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; premiered in 1979, many fans of the original series were elated--and many more disappointed.  The problem wasn't that the film was cheap or puny in scale, nor that it hadn't finally reunited the primary &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast members, some of whom hadn't been before cameras in years.  Thanks mostly to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; sci-fi fans by then had developed a ravenous taste for big-budget space opera and because the series had become more cartoonish as the 1960s wore on anyway, they now expected something that would outdo the George Lucas shoot-em-up.  <p>What they got instead was a bold, if flawed, attempt to return things to the more serious and understated tones of &quot;Star Trek&quot;'s first season while simultaneously pushing the special effects envelope.  And though &quot;Star Trek&quot; always was space opera with harder sci-fi leanings, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; mistakenly abandoned most of the space opera standards altogether--interstellar battles, &quot;ray gun&quot; fights, scantily-clad &quot;moon maidens,&quot; strange and menacing aliens--in favor of an approach that was more in keeping with &quot;2001:  A Space Odyssey.&quot;  The story of the revamped Enterprise's rush to stop a cloud-like entity's march toward earth became, in the end, mostly a platform for technical, not cinematic, achievement.  <p>In the years following the film's release, Director Robert Wise did not conceal his disappointment with both the movie's final cut and its critical reception, but thanks to the advent of sophisticated computer graphics, he finally got his chance to complete the film as intended two decades later.  The result is a mixed bag.  <p>Certainly, the director's cut is more streamlined than its predecessor--several edits speed up the action, and even some of Jerry Goldsmith's excellent orchestrations seem faster.  The reimagined special effects are, for the most part, an improvement (watch carefully, for instance, to see a shuttlecraft from the series depart the San Francisco port), though anyone expecting images on the order of &quot;The Matrix&quot; or the later &quot;Star Wars&quot; films will be disappointed.  (I'm guessing the technicians had to match image quality to that of the 1979 release.)  The credits definitely look better.  <p>But the major flaws of the film, including a second half that just seems to drag compared to the first, are intact.  Worse, because at least one version of the film with additional footage already shows us what is possible, some of the choices of what to cut and what to keep are questionable.  Gone are some great character moments like Kirk telling Bones to get out of his quarters and the computerized translation of the doomed Klingon captain (though some make it as deleted scenes on the bonus disk).  Perfectly adequate sound effects, too, have been replaced by others that seem tinny, and many of these effects compete rudely with Goldsmith's score.  All in all, the Director's Edition seems a tradeoff, worth viewing mostly by the diehard fan, who will also likely find the second DVD more interesting than the usual chatter and mugshots tossed into the mix.</p></br><a href="../users/A16YCLRKOU0EV3.html">A16YCLRKOU0EV3</a><br/><p>Star Trek returns after a 10 year absence.

First vaporizing a trio of Klingon battlecruisers, the cloud similarly dispatches a peaceful Starfleet outpost.  Frantic officials of the United Federation of Planets scramble to meet the cloud, which is apparently some sort of spaceship housing aliens, origins unknown.  Only one starship is in position to intercept the cloud before its arrival on Earth - the USS Enterprise.  Unfortunately, the Enterprise hasn't completed an extensive re-fitting, and barely anything works.  Kirk isn't even in command (though that changes quickly).  Meanwhile, on Vulcan, Spock is in the middle of a refit of his own.  Having cast off Starfleet, Spock embraces Vulcan meditation that will free him from his emotional human-half.  Before he can complete the transition, he receives a mental cry from space - a confused plea that he can scarcely understand but one he can trace to the heart of the mysterious cloud.  Having no choice, he leaves Vulcan to rejoin Starfleet.<p>This film took a lot of lumps from those, unlike Trekkies, who weren't willing to forgive any film that had nothing more than an uninteresting plot, some good FX and the name "Star Trek" (most would have preferred to start the franchise with something like Wrath of Khan").  The plot is thin and turns out to have been borrowed from an episode of the original series - "The Changeling".  Much of the film is slow and whole sequences amount to an excuse to show off the special effects and other aspects of the cinematographic look which both excel over the 60's campiness of the show.  The characters don't play as much with their older TV selves' persona as they would in the latter movies and most of the time, they're passive observers of an immense alien intelligence - unable to do anything to help Earth.<p>Yet this Trek is special - mostly because it was the first and could have set a worse tone for the sequels, but also because it created a futuristic look which was neither that of the clean and high-tech future of the old-style movies, nor the gritty and junky style of movies like "Alien" and "Blade Runner".  The Enterprise here is a masterpiece of technical design, but the film's makers show its faults (an horrific and fatal transporter accident; wormholes; very narrow hallways)  It's more streamlined than its TV version, but not so carefree looking that it's a cruise ship like the Enterprise-D.  As the Enterprise accelerates into warp space, you can almost feel the throb of the engines vibrate through your TV.  The characters are appropriately serious yet show that glimmer of their campier selves ("Spock, so help me I'm actually glad to see you!").  Even the danger's of space seem more palpable here than on the show (or any of the shows).  Though a rip-off of an older episode, real Trekkies know this as a common occurrence, and the movie actually kept me guessing until the last 10 minutes as to the identity of the aliens and their mission.  Even the special effects seem still fresh, despite the passge of over 20 years (and a switch to "Industrial Light Magic" after this movie).  With its emphasis on a mysterious alien and the dangers of space, this is perhapos the closest any trek has come to pure science fiction.  Perhaps the new show "Enterprise" will finally match the promise offered by this first movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>OK, we Trekkers know all the knocks against this movie by heart.

To this day, VGER  is entirely convincing, and an amazingly well-executed &quot;alien&quot;  ship.<p>And the movie does succeed in a way - as a kind of revisionist 2001  exercise.

I was glad they added the sound effects of the old bridge to bring a sense of continnuty to the new ship. <p>I was very dissapointed all the Memory Wall footage was not shown. I wanted to see the sets. They just showed an actor on a wire going down a movie set which looked like a wall from the entity. Then there was a pass with no sound with the costume coming towards the camera. There were so many photos I have seen of that deleted scene that at least I wanted to see the other portions of the set. Wise was right in his decision to remove it. It did look like they were on wires. <p>The case is another dissapointment. The plastic disk holder falls out if you don't open it correctly. It's like a two page disk container and you can lose the disk very easily if you are not careful.

We finally get to see what V'Jer looks like without the clouds surrounding it. If it were up to me I would have added a scene that shows the exterior and massive size of the craft in comparison to the Enterprise. I was so surprised to see this thing had an actual shape.

Kirk, stoic Science Officer Spock, and sardonically comedic Doctor Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; Mc Coy. In the vast horizon of space, there appears to be an immensely lethal gigantic space being intelligence on a direct collision course with the planet Earth. So of course the United Federation of Planets allows recently promoted Admiral Kirk to helm the U.S.S. Enterprise on an extremely vital emergency mission to investigate the mystery alien's intentions. Unfortunately for all but the most blindly devoted of the Trekkie fan base, the film lacked the one crucial engineering ingredient that made the original series glisten amongst all the other one-dimensionally conventional entertainment at the time, character and humanity.<p>Though we do see momentary glimpses of the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly character dynamic that propelled the original series ascendance into the syndication stratosphere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture creatively concentrates on a mightily bland ambiguous creature that never really fulfills on it's promise of threat to the audience, adheres too stridently to an old Hollywood pacing structure (form the 50's and 60's) that clashes as badly Star Trek as badly as platform shoes stand out at a Moshe pit, focuses on a very uninteresting romance between the first officer and a bald female navigator (both before and after one of them becomes an android), and horrendously confuses telling a intensely jargon-filled space odyssey with that of concocting a compelling movie. <p>All in all, despite an all-star cast, mind bogglingly excellent special effects, and a superbly noteworthy soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith (that track was later re-used in the vastly popular Star Trek: The Next Generation), Star Trek: The Motion Picture fails to go where almost all of it's sequels later went on to do, make an entertaining picture. <p>As for the upcoming Star Trek: the Motion Picture Director's Cut DVD Special Edition, it's intended to included a marvelously remastered anamorphic widescreen presentation, a Robert Wise commentary track, 3 documentaries, 11 deleted scenes, and more impressive Star Trek options to shake a replicated steak at. <p>Highly recommended for any Trekkie with a thirst for antiquity, but for all other indifferent non-fans stay as far away from this as you would from the Influencian Flu or Barclay's Proto-morphosis Syndrome.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Unlike many, I think this is a neat &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie, my only problem with this first film is the special effects which seem dated compared to the ones that followed, now this one has received full DVD treatment which i hope will be better, the special effects are supposed to be revamped to today's standards, lets hope so, because if so i will likely buy this DVD. if measured to the later films as far as effects go.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>Although overlong and dull, 'ST:TMP' is an often-fascinating, odd approach to filming 'Star Trek'. The key words are 'Motion Picture' - whilst the subsequent 'Star Trek' were often better, this was the only attempt to make  a truly 'cinematic' 'Star Trek' film.<p>The story behind the making is  probably more interesting than the film itself. In brief, it grew from an  aborted 'Star Trek: Phase Two' television series, and was produced with a  large budget by Paramount's motion picture division. A troubled production,  marred by an aborted initial set of special effects, led to a production  that was delivered at the last minute, and over budget to the tune of 30  million dollars - a lot in those days, and twice the expected cost. Coupled  with a bad critical reception, it almost killed off the franchise, despite  eventually turning a profit.<p>The good things - Douglas Trumbull's effects  are striking, dark and mysterious, much closer to 'Alien' than subsequent  'Star Trek' films, and space seems a much more dangerous place. Jerry  Goldsmith's music is the exact opposite of his 'Planet of the Apes' work -  lush and melodious, it has to do an awful lot, as Robert Wise's direction  is often very slow and ponderous. There's a memorable, loud 'twannng' noise  in there that became a cliche in subsequent sci-fi films. Furthermore, the  opening sequence, as Klingon battleships are knocked out of the sky by a  malevolent force, is fantastic.<p>On the other hand, the plot is very thin  for the two-hour running-time (Kirk and Co. inspect new Enterprise - Kirk  and Co. fly towards giant energy cloud - Kirk and Co. deal with giant  energy cloud - end), the costume designs have dated horribly (if they were  not dated already), and the film spends so long pondering supposedly deep  questions of life, the universe and everything that the people seem to get  lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>10 years following the cancellation of Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi television series, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, fans of the show (that aired for only 3 years between 1966 and 1969) were elated to learn that the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast had been reunited for a 2-hour feature film.  The much anticipated film, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, was placed under the direction of probably one of the best directors of all time, Robert Wise, who had previously won two Oscars for Best Director for the films &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965).  He also edited the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and directed &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971).  However, even with such an impressive director at the helm, long-time &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, as well as the rest of the audience, were not particularly impressed with the film.  Why?  The primary cause was poor writing, but Robert Wise may not have been the best choice for director either.  And what of the writers?  Though not credited, Gene Roddenberry was involved with writing the story, but the film's story was credited to Alan Dean Foster, who started writing sci-fi novels in 1972, but had no previous film or television writing experience.  Other writing credits go to Harold Livingston, whose previous writing experience was primarily for television shows, but he had never written anything for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.  Additional non-credited writing was done by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.<p>The story itself begins as follows: a massively large cloud emerges from unknown regions of space and is first detected by the Federation when it passes through Klingon space and is attacked by three Klingon warships.  The Klingons are destroyed, and the cloud is found to be heading directly for Earth.  Conveniently, with no other starships available to intercept the massive cloud, only the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is nearing the completion of its redesign, is in range to intercept the cloud.  The now Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) easily convinces Star Fleet Command to give him command of the Enterprise, even though a new captain has already been assigned, Captain William Decker (Stephen Collins).  (Capt. Decker is the son of Commodore Matthew Decker, who died in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode, &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, which aired on October 20, 1967.  In that episode, Commodore Decker was played by William Windom.)  Most of the original crew is already on board the Enterprise, including Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Lt. Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), the now Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett, who married Gene Roddenberry) and the return of Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), who was removed by producers during the first season of the original series.  Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is drafted back into Star Fleet at the behest of Kirk, but Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has been busy purging all emotions on Vulcan for several years.  A new alien crew member is introduced in the film, Lt. Ilia (Persis Khambatta, who got to shave her head for the role.)  From that point on, much of the film is essentially a rework of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;The Changeling&quot;, which aired originally on September 29, 1967.  The subplot between Capt. Decker and Lt. Ilia is very interesting and should have received greater attention.<p>The most memorable scenes in the film include the transporter accident, McCoy's arrival on the Enterprise, Spock on Vulcan, the Klingons' battle with the cloud, the arrival of Lt. Ilia, the worm hole, Spock's arrival, the Enterprise's first cloud encounter, the probe, Spock's space-suited journey, Kirk's challenges to V'Ger and the final bridge scene.  The two worst scenes in the film are both lengthy and have very little dialog: Kirk's lengthy external tour of the Enterprise and the psychedelic cloud light show reminiscent of the final scenes from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968).  Acting in the film was certainly not stellar, and was often rather emotionless and uninspired.  The best acting came from Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, the Klingon Captain (Mark Lenard, who usually played Spock's father Sarek in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; projects) and James Doohan.  Other notable characters include Sonak (Jon Rashad Kamal) and the female Vulcan Master (Edna Glover).  One thing that this film forever changed was the appearance of the Klingons who have the now familiar ridged foreheads.  In the original television series, they appeared far more human.  Special effects used in the film may seem dated to some viewers, but were quite good for the time.<p>Overall, I rate &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; with 3 out of 5 stars.  It certainly could have been much better, but it's not a complete waste of time.  Had more of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series writers been involved with this film, it probably would have been far more memorable and enjoyable.  At least the DVD version includes many deleted scenes.  These scenes help to explain the story and should probably have remained in the original film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB0HW46Y2EB.html">A1GB0HW46Y2EB</a><br/><p>This 1979 motion picture, based on the Star Trek television series, was intended to be the answer to the prayers of the heartbroken fans of the television series that was canceled in 1969 after three seasons on NBC.  The film has basically the same cast as the television series but was a high budget motion picture undertaking.  This is a very slow moving film which seems to last considerably longer than its 2:16  running time.  It shares certain similarities with earlier science-fiction theatrical films, notably Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968).<br /><br />To say that the acting is generally stiff in this film would be an understatement.  William Shatner embarrassingly overacts in this production to the extent that his character, Captain James Kirk, is thoroughly obnoxious through most of the film.  The story seems to be of a seemingly endless  journey through the Universe to reach a source of energy that is suspected to be a threat to the security of the earth.  The star ship Enterprise passes through strange formations and lights, reminding one of the psychedelic light-effects seen in "2001: A Space Odyssey" but taking much more time and having none of the artistry and imagination of the earlier film.  The ship finally passes through what can only be described as a galactic sphincter into a cosmic colon which contains this alien energy force which turns out to be SPOILER COMING UP! the space probe Voyager Six originally launched by NASA some 300 years prior to the time setting of the film.<br /><br />This is apparently the "Director's Edition" running  slightly longer than the original release.  The film, in Blu-ray, looks and sounds very impressive but must be, with one exception, judged from the standpoint of direction and acting as being significantly inferior to the five films having the same cast that would follow it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>This one will only really satisfy the real fans, if even them. The story used here comes from a script that they had worked out for "Star Trek Phase II", the sequel series that Paramount considered producing in the seventies. As an episode in a long running series, it would have worked. In fact, it largely resembles the basic story for the original series episode "The Changeling" from the sixties.<br /><br />The bad thing, though, is that, in order to take a story from an episode and make it a 2hr+ movie, they added several long scenes of people waiting and looking at ... something. It's never clearly explained, though it's easier to understand the geometry of V'ger's ship in this Director's Cut, with better special effects. It doesn't help the slow plotting, but it eliminates a bit of the confusion.<br /><br />In the end, there are some classic Trek moments here and there, but you have to wade through this plodding movie to get to them. Basically, the best thing to come out of this movie is that it proved that people still had a desire for more Trek. It did monster business when it came out, but people soon realized it wasn't all they'd hoped. The studios wised up before making the next one, but they could see that there was a market.<br /><br />More specific to this DVD release, the special features are quite interesting if you like understanding how movies are made.<br /><br />Just remember, this movie is really best viewed by those who already love the series and can forgive a misstep here and there.</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>Star Trek: The Motion Picture isn't perfect.  Sure, it has all the cast from the TV Show.  Sure, there are action scenes (albeit a few).  But, the first of the Trek movies isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong.  I think the cast did a pretty good job.  It's the story that is boring.  Not to mention that 10-minute blackness of music at the beginning..I found that boring.  This movie has been a mixed bag for Trekkies.<br /><br />  This movie also stars Stephen Collins from "7th Heaven".</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Originally dubbed the 'Slow Motion Picture' by even die hard Trekkies, the first Star Trek movie was a ponderous, plodding and protracted affair rushed into cinemas as a post-Star Wars special effects showcase. The plot was made even worse by the 1983 re-edit, which added 11 minutes to it's already interminable running time. Now director Robert Wise has re-edited the film, tightening the pace, re-inserted key scenes, enhancing effects and supervising a Dolby 5.1 sound mix. And the result? Well, it's still ponderous, plodding and only slightly less protracted. But there are good points though; the principal actors, (Especially William Shatner) are good in their roles, and Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic memorable score helps events, but it's still a so-so movie, that would thankfully be redeemed by the excellent Star Trek II. Not trying to push the point too far, but I fell asleep the first time I watched this lacklustre entry into the Star Trek cannon. The extra material on the DVD bumps up the rating though, with 3 retrospective documentaries with cast and crew interviews, trailers, 8 television commercials, 11 deleted scenes and additional scenes. Also included are storyboard archives and a new Star Trek series Enterprise promo spot.<br />Impressive extras but it's for hard-core Star Trek fans only.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>While it's still flawed, Robert Wise's Director's Edition of ST:TMP shows a huge improvement in pacing, structure and optical effects. Wise had a release date before he had even shot one reel of footage and, as a result, was working against a deadline from day one. With optical effects problems from the very first (the company hired couldn't deliver despite spending 5 million dollars), the original set scrapped (it was build for the planned television series and wasn't detailed enough for the motion picture screen)as well as endless rewrites (Alan Dean Foster's original script was radically rewritten by Harold Livingston), power struggles, etc. Wise had his work cut out for him.<p>The resulting film was compromised from the get go. Eventually John Dykstra (Star Wars, Spiderman)and Douglas Trumbull(2001, Close Encounters)were brought in to complete the massive amount of effects work necessary for the film. Wise didn't get a chance to really fine tune the final cut of the film until this DVD release. He took the opportunity to also go back and redo some of the opticals they didn't have time to finish. The only priviso was that the effects had to look like they were created in 1979. The resulting final product is a marvel to watch.<p>A mysterious cloud posessing enormous power and, perhaps, with a craft at its center advances on Earth. Why it's coming is a mystery. After it disintegrates two Klingon war vessels and a Federation space station, the Federation elects the Enterprise to attept first contact or, failing that, try and destroy the visitor. <p>Admiral Kirk convinces Starfleet to let him command the Enterprise over Captain Decker (recommended by Kirk)because of his experience. The revamped Enterprise isn't quite space worthy yet but must be launched within 12 hours to allow the Enterprise time to cut off the alien visitor before it reaches Earth. <p>Wise uses a slower pace to create suspense in ST:TMP and it's quite different from other installments in the film franchise. The regal pacing and production design might, at first, put off fans of films 2-6 and The Next Generation. Keep in mind that ST:TMP is from a different generation of filmmaking. ST:TMP straddles the line between The Day the Earth Stood Still (another Wise film) and Wrath of Kahn.<p>The first disc includes a combined commentary track featuring Wise, Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra, Jerry Goldsmith and others commenting on the stress and challenges of making of the original film. There's also comments from Wise about the changes made to the film for this DVD edition. The picture quality is exceptional although there are analog artifacts. Compression isn't an issue and I saw a bit of edge enhancement as well but, on the whole, it looks quite good. The remixed/remastered sound is a huge improvement on the original soundtrack (you can compare it to the deleted scenes to hear the difference). I'm not sure if this is an anamorphic widescreen transfer (it is presented in widescreen). The anamorphic transfer from video to DVd increases the resolution and clarity of the image. I believe it to be an anamorphic transfer but, again, have nothing to compare it against. <p>The second disc has all the extras including the scenes included in the 1979 version that were trimmed/cut/reshot for this edition. It also includes the extra scenes (including the infamous scene where Kirk goes after Spock outside the ship and you can see the edge of the set)for the 1983 television premiere as well. There's also feauturettes devoted to the new optical effects, publicity and interviews. There's also a section called Outtakes that focuses on an incomplete sequence that was replaced in the final film Spock going outside the ship and attempting to mind meld with the alien.<p>Although flawed with a script that was constantly being rewritten (with uncredited help from Leonard Nimoy), director Wise's film manages to capture both the sense of adventure and the larger than life qualities that made the series so popular. Keep in mind this film is less action oriented than other films in the franchise. It has more in common with the episodes like &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; and &quot;Nomad&quot; than it does &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; or &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. On its own, it's a fine film that has finally been finished in line with the vision Wise had for the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>only saw it once a long time ago, but i recall that it moved very slow and didn't seem to draw me in. i guess that's why they took such a long time to put this one out on dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Sadly, this first entry in the Star Trek feature film series is less than the sum of its parts.  Despite the reunion of the classic TV series' original cast, augmented by a pair of talented guest stars, the guiding hands of series creator Gene Roddenberry and legendary director Robert Wise, a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith, and a story concoted by great sci-fi author Alan Dean Foster, the film never rises above the mediocre.  The biggest flaw is the pacing, as exemplified by the absurdly long introduction of the Enterprise in spacedock, and the ship's later meandering journey through the internal world of V'ger.  The FX and sets are impressive, but never inspiring.  The script is built on an interesting premise, but one which never comes to life and finally disintegrates in a melodramatic but unmoving anti-climax.  The best parts of this film are the Mr. Spock subplot (in which the Vulcan sees V'ger as a kindred spirit and potential mentor), and the opening segment depicting V'ger's skirmish with a trio of Klingon battle cruisers.  There are worse films, even in the Star Trek saga (notably Generations), but this movie will probably only appeal to die-hard Trekkies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E.html">A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E</a><br/><p>I am still amazed that there are people who will give this a 5-star rating. When first released the movie had one main attraction: The reunion of the original series crew. Being a huge Star Trek fan I went to see it in the theater three times. But even then, before any other ST films were released it was obvious there were problems. Even when you take in the "Director's Cut" that has since been released, updating the look and feel of the movie, it still suffers from one major problem: The story sucked! It ended up being nothing more than a rehash of a couple of shows from the original series.<br /><br />Back in 1979 I listened to a radio interview with Walter Koenig after the movie was released and he basically stated that they started off filming with half a script. Because of the tightness of the shooting schedule there were many times they filmed with only an outline for certain scenes. The film feels that way. There are many scenes that seemed contrived, like the actors were winging it. Some of the acting was horrible (Persis Khambata), some of it was bland (Walter Koenig, George Takei), and some of it was just unecessary (Majel Barrett, Grace Lee Whitney). The best acting on the film was turned in by Stephen Collins (future dad on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDYQ">7th Heaven - Seasons 1-5</a>). His character was interesting. His constant sparring with Admiral Kirk was one of the highlights of the film, giving the picture a great tension within the plot. Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock was OK for this film but lacked originality. At the beginning he's 100% emotionless but by the end of the film he embraces his emotions. This would have been much more interesting had we not seen it 3 - 4 times in the original series.<br /><br />One other problem, there were times that the movie drags. Two scenes in particular: When Scott is taking Kirk over to the Enterprize in a shuttle we're treated to a 10 minute dragging "inspection" of the ship. Interesting for the first 5 minutes, it gets old quickly. But that pales in comparrison to the scene showing the Enterprize entering the Vger cloud. That seemed to go on forever. The only good thing about it, you had enough time to get up, go to the restroom, then stand in line to buy another box of Bon Bons, and still get back before it was over.<br /><br />Are there things to like here? Absolutely! Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack was astounding! No wonder TNG stole it. And, again, the reunion of the cast 10 years after the cancellation of the series was fun to watch. But once you got to see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000683DH">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a> you really do realize how bad this movie was. Did they improve it when releasing the "Director's Cut" on DVD? Yes, but only the look and feel of the movie. Even with the extended scenes added, it still ends up towards the bottom of the Star Trek Movie list, just a bit above (maybe) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOH">Star Trek V - The Final Frontier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Take an original Star Trek episode and draw it out to three times the usual length, take away the humor, throw in some post-Star wars special effects, and finally add in some uninteresting new characters, and there you have it "Star Trek - The Motion Picture".<br />Admittedly there is some initial fun in seeing the old crew back after a ten year hiatus but this fun drains away pretty quickly. Long, boring and colorless - right down to the drab production design - even fans will struggle to sit through this one. You get the feeling that director Robert Wise was so conscious of being respectful of the material that he ended up embalming it. If this review is not warning enough, this film has been recut twice all to no avail.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>I love Star Trek beyond belief but this first outing is a testament to one's patience as it was just bone-achingly slow.<p>&quot;Damn it, Bones, we need to stop this thing now!!  But before we do that, let's take a shuttle to the Enterprise&quot; (because the transporters are conveniently down) &quot;and show broad, wide, sweeping shots of the Enterprise that eats up so much screen time that it's a wonder that this mysterious cloud hasn't consumed us whole by now!!&quot;<p>In fact, Kirk seems so caught up by the majesty of the Enterprise that it's a wonder that he seems to be in such a hurried rush later.<p>Oh, and don't get me started about the acting in various scenes.<p>My favorite is the Enterprise's reaction to the cloud's effect on the visual screen--it just seems to be a shocked, drunken stupor and you can almost hear the &quot;Wow...that was not good, right?&quot; coming from every face in the room.<p>The wormhole scene...owwwwwww.  Tension is simply caused because you are waiting for someone to spout off a line, NOT because you're actually worried about the meteor hitting the ship.<p>The costumes are painful to watch and it's easy to tell who is male or female in THIS chorus line.  Thank heavens for the dramatic costume improvement from Star Trek II onwards.<p>There are some good moments, but if you're looking for something to nap and wake up occasionally for plot, then this is your flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Star Trek The Motion Picture overall is a good movie, but a little too long for it's own good. This movie just doesn't have that much action in it, but great special fx and story keep this movie interesting.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie are the references that would later appear in other Trek series, mainly the Borg. Some of the stuff used in this movie that would later be used in Trek again.<br /><br />- The opening theme would become the theme for Star Trek TNG<br /><br />- Spock says "Resistance is Futile"<br /><br />- VGER's name turns out to be a name used later (no spoiler)<br /><br />- There is talk about a planet of living machines (Borg)<br /><br />- Riker and Deanna Troi are based on Decker and Ilia<br /><br />This movie would be fantastic if they just left out the long scenes where Scotty and Kirk are first going to the Enterprise and when the Enterprise is flying into VGER. Those two scenes are very long and not needed.<br /><br />If you like character/story driven movies, this is great! But it is still slow/dull at some points of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>I am really glad that Robert Wise and company decided to go back and put in the new special effects and new scenes that were left out in the rushed 1979 release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. This is among one of the absolute best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ever made because you get to see what happens to Kirk, Spock, and crew after their famous 5-year mission in the original series. And plus, you get to see a new side of the U.S.S. Enterprise when they transformed it from a smaller ship (original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series) to an even bigger ship! And also, you get to see a couple of new faces, including Stephen Collins as Commander Will Decker and the late Persis Khambatta as Lieutenant Ilia. Some of my favorite improvements of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; are as follows:<p>A.) The overture and main title sequences<br />B.) The color of the sky on the planet Vulcan, Spock's home<br />C.) Starfleet Headquarters in the future San Francisco<br />D.) The Enterprise's warp speed sequences<br />E.) Shots of the Enterprise's warp nacelles inside the officer's lounge<br />F.) The improved Red Alert sounds<br />G.) A full shot of V'Ger heading toward Earth<br />H.) Shots of Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Decker, and Ilia outside of the Enterprise as they were heading toward V'Ger's source<p>This &quot;Star Trek&quot; film has pretty much everything that you'd expect from a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, such as action, a great storyline, and new and improved special effects! And you also get a little romance thanks to Decker and Ilia. This is truly one of the greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies ever made, alongside the other 8 Trek films. And like &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, there will be no other film like &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;...maybe someday.</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE has been greatly underrated. This film is very close to capturing the spirit of the original TV series. The TV series was about almost limitless space travel into far off worlds searching out life forms and strong on deep character interactions of the crew based upon this trek into space. This film reverts back to the central theme of characters facing the unknown and is complimented by magnificent special effects giving the film a realistic quality not seen up to that time. Jerry Goldsmith's rich score enhanced the human drama as the crew came into contact with a vast life entity approaching earth. This film was brilliantly directed by Robert Wise but I still prefer the original version released to the theaters over this special edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>The other special edition Trek movies that recently came out are loaded with extras too, but nothing like this DVD. I love the TV spots and the documentaries! Great nostalgia and awesome interviews! Notably absent from the interviews is Leonard Nimoy. Also I had no idea they had plans to make another Trek series back in the mid seventies. They even show test shots of the would be new cast (featuring Persis Khambatta who would have played Ilia on the show!) and the new sets on this DVD! Very interesting stuff! They were way ahead of their time. TNG was still over 10 years away from being made at this point.<br /><br />Star Trek The Next Generation "borrows" a lot from this movie. From the intellectual story telling, the theme song, the uniforms, and Jonathan Frakes owes his career as Riker to Commander Decker.<br /><br />This movie has been labeled a "bomb", but critics should know that this movie was the 3rd highest grossing movie of 1979 and it came out in December of that year! It made more money than the original Alien and Apocalypse Now! Both of those movies are considered classics. The new CG shots are amazing! They really add to the film! V'Ger is no longer just a cloud in space, but is now a massive probe looking for it's creator! The only drawback to this version is there is 7 minutes cut out. I would've liked to have seen maybe an egg (like T2) where you can watch the original version and/or the television version. But that is a minor point.<br /><br />So, just relax (forget the MTV flashy edit style movies of today) and indulge yourself in this bit of Star Trek history!</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1979.  I still have the original plastic popcorn cups to prove it.<br /><br />At the time I thought it was slow and bombastic, and I was dissappointed that they rehashed "The Changeling" episode from the original series.<br /><br />Well, perhaps I've mellowed a bit but I watched this DVD version last night a thoroughly enjoyed it.  The key is to relax and soak in the experience.  It's sort of a great, epic, mood piece with incredible visuals and a gorgeous sound track.  Lower your expectations and let the movie come to you.<br /><br />But beyond this, the movie poses a rather important question.  What do you do if you spend your life searching for God, and you discover that God does not meet your pre-conceived notions of what He should be?  V'ger finds that her "god" is a "carbon unit" and she doesn't believe it, but when the "carbon unit" enters  the transmission code -- proving his claim to be "god" -- she puts her faith in him, and she joins herself to her "god" and becomes a greater being for it.  There's a little to ponder there.<br /><br />Beyond this, the documentaries on the second disk are interesting, and I enjoyed the various deleted scenes that showed the differences between this directors' cut and the original version.  I haven't sat through the commentary track, but I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />Perhaps it wasn't all it could have been (and the documentaries explain a lot of why this is so) but I believe this movie has a lot to recommend it.  I'll probably watch it again every few years until I transition to whatever the next life turns out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SJSNS9LW981O.html">A3SJSNS9LW981O</a><br/><p>This film has been bashed up and down. Is it a "weak story" dependent on "special effects?"<br /><br />Not to me. The film has an awesome villian (and unlike most people, I use the word "awesome" sparingly), a huge and mysterious craft enveloped by a cloud. It's ominous mystery and deadly power could destroy the Earth itself.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT) As the craft is investigated, it's discovered to be an earth probe evolved and seeking it's creator. It needs to have meaning and purpose, much as the dispassionate and logical character of Spock needs.  It needs spirituality, hope and faith!<br /><br />Unlike what most reviewers claim, this movie does do justice to the Star Trek characters.<br /><br />Kirk is dissatisfied with being a desk jockey admiral, and wants to captain a starship once again.

This is where the motion picture journey should have began and it was well worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Similar to what the recent remastering of the original series has done, this is updated as well, but in a lesser degree. A lot of care was put into touching up and completing Robert Wise's original vision for the film. Using modern technology, new scenes that were in the original storyboard art but never used are finally brought to life. It's not so much new scenes, but the original vision for already existing scenes that could be done when the film was originally made. There aren't big changes, but small ones that you probably wouldn't really notice unless you were very familiar with the original film. That's how natural the updated film feels and stays a loyal as possible to the original movie.<br /><br />Some scenes that have been added are just beautiful. One scene in particular is the first time you see Spock on Vulcan. They have finally been able to make a realistic looking Vulcan planet and give it atmosphere. Unlike in the original film when he is blinded by the sunlight, but the sky is black and no sun to be seen. Overall, this updated "Director's Edition" just makes the film more enjoyable to watch and even more "sci-fi" than it previously was.<br /><br />It will not convert you if you don't like the original film, because it is very much the same and it is just as interesting. So, if you thought this film was boring, you still will. But, if you like this movie, it just enhances the experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>Maybe the title of my review says it all, but here goes. I got to admit, I was somewhat dissapointed with this movie. Although, it was great to see the original crew back from a nearly 10 year hiatus, I have to say that the overall plot of this film was weak. Now I have read reviews saying that this edition has cut out some sub-plots and storylines, so maybe I should watch the original cut, but I just couldn't stay really interested in the overall story. I also think, especially with this edition, the movie was overloaded with too many special effects. Some of the scenes were drawn out just so the effects could be shown. Take the scene when Kirk and Scotty were in the pod boarding the Enterprise toward the beginning of the film. That scene seems like forever. Its just shot after shot of the Enterprise sitting there in space at every angle imaginable while Kirk and Scotty fly around it. Ok, I get the picture..it's the Enterprise..cool shot...now move on please! Another thing is that I don't think the original crew actors had really shaken the rust off yet. They just didn't seem to mesh as well as I had expected. Now I know it seems I'm bashing this film badly, but its not that this is a terrible movie. Maybe I was just expecting better, but I was just dissapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>over the years many people have fought over this movie,and to be sure this isn't the best star trek movie made,but really it's not that bad!<br /><br />  after the end of it's five year mission, the enterprise is being refitted and the crew is gettting her ready for her new launch.while this is going on,we see(a very good opening piece) three klingon war ships and the "cloud" which they are attacking.very quickly we see that the "battle" is onesided and the klingons are defeated,all of which is seen by a federation listening post. flash to earth and james kirk as he takes commannd of the ship once again,because if not stoped the "cloud" will reach earth very soon!<br /><br />  while not the slam bang action of say star wars or even buck rogers,this thiking mans sci-fi tale is good and if the story is a little weak,you still get the cast back together and start the movies off with a bang!<br /><br />  the two disc dvd is great with both the movie version and the directors cut,plus more extras than you can shake a stick at,so enjoy and live long and prosper!</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Gene Roddenberry's "Star Trek" is one of the most unique TV shows of its type. When it originally aired on NBC-TV between 1966 and 1969, it did no better than No. 35 in the Nielsen ratings, and was cancelled by NBC at the end of the '68-'69 season. But then a funny thing happened in the 1970s: Syndication. It was syndication that bought "Star Trek" a renewed following, making it a massive cult favorite whose followers came to be known as "Trekkies." It was only a matter of time before the series made the leap from the small screen to the big screen. That happened in December 1979. <p>William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, and Walter Koenig were reunited for what turned out to be the first of many successful "Star Trek" movies. And while this initial entry is somewhat imperfect, it nevertheless shows a fair amount of style.<p>The film focuses on the crew of a now-redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise, once more commanded by James Kirk (Shatner), heading out to confront a vast alien cloud making its way towards Earth on a mission of destruction. Shatner this time also runs into conflict with the new "Enterprise" commander (Stephen Collins) over his usurping of authority. But for the most part, the differences are put aside to confront this hideous threat to Earth's population. The alien force, which calls itself "V'ger", has taken over the body of one of the "Enterprise"'s medical officers (Persis Khambatta). As the crew learns, "V'ger" is in actuality an ancient "Voyager" space probe launched from Earth three centuries ago. It now makes what is obviously quite an impossible demand to meet: either it reunites with its "Creator", or it wipes out the "Creator"'s planet--Earth.<p>Originally budgeted at five million dollars by Paramount Pictures when production started in mid-1977, the size and scope of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE grew very fast; and as a result, so too did the budget until it came out to a then nearly-unheard-of forty million. Much of that budget, not surprisingly, was spent on production design and the wide array of special effects. On that score, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE certainly looks every bit like it. And having a veteran director like Robert Wise, who made films like WEST SIDE STORY, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE HAUNTING, and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN didn't hurt either. But the slow, leisurely pace of the film did turn off many filmgoers, even some Trekkies; in that sense, it closely resembles 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY more than it does, say, STAR WARS, let alone the original TV series. But even that can be a plus, because the series was not merely concerned with fancy visuals; it was concerned with deep human issues, and the movie itself concerns itself with an issue as old as humanity itself--God, or, The Creator.<p>The ultra-familiar cast was one of the reasons that STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was a box office smash, despite its flaws. Another reason, of course, was the superb visual effects work supervised by Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra and Richard Yuricich, which got nominated for an Oscar. The other high point of the film is Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music score, with echoes of Debussy's "Nocturnes" and parts of Holst's "The Planets"; it is easily one of the greatest music scores produced in Hollywood during the last four decades that John Williams did NOT compose, and it too was recognized with an Oscar nomination.<p>Despite its extreme length (at 144 minutes) and somewhat slow pace, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is still eminently watchable on all counts, and comes highly recommended for all science fiction film fans, even those who are not necessarily Trekkies.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>The flaws of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; never bothered me that much upon its release, but this new version, while better, still is a long way from greatness.<p>The revised special effects are an improvement over some of the flawed originals (particularly the final scenes involving the walk to V'ger), and director Robert Wise has trimmed a lot of the unnecessary dialogue, but the main problem with this film was a script that packed too little excitement.<p>Unfortunately, that can't be cured with better visual effects or more effective film edits. This film was always a visual treat, but the characters and script let it down badly, and they still do.<p>Still, this film IS a good time, especially for Trekkies, and simply watching it in widescreen, on DVD, makes the film look and feel a whole lot better. Paramount also included some terrific bonus materials on the making of the film, and the aborted Star Trek TV series that became the film series.</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>A famous author once remarked about a &quot;rose by any other name is still a rose.....&quot; Those words come to mind when I think of the first transition of Trek to the big screen.The plot of this science fiction film  is indeed worthy of Kubrick and Clarke, and yet because it is the familiar  pop-icons of Star Trek who play out this space opera that somehow makes the  viewer more comfortable about what is going to unfold on screen.  It is  a rather complex plot with a lot of techno and spiritual babble that will  no doubt confuse the young who view this for the first time(as it did me  when I was 11 and saw it at theatres for the first time!)yet it works  because we are all too familiar with maybe how Kirk will deal with that  gigantic cloud, or how Spock will interpret meanings beyond what any human  could grasp.Some felt that Star Trek TMP was too slow and cerebreal, that  in its transition from t.v. to bigscreen it had somehow lost the wonder of  the series.I disagreed as I sat there mesmerized by the stunning  visuals,Jerry Goldsmith musical score, and all-too-familiar t.v. icons.It  is still a rose however you look at it!</p></br></body></html>

Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.<br /><br />For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.<br /><br />I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs. I have watched DVDs and yes the picture is clearer, but it is the film itself that makes me enjoy what they are.</p></br><a href="../users/A18HHKM6WGEF9D.html">A18HHKM6WGEF9D</a><br/><p>The 7th Harry Potter book marks a distinct shift in the series, as Dumbledore is dead, Harry and friends are no longer at Hogwarts, and the world is facing a dark future that only they can prevent. This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.<br /><br />My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know. I'm fine with that - this is the 7th film after all.<br /><br />Anyway, a wonderful setup for the final film!</p></br><a href="../users/A1KMG1AIUS00DC.html">A1KMG1AIUS00DC</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.<br /><br />Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.<br /><br />This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).<br /><br />The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.  The main extra is the opening scene of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II."  There are also additional scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.  The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Hard to believe this is the beginning of the end for this series. But what a way to go out! As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).<br /><br />The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt.1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.<br /><br />The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate. Aside from a couple of odd scenes, which were not in the book, I could really find nothing to complain about. I'm glad they decided to split the book, I think it was the best decision for this film and the entire series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 gives the intense feeling of a world that is dangerous. And being that I have grown up with Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, I feel for them as I would for a family member. There are true scenes of terror in this latest movie, and the music can be very alarming. I got the feeling I was watching a well done political thriller at times. This movie is almost entirely about the characters that we love most: Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. In my opinion some of the best acting of the franchise is displayed in this excellent movie.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows was almost painful for me to watch though, as I have grown up with these characters and I care for them all so much. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are still young, but the cruel world throws them out into the fire where anything may meet them! They are hiding, scared, and alone from powerful forces bent on their deaths. Everything they love is in peril, or has fallen and nobody can be trusted outside of themselves. The thoughts of the loved ones left behind drive them to stay up all night thinking about them in unconsolible agony. The three camp in woods, with only enough supplies to survive, and in places little traveled by people. Each wearing thinner daily by the impossible burden of perhaps being the last hope.<br /><br />The warm guidance and protection of those that love them are ALL gone except in memory. It is up to them, with barely enough knowledge to suffice, and definately not enough experience! And it drives me to worrying fits, because I don't know what's going to happen to these kids. I have refrained myself from reading the novels until I have seen all the movies. I have kept myself from overhearing anything about the books, and now I am in complete mystery, and it thrills me, but also it holds me in agony at times. I was reminded how young these guys still are when Hermoine was crying like a child. I wanted to protect her and kill the people who harmed her! You forget how young the characters are because of how grim, and aged they behave at times.<br /><br />It is not only their world that is in peril, but the world that I have come to know extensively, and that I have appreciated, and held in my imagination with awe and wonder. It seems every new movie had been a slow death of that world. A piece of it would die and not return. There are real consequences in this world, though it be fantasy, it is filled with real moments of loss. Every scene is weighted down with danger. Every corner is dangerous, and may have some terrible consequence. Terrible thoughts went through my head; and there were times when I had lost hope. I can't remember when I watched a movie with such emotional responses.<br /><br />This is a movie that I instantly loved, and will watch many, many times. I am convinced that the end movie will be historic. I cannot wait for next July for the supreme finale. I am sad that it is coming to an end, but I am also very happy that it will be filmed will nearly all of the original cast in the end. I believe this is the movie of the year. Enough of this "It's a good harry potter movie." No, it's a great, epic MOVIE. I highly recommend this tragic, Dangerous, and Emotional movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Part I of the Deathly Hallows is faithful to the book for the most part.  Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.<br /><br />Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.<br /><br />The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say "Wow, I've come a long way."<br /><br />And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.<br /><br />Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.<br /><br />And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!<br /><br />Nitpicking Follows!<br /><br />Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.<br /><br />It's going to be a long wait to this summer!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>While I thought the production team did a great job with the film, I think it's a perfect example of "if you haven't read the book, it won't make much sense."  At this point, why would anyone see a Potter film without having read the books?  It boggles the mind.  That said, this review is written toward those who know the story, proper.<br /><br />The direction was good, as was most of the writing.  Rupurt Grint was ever on pointe as Ron, and Radcliffe has without question grown his skills as Boy Who.  Watson finally acted, and without total reliance on eyebrows!  She was actually impressive in this film.  Maybe she has an acting career ahead, yet. The adult cast stepped it up in this installment, as well.  Billowy-cloaked Snape is a thing to behold, as is a broken Lucius Malfoy.  I was happy to see Carter act as if she wanted to be there, which finally brought Bellatrix alive for me.  Newcomer Rhys Ifans was wonderful.  In short, every actor delivered a standout performance.  Very impressive, in that regard.  The creatively layered reunion of the entire cast was fantastic.  That excitement alone boosts anticipation of the next film.<br /><br />I appreciate that this film was split, in order to do the story justice, as well it should have been.  I can't help but think that all of the action and luster is in the second half, which leaves this lead-up a bit diminished.  In the story proper, this portion should be the emotional setup for what is to come, and in that regard I felt it lacked.  The darkness, thus direness, of the Wizarding world was made evident from the opening scene.  This is no children's film.  Know that the racy scenes and violence reveal this throughout.  Still, even with poignant smatterings of grief and terror, the emotional depth did not sustain.  I would have gladly sat through a four-hour film if longevity would have maintained the momentum better.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />I was a bit bereft of the treatment of Hedwig's demise.  As the film left it, her absence was the only real indicator that she was dead.  The lack of Harry's processing of that was equally unrealistic and unclear. More acknowledgement was given to the loss of Dobby, who had far less face time in the films than she did.  Though Hagrid was Harry's first real friend in the Wizarding world, Hedwig was his first real emotional connection in his life.  I didn't think it canon that this bond wouldn't have been more acknowledged at her death.<br /><br />Though the camping scenes didn't make for riveting action (the same can be said of the book), the character development during those weeks was long overdue.  We saw a darkness in Ron prior unrevealed, a depth to Hermione and Harry's relationship had only been hinted at prior, and a long-needed resourcefulness in Harry was finally tapped.  I agree with criticism that pace slowed tremendously during those scenes, but what we learned about the trio in that stillness was necessary.  In truth, it was better delivered in the film than in the book, albeit out of sequence in the film.<br /><br />Insight into what was happening at Hogwart's bore showing.  Early in the film, the impression is finally given that this is not just Harry's fight, but is that of the entire Wizarding world.  But by focusing primarily on the trio's lives and not how others contributed to the effort--and they were--much of that communal sense of obligation, thus sacrifice, is lost.<br /><br />Explanations of the Hallows was rushed at best.  If you didn't understand them or how they and their lineage relate to Harry's plight, I'm afraid rewinding won't be much help.  That said, if you know their far-reaching relevance from the book, the animated sequence telling their story was well-done, albeit quickly so.<br /><br />The cheesiest effect in the film was Ron's greatest fears come to life, seeing Harry and Hermione passionately locked together.  It looked like a 2D paste job against a rolling CGI effect.  I was so unamused by the effect that I didn't connect with what a riveting and psychological test it was for Ron.<br /><br />The best scene in the film was Harry silently summoning Hermione to dance.  Without being romantic or sentimental it was profound, showing how Harry has matured into awareness of and reaction to the emotional states of others.  This is the trait that sets Harry apart from Voldemort more than any other, and this scene subtly conveyed his finesse in interpersonal observation and reaction.<br /><br />Several vaguely explained plot items troubled me, most of which were also problematic in the previous films.  Dobby showing up with no explanation is a major oversight that did not need to be.  The Missing Mirror, which should have been introduced way back at The Order of the Phoenix and wasn't now shows up with no explanation at all.  This lack negates how instrumental it is in the escape from Malfoy Manner, and diminishes the grief that Harry still processes from Sirius', and most recently Dumbledore's death.  Along that line, the need for the horcruxes is revealed, though the significance of the items precious to each of the Houses at Hogwart's is not.  It will be interesting to see how they jam learning about them AND finding each of them into the remaining installment</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, "That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!" or "Ahh, so that's the significance of the ..." was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).<br /><br />I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.<br /><br />My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.<br /><br />Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective in conveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor. Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>The decision to split the final of J.K. Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.<br /><br />Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.<br /><br />Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroes are forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.<br /><br />A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).<br /><br />These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!<br /><br />Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the "TWO movies? [...] that" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.<br /><br />Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.<br /><br />I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.<br /><br />Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.<br /><br />In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Sad days lay ahead now that the "Harry Potter" saga is coming to an end.<br /><br />There isn't anything else like it now ("Twilight"? Please!) and it seems doubtful anything else will be able to match it for some time to come. Author JK Rowling created a series of highly imaginative books introducing us to a bevy of unusual, interesting characters we have lived with for a long time, so long they seem like friends/ When the enormous success of the first few books led to the inevitable films, many die-hard fans were worried. Thankfully, the first two films were adequate, if uninspired. Beginning with the third film, the series takes on a darker personality, to match the tone of the books, and allowed a handful of more creative directors to create a movie series worthy of the imagination the books helped us conjure.<br /><br />Warner Bros. made the right decision to tell the story of the "Deathly Hallows" in two films. This frees Steve Kloves, the screenwriter of the entire series, and David Yates, the director of the last four films in the series, to tell as much of the story as humanly possible. Given "Part 1" runs close to 3 hours, they are covering a lot of the book. This is a refreshing change of pace as each of the previous film adaptations pared down the material, sacrificing characters, subplots, relationships.<br /><br />And much like the book, "Part 1" basically sets up "Part 2". It is basically an introduction to the conclusion, the set-up for the big finale, the epic battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Some may feel there is too much exposition. I don't. It works and the filmmaking is top notch creating a thrilling chapter in the series.<br /><br />Picking up at what would be the beginning of Potter's final year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) wait anxiously for their friends in the Order of the Phoenix. Soon everyone assembles at Harry's Muggle home and an elaborate plan is put in place to move Harry to a secure location and keep him out of the hands of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But Voldemort and his minions are hot on their path. Harry, Hermione and Ron quickly decide to flee to a secret place in the forest and hide out. They spend every moment trying to figure out how to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Once these powerful mementos of Tom Riddle's life are gone, they believe He Who Must Not Be Named will be vulnerable and they stand a chance to defeat the enemy. But Voldemort is looking for some very different items, the Deathly Hallows, items he believes will help him defeat that pesky Potter.<br /><br />Yates and Kloves have done a remarkable job of building the story towards this inevitable dark climax. As the stakes rise, the danger increases matching the dark tone of the narrative. Given this series was originally written with pre-teens in mind, it is nice to see the filmmakers have not shied away from depicting these dark moments.<br /><br />Throughout the series, the three leads have grown both physically and as actors. Daniel Radcliffe creates a viable persona for Harry, giving him a human quality, real feelings, making us care and root for him. When his friends face danger on his behalf, we can see the pain on his face as he realizes the sacrifices others are making for him. Emma Watson continues to give Hermione a real depth. She has always been the smart one, the one who excels in her studies, and the one her friends turn to for a quick spell or an answer to a puzzle. But as she has grown into a young lady, threads of confusion have woven into her performance; she doesn't understand the power she holds over boys, but is only too willing to use this power when necessary. Rupert Grint has grown most of all. In the early days, his google eyes and incessant mugging made it almost impossible to watch him. Now, he is able to channel the real feelings and distractions any teenager might feel which make him seem more real and more interesting.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about "Part 1" is something dictated by the book, so I am not sure the film should be faulted. The best thing about this series is the rich wealth of acting talent appearing in supporting roles as various wizards, witches and villains. Alan Rickman, the best throughout, plays the sly, sneaky and snarky Professor Severus Snape. It is great fun to watch him play the role, tailor-made for his talents, with such relish. Maggie Smith is very good as Professor McGonagall, the head of Harry's house and a defacto mother for the young wizard. Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Harris, Imelda Staunton, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths and Michael Gambon, to name a very few, have all taken on roles and all have been memorable.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes returns as Lord Voldemort, the ultimate bad guy. He Who Must Not Be Named is ready to battle the young wizard, his nemesis for all of these years. He is ready to take over the wizarding world, his power is growing, and he now has control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Muggles should be very afraid.<br /><br />But in "Part 1", a significant portion of the film involves the three young friends hiding out in the forest, trying to figure things out. This involves a lot of talking and some arguing. Most of all, these moments keep us away from most of the British actors who lend their talents to and provide some of the most memorable moments in the series. While Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown as actors, it is still far more interesting to watch them interact with a virtual who's-who of British cinema. Thankfully, many of these actors should play a more pivotal role in "Part 2".<br /><br />The "Harry Potter" franchise has been and will continue to be so lucrative for all involved it makes sense Warner Bros. has always been extremely careful with each film, creating one great film after another. "Part 1" is no exception and I think it may be one of the most beautiful in the series. From the moment we enter the wizarding world, everything looks real, beautiful and wonderful. The ability to make this world appear so real, as it basically sits on top of London, is no small feat. The film opens with an exciting chase, our attention focused on Harry as he rides in Hagrid's sidecar. The motorcycle roars through London traffic and at one point drives upside down in a tunnel. The motorcycle speeds through traffic and helps illustrate the danger our hero faces as he straddles these two worlds. The previously mentioned scenes of the trio in the forest and other natural locales are also beautiful, reflecting the harsh reality of a British winter. When the action moves to the Ministry of Magic, you feel as though your are entering the halls of a hallowed institution.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the Tale of the Deathly Hallows. Late in the film, Hermione finally has a moment to recount the story for Harry's benefit. As she narrates the fable, it is illustrated for us using a series of dark shadows, as though puppets are recreating the tale. This technique helps to give the story a children's book quality; the characters might be hand shadows or paper cutouts moving across a sepia background. It is a nice touch to further reinforce the fable nature of the story, a fable both Hermione and Ron heard as children. It almost feels as though we are watching the story unfold through Potter's eyes.<br /><br />The "Harry Potter" films are magical and as the series comes to a close, everyone has such high expectation for the last two films. If these expectations aren't met, they will feel disappointed. Originally, "Part 1" was going to be released in 3-D, which was exciting news; using this technique promised to bring the world in these films to life. But then Warner Bros. changed their plans and I learned these films weren't actually made in 3-D. They were going to retrofit the second to last film, the same technique used to help make "Clash of the Titans" the piece of crap it is. Thank goodness they changed their mind. "Clash" looks terrible, as though the film was made in the 50s using the original 3-D technology. The newest "Chronicles of Narnia" is also retrofitted and looks it. I have to wonder why they continue to do this and also why didn't they just make the film in 3-D to begin with? It boggles my mind to think they might have subjected "Part 1" to this process, creating a sub par entry in the series. As the second to last entry in the series, an awful experience would be a huge let down to the loyal fans and would leave a bad taste in their mouth.<br /><br />Hopefully, this common sense will prevail for "Part 2" as well.<br /><br />"Deathly Hallows Part 1" is a necessary step to "Part 2". It isn't the most memorable entry in the series, but it is very good. And my expectations for "Part 2" are very high.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.<br /><br />Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.<br /><br />Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.<br /><br />Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.<br /><br />My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.<br /><br />For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.<br /><br />It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>This movie was made of awesome.<br /><br />I haven't reread the book, as I've done previously with the films, so I wasn't in my nit-picking mood.<br /><br />Plus, the special effects looked fabulous. Both Dobby and Kreacher looked real and, although my brain knows that Nagiri isn't real, my eyes couldn't tell that.<br /><br />The trio are so much better actors now than they were in the previous six films - whatever advice or acting lessons they took paid off.<br /><br />Alan Rickman appears in the film not nearly enough but steals the show for the 2 milliseconds he is on screen.<br /><br />I thought that the storyline and the necessary revisions, as well as additions were handled well. I would see this movie again in theaters. Soon.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>I think today, or possibly even tomorrow, is the official release date for the DVD. But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.<br /><br />It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in "Half-Blood Prince" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in "Tales of Beedle the Bard," and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the "Elder Wand," which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.<br /><br />Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out. I get the distinct impression the first half hour or so has most of the differences.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the first of two parts of the last two films. The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film. Still and all a quite good film that I can gladly recommend. 4/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Finally, the moviemakers behind the Harry Potter films did the right thing and broke up a book into two movies, something that should have been done from the very first book.  Given that, this is still a long movie, clocking in at almost 2.5 hours, without any additional footage separate from the theatrical release.  This film is part action, part suspense, part drama, with a little comedy and romance thrown in.  There is magic, but not so much of it as to overwhelm the plot lines, of which there are several.  First is the quest of Harry and friends to find the Deathly Hollows.  Second is the relationship between Ron and Harry both over Hermione and with regards to each other.  Then comes the separate tragedies of the various wizards and muggles as they fall prey to Voldermort.  Last, but not least, is Voldermort himself, and his quest to find Harry Potter.  Mixed in is a very original and effective retelling of the Deathly Hallows story narrated by Hermione, some key deaths, and further insights into Dumbeldorf's past.  Overall, a great movie and well worth the purchase, especially considering the news that Warner Brothers will remove all the Potter DVD's from store shelfs early 2012.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>A decided improvement over the book in this case. This installment leading up to the big finish focuses on what most of us probably really care about - the people and relationships. The acting is quite good as well. The "kids" are growing into very good actors and director Yates trusts them to communicate everything the audience needs. Plus the kids are, as usual, surrounded by some of the best film actors around today.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>To those who boohooed the Blu-ray/ultraviolet set, GET OVER IT! Okay, the UV was crap, but post on the movie! Not the lack of extras.<br /><br />SPOILER!!!! SPOILER!!!SPOILER!!! If you do NOT know what happens, PLEASE STOP NOW!!!!!<br /><br />Everything you thought about Snape? Well, you were wrong (personally, I saw that coming). Dumbledor was more of a finagler that you EVER thought, even in death. The bad guys get there's BIG TIME. Harry has kids who go to Hogwarts 19 years after the end of the film.<br /><br />Okay, now to MY review. I know almost everyone knows what happens in this dvd by now. I am 58, and a huge fan of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a very very dark set-up to finish with DH 2. The CG effects in DH2 are way better than any of the other films. There is not ONE moment that doesn't have you on the edge of your seat/couch. The filming is dark when it needs to be, and bright when it should be. The characters are no longer young kids, they have arrived into adults, and play that role. The soundtrack...excellent. Subdued and used purely to accent the action. While the plot takes you to the inevitable end, you find yourself embracing it, and, even though it is the end of this fantastic series, accepting. You will bury your face in your hands at the sad parts (yes, I may have shed a few tears), but shout cheers at you tv for the victories. And after all, isn't that WHY we watch this series? My ONLY sorrow, is there isn't more. The world created in this series is a very special world. And I will miss it.<br /><br />As to the DVD set, there are NO extras. At all. At least on my rental from Redbox.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>These hallows are not only "deathly," they're "darker than dark."<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.<br /><br />Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly "in support." All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.<br /><br />Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.<br /><br />The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.<br /><br />Summing up: Many of the "dark" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I wasn't a fan of the previous Harry Potter film because it was extremely shy on the actual magic and didn't contain enough action for my liking, but Deathly Hallows is a pretty remarkable improvement on *both* accounts.  To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.<br /><br />As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.<br /><br />The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.<br /><br />Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter in the Harry Potter films.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>When I say this film is dark, I don't mean in its visual presentation, which is superb. The cinematography and special effects are top notch. But much like "Half Blood Prince", DH Part 1 has very little of the delight and joy which were evident in the early books and movies. Yes, those stories had the dark elements associated with Voldemort and in the dangerous seeming climaxes, but other parts of the stories were highly entertaining and uplifting in their depiction of life at Hogwarts. Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.<br /><br />At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like "The Dark Knight" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch "The Dark Knight" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOL<br /><br />So if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the beginning of the end for this franchise, which began nine years ago with the cinematic adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.<br /><br />In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.<br /><br />The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.<br /><br />This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.<br /><br />All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.<br /><br />In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>The producers of the Harry Potter film franchise seem to have given up on using a different director with his or her unique style for every episode. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.<br /><br />The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, "These are dark times," and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, "Dark Mark Sparks Panic." Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.<br /><br />There is an oddity in the tone of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal "Tale of the Three Brothers", as found in "The Tales of Beedle the Bard", particularly effective.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I may be giving this movie 4 stars, but this will not be a glowing review. HARRY POTTER has one story. Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... "Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash." This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.<br /><br />I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, "Thank God." or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's "Thank God."<br /><br />HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this was by far the darkest chapter in the harry potter series yet.it reminded me of "empire strikes back" or "revenge of the sith" in that it was a family film that took a very dark turn.<br />  the kids have to carry around a trinket for a while that makes them turn on eachother.it reminded me of "lord of the rings" and the hobbitts with the ring.<br />  it was not my favorite part.my favorite part was "prisoner of azkaban".although,i would rank it in the top half along with "the half blood prince"<br /><br />  i say it is a good movie.the only harry potter movie to be my favorite for an entire year.yes the movie industry is going to crap but this was still the winner.<br />  now id like to address all the ill informed misfits out there about something.i hear a lot of people saying that harry potter is evil.they say just because the kids are at a school learning magic,that they must be satanic.well,magic is magic and satanism is satanism .they are 2 entirely different things.some of the wiccans and celts and such belive there isnt even a devil at all.others still belive that he is real but they belive he is pure evil and they sure as crap dont worship him.any idiot in the multiverse knows that.so i say to these uninformed misfits....GET A LIFE AND THEN AN EDUCATION.......ITS this same of short cuts to thinking that caused the inquisition.<br />  its just a bunch of family movies.nothing to run away from.kids playing with sticks and casting spells that make spiders walk on roller skates and stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>**THIS HAS MAJOR SPOILERS (LIKE I CARE!)**<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 (2010) is a great warts-and-all film. How ironic, since it is about witches and wizards. My original review, though almost all here, is scrapped in favor of kicking off complaining about Daniel Radcliffe. He can act, certainly, but in this film he's more than flat. Frustration and angst is the character's hallmark, but the days of a sometimes sweet and charming Harry are days long gone. Be aware of that and beware Radcliffe's unforgivable failures as a young adult actor.<br /><br />This is a very skillful adaptation of novel-to-script, and let no one dispute that fact.<br /><br />The kids (Daniel Radcliffe in spite of it all, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) are a delight, a true delight! How they've grown, yet they remain themselves.<br /><br />This film's power is mostly in its gloomy silence. Andr&eacute; Desplat's soundtrack, as thin as wispy mountain air, is nonetheless brilliant. Also, Yates handled the disgusting scenes very well. He had to put them in - Rowling wrote it that way, didn't she? I believe Yates split the story - that is, brought Part I to its end - at the perfect moment. I wondered where they'd split it.<br /><br />Now the BAD:<br /><br />The others in this film are a bit on the cardboard site. One expects better, though the acting (such as it is) is great. If you do not blink, otherwise you'll miss it. It angered me that Rufus Scrimegeour (Bill Nighy) was not introduced in the last film as he ought to have been, and here he appears for all of exactly five minutes, including a full minute-plus in the opening scene. This was saved only by the fact that Bill Nighy is as great as ever.<br /><br />What I did love about Scrimegeour was his speech, that opens the film. It was straight from Margaret Thatcher and would have done the old lady proud. I thought it was deeply moving yet hilarious; English audiences will instantly perceive it but I doubt it will have any impact on the American viewer.<br /><br />While I myself cannot tell whether Scrimegeour is talking with a Welsh or Scots accent, it is a precise growl that grabs your attention no matter what. (He says, "deluminator-r-r-r" with a velvety purr.) The whole character is reminiscent of the character's name: it is a Scots name and has its own tartan, but it is a sept of a larger clan name. This is the kind of depth you can expect from these great actors, given what little they've got with which to work here.<br /><br />Further, the film sags horribly during its central 40 minutes. Bad, especially after its genius beginning and follow-through. It was intended to do that, but I think it was 40 minutes totally wasted.<br /><br />Oh, now give me a break: Indo-Chinese style shadow puppets to tell the story of the Three Brothers? How unnecessarily cheap Yates can be! They do better than this with crummy historical reenactments in documentaries. And how he skimped on the magic - a fate Roger Ebert tellingly prophesied almost ten years ago.<br /><br />There were disgusting moments that, although I can see as necessary, really should have been re-written for younger viewers. That's just me. Otherwise, there's nothing else. I LOVED this film and wish that the POTTER craze had used a bit more of Yates' tricks in the past. Impossible, but I wish it. Someone said this is "the most cinematically satisfying" of all the films. Agreed, but only to a degree.<br /><br />WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SEE AND WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED: Harry and Hermione seeing the "Potter Memorials" in Godric's Hollow. A bit more dialogue might have helped.<br /><br />WHAT I REALLY LOVED SEEING (ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE): Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasely. He's a handsome redhead and I wish they'd shown more.<br /><br />PAY ATTENTION: I will only ever explain this once and tough toenails if you think it spoils anything. It is about the wands. Dumbledore of course owns the Elder Wand. Draco disarmed Dumbledore at the tower before Dumbledore died, so the Elder Wand belonged to Draco. Note: one does not need to take the actual wand or fight against it to defeat its master.<br /><br />Therein lies the trick: when Harry disarms Draco of some paltry wands at the Malfoy mansion (shown vividly here), Harry becomes the Elder Wand master. So the fact that Dumbledore is buried with it, and Voldemort steals it, is of no consequence. Harry is still its master as soon as he beats Draco by disarming him.<br /><br />Ending: Voldemort cannot kill Harry with the Elder Wand stolen from Dumbledore's tomb: the wand recognizes its true master. However, he does stun the part of himself that lives in Harry. When Harry awakens, all he has to do then is defend himself and let Voldemort kill himself with his own Avada Kedavra curse. See? Simple.<br /><br />Get this film, no question about that. I hear the Blu-Ray or whatever it's called has terrific extras, which the single, plain-jane DVD does not. The single edition only has deleted scenes, and not nearly as much footage as I expected.<br /><br />DVD COMPLAINING: We were cheated with the plain single DVD for some reason. It has some deleted scenes and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors about what extras would be on the single edition. Remember, this is the arm-twisting that will force us all sooner or later to get Blu-Ray. That angers me more than Warner Brother's habitual broken promises and lies.<br /><br />Yes, there is a double-disc plain DVD edition because we considered it before just getting the single plain one. I'm tired of the almost-100% lame quality of POTTER extras. It's just that there is so much more and apparently the Blu-Ray special is a 3-disc. See? The air is full of rip-offs!<br /><br />We didn't get our single edition at W**~M*** but they did have the double plain DVD edition there ... where was that ... T**** I think.<br /><br />And yes, WB should be FINED for their habitual lies, bait-n-switch and broken promises. This is the beginning of the forced move to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />One day, no regular DVDs will be seen anywhere.<br /><br />For all the negatives, I demerit one star. For Warner Brothers/DVD distributor in America, I give the biggest raspberry in the universe!!</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.<br /><br />My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the "dream scene" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.<br /><br />Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.  It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.<br /><br />The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.<br /><br />I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This series really is an extraordinary pleasure.  While the HB Prince and Order P were a bit of a blur, this film is completely distinctive - it doesn't take place in HogW and is a running adventure chase in full, with many principal characters killed off.  It moves much faster, the dangers seem far greater, and everything is at stake.  This is even character development, with Ron rebelling and coming back, the progress of young love, and Harry's flaws coming out more clearly.  After so much time, it amazes me that the quality is still going up.  The comic touches, depth of theme, and fine acting continue, of course.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>**1/2<br /><br />In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the penultimate entry in the decade-long "Harry Potter" movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.<br /><br />For those who are diehard devotees of the "Potter" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching "Deathly Hallows" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails).  For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow.  The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment.  Still, that doesn't make sitting through this film any more palatable or entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>As a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie very much, although a few things about the film could have been better.<br /><br />The best thing about "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is that the producers were smart enough to split the final installment of J.K. Rowling's brilliant wizard saga into two films. As a result, not nearly as much content from the book was cut for Part I of "Deathly Hallows" as has been the case with the other HP movies. The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.<br /><br />This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)<br /><br />I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.<br /><br />In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>Technically it's half of a movie but I really feel that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stands on its own as an excellent HP film. While I really like it I probably wouldn't consider it to be the best HP movie but I quite enjoy it, some of the character's emotions come out really well here. For those who have not read J.K. Rowling's seventh and final book in the series the action may seem slow and it may seem a bit boring but this Part 1 was necessary. Not everyone will see the beauty of this 7th Potter film but I think splitting the final film in two was a great decision, of course money-wise it was a very good idea for Warner Bros profitable to do so. It also allows viewers a more complete visual experience of the book. Contrary to what some may think I feel that splitting the final book into two movies was for the best because it gives more room for character emotion, ambiance and best of all, it doesn't rush things. I must say the action is a bit slower and Hogwarts is missed but Part 1 sets things up nicely for the conclusion of the Harry potter saga on movies. Everything that needed to be in this movie was and they didn't cut out much. As for the acting I don't think the actors have ever been better in a Harry Potter movie their performances here were nothing short of excellent and brilliant. I won't go through the storyline or the events of the movie, this should be clear by now and I don't think there is much more to say, basically Harry, Hermione and Ron search for the missing horcruxes. I don't want to spoil anything or reveal too much but I just want to say that one of my favorite parts was the animation showed for the story of the three brother in "The Tales of Beetle the Bard". It looked fantastic visually and even if brief is I feel, a highlight of Part 1.<br /><br />For the Blu-Ray: The special features are Blu-Ray exclusive, now I don't know why that is. Perhaps Warner thought that those buying the DVD version (which is a LOT) wouldn't like to have bonus features for some reason. The Blu-Ray has a disc devoted to special features only, the extras are a nice touch for fans and I did like them. For instance the 7 Harrys feature was pretty cool and I liked watching the deleted scenes but I probably won't watch the bonuses very often. The digital copy is not on a disc, it's an online download and from what other reviewers are saying it's not ideal because of software download, unwanted software and it isn't the "safest" download, let's put it at that. I would've rather had the digital copy on a disc like much of the other Blu releases but that's just a minor complaint.<br /><br />There are many complaints about the picture quality, especially for the DVD. I own the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy/DVD combo version of Deathly Hallows and I have to admit that these are definitely not the best Blu-Ray or DVD that I've seen. I watched both formats and I think the Blu-Ray looks better in comparison the very dark picture that you get with the DVD. I watched the movie in theaters when it was released and I don't remember it to be this dark. I don't know what it is but Warner Bros managed to screw up the picture quality for this movie, perhaps this will be corrected in the not too distant future with a boxed set of the 8 movies?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; it's a nice addition to the series and set the viewers for what should be a fantastic conclusion. It's hard to believe 2011 marks the 10 year anniversary of the first movie and the franchise! I can't wait to see Part 2 as I think Part 1 set us up so nicely for it! Now, as much as I love the movie I can't give this Blu-Ray/DVD release 5 star because of the picture transfer but those who are not too preoccupied by the darker picture quality should still go for it.4/5 stars, minus 1 star for the visuals.</p></br><a href="../users/A168VXSISJWQN9.html">A168VXSISJWQN9</a><br/><p>I think director David Yates did as much with the material as could be expected. He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.<br /><br />A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it. If you are a Harry Potter fan (like me), no problem. If you haven't got a good knowledge of the story so far, either bring yourself up to date with it up to the end of book/movie #6, or don't waste your time watching this one. It won't mean a thing to you.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>The Harry Potter films continue to get better with each succeeding film for me. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I" is the action thriller of the Potter films. Fans already know what's going to happen and for those who don't I'm not going to spoil it except to state up front that the film doesn't have a conclusion but ends on a great cliff hanger.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good--the image is crisp and true to the theatrical presentation of the film. The look of the film is much more subdued with colors that are often muted to reflect the much more serious and dangerous elements of the story.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific with a strong 5.1 lossless mix.<br /><br />The DVD that is included has a substandard transfer. I'm not sure what Warner has thinking here as many people will just be buying the DVD (perhaps they were thinking that most folks would be watching the show on their car DVD players to keep the kids occupied).<br /><br />Special features include a featurette on shooting the scene for the seven Harrys. We also get "Maximum Movie Mode" the interactive feature that acts as a commentary track taking you behind-the-scenes of the movie while you're watching it.<br /><br />We also get a promotional featurette on the creation and opening of the theme park in Florida. There are a number of deleted scenes which while they don't necessarily add to the film per se do give us some additional character moments. There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of "Supernatural".<br /><br />The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the "Maximum Movie Mode" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those "Ultimate" boxed sets).<br /><br />For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.<br /><br />Over all this is a good set with the film being exceptional. Potter fans will enjoy this set.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time.

Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.<br /><br />[Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]<br /><br />That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.<br /><br />The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.<br /><br />[End of Spoilers]<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant. One can't help but get the feeling that this is leading to something bigger.</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>For me, this was an odd movie.<br /><br />First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.<br /><br />I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.<br /><br />Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.<br /><br />Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.<br /><br />Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.<br /><br />Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.<br /><br />Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.<br /><br />Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.<br /><br />I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>According to the Blu-ray disc Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will be released in theaters on July 15th and if that isn't enough it will be released in 3-D as well. That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.<br /><br />I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.<br /><br />I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.<br /><br />In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story. I'm delighted to have this movie as a part of my collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this has to be the best harry potter movie yet. this movie was awesome i love this movie. i was so excited to see how close they were to the book. i love this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>So here we are at last. Part one of the last film of one of the best series of movies in a very long time. The Harry Potter series, books and movies both, have been generally very good, very well-received and very profitable.<br /><br />Part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is very good. In many ways its better than the first half of the book it's based on. It tells the tale... well, you all know what it's about. Harry and friends go hunting down the various parts of Voldemort's soul in order to destroy him. They do this with the support and hindrance of roughly half of the Royal Shakespearean Company.<br /><br />The movie suffers from one of the same problems that the book suffers from, and that's what I describe as "Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip". There are many, many scenes with the kids out camping and trying to decide what to do next. They angst, they are argue, the waffle and debate. This does not make for the most compelling reading nor the most compelling watching. Frankly the camping scenes could've been trimmed down considerably and we wouldn't have lost much.<br /><br />Aside from that, everything about the movie superb, and I'm very happy Warner Bros chose not to release it in 3-D. There's just no need for it. The movie looks fine without it, and hopefully they will abandon plans to release part two in that format.<br /><br />Whomever it was that cast Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who looks better and better with each film), Emma Watson and all the other primaries should probably receive a special Oscar for their efforts. They managed to cast the perfect actors for this series, and thanks to that and a great respect for the material we've been treated to a series of films where even the weakest is still pretty damn good. There's not many other film franchises one can say that about.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I will say this - the Harry Potter series is getting darker and better as it progresses. I like David Yates' innovative camera angles and pacing - they really do set the mood for the film and make it quite chilling. The animated sequence illustrating the Death Hallows was beautiful. The campsite locations were all exotic and evoked the landscapes of the Lord of the Rings. I was actually surprised that we don't see Hogwarts at all (except for a brief cameo).<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were a few bad influences from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI">Twilight</a>, particularly a vision of Harry and Hermione making out. These were usually minimal, but still stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, if you haven't read the books, some scenes will seem pointless or extraneous.<br /><br />Probably the best part about this movie was the ending and how it sets up for the grand finale. I won't spoil the ending, but I think Yates chose a perfect spot to split the final book in half.</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.<br /><br />The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, "Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill."<br /><br />Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A  few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom.  The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.<br /><br />The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.<br /><br />One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things... Readers know this potential disappointment however will be rectified in part 2.</p></br><a href="../users/AG8U6F6226GBZ.html">AG8U6F6226GBZ</a><br/><p>Good thing, I read the Deathly Hallows in the book. I liked it very much. But the DVD finally came in and I just watched it. If I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have been able to follow the story at all. The scenes changed so fast with a whsssh! They didn't make any sense at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I like all six of the previous Harry Potter films, but I'm not a big fan of what director, David Yates, has done with the last two installments. Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.<br /><br />The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br /><br />Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...<br /><br />1. The Prisoner of Azkaban<br />2. The Goblet of Fire<br />3. The Sorcerer's Stone<br />4. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br />5. The Chamber of Secrets<br />6. The Half-Blood Prince<br />7. The Order of the Phoenix</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>After finding the Half Blood Prince to just be dark and dull, I wasn't looking forward Deathly Hallows: Part 1 much at all. With that said though, I was pleasantly surprised how well done the movie was.<br />  The film isn't just dark with barely any charm or laughs like the last film. There's plenty of magic, excitement and heart-felt moments that will keep you entertained through-out. This Potter is easily one of the years best and one of the best Potters!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction -- the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became "the Boy Who Lived." No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) & Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) is excellent! The directing by David Yates (who also directed "Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix" (2007), "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince" (2009) & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2" (2011) is excellent! The screenplay (based on J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did the screenplay to "Wonder Boys" (2000) & the screenplays to all, but one of, the Harry Potter films) is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Alexandre Desplat (who also did the music, recently to, "The Ghost Writer" (2010), "Tamara Drewe" (2010), "The King's Speech" (2010) & the upcoming "The Tree Of Life" (2011) is excellent! The cinematography by Eduardo Serra (who also did the cinematography to "What Dreams May Come" (1998), "Unbreakable" (2000), "Blood Diamond" (2006), "Defiance" (2008) & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2") is excellent! The film editing by Mark Day (who also did the film editing to "Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix", "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince" & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2") is excellent! The casting by Fiona Weir (who also did the casting to "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" (2003), "Love Actually" (2003), "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire" (2005), "Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix", "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince", "Invictus" (2009), "The Ghost Writer", "Hereafter" (2010) & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2") is excellent! The production design by Stuart Craig (who also did the production design to "Notting Hill" (1999) & all the Harry Potter films) is excellent! The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow (who also did the art direction to "GoldenEye" (1995), "Notting Hill", "The World Is Not Enough" (1999) & all the Harry Potter films) (senior art director), Mark Bartholomew (who also did the art direction to "Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets" (2002), "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", "Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix" & "The Dark Knight" (2008), Alastair Bullock (who also did the art direction to "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", "Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix", "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince" & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2"), Martin Foley (who also did the art direction to "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince", the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2" & "Hugo Cabret" (2011), Christian Huband (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2" & "Hugo Cabret"), Molly Hughes (who also did the art direction to "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince" & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2"), Hattie Storey (who also did the art direction to "Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince" & the upcoming "Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2") & Gary Tomkins (who has been doing the art direction to the Harry Potter films since "Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban" (2004) is excellent! The set decoration by Stephanie McMillian (who also did the set decoration to "Notting Hill" & all the Harry Potter films) is excellent! The costume design by Jany Temime (who has been doing the costume design to all the Harry Potter films since "Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban", she also did the costume design to "Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason" (2004), "Children Of Men" (2006) & "In Bruges" (2008) is excellent!<br /><br />This is another excellent "Harry Potter" film that is just as excellent as its other sequels before it. This is a well-made and well-crafted film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is one of the best films, if not, the best film, of the holiday season.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Now maturing into young adults, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are on their own and on the run from Death Eaters as they search for the scattered pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and an ultimate weapon that will destroy it forever.<br /><br />The ultimate judgment of this final installment must await the release of Part II next year, but this is a promising start.  In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.  I appreciate that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves did not pack in a few more breathless escapes or big action set pieces.  Instead, we have a chance to get reacquainted with the three protagonists and spend some quiet time with them before the explosive climax that is sure to come.</p></br><a href="../users/AXSH6O4OP5L4M.html">AXSH6O4OP5L4M</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.<br /><br />The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were "required" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the d&eacute;nouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!<br /><br />The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2 ? hour film.<br /><br />The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them "camping out" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.<br /><br />Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYMJ96STIRW.html">AMYMJ96STIRW</a><br/><p>After repeated attempts to look at this movie and literally falling asleep in the process, it dawned on me that I was looking for the thing to make sense, to have a plot, to actually be something that went from point A to point B and actually told some sort of story.<br />This was the mistake!<br />There is none of the above.<br />All it is is trans-spiritual gobble-guck rife with hordrometts and gizzle-wigkets, dolp-grommets, bing-slammits and wands that can do anything including creating flowers on graves.<br />This is the worst movie that was ever so-called created for children.

The poster shows action, but should have shown Harry just standing there instead. I hate false advertising!<br /><br />After the initial escape scene, it's loooooooooooong, lingering shots for most of the movie, interspersed with short bits of action, some of which is so badly filmed so that you can't see what's happening. It's obvious that they're stretching it to justify two movies. They should have just made two 1.5-hour or 2-hour movies instead of subjecting us to these tediously boring stretches.<br /><br />My friends told me it was that way in the book, but slavishly following the book does not make for good filmmaking.<br /><br />There's a wedding scene that doesn't make any sense at all. Voldemort and company are scouring the world for Harry, and they throw a big wedding party? Want to attract attention much?<br /><br />And the super wand is hidden in a place that is all too easy to access ... I don't remember the upcoming plot, but I'll have to assume that Dumbledore *wanted* Voldemort to get his mitts on it, for some reason.<br /><br />There is a somewhat racy scene I'm not sure I'd want kids seeing - suggestive of Harry and Hermione embracing nude. It seemed unhealthy for all concerned, in a "kid's" movie.<br /><br />Very touching scene with a CGI elf, though.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I wouldn't dream of not seeing this as Harry Potter, whether in print, audio or film, has been a most wonderful experience for me.  However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.<br /><br />That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.<br /><br />If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.  As it is, one is left a bit unsatisfied at the odd truncation point of this seventh film, a part one rather than a whole film.</p></br></body></html>

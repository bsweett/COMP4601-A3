The result? An excellent adaptation that makes the experience of watching this film feel almost like reading the book.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Patrick Suskind, `Perfume' tells the story of a singular character born with an enhanced sense of smell that enables him to identify and separate all smells he can detect. The character seems also to be cursed as everyone related to him ends up badly. When he gets obsessed with the smell of a virgin he then looks to learn how to capture the essence of things so he can obtain the smells he wants to create the ultimate perfume.<br /><br />The story in the movie is guided by a narrator (John Hurt) and has most of the story arcs from the novel; some details were removed but they aren't really to be missed, in the novel for example, Grenouille creates a perfume with the smell of human that is not shown in the film. From beginning to end the adaptation is incredibly accurate, but even though the ending is exactly the same as the one in the book (even the same lines), the ending didn't feel quite well to me in the movie, I remember it having a deeper effect on me when I read it.<br /><br />The style Tykwer uses to show the smell of things in interesting and in the same format of effects used in `Run Lola run', the music fits well with the movie as it uses haunting themes that complement the visuals to create a dark mood for the film.<br /><br />Other than a 30 minutes documentary of the making of the film, there are no special features. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround and English/French/Spanish subtitles. The lack of extras really don't compensate for the price, you can get the movie for a cheaper price in the amazon market place instead. This detail explains the star I took from the review.<br /><br />If you read the novel you definitely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema. If you haven't you don't really need to read the novel first unless you'd like to compare details.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This is a very original film, based on the exacerbation of the smell, and impelled o unsuspected heights. Based on the famous best seller of Patrick Susskind, the cinematographic proposal was very satisfactory. This promising director handled with secure hand and firm conviction this weird story about a human being with a visible lack of affection and tender (since the moment he was born) who found his bliss through the pleasure of enjoying and even to recognize the most unexpected scents and, to separate them and back to join them in new and attractive proposals.<br /><br />The suspenseful frame I which the movie undertakes is filled of daring camera work and so the edition process and the enigmatic presence of this strange collector of scents and something else that you must find out.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>It must be a daunting task when a filmmaker attempts to adapt a novel that has been deemed "unfilmable." Such is the challenge Tom Tykwer (the audacious "Run, Lola, Run") accepted when he decided to film "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer," the wildly popular cult novel by Patrick Suskind first printed in the US in 1986. Intrinsic to the success of telling the tale of "Perfume" is to convey a palpable sense of "smell" and its intoxicating powers. While a book may do this with pages and pages of prose, a film does not have this descriptive luxury--hence, it must attempt some sort of visual shorthand. I'm pleased to say that Tykwer was up to the task. With vivid art direction, stunning visuals, and bold editing choices--you feel, almost, as if you can smell this peculiar tale. While this may sound like dubious praise, it is actually the highest compliment.<br /><br />Set in 18th century France, "Perfume" relates the tragic tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw). Born and almost killed in a fish market, raised in an orphanage, put into manual (and often dangerous) service at a young age, Jean-Baptiste is a disaffected and disconnected youth. Having no social skills and lacking any kind of normal emotional processes, the one thing that differentiates Jean-Baptiste is his keen sense of smell. It seems to be the only thing that connects him to the world he lives in. A chance visit to the city brings him to a perfume shop/manufacturer. Captivated by this world that revolves around the olfactory senses, Jean-Baptiste aggressively pursues a position with the proprietor (Dustin Hoffman). After achieving some success and freedom, he becomes obsessed with procuring the perfect scent--one that he once smelled in the "essence" of a beautiful young woman. Jean-Baptiste's obsessive bent soon leads to murder (no spoiler here, it is the title) as he seeks to extract this intoxicating smell from his victims. It's as if creating this one perfect scent will somehow humanize him--but to attempt it, he becomes even more monstrous.<br /><br />In the opening minutes of "Perfume," I was absolutely blown away. The visual impact of the early scenes is astonishing and unique. The tale, however, does settle down into a more routine and more familiar pattern. But while it doesn't maintain the frenetic and captivating pace, it is never less than intriguing and certainly beautiful to view. Technically, the film is awesome. I've already mentioned art direction and editing, but scoring, cinematography, and costuming are all top notch. Jean-Baptiste, who is really in every scene, can be a challenging central character--Whishaw plays him fairly vacantly. It is a one note performance, but largely because that's what the story calls for--a certain emotional flatness. Therefore, I thought it was effective--others might find it somewhat empty.<br /><br />I suspect many will absolutely loathe "Perfume," however, for I have yet to speak about the ending. The ending is absolutely outrageous, and I suspect that it will polarize audiences into "love it/hate it" camps. It's so over-the-top, so unlike anything you might foresee, and so unlike anything you've ever witnessed in a film before. Yet, for me, these excesses worked and fit well with the tone of this lurid little tale. Love it or hate it, it's a bold choice--and one you're not likely to forget. So I am recommending "Perfume" for those that like something different--this is not standard Hollywood fare, and I mean that in a good way.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this, and it is weird in some parts, but is actually a pretty darned good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.<br /><br />But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer." This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.<br /><br />In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the "thirteenth scent." But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.<br /><br />"Perfume" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is all of those, and more.<br /><br />Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.<br /><br />In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.<br /><br />A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>German born director Tom Tykwer slows things down quite a bit in PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER. Those in the know are probably aware of Tykwer's ultra-fast paced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00103584Y">Run Lola Run</a>(1998) in which the action never stopped. But here in Perfume we get to see a completely different Tykwer, one with an eye for beautiful camera shots, incredible vistas, and stunning cinematography.<br /><br />Problems with the film became apparent, however, before the film ever got green-lit. Several directors considered the project before opting out. Among them were such notables as Ridley Scott, Tim Burton, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, and even Stanley Kubrick (may he rest in peace). But fate - or karma or whatever you might believe in - intervened and plopped it in the lap of Mr. Tykwer, who quickly decided to make this feature event a spectacle beyond most imaginations. With an incredible budget of over $65 million (the largest ever from a German production company), the film was shot with an eye for artistic quality along with a flowing script. And it worked. It worked very well.<br /><br />The dark sets of 18th century France come alive (and frighteningly so) thanks to the shadowy sets and creepy main character of Jean-Baptiste Grenuille (Ben Whishaw, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFQLG4">Layer Cake</a>), a man with a gift for smells. Born to a careless and soon-to-be-dead mother, Jean-Baptiste's life is put under the microscope for the entire audience to see. Since being born on the streets of France (literally), Jean-Baptiste smells all of its greatness and stench. Being shuffled first to an orphanage where he fights for his infant life, to his life as a tanner, to his eventual acceptance into the business of a down-on-his-luck perfumer named Giuseppi Baldini (Dustin Hoffman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168OINK">Kung Fu Panda</a>), Jean-Baptiste demands more and more from his marvelous sense of smell. In fact, he wants to be able to bottle the smell of glass and other intangibles. Maybe even capture the scent of ...life? Beauty? Oh yes, even that.<br /><br />During a visit to the streets of France, Jean-Baptiste encounters his first truly magnificent smell, that of a lovely redhead. But her fear of him leads to her death and Jean-Baptiste worries he may never get that scent back.<br /><br />His fears are side-stepped, however, when he learns how to capture the smell of beautiful women, but only after killing them. Dread grips the countryside as women of all socio-economic classes are found murdered.<br /><br />A man with an acute sense of danger named Richis (Alan Rickman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BN1ZHW">Sweeney Todd</a>) realizes the danger his only daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is in and decides to flee with her across the country. But can distance save her when a human bloodhound is on your trail?<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste needs Laura in order to finish his scent de excellence and nothing appears to be able to stop him ...except for himself. His life has been a pursuit that no other person can share, and this has made him a truly lonely figure ...if not a non-entity in terms of humanity itself.<br /><br />This film came very close to being one of my top ten favorites, but fell a tad short thanks to what many call "the orgy scene." Although it was a nice twist from what I thought was going to happen, it really, really, REALLY stretched the imagination beyond any possibility of realism. Even so, it was filmed exceptionally well.<br /><br />Most surprising to me was that I hadn't realized how long this sucker was. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, it whizzed by; that's how engrossing much of the production was, including the acting, the (amazing) sets and costumes, and the sumptuous cinematography (pay particular attention to the red hair, especially when Laura is fleeing on horseback with her father).<br /><br />I intend to buy this film and keep it in my DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>Words cannot begin to describe how this film left me. I had to watch it twice to be sure, but I have to say it is exhilirating.<br />This has to be the most bizarre movie I have ever seen. The only one that even comes a bit close is any version of 'Sweeny Todd', simply because of the story line.<br />The plot has been gone over, so I won't do that again. I will say that everything about the movie was in prime shape. Actors, sets, costumes,story line, music.... it all came together into an amazing, repulsing masterpiece of a wondrous story! This could almost be fitting to be called a modern, adult fairy tale, with how violent the Grimm Brothers stories were.It does have a finishing moral to boot!<br />I highly recommend this film. This is one that could certainly be up for discussion in classrooms.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I had no idea what this film was about. I was absolutely stunned by the acting, the storyline, the direction, the background music and even Dustin Hoffman's little cameo. This film is about 150 minutes and yet is worth every bit of it. I would compare this film with greats like Prestige, Passion of the Christ, Amadeus and maybe even American Beauty. I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.<br /><br />I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it. I am now looking forward to reading the book. I will not bother recommending this film to people who I think won't like it, simply because this is a film only to be appreciated by someone worthy of understanding it's craft and poignance. I loved the first one hour, hardly any dialogues, the film was amazingly easy to follow. The last thirty minutes had me so gripped that I felt a bit emotional out of the sheery beauty the central character brings out.<br /><br />The Perfume is a film about survival, faith and hobby. Three cheers and much respect for the makers.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I read Patrick Suskind's Perfume when it was published in English in 1986.  When I heard over the years that a movie version was planned I never thought it would become reality.  I was always a little uncertain how Grenouille would be presented since he is hardly a hero.  The film is an excellent adaptation of the book with a remarkable performance by Ben Whishaw as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.  Mr. Whishaw manages to convey the "otherness" of Grenouille; a feeling he conveys that he is different and an outsider.  He is relegated to his own world of smells and has no need to communicate with people.  The gaunt appearance that Mr. Whishaw achieves is perfect for his character.  It is equally interesting to see his passions aroused when he first detects the scent of a young woman selling fruit.  He truly comes alive and when he accidentally kills the girl his reaction is like a child that has killed a favorite pet; he does not know that he has done anything wrong: he had to relish the scent of the girl.<br /><br /> Dustin Hoffman makes an interesting Giuseppe Baldini.  His nose is perfect for a perfumer and he does quite well with the role although his accent does not sound terribly Italian.  Alan Rickman is superb as Antoine Richis and Rachel Hurd-Wood, as his daughter Antoine Richis, is very attractive and entirely convinces you that she is an intelligent young woman who would rather do without marriage to the well-meaning but much older Marquis de Montesquieu.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent and beautifully fit into their characters.  The production is first rate and is entirely convincing from the start that you are in 18th century France with all of its squalor and filth.  The CGI effects are quite good, particularly the bridge where Baldini has his shop.  John Hurt lends his mellifluous voice to the film as the narrator, helping to fill us in on Grenouille's workings and motives.<br /><br />If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the film unconditionally.  For people who have not read the book, I hope you will find the experience a journey of the imagination.  While this is not a morality tale perhaps the moral of this story is that we cannot live (as Grenouille understands in the end) without love and be whole.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>this is one of the more creative movies ive seen in a while.baby born under a table at a fish market where his uncaring mother was working.even worse,she hoped he died (theres more to this but youll have to watch it for yourself).<br /><br />baby grows up and his life got no easier.his only skill;extraordinary sense of smell.i mean,he can smell the exact ingredients of perfume and from great distances.a smell,or,to be more exact,a certain fragrance,is now his obsession.<br /><br />he,jean baptise,is given apprenticeship at a famed perfumers shop (d hoffman).here jb tries to hone his gift/curse.this is also where the killing takes off.his need to kill is due to his need for the perfect scent.<br /><br />this is very well done and didnt go for the jack the ripper kind of violence.one may actually feel sympathy for jean baptiste for he doesnt kill out of hatred,but out of necessity.<br /><br />as for the ending...........SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!

His first kill is accidental, but once he advances his craft of separating a flower/woman's smell and putting it in a vial, he can't seem to stop until he's captured the scent of every beautiful woman he's ever smelled.

I am not saying this will give a pleasant smell to you. Probably some people would be attracted to the complexity of the strange world where olfactory perception means everything. Or some would loath the film's story and main character itself, especially the conclusion. Whatever you may find it, Tom Tykwer's "Perfume" remains intriguing throughout as allegorical tale, dark comedy or serial killer suspense. Pick your choice.<br /><br />With John Hurt as narrator with slightly mocking tone, the eventful life story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is introduced, and from the very first moment you realize "Perfume" is no ordinary film. The film successfully conveys how Paris in the 18th century (at least one certain district) smelled really bad, with too realistic scene of its fish market, which is followed by the birth of Jean-Baptiste. His life is destined to be a different one, and the first chapter fully convinces us of his fate.<br /><br />Ben Whishaw plays adult Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his wonderful acting as the (anti-)hero virtually carries the entire film to the last. Typical rags-to-riches drama is given a twist when other characters step in his life. First Jean-Baptiste is apprenticed to Giuseppe Baldini, second-rate perfumer who lost his skills. Dustin Hoffman's fake Italian accent may annoy you, but wait for what happens. Jean-Baptiste creates a "hit" perfume with his superb olfactory sense, making Baldini a rich person, and then ... see it for yourself. The story is not definitely Charles Dickens.<br /><br />Beautiful Rachel Hurd-Wood and Alan Rickman are both memorable as aristocratic father and his only daughter. Tom Tykwer relies much on their acting talent to create the credible relations between them, which is I think still underwritten and not interesting enough. His skills as director are more effective in presenting Jean-Baptiste who can create the perfect scent in the most unique and terrifying fashion.<br /><br />As to its conclusion - don't worry, this is spoiler-free - you will find it either fascinating or just awful. But maybe we shouldn't take the story too seriously for "grenouille" also means "frog" in French. "Perfume" defies easy explanations like real perfumes you smell every day. "Perfume" has that inexplicable quality that makes itself all the more attractive to us.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>How exactly do you make a movie about smells?

Every page of the novel effuses some smell and it literally makes you either savor it or hold your nose in disgust. Suskind's talent in describing different kinds of flavour can't be overestimated, like a real poet he finds words and metaphors that sometimes let you salivate and sometimes bring you very close to throwing up. In my opinion the main challenge of this film from the very beginning of its creation was: will this movie smell like the book does?<br /><br />Many great directors were to make "Perfume..." and many washed their hands for a variety of reasons. Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, Tim Burton and others - all of them were once attached to the project and walked away. Stanley Kubrick nurtured the idea of filming Suskind's novel for a long time but finally concluded "Das Parfum" was UNFILMABLE. And I can understand that - the book based on all kinds of odours is very hard to be put on celluloid. So walking to the theater I was recalling the book's first scene taking place at Paris' fish market couple of centuries back and thinking - will it all smell?<br /><br />And - oh, my God - it did! It smelled and it reeked right from the screen. Certainly the book smelled better (or worse in this case) but those things you do not see but only imagine always hit harder, so I doubt any movie can be better than a book. But in this case actually it wasn't this film's idea - to top the novel, it just had to match it distantly. And it matched indeed. "Perfume..." is no cheap adaptation of another book - it's a piece of art of its own and it deserves some recognition. Tom Tykwer - a young German director whose best-known work to date was "Run, Lola, Run" seemed rather strange candidate to direct this picture at the first glance, but ultimately it turned out to be a wise idea. Tykwer is not afraid to experiment and we've seen it in "Lola". Many of his patterns and tricks from that movie were later used by a number of directors around the world. He is innovative and that's a fact. If you close your eyes and try hard to imagine what Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman or Tim Burton would do with this picture, I bet you'll come up with some idea and I bet it will be right. But what could we expect from Tom Tykwer? Only some surprise.<br /><br />Finally there were no surprise and in "Perfume..." Tykwer didn't invent anything. It was pretty traditional I'd say, but still very professional, magnificent and exciting. Still better than I think any other director would manage it. And what's most important - it SMELLED. It had all the scents and fragrances needed to feel yourself inside this movie. Tykwer didn't do the impossible, but he was very close... And in this case it's a hell of an achievement.<br /><br />Actors deserve a whole separate article, I'll only say Ben Whishaw and everyone else except Dustin Hoffman were awesome and the latter is still playing the role of Bernie Focker as it seems with all my respect :) Although I like THAT role of his a lot I think here he could be a little more serious. On the other hand - don't pay attention to my lamentations - a comic part was never too bad for any movie. So maybe it's just me. Anyway - why 4 stars? 5 would go for the impossible done by the director, but unfortunately I'm positive it was impossible to do so (no pun intended). Hence 4 is the highest rating this picture can get in my opinion and I'm giving it the highest rating possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>I read Suskind's work as an undergraduate ... and its details are still grotesquely etched on my brain. I cannot say that I "liked" the novel, but I was engrossed enough to complete it. Fast-forward a decade ... and the same applies to Tykwer's film-adaptation.<br /><br />Within the first few seconds, I felt a visceral repulsion to the film (as the viewer is expected to). The quick-cuts of the putrid marketplace creates revulsion and distance ... which is why many viewers here expressed a sense of "not caring about the characters" (this is valid). Likewise, Tykwer (true to Suskind) resists romanticizing Paris ... few directors are this straight-forward. The place is revealed as filthy, with a near-tangible stench (this is why we see members of aristocracy holding scented handkerchiefs under their noses). Even the long-shots of the city show stained, unappealing building facades. Who knew an artist could create a visual so fetid that the viewer can actual smell it?! Brilliance.<br /><br />Hoffman is convincing is his role as an aging perfumer. His portrayal of Giuseppe Baldini is as amusing as it is compelling. Likewise, Alan Rickman's "Richis" may be the character with whom the viewer can align her/himself. He is the voice of reason ... all of his "paranoid" obsessions are completely justified ... but no one will listen. His frustration is ours. Still, this is not enough to forge a connection between the film and the viewer. We find ourselves not caring when his beautiful daughter is being hunted for her scent. (And there is an attempt at garnering emotion ... evident in the delicate replacing of the flower on her mother's grave).<br /><br />This is a film with no catharsis (which is fine), but couple that with its dreary setting and vulgar displays, and the film becomes impossible to "like." This does not mean the film fails to intrigue, it simply means that a viewer may walk-away feeling empty. And, perhaps worse, wondering why the film was created at all. And, yes, it is true that Kubrick was intrigued by the text, but found it "unfilmable." I wonder what spurred Tykwer to tackle the text a master found "unfilmable"? One is forced to assume hubris was at work here ... and this gamble was not a (TECHNICALLY) successful one. The budget for this work was a staggering $65,800,000 and was an epic, box-office failure. In fact, I have never before or after read such a vehement review from the much esteemed Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper: "Hated this movie. Hated it" (his literal words). Still, consider the equally (perhaps even more) esteemed Ebert who found it "brave" (to paraphrase). I think it may be JUST that polarizing.<br /><br />My middle-of-the-road review is both an acknowledgment of the film's artistic merits and a recognition of its tendency to evince viewer-apathy (including mine).<br /><br />If you have an interest in seeing Suskind's work on-screen buy this film. If you were a huge fan of "Lola Rennt" (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000021Y77">Run Lola Run</a>) then buy this film. However, if you are entering this work "blind" ... you may wish to rent it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`Perfume' released in '07 is one of the most absorbing, unpredictable, titillating, genre free films I've ever seen. It is a stylish and atmospheric period piece, a taut and perverse psychological thriller, a demented romance, and a dark, edgy comedy all rolled into one very surprising movie. If that weren't enough, it's also a parody, allegory, fable and parable. I guess the bottom line is it leaves the audience with so many unanswered questions and possibilities you can make of it whatever you wish.<br /><br />The movie will simultaneously surprise, disturb, repel and fascinate the viewer as it moves upside down and back again on a dizzying rollercoaster journey through the visceral world of odors and scents that defined 18th century France. This film has it all, mesmerizing cinematography, haunting soundtrack, superior cast and an extremely unique storyline that will keep you wondering where it's all headed until the shocking end. Even if you don't like it, you won't forget it. 'Perfume' is a viewing experience extraordinaire, surely destined to become a cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>Jean Baptiste Grenouille's (Ben Whishaw) birth foreshadowed his future.  His fishmonger mother squirted him out like the four stillborn babes before him.  When she believed him dead, she left him to be tossed with the day's guts.  His cry saved him--and damned his mother to the gallows.<br /><br />From there, the baby went to an orphanage, raised just old enough to be sold as a servant to a tannery.  A trip to town taught him there was more to smell than just dead animal hides.<br /><br />His sense of smell brings him to the attention of once famous perfumier, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who teaches him everything he knows--until his protege tries to cook down the cat to gain its essence.<br /><br />From there, he continues in search of the perfect scent and discovers the best way to obtain a truly divine perfume--which happens to be rendered from the rendered fat of women he killed.<br /><br />"Perfume" details the killer's process of 'discovering' his perfect perfume.  As one might expect, the dehumanization of of Grenouille's own life gave him no concept of any other--animal or human. His progress from animal killer to human serial killer is grisly, shocking, and far too realistic.<br /><br />Cinematography was excellent. Whishaw, Hoffman, and Alan Rickman as Richis, a local nobel desperately seeking the man who killed his daughter, were all convincing. Certain elements of the story were unfortunately somewhat surreal.<br /><br />"Perfume" is a one-time view for me.  The story pushed far too many buttons for me--and frankly was slow enough in more than one place to make me want to stop before the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>There is such a fascination in adapting famous books to the cinema language, for both filmmakers and film-viewers, especially if the book is a famous best seller one. Comparisons will take place, no doubt. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is almost a collective part of a lot of people's memory and wakes curiosity the film itself. So I clearly see that the cinema language is absolutely different than literature language (in all genres)? Anyhow, expectations are served. Jean-Baptiste is someone special since he is born, in the middle of a fish market, where the smelling was everywhere except in him. As he grows, the scents and smelling becomes his path for pleasure, for recognizing, for commitments. In his memories he keeps all kind of scents, even without knowing where they come from, and he tries to bring them back to reality, as perfumes. When he achieves it, he attempts to create his best perfume, moral apart, regardless of the way he does it. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer," is a great manufactured film, no doubt, great scenarios, great cinematography, create custom design. The film, although basically a German production, was filmed in English, not being the first time (perhaps for an international appeal?),<br /><br /> I didn't actually mention 'good editing' among the virtues of "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer."  Some of the most exciting moments of the film, are when some scents call the attention of some characters (the plum girl, Baldini, Dominique, the orgy, etc), and the way the film 'tries' to show us the effect on them is with fast and short cuts, 'a-la-Hollywood', which I am not saying is bad, but it is just too rapid in the visual way, and not as subtle as a scent actually would work. A resource which is over-used lately in a lot of films is the close-up. And I guess that happens when a director finds kind of non-easy to portray a character, so, let us see at least a close-up of the actor. Again, lack of subtlety. So, I wouldn't even praise the achievement in make up in this film, only for showing us closely the noses and faces of some actors. I am not the greatest fan of Tom Tykwer, yet I think he's a good director, but as a stage-director, he may lose some control on his actors, that lead us to see Alan Rickman as a flat character and Dustin Hoffman seem miscast and a bit over the top, even as a silly perfumer, Ben Whishaw is fantastic for creating and developing his own Jean-Baptiste (watch his tics) and it's hard to avoid to see him a bit overacted in some scenes. Jessica Schwartz in her short role is great; she has what is called presence. And the orgy's scene made me laugh for moments; I would rather have felt embarrassed. Another resource which is sometimes unnecessarily used is the voice-off. I am not disappointed with "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer." I was entertained, I enjoyed the experience, but I have to be honest by saying the typical phrase "it could've been better...". And more expectations are served.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>Although I have not read the book that this film was based on, I could not resist watching the movie that includes cast of actors such as Alan Rickman, Dustin Hoffman and some of the most beautiful red haired women (actresses) one has ever seen on the screen.  This is a story about young man who can express himself only thru his sense of smell.  He is deprived in every way except in his ability to experience pleasure in cataloguing smells of the world around him.  Ben Whishaw is fantastic in portraying this character with all his depravity for motherly love, decent upbringing and childhood, desire to survive harsh life at any costs while bringing misfortune to all his encounters along the way - starting with his own mother from the day of his birth, perfume master who teaches him a trade and yound women, whose ethernal essence his tries so desperately to preserve.  Is this story about the man with a special gift, or a story of love that is destructive in all its beauty; is it a story of one's purpose and all the emotional numbness that comes from need to experience love and obtain one's own essence in this world- no matter what the cost?  The character of this movie is so intense, in his own way - he is greater than life itself in spite of the fact that the only way he can express himself is thru creation of the ethernal (love) perfume that disarms all around him.  This poor soul is not seeking riches, or fame, or power -- all he wants is to experience love and beauty he has never had.  He commits the unthinkable for the brief moment to experience such hapiness.  You will carry images from this movie for a long, long time.  Excellent story, talented director and fantastic cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>And again, everyone loves the emperor's clothes and how pretty all the colors are. Dustin Hoffman's career is circling down the drain much in the same manner that Robert De Niro's is, by showing up in films like this that are so utterly undeserving of his talent. If this is esteemed as a work of vision and depth, then the fix is truly in and the moviegoing public has been broken on the wheel of mediocrity- happily ingesting any substandard, contemptible feed Hollywood wishes to slop into the entertainment trough. Just because someone can recreate the streets of Paris or can CGI color a few fruits and hairdos to convey beauty and richness of experience doesn't mean that we should all clap and be awestruck. This movie is meaningless and unbelievable, a mockery of the period piece, the detective thriller, the psychosexual drama, the tortured genius expose, or any other genre it unintentionally parodies.<br /><br />In politics, some say we get the government we deserve. By heaping praise on hollow window dressing like "Perfume", it looks like we will all continue to get the movies we deserve. Giving further life to this box office bomb via rentals or DVD sales is simply irresponsible. I bet the author of the book had to be restrained from going into the lot when this was filming, hoping he could find the screenwriter and sock him(and I say 'him' because I'm having trouble with the idea that an intelligent woman would countenance abetting the creation of such mindless exploitation of the fairer sex) in the jaw.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>Perfume<br /><br />"Perfume" tells the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a Parisian baby born to a rather stupid mother, who, assuming him to be yet another stillbirth, literally tosses him into the gutter. He's hired by a tannery and eventually, when a down-on-his-luck perfume maker Giuseppe Baldini notices his incredible gift for scent, Grenouille sets about achieving greatness in his own peculiar manner.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "Perfume" is that it suffers from the ultimate case of The Emperor's New Nose. There's an imperceptible line of demarcation, much like the two mountain paths recurring in the movie, that divides brilliance from dreck, and sadly, "Perfume" hitches its wagon to the latter path, and follows it through to the bitter end.<br /><br />Performance-wise there's nothing going on we haven't seen before, the nearest thing to honest-to-god acting contained in this movie is Alan Rickman's performance as Antoine Richis, troubled father of the beautiful Laura. Sadly, his part is a very small one (as are all parts of this movie not that of its lead character) and his ridiculously over-the-top speech in the closing minutes of the picture negate any sense of affinity or empathy we might have felt for him. Something about how he's going to seep into Grenouille's pores and come shooting out his nose, or something. I'm not making this up.<br /><br />As troubled teen Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, Ben Whishaw is a total nonstarter: he's sort of a cross between Beaker from the Muppet Show and a comatose Hannibal Lecter. His emotional range doesn't stretch past looking either A. bored, or B. slightly turned-on. But then, the screenplay must assume its fair share of the blame: Whishaw does for the most part what he can with a really turgid script. It seems someone forgot to explain to the director and screenplay writing team that this, in fact, is a talkie.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "Perfume" is the disparity between what the overly-explicit visuals would have you believe, and what the screenplay actually tells us. Smellovision hasn't yet been invented so clearly the production design and the camerawork are designed to make us believe that we can indeed smell the many strong odours of Grenouille's Paris. It's going for a sense of lushness and full-on olfactory assault. The screenplay gives us a monotonous one-note Tale O' Woe, and it's in this glaring contrast that the essence of what could have been a stellar piece of cinema is totally and irretrievably lost. We keep searching for a mental connection with the content to match our optical connection with the visuals, and sadly, this never arrives.<br /><br />Don't bother. "Perfume - Story of a Murderer" isn't worth your while. Check out Hugh O' Connor in "The Young Poisoner's Handbook" for a much more satisfying example of sociopathic teens, or something like "Dangerous Liaisons" or "La Reine Margot" if Ye Olde France is your thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>If I could I would rate this movie less than one.

Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick S&uuml;skind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people.  The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers.  It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice.  The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat.  Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims.  When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.<br /><br />In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching. Grady Harp, August 07</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Mesmermerizing, often perplexing, and surreal, 'Pefume: The Story of a Murderer' is more than a keen study in the sense of smell.  It methodically wraps a story around key players that both transcend and embrace class and sensual experience.  What strikes me throughout this film is how different it is from other movie outings.<br /><br />We start with a French baby who is born in Paris in the greatest of squalor.  His mother abandons him and lives him to rot on the streets.  She is caught and sent to the gallows, but his fate is to be sent to an orphanage where the children almost make a second attempt at the death penalty.  He's Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), and he soon discovers coming of age that he is different.  Not only is he a pariah, but he harbors a strong sense of smell that is only associated with animals.  It becomes clear that not only does it become his main sensory operandi to detect things and people, but, it is his last piece of dignity, so he lives his whole life wanting to preserve every smell he comes across on the planet.  Director Tom Tykwer makes every image stand out, so we can see, hear, and, well, almost smell, everything Jean-Baptiste does.  I felt my mind's filing cabinet filling in the blanks.  What they don't provide, we easily fill in the gaps, but what they do provide is an especially sensual visual and listening experience.  Much of 'Perfume...' is exquisite.  So if it is smell, like himself, he wishes to preserve, his highest pursuit will be for "the scent of a woman".  He can't rise above that in 18th century France until he comes upon a famed Italian perfumer living in Paris, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman).  Delivering hides from a tannery not known for health benefits, Jean-Baptiste begs Baldini for a chance to work for him.  Here he can work on extra-curricular projects that will attempt to satisfy his olfactory palette for preserving every scent.  It's a tempestuous relationship at times, but it is Jean's portal to encountering wealthy women who wear the scents, like the one's Guiseppe is perveyor for.  In a tragic scene Jean-Baptiste encounters a woman, and, frightening her, he restrains her, so she won't cry out.  He is overly zealous and kills her inadvertently.<br /><br />After that the lingering fragrance of the movie is to trace and bottle the scent of a woman.  There's a scene where a red-haired woman is cutting apricots in two.  It is hallmark.  I was expecting an overflow of sexuality, but what I got was sensuality that was effective like few films are.  The rest of the movie takes many turns; many of which I didn't expect.  I am still pondering the repurcussions of this film.  The only film I can think of that remotely reminds me of 'Perfume' is 'Chocolat'.  It is an odd and unique bird.  While I am satisfied with the lingering effects of 'Perfume,' it isn't all neat and tidy.  Perhaps that's what makes it so rare and special...The film I mean.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>an ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT movie ~ Ben Wishaw as our hapless hero[?] reminds strongly of Tony Perkins and Tom Courtnay, but what a delightful and subtle performance!

At odds in the world, he acquires an unusual gift, the gift of smell, and not just any gift...one of extraordinary and unique talent. Unable or unwilling to speak, Jean-Louis Baptist prefers to use his sense of smell to define his environment, to define the world as he knows and understands it. To him words are too primitive and restricting to communicate what he sees, hears, or wants to say.<br />  Sold twice over, what seems like a dismal existence to work in a tannery he one day discovers a smell so profound, so intoxicating and so beautiful he is forever changed and is obsessed with obtaining its essence. He finds himself in an apprenticeship as a perfumist where he learns the art and skill of obtaining the essence of smell, but it still is not enough. That unique smell that he discovered from a woman has him so self obsessed; he stops at nothing to obtain it. Through trial and error he constantly experiments to find a way until one day he does with a prostitute.<br />From there he goes on a killing spree, as a 19th. Century serial murder in order to obtain the essence of smell from the most beautiful and purest of women to create the most perfect perfume the world has ever known. At long last he is caught and stands to be executed upon the eve that he will unveil his creation. A perfume extracted from 12 young women that is so perfect, so intoxicating, he can bend the will of mankind with it. He is found to be not guilty and deemed, "an Angel" and released. In the end he chooses his own fate and demise, and the secret of his perfect perfume dies with him.<br /> I found this film to be extremely well done. Excellently written and adapted from the novel, a great cast (both Allan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are great to see onscreen). I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to nearly the end. I found the end to be a slight let down, and a bit of a "cop out".<br /> I didn't care much for the town orgy scene. I know that both the novelist and the director were trying to create a scene that was very poetic/artsy, even surreal, but it didn't really do it for me. Perhaps I would need to see it again to see if there is something I missed? The end, well...I was a little disappointed with the end also. Far too easy of an ending, as if the novelist or director got "lazy" and "just wanted to finish". Still, it was a great story, I really did enjoy it. Even the narration through about half the film, it tied things together and you were able to see things from Jean Baptist's perspective. Well worth watching, I highly recommend it and you will not be disappointed. See it yourself to believe it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Even after reading the book, Perfume is the kind of a movie that can still shock and send chills down the spine. The story of a man born with no scent of his own but on a constant hunt for something that he can capture and anoint with to fit in is magnetic. I have never heard of a more interesting take on the world of scent mixed in with murder.<br /><br />Ben Whishaw  as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was enigmatic, quiet, spooky, passionate and evil. I traveled though a flurry of emotions for him and his victims, knowing that his quest was very interesting yet it left a trail of despair and broken hearts of those who lost their loved ones. Death in the name of beauty if not a new phenomenon but it certainly is twisted when someone else has to pay the price. Alan Rickman, who also  plays Snape in Harry Potter movies, brings his uniqueness into the tale. The timber of his voice fits perfectly with the whole ethereal feel of the movie. His ruby haired daughter played by Rachel Hurd-Wood is Laura, the final ingredient on Grenouille's list to a heavenly scent.<br /><br />18th century France comes alive in this fantastic movie. I have never seen so much filth, dirt and grease in any costume movie but it was all worth it, and I swear my senses of smell were heightened for hours after watching it. The extremely long list of makeup artists at the end credits confirmed my suspicion that this was done with meticulous care to breath more life into the story.  The soundtrack is marvelous, the scenery breathtaking and everything simply tingles with richness. This movie is enigmatic, there's not question about it but I enjoyed the subtlety and the shocks it caused, unless you jump and sweat what good was wasting all that time watching TV?<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Of all the movies about deranged killers, this is probably the most intriguing one yet produced.  Set in post-Napoleanic France, the story follows the tragic life of a man, Jean, from birth to death, and how his scent of smell leads him to do ghoulish deeds.  You see, Jean has the world's most acute sense of smell, both in terms of sensitiveness, and ability to distinguish two smells that are almost identical.  Growing up in an orphanage, his ability sets him apart from the others.  He finally escapes and discovers the smell of women; specifically attractive virgin women.  This sets him on his goal of creating the perfect perfume, one made out of the scent of virgin women.<br /><br />How does one classify this movie?  It has scenes of suspense, but these are few and far between.  There is comedy, but it is black comedy that is grim.  There is murder, but no blood or gore of any sort.  And there are numerous scenes of attractive, naked women; but our protagonist only rubs their smells from their bodies without ever taking advantage of them.  It is best classified as a drama; one meant for adults only.  The story is very original, probably the most original story of any film released in 2006, even though it is based on a book.  The two main supporting actors are the only famous names in the cast; Alan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman.  Everyone else, including the numerous beautiful women are Hollywood unknowns.  All in all, a good movie to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is one of those films that begins pretty much at the start of the end.  Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is beaten and dragged from his prison cell to hear the sentence of the court, which seems to have a viciousness usually reserved for regicides.  This beginning makes it clear that the murderer whose story this is will be caught.  Such a statement is true, but it is also inaccurate when it comes to capturing the nature of this 2006 film directed by Tom Tykwer ("<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKN2">Heaven</a>") based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725849">novel</a> by Patrick S&uuml;skind.  Ultimately, I found myself thinking that this story is a fable.<br /><br />The history of perfume begins in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, with the name of a perfume maker appearing on a second millennium cuneiform tablet.  In the 18th century France became the center of the European perfume trade when aromatic plants grown in the Grasse region provided the raw materials for the flourishing industry.  However, S&uuml;skind's novel finds the motivation for perfume in the muck and mire that was the streets of Paris three centuries ago and even without the use of scratch-and-sniff stickers Tykwer's movie gives a sense that the city is one giant cesspool where perfumes are a necessary way of covering the smells.  Grenouille is literally born in the muck and manages to survive, growing up to evince two remarkable traits: Not only does he posses the most acute sense of smell on the planet but also has absolutely no scent of his own.<br /><br />Grenouille's unique talent leads to a peculiar obsession when he encounters two people.  One is a girl (Karoline Herfurth) who sells plums on those streets of Paris and the other is Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a master perfumer who has fallen out of favor and now resorts to trying to copy the successful perfumes of his competitors.  Grenouille wants to preserve the smell of the plum girl and it is in the service of that obsession that he becomes a murderer.  Baldini agrees to mentor the young tanner in exchange for marvelous new perfumes, but the old master does not have the secret that drives Grenouille and in parting Baldini tells the young man to head to Grasse, the center of the world for the art of perfuming.  However, once there what catches Grenouille's attention are not the plants of the region but the young women of Grasse, especially the beautiful Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood), daughter of Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman), a wealthy and well-respected citizen of the town.<br /><br />John Hurt's narration is a major part of the film since Grenouille is a man of very few words who spends most of his time sniffing the air and inhaling deeply the scents that catch his attention.  The narration is also needed to ensure the audience catches the attendant ironies of the story's conclusion.  It is Hurt's tone as much as his words that confirm my idea that this story is a fable.  Except for the layers of irony at the end I might be tempted to call "Perfume" a parable, but the uniqueness of both Grenouille's character and his story are such that it cannot be extrapolated to the audience in any meaningful way.  There is no catharsis to be found here and none is intended, but "Perfume" is very much in the tradition of the tragic heroes of ancient Greece where the Fates often dictated an ironic demise.  As such, it will not be to everybody's taste, but then that is not the primary sense at play in this partiucular tale.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>Orphan, Jean Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) develops a special olfactory sense. After working in a tannery, he discovers the city and meets a girl that inebriates his senses. He then realizes that he has a destiny. He soon meets perfume-maker Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) and will reproduce perfumes for him. However, his work will take a dark turn as his search deepens for the ultimate scent.<br /><br />While the book is very vivid and calls for the reader's imagination regarding the smells, and accurately describes the olfactory senses and odors one might encounter, the film obviously lacks this reproduction. (It *is* difficult to transfer odor on film! so this was to be expected.) Also, the book was more shocking than the movie probably because of the strong description of smells, and violent details.<br /><br />That said, the film is nevertheless watchable, despite Hoffman's terrible overacting interpretation. Whishaw is a good casting choice as Grenouille, he is well directed and is not too much a "pretty boy" for the part.<br /><br />The costumes, the period details, the images, the music - they do help in experiencing atmosphere, but it still rather limited because of the lack of correct interpretation or transcription of smells to the screen.<br /><br />Worth watching once. For the sheer beauty of the photography work.<br /><br />NOTE: I still recommend reading the book, whether before or after the film that is your choice. But read the book. A totally different experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>I could almost smell everything portrayed in the film from the nasty fish market to the stones, metal and rocks. Each image made me conjure in my mind the smell. What a completely original film. The main character made me feel sympathy and hate him at the same time. Rickman was outstanding portraying the feelings of a protective father demonstrating a love for his daughter that was painful to watch because he is so worried about what will happen to her. He did a wonderful job capturing the protectiveness, vulnerability, and strength of a loving father. The main actor, playing Henri, was outstanding.<br />I was surprised to see Dustin Hoffman as the italian perfumer. His accent was really bad and he kept pulling me out of the movie to Dustin Hoffman the way he'd go in and out of accent. His voice was distracting. Other than that he was good portraying the has-been perfumer, silly and desperate at the same time.<br />What a beautiful unique bit of film art. Not enough artistry is scene in film today, it's mostly about making millions of megabucks. But this movie was something that had you riveted from the opening scene in the fish market. Weird, but so well done, appreciated for its weirdness.  There was so much visual beauty. It had me wondering whose scent Henri loved the most, which girl, was it that first with the fruits?! Cool film. Also recommended: Black Snake Moan - another well-done film which can be appreciated for its artistry, acting, music, etc.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>When I saw Perfume, I figured it to be another B-movie that might occupy some time. What I found in that movie's place was another movie, a more interesting one with an interesting cruel side, and that was really worth a watch. We start with a man hat claims he can identify any smell in the world and that he wants to own them all. To do this he has plans; some of his plans seem not-so-bad at first but then they take on a darker shade. And that's where the fun begins and an interesting story starts playing out.<br /><br />One of the main reasons this movie was so successful was the ability of our lead character to seem so many things at once. Sometimes you cold taste the menace that swirled around and sometimes you could see other pieces of persona swimming around in his tangled expressions. The life he gave tot the role was amazing because of this - I expected few things going in to the movie but I really didn't expect someone to so brazenly steal the spotlight.<br />He was perfect.<br />The support cast was really god as well, and all these efforts combined helped build a rather interesting storyline that I would have missed if it had not been for a suggestion on rentals.<br /><br />If you want a diversion that is out-of-the-ordinary and like the way the plot to the movie goes, then this might be a pick for you. I enjoyed it but, at the same time, I was looking for a B-movie to fill in my watching void and was happy that it was superbly better than "B." Still, it comes with a "worth watching" if you like your story with a little darkside attached to it underpinning.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>I have to confess, I was hesitant to watch this movie. I read the novel, which is magnificent, and I had a tough time imagining how somebody could reflect Suskind's masterpiece on the screen, and make it justice. I am really glad I decided to go ahead and give it a try, since this is one of the best adaptations I have seen in my life, up to par with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATQJ">The Shining</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225857">To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)</a>. The way in which the director, Tom Tykwer, used the camera to convey a world of olfactory sensations was simply brilliant.<br /><br />This is the story of the abominable Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, who was born in 1738 in a putrid fish market and who had to fight for his survival right from the start. Rejected by his mother, who left him to die, he ends up in an orphanage where he has to endure abuse from his peers. When he is old enough he is sold as a slave to a tannery, but his willpower kept him afloat. That was not his only strength though, since Grenouille had a marvelous gift: his supernatural sense of smell.<br /><br />While working at the tannery he discovers a couple of things that will change his life: a perfume shop, and even more relevant, a woman with a magnificent scent. The latter generates an urge that has to be satisfied, so Jean-Baptiste follows the girl and ends up smothering and killing her. The problem is that after death the scent disappears. So now he has to find a way to preserve the object of his obsession, and his journey begins with the perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). Baldini has had his era of glory but he has been eclipsed by the brilliance of his competitor Pelissier. Grenouille and his unnatural ability seem to be the answer to all his prayers, or maybe not.<br /><br />Part of the reason why the adaptation of this novel works so well is the amazing performance of Ben Whishaw, who convincingly portrays the perturbed and immoral Grenouille. Whishaw is able to give this character a combination of obsession with his quest and nonchalance regarding the actions needed to achieve his goals. These are the things that make the main character of this story so complex and mesmerizing in the book. The supporting cast does not lag far behind, with a Dustin Hoffman that plays his role accurately and efficiently, and a Alan Rickman that infuses his character with the necessary emotion and desperation to make it believable. I recommend this movie without reservations, and if you have not read the book I urge you to do that too, since both experiences are highly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Wow, this is really a bizarre story with an ending that probably will turn off 98 percent of viewers who stick with this two hours, 147-minute film. I'm not sure what to make of it, other than totally understanding if people are left unsatisfied after watching this movie. As I said, I'm not sure how to interpret it as I just finished it minutes ago. It leaves you almost stunned.<br /><br />Rather than judging that finale or divulging it, let me just comment on the first two hours of the film, which I found utterly fascinating. If I wasn't such an admirer of photography, art and special-effects, I doubt I would have found the movie so appealing because the story is "not for everyone." However, thanks to stunning French city and countryside scenery, 18th century period and beautiful women it enhanced the story to me. Yet, regardless of the visual treats, the story was so unusual it still would have held my attention.<br /><br />Ben Wishaw, who plays the lead character "Jean-Baptist Grenouille, has a face that is perfect for this role. His emaciated body, which survived a brutal childhood existence from the moment he was born also makes his character all the more credible. The looks of shock and awe on this man's face throughout the picture also add to his believability. He was mesmerizing with his haunting expressions. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide "name" actors the film but it's Wishaw's movie, all the way.<br /><br />I can only recommend this movie to those who share similar interests in cinematography and who like a "different" story but there are so many things in here - especially the ending - that could offend so many people, I would be hesitant to recommend this to the general viewer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Try as I might I could not think of a non punning title for this review but at least I stayed away from "Scent of a Woman." With that said I feel that Tom Tykwer has done an admirable job in bringing Patrick Suskind's unfilmable (to use Kubrick's words) novel to the screen.<br /><br />The film follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), an outcast with an incredible sense of smell throught 18th Century Paris. Grenouille uses his gift in order to find recognition and possibly even love and acceptance from those around him. Unfortunately he does it in the wrong way, he becomes a serial killer obsessed with making the perfect perfume. This perfume being created from the distilled essence of virgins.<br /><br />Along the way he is apprenticed to master perfumer Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman)who teaches him his craft and starts Grenouille on his macabre journey. There is also some fine acting on display from Alan Rickman as Richis the father of Grenouille's final victim.<br /><br />This is a film that relies heavily on its production design (Uli Hanisch) and its cinematography (Franke Griebe) in order to make the viewer feel and smell the sights and sounds of a filthy urban sprawl that was 18th century Paris. The novel was deemed unfilmable because it was thought that no film could capture this feel. Tykwer did a very good job even if the film is a little overlong for its own good. While the plot may not stand up to close scrutiny it does provide an interesting few hours in the dark. Many have commented on the strange ending but I feel that the ending helps the film reach its ultimate resolution. All said maybe the recognition that we seek is not what is in our best interests after all.<br /><br />This is a provacative and intelligent horror film that many missed on its theatrical release. Give it a try. You may be glad you did for the acting and design alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>A meritorious overall design and an intriguing beginning are promptly buried by exceptionally unconventional twists and a laughably bizarre conclusion in Tom Tykwer's Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. With undertones of Silence of the Lambs, and a beautifully haunting score, we're unfortunately forced to root for Buffalo Bill. Based on the perceivably unfilmable bestselling novel by Patrick Suskind, the world of scents and smell appear visually delightful; however it fails to be wholly entertaining.<br /><br />In 18th century France, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born to a nauseating fishmonger who promptly disposes of him in a pile of rotting fish carcasses and writhing maggots. She earns the noose for her troubles, and Grenouille is sent to grow up in the orphanage where he discovers his astounding ability to discern every kind of smell. He is sold to a vile tanner, and during a fortunate delivery happens upon Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), a d&eacute;class&eacute; perfumer who quickly buys Grenouille when he discovers his skills for deciphering the ingredients used in a rival's perfume. When a chance encounter with a young girl leads him to obsess over the unobtainable scent of womanhood, he ignites a killing spree of several women in the city of Grasse, using their bodies to create the elusive aroma. Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) must protect his daughter, the most enticing woman in Grasse, whom he knows might be the final ingredient in Grenouille's relentless and unimaginable plan.<br /><br />Newcomer Ben Wishaw plays Grenouille with morbid yet enticing fervor, leading the viewer to anxiously wait for his next psychotic endeavor. Hoffman and Rickman also lend their acting expertise; Hoffman mainly for comic relief, and Rickman for much needed, stern normalcy. And normalcy is what Perfume so desperately lacked, as the twisted events abruptly spiraled to an unfathomable conclusion. So many pieces worked in favor of the film, but nothing could save it from its intangible plot. We follow the works of Grenouille much in the same way we root for the insidious Hannibal Lector, except that Perfume is unquestionably devoid of any Clarice Starling characters to which we can justifiably relate. As much as the film is visually stunning, the eccentricity is so overwhelming that by the unpredictable and sadly laughable conclusion, we're left with nothing to dwell on but those very atrocities. Culminating with a surprising display of sexual deviance, the magnificence and allure of the characters and settings are disbanded, resulting in disbelief and confusion. Crossing those boundaries of believability, even in a predominantly fantasy environment, and then subjecting audiences to little sense of retribution, leaves much to be desired from such an engrossing start. Curiously reminiscent of David Lynch, Shinya Tsukamoto and Alejandro Jodorowsky, director Tom Tykwer achieves few of their often satisfyingly macabre concoctions.<br /><br />Perhaps the only truly redeeming aspect of the film is the captivating score with a recurring melodic theme that permeates the oftentimes grisly look of the filthy cities portrayed. The major settings, first Paris where Jean-Baptiste is born, and then Grasse where he journeys to discover the secrets of preserving scents, are brilliantly recreated in all their dismal glory. Elaborate costumes and striking imagery are lavishly produced, and the abundance of highly aromatic items nearly burst from the screen.<br /><br />Fans of particularly deranged cinema might find this interesting fantasy palatable, but the majority of moviegoers will probably be paled by Perfume's deficient denouement and its lengthy two-and-a-half hour duration.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Perfume-The Story of a Murderer brings to the screen the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a young man with an unprecedented sense of smell, which allows him to do extraordinary feats such as break down the contents of a perfume simply by one whiff.  Things take a turn to the darker side when he decides to create the perfect perfume made of the scent of young women...<br />The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of conditions in 18th Century pre-revolutionary France.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his life dream of creating the perfect perfume, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), conditions leading to the French Revolution (1789).<br />The movie portrays superbly life in France, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.<br />We get a feel for the power and influence that the Catholic Church exerts during this time.<br />The film is also excellent in showing the Ancien Regime's methods of execution (Hanging and "The Cross") as opposed to the "revolutionary" guillotine used after 1789.<br />Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.

It was absolutely amazing that the filmmakers managed to immerse us in such a rich and varied realm: we're incapable of actually smelling the images as they appear on the screen. Nonetheless, we're able to understand what we're being asked to experience along with the main character, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), who was born with an inhumanly strong sense of smell. As he wanders the streets of eighteenth-century France, his nose acts like a filing cabinet, collecting countless numbers of odors and storing them in his memory. Everything emitting a scent is shown to us through some clever camera angles, most of which are extreme close-ups of objects and bodies moving in slow motion.<br /><br />This first-hand look into Grenouille's world made for quite a unique experience, especially since we're being asked to address a sense that's quite useless for film watching. But his obsessive and ultimately murderous drive to capture the perfect scent enables us to transcend that handicap; even if we can't smell what he smells, various shots enable us to understand that he finds the scents of the world intoxicating. We also gain understanding with the help of John Hurt, the film's narrator. He's quite an important character, considering Grenouille is a young man of very few words. According to some background information, he didn't learn to speak for many years. He was unceremoniously born underneath a foul-smelling fish cart in Paris, the fifth child of a woman whose previous four children were stillborn.<br /><br />After she's arrested and executed for willful neglect, the infant is sent to an orphanage, and there he remains throughout his entire childhood. It's established almost immediately how unnerved the other children are around the now named Grenouille; he cannot speak, yet he develops a peculiar sense of smell, one that makes him perceptive to everyone around him. This marks the first in a series of plot devices that almost come off as supernatural, a quality that, if not viewed in the right frame of mind, may come off as completely ridiculous. There are a number of moments in this film that require suspension of disbelief. This is especially true of the final major sequence, in which a spur of the moment orgy takes place in the town square.<br /><br />This isn't to say that they detract from the effectiveness of the story. If anything, they enhance it. Keep in mind that Grenouille is a unique individual; not only is his sense of smell incredibly powerful, he also has no scent of his own. He doesn't learn this until he's older, at which point he's already been sold as cheap labor to a tannery owner.<br /><br />But this is when things take a much darker turn, and they only get darker as the film progresses. After years of remaining behind the confining walls of the tannery, Grenouille is finally asked to assist in making deliveries. At last, he has the chance to take in the various odors of the city, all of which he has yet to distinguish as bad or good. Then he gets a whiff of a young girl selling yellow plums, and the seduction is complete. He's not interested in buying any of her fruit; he only wants to bask in her heavenly aroma. Unfortunately, restraining her and choking her to death brings him no closer to capturing her scent. He then understands his purpose in life; he shall find the world's most enticing smells, collect them, and make them into a one-of-a-kind perfume.<br /><br />And as luck would have it, he makes a delivery to Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), an Italian perfumer. At one time, he was well respected and his shop was always full of customers. Now it seems as if he's past his prime, his attempts at creating the next great perfume being thwarted by rival businesses. But then he meets Grenouille, whose powerful nose allows him to pick out exactly the right scents and mix them in exactly the right amounts. Finally, he's found someone who can put him back in business. In becoming an amateur perfumer, Grenouille hopes to learn the fine art of capturing scents.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Baldini is only familiar with one capturing method: distilling various flora and fauna by boiling them in water. Grenouille's pursuits are far too grand for this method, and it shows through his unsuccessful attempts at distilling the essences of glass, various metals, and Baldini's cat (supposedly for the sake of experimentation). His only other option is a method used in Grasse, a city known for producing the highest quality perfumes: it involves animal fat, which can easily absorb scents. After the fat has been slathered onto flower petals, it is then scraped away, mixed with alcohol, and distilled into concentrated oil. Grenouille immediately leaves for Grasse, knowing that this method will serve his purpose.<br /><br />At this point, his obsession turns deadly; he kills a number of young girls, capturing their scents by slathering their naked bodies with animal fat, scraping it off, and boiling it with alcohol. I remember how uncomfortable I felt watching the fat sizzling in glass beakers; we're essentially witnessing a madman bottling youth, beauty, and innocence, all of which were previously impossible to collect. The very thought of someone being both skilled and heartless is not exactly pleasant, especially since he needs one more victim to perfect his perfume. Here enters Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), a young virgin who lives with her loving father, Antoine (Alan Rickman). Capturing her scent won't be so easy; Grenouille's murder spree has definitely gotten the city's attention.<br /><br />Such a fascinatingly dark story was enough to get my attention, as well; despite disturbing visuals and heavy-handed subject matter, "Perfume" is not easily dismissible. I watched it with grim focus, and I found myself waiting impatiently for the next turn of events. I don't know if I'm helping the film or hurting it by saying that they lead to a particularly odd ending; while I consider it appropriate, some my find it nonsensical and in poor taste. But you have to keep in mind that a supernatural story is being told. It may not seem that way at first; initial appearances make it seem like a straightforward period piece. But as soon as the infant Grenouille inhales the scent of an orphan boy's index finger, it becomes obvious that extraordinary things will happen. A lot of credit has to be given to such a film, especially one in which the everyday sense of smell is successfully woven into the narrative fabric.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>How exactly do you make a movie about smells? After all, a movie is all about sight and sound. Touch, taste and smell rarely come into it.<br /><br />But acclaimed German director Tom Tykwer manages to make us smell things, in his most disturbing movie to date, "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer." This time around, the talented Tykwer abandons his usual lovers-against-the-world stories for a lushly-filmed, darkly comic story of olfactory obsession. Yes, that is what I said.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouillle (Ben Whishaw) is a man with a brilliant sense of smell, and zero body odor. He was born in a putrid fishmarket, raised in an orphanage, and later escapes from a tannery where he was working. He's enraptured by the many thrilling smells in the city -- he even kills a young girl, so that he can smell her lovely scent.<br /><br />In his search for the perfect scent, Jean-Baptiste gets a job with a once-famed perfume-maker (Dustin Hoffman). But after learning that not everything has a scent, he begins killing women to try to distill their scents into the ultimate perfume -- with beautiful redhead Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) as the "thirteenth scent." But his ultimate scent has an even more sinister side, as his scents begin to affect the population in unusual ways.<br /><br />"Perfume" is Tykwer's most unique movie to date, and the one that definitely identifies him as a cinematic master. There are lots of music that are evocative, sensual, colourfully beautiful, or unspeakably creepy, but not many manage to be all of them. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is all of those, and more.<br /><br />Obviously a movie doesn't smell like anything, except maybe stale popcorn. So Tykwer uses sight for smell -- rotted fish, maggots, moldy walls from the late 1700s to show Jean-Baptiste's miserable origins. And he uses sparkling colour and windblown trees for nicer scents. Colour takes the place of scent itself -- bright red Lola hair on multiple girls, flowers that seem to pop out of the screen, fresh leaves, brilliant fruits, even brightly coloured food. It gives the visuals a fairy-tale vibrancy.<br /><br />In fact, the scripting almost comes second to the exquisite cinematography. Yet Tykwer is able to bring across the powerful symbolism that brings the movie to life -- the smells are symbolic of love itself, which the scentless and amoral Jean-Baptiste does not have. He can only try to take it from others, with a finale that is the very image of poetic justice.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste himself is one of those love/hate characters, and Whishaw does an excellent job with his sort of half-crazy, intent stare. And there are some great supporting performances by Alan Rickman as Antoine Richis (Laura's dad) and Hoffman as the eccentric old perfume-maker -- he adds a welcome note of comedy.<br /><br />A movie is dependent on sight, but Tom Tykwer creates a movie that you can almost smell. "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" is darkly comic, bizarrely beautiful movie, and definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>The year is 1766, and Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is born amid the filth of a Paris slum with an unusually well-developed sense of smell.  He grows up in an orphanage, never knowing a kind word or deed, perceiving and relating to his harsh life only through smell.  When as a teen, he sees a beautiful young woman for the first time, he becomes obsessed with capturing her essence in a perfume, but to do this, he must kill her.  She is but the first of many young women who will be used to create a scent of perfect beauty, innocence, and even love.<br /><br />In the beginning, the ugliness and brutality of slum life were so realistic I often had to look away.  In contrast, the second half is set in a beautiful countryside amid luxurious surroundings.  The photography and set designs are excellent as are the period costumes.  Whishaw gives an intense performance as the asocial, amoral anti-hero, an unlikable but fascinating character.  Dustin Hoffman is miscast as an Italian perfume maker.  His American accent and deadpan delivery are laughable and out of place.  Alan Rickman is very good in the small role of a nobleman.<br /><br />The story of a serial killer's desire to capture unattainable essences is engrossing, with final scenes involving 750 naked extras that are quite bizarre.

Tykwer uses a series of authentic looking historical sets and impressive cinematographic close ups and zooms to depict Europe's largest city in the 1700's, Paris.  He uses his camera to convey the sense of aroma in the squalid, unhygienic metropolis which is essential to the plot.<br /><br />Born into the lowest rungs of society and immediately abandoned by his uncaring mother Jean Baptiste Grenouille, the anti-hero of "Perfume", must overcome long odds to survive the pitiful life of an orphan.  The grown up Grenouille played admirably by Ben Whishaw from the onset of life had been endowed with the most highly developed sense of olfaction.  He gets a chance to prove and enhance his gift under the tutelage of once renowned Parisian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini played by a heavily made up Dustin Hoffman.<br /><br />Obsessed with the art of perfuming, Grenouille at the insistence of Baldini treks to the city of Grasse to add to his skills.  A dark side of his personality reveals itself as he maniacally attempts to capture the ultimate scent.  He begins murdering attractive young women, and using the art of effluence uses their hair and bodily oils and scents to create a fragrance from each unfortunate victim.  His murderous actions cause a panic in the town and across the countryside.  Local beauty Laura played by Rachel Hurd-Wood and sheltered by her father played by Alan Rickman becomes Grenouille's ultimate target as the final ingredient in his perfect concoction.<br /><br />The finale was a bit of a stretch but overall the film which was a box office failure, was totally engrossing as the mellifluous tones of narrator John Hurt and the wonderful sets and costumes guide us through a satisfying viewing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer" (2006) is directed by Tom Tykwer (Lola rennt (1998), Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (2000), and Heaven (2002)) and based on the bestselling novel by Patrick Susskind which is one of the most amazing debuts in the world literature. The novel was written in 1985 and has been translated into 45 languages, so far selling more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it the most successful novel of post-war German literature. Having been known as un-filmable, the novel presented the ultimate challenge for any director who would decide to adapt it the screen. How is it possible to transfer to the screen the myriads of odors that practically crawl and jump from every sentence of each page to envelop and to overwhelm the readers?...<br /><br />"Perfume" tells the story of Jean-Baptist Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) a young man, who was born in Paris fish market in 1738 and was not supposed to live at all just like his four siblings that had been killed by their mother minutes after they were born but who survived and brought to the world with him double curse of not having any smell of his own and to be able to recognize, memorize, and later to capture every odor existed (or was that a blessing?). He grew up to become obsessed by the idea of creating the perfect perfume, the one that would capture the fragrance of love, devotion, and desire. To create the perfume like that, he would need the ingredients that could only be obtained by capturing essence of the unique scent, an indelible part of the young, beautiful, and innocent women that effortlessly evoke love, admiration, tenderness, and desire in everyone who'd approach them. Not even a human being but rather a creature for whom there is no word to describe, the monster with the divine sense of smile, the depository of myriads of odors, the evil genius obsessed by the perfection and beauty that he never was able to approach and to possess, Jean-Baptist Grenouille would stop to nothing to reach his terrifying and fascinating goal.<br /><br />I believe that Tom Tykwer made an astounding film that is perfect with the exception of a short scene few minutes before the film was over. Tykwer decided to make his anti-hero sympathetic - just for a couple of minutes and it was a wrong decision that goes against the character's logic, against everything we've learned about Jean-Baptist Grenouille. Other than that, I found the movie outstanding in all departments. It is the true Ode to Olfaction where the sense of smell was presented by the incredible, fantastic images combined with the music written by director himself and adding marvelously to the strange, dark, disturbing, and sensual world of mystery, murders, beauty, and obsession. The film director recreated the 18th century France beautifully by shooting the Paris scenes in Barcelona, Spain, and the ones that take place in Grasse, the capital of French perfumers, in Figueres, Spain, the city of Salvador Dali. Just like the novel, the film presents rather pessimistic and un-flattering outlook at the mankind and in this regard, the final two scenes are absolutely brilliant in their morbid irony.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>The long slo-mos and wide shots are not always necessary.  But it is a fascinating, disturbing and certainly original story.  You can practically detect the scents as the murderer learns the art of perfume-making from a master, and as the former breathes in the fragrance of the young women he ends up killing in a desire to capture their unique scents forever.<br />  I don't think I would have cast Hoffman in the role of Baldini--his accent was too slippery and he didn't look quite right in the role.  But the others fared far better.<br />I am now curious to read the novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>HEY! YOU DON'T SAY A REVIEW ISN'T HELPFUL BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE OPINION EXPRESSED! GET A LIFE!<br /><br />i saw "Run Lola Run" a long time ago but remember it being a very engaging and memorable film. I've seen ads for Perfume over a year and finally got around to seeing it and i have to say, i'm glad i did. This film is completely original and very engrossing. i thought the acting was exceptional and the psychology of the characters very deep and captivating. The cinematography was great as well, it created a very alluring atmosphere. I thought the concept and motivation for the killing was brilliant and i was completely moved by the film. i learned a lot about the art of creating perfume as well. I thought the ending was extraordinary and very original. i really didn't see that coming. this film is highly entertaining, intriguing and captivating. A very original story...</p></br><a href="../users/A153NZD2WZN5S3.html">A153NZD2WZN5S3</a><br/><p>Unwanted hatred offspring was born in a rubbish disposary and abandoned even before a first breath.<br /><br />Hatred and humiliated by all a growing man had been surrounded by, he developed an indefinite urge for tender and love on a very personal simply biological level not nurtured even with a shadow of community-bounded restrictions a middle-ages society imposed on then living.<br /><br />Short of education, his obsession and a craft only is making perfumes, based on his very natural superficial capabilities of memorizing the smells and imagine pure physical outcomes from the mixtures of chemicals. By a such extraordinary way he assumes people around and his rather investigatory-out-of-this-world imagination stipulates him pursuing females of whom necessary component extractions had been released.<br /><br />Knowing no boundaries in his unstoppable quest for these rather witchery activities, a young man not only converted his execution in a mass orgy but made himself an object of an indefinite sexual attraction, which act had ended his human existence.<br /><br />Although this movie might for instance be lined up with "Interview with Vampire", "The Queen of Damned " and, to some extend, "The Brothers Grimm", its deep philosophical meaning could hardly gratify a broad majority of cinema-goers.<br /><br />Personally, I would return to this brilliant work in some time later.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>The film, "Perfume", directed and cowriten by German director, Tom Tykwer, is based on a novel I read shortly after it was published in 1985. I recall then thinking that is was an odd story, which seemed to have few cinematic virtues. This movie tends to confirm my point.<br /><br />The first thing which strikes me is that the dialogue is thin as a weak broth, made from old bones. I find myself in disagreement with several professional critics when I say that the most enjoyable scenes in the film are those with Dustin Hoffman as the old Parisian perfumer, Baldini. Those scenes have at least some reasonable amount of exposition by a character rather than the clinical voice of John Hurt who does the narration, an unseen voice. Some critics complained about Hoffman's over the top acting, a bit too "kitch". Well, maybe it was, but it seemed to be one of the few traces of real life, however "overdone."<br /><br />My strongest memory from the novel was the discovery that the main character, the infant who was to be given the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by relatively unknown actor Ben Whishaw, had no smell whatsoever. This comes very early in the novel, setting the scene for what is to motivate the principle character throughout the story. This revelation does not come out in the film until about 2/5 of the way through it, leaving us with no strong explanation for why Grenouille is so entranced by the smell of the young apricot seller (the Wikipedia plot summary says plums. They look far more like apricots to me.)<br /><br />The unique absence of all sent from the child is replaced in the film by its beginning with a scene where Grenouille is sentenced to a horrible execution. Most of the remainder of the film is a flashback about his life leading up to that scene, which plays out in a manner which should confirm (if nothing up to that point does not drive home this point) that the story is a fantasy. But it's a fantasy based on a very slim extrapolation of reality. What if a human had as acute a smell as a dog, for example. This is played out when Grenouille demonstrates for himself that his extract of the fragrance of his first victim is recognized by that victim's dog. We are reminded of this evidence later in the film.<br /><br />For those who are annoyed by spoilers in reviews, you may wish to stop now.<br /><br />I found several scenes in the film which were simply too unrealistic to accept, similar to a Sci Fi movie about people in outer space where they can hear sounds in the vacuum of space or they walk as if there were gravity where there can't be any. The most jarring was in the execution scene, where, having been stripped to the waist and chained to the wall of a locked cell, Grenouille manages to retain possession of not only his vial of perfume made from the 13 essences of the fragrance of his 13 victims, but he retains a handkerchief by which he can disperse the fragrance to the crowd assembled to view his execution. Perhaps the whole unreality of the scene is signaled when Grenouille arrives at the execution stage dressed like a dandy, in a carriage fit for royalty, instead of the hay cart we are so familiar with from the French Revolution.<br /><br />Less "unreal", but similarly jarring was the scene in Baldini's laboratory where Grenouille creates an improvement over a perfume Baldini was trying to copy. It was reasonable to believe that Grenouille's talent enabled him to identify the five or six components of this perfume, but as he himself states, he knows the smells, but he does not know the names or how to capture them. So how does Grenouille assemble the components he needs by selecting sealed containers, with labels. The business as Grenouille enters Baldini's laboratory suggests he can distinguish each of the smells from the hundreds of containers by smell alone. I suspect that would be beyond the capabilities of even a bloodhound.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the film is about the sense of smell, which may be virtually impossible to convey in a film. But wait, wasn't there a very successful film entitled "The Scent of a Woman" which seemed to succeed in conveying that idea. The very slow pace of this film, with precious little dialogue to speak of, tends to be just a bit boring. Which is odd, because my memory of the novel was that it was anything but boring. Here, Hoffman, pulls off a good scene or two, and Alan Rickman is almost totally wasted, with very little dialogue. If the roles of Narrator and  Antoine Richis, the 13th victim's father, were reversed, at least we would have been treated to Rickman's delightfully serious sounding voice. Hurt's voice seemed to lack character, the same way the principle character lacked a fragrance.<br /><br />The proper bookends of the film perhaps should have been Grenouille's triumph in finding a proper fragrance to replace his own lack of one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I was sort of into this film at first. It had an interesting premise and I love Alan Rickman so I really wanted to see this. I had read that some people really dug it and some couldn't stand it. Well, now I know why. It gets very bizaar at the end where I sort of looked at my husband and we had equal looks of 'what the heck is going on here'. It was all just very odd in a disturbing and ridiculous way. I think that ruined the film for me. I mean, it had a few things going for it, but then what happens hits you like a ton a bricks and it all feels like a wasted effort.</p></br></body></html>

Then I thought, "Hhmm...I haven't done a review for Night of the Living Dead yet!". So here it is, a review of what is considered probably the most important and influential zombie movie of all time.<br /><br />Although it's not the first movie in the zombie-horror subgenre, ("White Zombie" beat it, being made in 1932) "Night of the Living Dead" is without a doubt, the most infleuntial zombie movie of all time, and probably the greatest one, too. Although it lacks the gore of later Romero classics such as "Dawn of the Dead" or "Day of the Dead", "Night of the Living Dead" is still a revolutionary horror film for several huge reasons.<br /><br />First off, having a black guy as a hero was a big step at the time, considering this movie was made in the late '60s. Romero wanted to show that with the changing times, there was no racial boundaries on who gets to be the hero in a movie. And although I'm a white guy, I like his decision a lot, because it showcases a call to revolution.<br /><br />Also, the movie itself is a social and political statement, about the new society, in this case, literally devouring the old one. Had the new society's devourment of the old society only been for the better this day and age...it's tough for me to be young and growing up in our culture these days! But Romero definitely had a brilliant idea with that underlying message in mind.<br /><br />Now, we're on to the zombies. Combining the claustrophobic atmosphere of the house and the overpowering feeling of fear and doom caused by the start of the zombie apocalypse, "Night of the Living Dead" gets everything right. Although fast zombies were to be later featured in more recent horror films, the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead" are the epitome of classic, death-paced, flesh-eating horrid fiends.<br /><br />I saw the movie online so I know nothing about the different DVD versions but I hear that the Millennium Edition is the best to get, so getting that one is probably the best thing. However, I did read that when purchasing any version of "Night of the Living Dead", none of the money will go to George A. Romero or any of the makers, so watching it online might be a good alternative. Any way you watch it, this is a zombie movie classic! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>I like many other night of living dead fans i have  been scratching my head over which version of this film to get. because it seems like every tom,dick and harry who is in film company biz has release their version  of this classic film, which explain  why there are so many versions. it's a headache too choose which one to get, i know george and his associates are bit upset over this problem too. well i got this version because it was endorsed by george himself and was filled with goodies that the others didn't have like  duane jones last interview in audio form on this DVD which  is great and all the other extra have interviews with the surviving cast members of this classic dead film. showing where they shot most of key shots in the film and fun  stuff like that, plus the film has been cleaned up with the scratches and dirt removed from so it looks as if it was shot today with exception of the vintage automobiles etc. it is a pristine print ,  clear and vivid . This definitely  the one to get out of all the ones on the market.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>This is the movie that started it all. If you love horror movies, and more specifically, if you love zombie movies you owe a lot of your enjoyment to this film. Shocking for it's time and still holds up. What is most important about this film is that it gave director and creator George Romero a path to make the movies he wanted to make. For that alone it deserves immense respect as one of the all time classic films. 5 stars because I can't give 5 million stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GA09FYFKL4EY.html">A3GA09FYFKL4EY</a><br/><p>Romero's low-budget gorefest is still one of the best horror films ever made. This new edition is a must for the serious horror fan's collection. "They're coming to get you..." and fans of this zombie romp are ready for this one!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>While zombie pictures had been around for a while, George A. Romero changed things forever in 1968 with this classic horror film.  Produced on a shoestring budget with unknown actors, he brought a new gory, visceral texture to the genre.  The movie opens with a brother and sister travelling from the city to rural Pennsylvania to place flowers on their father's grave.  A lumbering man with dead eyes approaches and the fun begins.<br /><br />As her brother is killed, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) manages to escape to a farm house.  Shortly a man drives up in a pick-up truck.  Ben (Duane Jones) is also looking for safety.  He manages to board up the house using tools and wood found inside the house.  Barbara goes insane after her confrontation earlier which isn't helped when she finds a partially eaten housewife upstairs.  They are then joined by a couple and their young...and bitten...daughter along with another young couple.  They had taken refuge in the cellar but finally emerge after hearing a radio.<br /><br />All the performances are, well, terrible with the exception of Jones as the hero.  Although his race is never mentioned in the film, it was controversial at the time.  Here is this good looking black guy saving the ass of the white whiners.  Pretty ballsy casting by Romero.  The zombies in this early film, unlike some of the more modern epics, are slow, clumsy, stupid and easily killed, "kill the brain, you kill the ghoul" (they are never called zombies).  Even though it is cheaply made, there is a certain legitimate dread watching it.  And if you saw it in 1968, you remembered it for a long time.  Still it really isn't very good; but it is a game changing horror classic and certainly worth watching.<br /><br />There are numerous video versions of the same film and some are pretty bad transfers.  I saw this on "Millennium Edition" DVD which is THX certified and produced by Elite Entertainment.  The film looks good in its original black and white and 1:33:1 aspect ratio.  You have a choice of original mono or Dolby Digital 5.1 surround.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This was the original zombie film, which spawned many remakes and sequels, none of which, were as good as the original. A low-budget horror film, that gets the most out of it's tight budget, effectively. Resident Evil reinvented the zombie film, adding action, combined with sci-fi, which was pretty effective, especially the first film in the series.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of the last and best of the low-budget "Radiation Is Coming To Get Us" genre of films that came out of the 1950s. Although director George Romero has spent his career trying to replicate this film he has never succeeded and realistically never will.<br /><br />Shot in grainy, low definition black and white with a muddy soundtrack, peopled with actors nobody ever heard of before or since, and done on a budget of about $82.47, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has all the production quality of an 8mm home movie, which is what makes it so effective.<br /><br />The storyline is simple: A mixed group of terrified people are trapped in a remote farmhouse trying to escape from a horde of dead ghouls, who have been reanimated by a radiation burst from an exploding space probe. The ghouls are "deadicated" (pardon the pun) to killing and eating the living, who then become ghouls themselves.<br /><br />The acting quality is unprofessional and brilliantly sincere. The tensions within the group are at a fever pitch. Barbara is a terrified girl, almost zombielike herself from shock after being attacked by a ghoul at the outset of the story. Ben is a competent, driven man fully committed to staying alive. He happens to be a black man, which although never specifically mentioned, underlies the animosity between himself and Harry Cooper, a disagreeable middle-aged coward who bullies his wife, Helen and daughter Karen, and tries to control everyone else in the house. The group is rounded out by Tom and Judy, a local young couple. Without meaning to, Romero created a 1968 period piece on social and race relations. Life and living is reduced to the most primal of conditions in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.<br /><br />The ghouls are frightening in their silence and inexorable craving for flesh. The scenes of them feeding are utterly grotesque, and have revolted reviewers and audiences alike since this film was first released.<br /><br />So much of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has become part of subsequent moviemaking dynamics that it is hard to imagine the impact this movie originally had.<br /><br />Best viewed on Halloween or on a stormy night, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD never fails to terrify and entertain. Viewers are best advised to stay away from the remastered full-frills editions as unnecessary; for sheer impact, nothing is better than the bargain dollar DVD release or the spotty budget VCR version.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Plot: Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russel Streiner) are visiting an old graveyard as they do every year for their passed loved one. But this time, they encounter a crazed man (Bill Hinzman) who attacks them both (indeed, he is a walking corpse in need of a good meal). Fleeing from the scene without her injured borther (did she have a choice? geez, Hinzman was creepy) she finds a small house as her hiding place. Already inside, though, is Ben (Duane Jones). He has had an encounter with a few of "those things" himself. Before long, the isolated strangers discover by radio and television that the unburied dead are coming back to life and feeding on the living -- most likely from a recent radioactive explosion. But in the long run, who cares how they came to life? They are killing the living and consuming their flesh! What can be done, if anything, to stop this madness from growing and growing and growing? Time runs out as the zombies' numbers increase and the gang find any sense of safety hard to come by. Is there any hope? Or will they all perish in the sea of the dead awaiting their sweet'n'salty fresh carcasses?<br /><br />If you are like me, you can't stand those newer zombie flicks that have come out within the past decade or so. Sure, they have some good horror and suspense, but come on! They're nothing compared to the original zombie recipe perfected by Romero in 1968 with "Night Of The Living Dead". If corpses were suddenly rising from their deaths in an incompetent army of cannibalistic horrors, would they be faster than a speeding bullet? I think not! That is one of the best aspects of older zombies films: the zombies are creepily slow and lethargic. They are corpses in a mobilized trance, hungry for your flesh. Nowdays, all I see are super-corpses running frantically amoung several teenage idiots with all of the cliches we are tired of to make a two-hour bore-fest. Not this. NOTLD is a truly original take on the zombie invasion concept -- and it's still the best. It not only presented the old-fashioned dead folks we love to watch creep along the black and white screen, but it also introduced a feeling of pure nihilism. The characters (the living ones, heheh) are trapped in such an isolated and seemingly hopeless situation. The viewer is pulled into this realm of chaos and darkness, forced to experience the horror along with these unfortunate midnight snacks we call "the living". Truly, nothing compares to NOTLD. Romero did it right the first time, and we'll always have it to cherish in our DVD collections. This DVD transfer isn't too bad either. For the price, it has great sound/picture. The catch is that there are no special features. Oh well. Who needs 'em! The movie is the only excuse you need to purchase this DVD. Just be sure to have your baseball bat handy. Hit 'em in the head and they go down quick. But then you've to burn 'em or they just get right back up! Bwahahaha...BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA...bwa.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>This is definately the best zombie film ever made, and set the scene for every contemporary zombie movie to come.  By contemporary I mean with zombies that aren't possessed by demons.  Anyway the tension between the characters is excellent, and totally beleiveable and the ending is incredibly realistic for the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Barbra and her goofball brother Johnny are putting a wreath on their father's grave one cold damp afternoon. Little do they know that across the eastern third of the united states, the dead are rising and feasting on the flesh of the living! One of the zombies attacks Barbra. Johnny comes to her rescue, only to be overpowered by the walking cadaver! Barbra runs, trying to escape in the car, which has no keys! The dead guy breaks out the passenger-side window with a rock, just as Barbra releases the emergency break, sending her down a hill and into a tree. Barbra gets out just in time and runs to a nearby farmhouse. Once inside, she finds a corpse at the top of the stairs, stripped of it's flesh from the neck up. Enter Ben (Duane Jones), the true hero of the story. He's a cool, smart, tough-under-pressure man who has just arrived after fleeing from a swarm of undead. Ben begins fortifying the house, nailing boards over the doors and windows. Barbra is in shock and remains mostly silent. Later, a group of living folks come up from the cellar, where they've been hiding. This includes a young man named Tom (Keith Wayne) and his girlfriend Judy (Judith Ridley), and the Coopers- Harry (Karl Hardman), Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter, who was bitten by a zombie sometime earlier. Well, Harry Cooper is a know-it-all type and immediately wants to take control of the situation. The problem is, he's also a gutless coward, and Ben has to put him in his place more than once. Can this motley group survive the night while a legion of flesh-eaters gathers outside? George A. Romero created THE classic zombie movie with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Only his remarkable DAWN OF THE DEAD even comes close to (perhaps surpasses) it's visceral impact. Romero's use of radio and TV coverage of the zombie invasion adds realism and texture (you can just imagine the 24 / 7, wall-to-wall coverage on the 24 hr news channels of today). The "closed in / cut off" feeling of the characters is portrayed perfectly. I highly recommend this movie to all zombie-lovers everywhere, as well as those who hate most recent hollywood attempts at "horror"...</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father. The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, "They're coming to get you, Barbara." However, the joke ended up being on him because they were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.<br /><br />I first saw "Night of the Living Dead" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel on cable was showing the film. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television (one of the living dead is naked and they do like to eat human flesh), but Iowa is a state that thinks caucuses are a good way of selecting presidential nominees, so what can I say? But this is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on.<br /><br />"The Night of the Living Dead" is a horror classic, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said "I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead"). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics like "Dementia 13" and "Carnival of Souls." You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films.  Romero has upped the ante on the social satire along with the blood and guts in his next three zombie films, including the recent "Land of the Dead," but this first one remains special.<br /><br />The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones). After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is getting weaker and weaker.<br /><br />The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (which is, I believe, redundant), which has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the "why" does not matter in this story; just the "how" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>The first time I saw &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was at my own house, in the middle of the day, on a VHS tape I rented from a video store. The second time was on one of the worst excuses for a DVD I had ever seen: A Hollywood Classics edition of NOTLD that my buddy Jon had picked up for six bucks at Best Buy. It was worth every penny. The quality of it was so awful. The sound was off key, the picture looked like it was a digital transfer from an old tape someone had left in their garage to go through a few freezes, and the general look of it was terrible. So I say all hail the geniuses at Elite Entertainment who took it upon themselves to reissue this classic of horror films with a look and sound quality better than it originally had. The THX transfer of the film is impeccable. It looks simply amazing. But anyway, the reason I'm writing this review is because I've written three reviews for &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; two for &quot;Day of the Dead,&quot; and yet I've never even touched on George Romero's original film that started it all.<p>Back in 1968, George Romero and his buddies were directing local commercials, using the money they made during the day to film &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; after hours. The story of a group of recluses trapped in an abandoned farm house out in the middle of Nowheresville, Pennsylvania with the living dead pounding on their doors, turning them against one another in a way that reflected the paranoia of the times. That's how I would've described the film to a potential investor. Oh yeah, did I mention that they were going to break all ground previously laid in the field of gore in cinema? The sight of former humans ripping flesh from char-fried limbs and a little girl laying waste to her mother with a gardening trowel are among the blood-caked spectacles in this film.<p>Shot in a grisly black and white that further accents the hopelessness in that house, &quot;Night&quot; is more about evoking the emotions of the humans as they fear the unknown and each other, more than the terror inflicted by the zombies outside. Throughout the entire trilogy of the Living Dead, George Romero has used his zombies to symbolize what human beings are becoming, as opposed to using them to instill fear in us. The real horror lies in that human beings, so involved with themselves, are becoming zombies, and that, if we can't work together toward a common goal like the people trapped in this ramshackle little farmhouse, then we deserve to be ripped to shreds and eaten alive by our fellow man. It's our fate if we can't be civilized.<p>If the zombies do really represent us, just on a lower evolutionary chain of civility, acting merely on instinct, then there's another point to be made, too. As great apes evolving into who we are now, humans worked together much easier than they seem to now. The instincts of these zombies is grotesque and stomach churning, but they are blameless; victim to their own way of half-life and hopeless to learn more in their search for food. Yet, they work together; they don't prey on each other. Not like the civilized humans trapped in the house who can't stop fighting with each other, thinking only of saving their own behinds. And as the last shot is fired, the last survivor drops to the floor. We don't deserve to survive. We let our paranoia and selfishness defeat us in the end.<p>Wow.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>For how old this movie is it was pretty scary. this is and probably one of the best zombie movies ever made. this movie is great</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>George Romero's 1968 horror film features a group of people<br />trapped in a farmhouse fighting against hungry zombies.<br />This definitely paved the way for zombie horror flicks<br />and George is the master.

This is not your typical movie at all.<br /><br />There are no stars and Duane Jones (Ben) is the only substantial character (other than catatonic Barbara played by Judith O'Dea).  It was shot on a shoestring budget (estimated at a little over $100,000) around Pittsburgh, PA.<br /><br />The movie starts swiftly and emerges the audience without any warning into a nightmarish world.  The quick pace of the film makes it easy to watch, and the intensity of it all--gripping the edge of your seat to see what happens next--totally captivates.<br /><br />This movie is truly enjoyable.  In the original black and white, it is an eerie film, not gory or gruesome.  It is terrifying.<br /><br />This edition also comes with the colorized version, which is not bad, but just strange (some colors are so vibrant and intense it shifts the mood of the scene, meanwhile other colors are paled or grayed and actually enhance the feeling of the scene).  Watch it in black and white first, and then try it in color.<br /><br />Either way, this film is a must see for horror fans.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites!</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>Even if you have never seen a frame of George A. Romero's midnight cult classic, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968), you probably know the plot from the several remakes and sequels:  a small group of people barricade themselves inside a Midwest farm house one terrifying night while an army of flesh-eating zombies try to get inside the place.  The movie was filmed in and around Pittsburgh.  It is in gloriously nightmarish black-and-white, and the low-budget definitely adds to the chills.<br /><br />NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD has been remade, and there are sequels to both the original film and the remake.  The original has been colorized and recut, with a prologue and happy ending added that Romero never intended.  There is only one version I know of to buy or rent--the Millenium Edition on DVD from Elite Entertainment, in B&W and remastered from the 35mm negative, running 96 minutes with no prologue and a profoundly unhappy ending.  It comes with comments from Stephen King, who notes how the original influenced a new breed of horror filmmakers, including Sam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD trilogy) and John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN).  And Romero offers an introduction that appears to have been used on the original laserdisc about how this authorized 35mm edition looks and sounds better than even the original film did, with its 16mm drive-in circuit distribution.<br /><br />The movie has an unknown cast that includes Duane Jones as a black drifter, Judith O'Dea as a catatonic white blonde, Russell Streiner as Johnny the zombie, and Karl Hardman as hard-headed Mr. Cooper.  The small group of main actors doubles as producers and crew people, and the people of Pittsburgh must have had a lot of fun playing the zombies and reporters.  Pittsburgh is my Dad's home town, so NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of my favorite contemporary horror films.  Like Herk Harvey's brilliant CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962), it has the look and feel of a nightmare that is hard to shake off.<br /><br />This is also one of the most important modern horror films.  As Stephen King notes, no one survives; it is a very bleak film.  There is no hero who lives to tell the tale.  A little zombie girl takes a bite out of her mother's arm before stabbing her repeatedly with a small garden shovel in the house basement.  Zombies keep coming back from the dead, even as Mr. Cooper throws molotov cocktails at them from an open window.  This is the ultimate midnight movie and still gets a Restricted "R" rating four full decades after its initial release.  It must really be something with an audience because it gave me strong nightmares even when watched alone in a night bedroom.<br /><br />George A. Romero himself made a superb sequel in 1980 called DAWN OF THE DEAD, with four main young people taking on motorcycle riding zombies armed with shotguns (!) in an all night suburban Pittsburgh shopping mall.  With good performances, a lively music score, color, and welcome dark comedy to go with grisly horror, DAWN OF THE DEAD is almost better than NIGHT.  Running over two hours, it is a horror epic.  As for the original NIGHT, if you like raw meat horror films with lots of gore and intense terror, this primal classic from the mind of visionary Romero should more than satisfy you.  So should DAWN OF THE DEAD.  More squeamish viewers should stay with the more subtle (I'm serious!) Alfred Hitchcock films and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS television show episodes for Halloween season.<br /><br />Bonuses on the Millenium Edition DVD include trailers/TV spots, notes by Stephen King and filmmaker George A. Romero, scenes from a lost Romero film and the history of his company The Latent Image, and the hysterically funny parody short NIGHT OF THE LIVING BREAD. Pleasant dreams.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>The ultmate zombie flick, filmed for $145,000 in 1968, completely reshaped the horror outlook for years to come. The first in a marvelous series of zombie flicks by master George Romero, this one still works today quite efficently.<br /><br /> Barbra and Johnnie are siblings, taking a stroll out in the cemetary one evening to place a wreath on their father's grave. As they walk through the cemetary, a homely old man passes them by, and attacks them with startilingly little ease. You see, there are people, er, zombies like this all around tonight. Hungry for a late night dinner of human flesh. A b&w film that's potent all the less, features 7 people barricaded inside a farmhouse, but they soon find out that they have every reason to survive, but the only thing in the way of survival is coexisting with each other. A truly brilliant film, with a shock ending that will pull you under your covers. Ben, played by Duane Jones, gives an outstanbding performance in the lead. Careful though, its easy to become attached to this cult classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>Wow. This movie is better than I expected.

But it still has that something special.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>This review is mostly for the dvd. I don't think i have to mention hwo good the movie is because everyone knows its a classic horror film. Anyway, many people are always confused on whether which version to get. There are so many out there it is frustrating. But let me re-assure you night of the living dead fans that the Millenium Edition is the way to go. First off, You finally get to see the original classic in the most clear and amazing dvd transfer ever. Great sound, no dark or muddy looking scenes. Everything is crystal clear. The Anchor Bay versions out there are garbage, they added all these un-edited and terrible scenes. They just ruin the classic, don't waste your money on the 30th anniversary edition or limited edition. Pure TRASH! The bonus material on the millenium edition is also better, an interesting interview with Duane Jones, two insightful commentaries, some of George A. Romero's lost films including &quot;NIGHT OF THE LIVING BREAD&quot;. My only problem with this dvd is that they should of added a nice long documentary on this classic film. Other than that it is the best version out there!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7.html">A1ZO30Z16MQ7Y7</a><br/><p>This movie is the best Zombie film. The charactors are great. The zombies rock. This film spawned many sequels, one was Dawn of the Dead, then Day of the Dead, and three films called Return of the Living Dead. And now there are two remakes, one of this movie, and on of Dawn of the Dead( Very recent). This movie is best out of all those. A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>The five star rating I gave Night of the Living Dead is, of course, for the original, uncut, unadulterated edition. The original is, quite simply, the most terrifying movie I've ever seen, even when compared to horror classics like Diabolique (the original French version), Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Halloween and The Shining. I saw NOTLD when I was 9 years old on Creature Features at midnight after a funeral. I had nightmares for the next two nights. The film still gives me the chills whenever I see it (usually at Halloween).<br /><br />When the 30th Anniversary Edition came out, I bought it on VHS as I was curious to see what they termed as "new footage." What I got was a horrible mess that butchered the original film, removed the original music for a terrible synthesizer score and added pointless footage that makes the viewer want to grind his teeth down to the gums. One of the additions is a new character: a fire and brimstone preacher. While the acting in the original is amateurish, at best, the "actor" who plays the preacher makes the original cast look like Oscar winners by comparison. He snarls, and howls and gnashes his teeth like he has rabies. Even more ridiculous is the extra footage of Bill Hinzman -- the "cemetary zombie" in the original. The extra footage shows Hinzman's character emerging from the grave, then cuts to the original 1968 opening footage with Judith O'Dea and Russell Streiner. It's absolutely ridiculous as Hinzman looks 30 years older in the new footage. In addition, there are more zombies and a new ending to the film that makes no sense whatsoever. This "new" version is a piece of trash that desecrates the most frightening film of all time. Avoid it like the plague!<br /><br />ORIGINAL VERSION: *****<br /><br />30 Anniversary version: No Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>Those who have seen NOTLD usually claim that it is one of the scariest if not the scariest horror film of all time.  The reasons most often mentioned include the grainy black and white pseudo-documentary filming, the heretofore unbroken taboo of onscreen cannabalism, the bold decision to use a black man as the protagonist, and the dreary ordinariness of the zombies.  Certainly, the sum of these factors makes it easy to tag this film as something special in the horror genre.  Yet for NOTLD, the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.  There are other films in other genres that had talented directors consciously try tactics that would appeal to the immediate senses of the viewer.  What separates the merely effective film from the truly memorable one is what the director presents as lurking beneath the surface.  In the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock is the acknowledged master of the subconscious demon that lurks in us all. George Romero, the director of NOTLD, surely runs a close second. What Romero manages to do in NOTLD is similar to what Ridley Scott managed a decade later in ALIEN.  Romero knew that walls and claustrophobia often interact on the screen to produce a creepy feeling in the audience.  In fact, walls and wall-breaking become the central metaphor of this film. As the movie opens, a zombie attacks a woman who seeks safety in her car.  The zombie tries to break in by smashing the car's window. The woman seeks safety in a house, and with the aid of other normal humans, seeks to buttress the structural integrity of the house by using nails and boards.  Soon enough a horde of slow-moving corpses tries to smash into the house.  Eventually they succeed. The grotestque climax occurs when the recently murdered brother of the woman reaches through a smashed door and drags his poor screaming sister out into the night to be devoured.  The cumulative impact of this scene scares the viewer on more than one level.  The horror of seeing a sister ripped apart by her ghoul brother is surely nasty enough, but Romero amplifies this grotesqueness by suggesting that the malevolent events of this movie are nothing more than an exaggeration of a fundamental principle of life--that the order and stability of this universe has only the thinnest of gossamer protection against the terror and chaos that exists just inches from that wall. It is almost as if Romero is suggesting that the nightmares which afflict us all are only glimpses into that anarchic nada which preceeded the origins of our universe.  If a nightmare glimpse scares the ordinary individual, then, he shows on the screen what the grim reality of a wall collapse must be like.  This other nightmare universe sucks us into its foul regions where the dead are not dead at all.  By the end of the film, the audience is forced to see that the dramatic focus of the title is not on the living at all, but on the dead.  And it is this soul-shaking divination that causes a new generation of audiences to continually reappraise the sometimes elusive distinction between that which is dead and that which is not.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>As with any other horror genre, the groundbreaking zombie movie is the best. "Night of the Living Dead" is a cult gem that has inspired every zombie movie after it, with its low-budget look and cast of excellent, unknown actors. And, of course, the flesh-eating undead who are rising to kill the living.<br /><br />A crashed satellite starts emitting radiation, which somehow causes the dead to rise out of their graves to devour the living. Don't ask how, because it doesn't matter. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) is visiting a grave with her brother -- when suddenly a shambling, dead-faced man murders him, and chases her down the road to a farmhouse, where she manages to hide.<br /><br />But she's not alone -- a kindly man named Ben (Duane Jones), a young couple, and a family are also hiding there. And without weapons or protection, they have very little chance of survival. The refugees barricade themselves for protection -- but now there are hundreds of zombies closing in. They must fight with fire and their wits... but it may not be enough to save them all.<br /><br />"Night of the Living Dead" is one of those horror movies that chills viewers right down to the marrow. Romero creates a nightmarish, claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie, where no matter where you go, you're trapped -- and the humans might kill you if the zombies don't. The finale is a tragic, but very realistic twist.<br /><br />Originally filmed in murky black-and-white, Romero manages to make this film feel creepy even when the zombies aren't there. And while they're hiding in the farmhoruse, he takes the time to make it realistic -- the refugees grate on each other in a believable way ("I ought to drag you out there and FEED you to those things!").<br /><br />But then things get creepy, gross AND action-packed, when they slip out to fight the zombies. Romero switches the tone from eerie to downright terrifying -- the characters just reek of desperation -- and builds it up to a slam-bang finale. And along the way, we get terrified people fending zombies off with torches -- what could be better?<br /><br />Duane Jones is the standout performance here: he's strong, kindly, take-charge and resourceful, but he also knows how to kick undead butt. By the finale, his character is the one that is remembered, especially given the haunting, shocking last scene, with an all-too-realistic racial undertone. But he was backed by excellent actors in Judith O'Dea, Karl Hardman, and dozens of zombie extras. Those people were amazing!<br /><br />Stripped-down and stark, "Night of the Living Dead" is the sort of movie that should never be watched at night, and might make you look twice before going outside. Creepy, innovative and bizarre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>There have been numerous versions of this film circulating on DVD for years from cheap public domain copies on the 50 Movie Pack collections to more deluxe releases. Now here comes another version with - count them - two audio commentary tracks.<br /><br />Along with "Carnival of Souls", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.<br /><br />This movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.<br /><br />Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, is the sole survivor of the group. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. However, in the end, as morning arrives, Ben is sitting near a window of the farmhouse as the posse that is hunting down, shooting, and burning the zombies finally arrives. Happy to see his rescuers, Ben makes a movement, hoping the posse will see him. Unfortunately they do, and they shoot him dead. The film ends with Ben's body being carried from the house and being put in a pile about to be burned. He survived the whole ordeal for nothing. This begs the question, would the posse have shot first and asked questions later had they seen a white person waving from the window? Did they automatically assume - perhaps subconsciously - that there was no good reason for a black man to be in mainly white rural Ohio and therefore just assume he was a zombie? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignor.

I guess in an age of horror movies delivered to theatres on an almost weekly basis, it's hard for younger audiences to appreciate the delicacy of the classic that started it all.<br /><br />Romero perfected the formula for horror by providing several key elements - a gang of strangers in an isolated area where they are trapped at night.  The isolation alone must have given moviegoers a scare back in 1968.  But it goes beyond that.  The crude effects and idea of the zombies, mindlessly attacking our unsuspecting heroes and the mere thought of the zombie child in the final act are terrifying.<br /><br />But this was more than a mindless horror film.  The characters are incredibly flawed, but not by the mere stupidity that marks most modern horror films.  Barbara is understandibly hysterical while the Coopers and Ben argue about what to do.  The lack of teamwork between the characters may be their defeat.<br /><br />But it's the film's conclusion that ultimately makes this film more than run of the mill horror.  The quiet music, radio communications and still photos at the end credits are unlike any other movie I've seen and must've moved the audiences from fright to pure shock back in 68.<br /><br />If you are to purchase this film, go with the excellent Millenium edition.  It's probably the highest priced version, but worth every penny - with a beautiful remastering job and direct involvment with all the filmakers.  It included an interesting final audio interview with Duane Jones, the actor who played Ben, regarding how he became detached from the film, but still proud of it.  There's also an audio commentary, parts of an early film from Romero and a weird Night of the Living Dead parody - with bread of all things. As to how it holds up - turn your lights down and watch it alone at night - then ask yourself if it holds up.  It's more than effects that make a movie a horror film and Romero demonstrates that here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Ah, here we are. We have the first of four great films from the mind of George A. Romero. While LAND OF THE DEAD is not as classic as this beauty, all four of Romero's 'DEAD' films hold true to the zombie genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD was the film that truly changed the horror genre, and Romero knew he had it made when he graced the movie audience with sheer terror.<br /><br />While revolutionary, this film also features some B-grade acting (Duane Jones as the lead hero, really was much better than most actors of this genre's heyday) and shocking gore effects that are quite gruesome. The color version of this film doesn't change anything at all, and really the black and white version is more terrifying because it's darker, and it creates more menace. The zombies are relentless; the characters are cornered like frightened dogs; and the gore is not short of supply. People are trapped in an abandoned home trying to find a way to keep the undead out, but the zombies are relentless and will stop at nothing to feast on warm human flesh. The movie's black & white documentary style innovation is key to the effective suspense and terror that ultimately breathes in this movie.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD today is still heralded as one of the classic horror films of all time, and it's sequels are almost as powerful, but none of them will come close to the sheer terror and power of this one.<br /><br />Romero's legacy will live on for years to come, and all the 'DEAD' films will hold a place in the ultimate shrine of the horror genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a must-own film, a testament to the power that we, the cult following, gave to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I don't like horror films, but Night of the Living Dead is an exception. It's about survival - a stark story in stark black and white. The fear and tension slowly and inexorably rise and peak until the shocking and unforgettable ending. The goriness is palpable but understated. This is a classic and classy horror film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>Much has been said about "Night of the Living Dead" for the last 37 years. Of course it's one of the classic horror flicks that will be remembered for a very long time. It's not just fun (in a "horror" meaning of this word) it has a social message, it was rather important for that time and now also - I'm talking about the whole Romero's trilogy (quadrilogy now) - you all now about its anti-racist, anti-consumer and so on aspects. "Night of the Living Dead" is still topical. BUT.<br /><br />Old movies sometimes are hard to percept today. They seem a little bit naive and funny. The same thing I guess happened to Romero's classic. Nowdays it's not that scary and shocking as it was in 1968. Maybe I'm wrong and some people still find it the way it was then. Well, good for them. But I think there are some who think like me and who can't watch old films without making allowance for time. I watched it three times and each one I found myself being a little bored.<br /><br />Again I repeat it is a great movie of a great cinematographic and panhuman value, it's in my top 10 of the greatest horror flicks of all time, but I doubt you'll be watching it for a couple times a year. Maybe two or three times like me. Tom Savini's remake look much more up-to-date.<br /><br />What I have no doubt about is that it's neccessary to have it in your collection even if you are not an avid horror fan. "Night of the Living Dead" is one of the movies that changed cinematography forever and although it might not be perceived as 40 years ago, it's still worth time and money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father. The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, "They're coming to get you, Barbara." However, the joke ended up being on him because they were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.<br /><br />I first saw "Night of the Living Dead" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel on cable was showing the film. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television (one of the living dead is naked and they do like to eat human flesh), but Iowa is a state that thinks caucuses are a good way of selecting presidential nominees, so what can I say? But this is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on.<br /><br />"The Night of the Living Dead" is a horror classic, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said "I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead"). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics like "Dementia 13" and "Carnival of Souls." You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films.<br /><br />The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones). After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is getting weaker.<br /><br />The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (which is, I believe, redundant), which has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the "why" does not matter in this story; just the "how" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father.

The cause for their awakening is due to a possible radition contamination.<br /><br />A group of sane people are hiding out in a house. One smart guy figures that he could board up the windows in this abandon house and wait it out.  He breaks nearly every piece of wood furniture in the place to board up the windows so the zombies couldn't enter.  I didn't know furniture could break that easily!

Anyway, the group struggles and eventually the zombies win and get them all, but one...<br /><br />While I respect this movie as a horror classic, the story and filming were good for its time (1968), the acting was pretty bad and detracted from the story a bit for me.

I couldn't understand why they didn't go to the upper floor and throw Molotov cocktails out the windows and remain there.

The best cheap print I've seen was the Diamond Ent. copy, paired with "Dementia 13" -- lovely, clear and sharp.<br /><br />Stripped-down and stark, "Night of the Living Dead" is the sort of movie that should never be watched at night, and might make you look twice before going outside. Creepy, innovative and bizarre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Along with "Carnival of Souls", this movie stands out as one of the definitive black-and-white horror movies of a bygone drive-in movie era. This movie scared me horribly when I first saw it back in the sixth grade. I had seen other scary movies before, but I think what makes this film so frightening is that there is a somewhat scientific explanation involved and that the horror is occurring to average people. The terror is not due to some supernatural occurrence that we know to be fantasy such as a vampire or some other relic from a 30's or 40's Universal horror film. Also, the drama is playing out in and around a farm house in rural Ohio, not some mythical haunted mansion. This puts you into the dilemma with the players. The fact that such bad acting is in play here just adds to the realism rather than making the film campy.<br /><br />Many people have talked about the plot in detail before, so I won't continue to belabor the details. I will mention that the movie showed something that could have only occurred pre-Watergate. At one point, the people trapped in the farmhouse discover a television and turn it on in search of news of what is going on. Something almost as remarkable to today's audiences as the dead rising from their graves is seen to occur. In Washington, reporters confront a government official about the situation, the government official tells the reporters the truth, and everyone believes what the government has told them. All of this would be truly remarkable in today's environment of mutual mistrust between citizens, government, and the media. Also, although we don't have actual vampires as the villain here, we have a similar dilemma. As the radiation causes the dead to become animated and seek to eat the flesh of the living, each time a victim is bitten, that victim eventually dies only to rise minutes later seeking the flesh of the living themselves, producing a problem that grows geometrically, just as vampires do.<br /><br />Finally, this film has something important to say about race. Ben (Duane Jones), an African-American man, is the sole survivor of the group. Unique to 60's films, the group in the farmhouse accepts Ben as a leader since he is smart and a quick thinker. This portrayal of an African American as protagonist and problem solver is also unique to films of forty years ago. However, in the end, as morning arrives, Ben is sitting near a window of the farmhouse as the posse that is hunting down, shooting, and burning the zombies finally arrives. Happy to see his rescuers, Ben makes a movement, hoping the posse will see him. Unfortunately they do, and they shoot him dead. The film ends with Ben's body being carried from the house and being put in a pile about to be burned. He survived the whole ordeal for nothing. This begs the question, would the posse have shot first and asked questions later had they seen a white person waving from the window? Did they automatically assume - perhaps subconsciously - that there was no good reason for a black man to be in mainly white rural Ohio and therefore just assume he was a zombie? I don't know if this question was hung out there intentionally by the film's creators for the audience to ponder, but it is a point that is almost impossible to ignor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EIK4L9730WWJ.html">A2EIK4L9730WWJ</a><br/><p>Night of the Living Dead by George Romero is a horror classic and not only that but its also the one that started the zombie movies!!!!!!!! I think that this classic will be treasured always and to me it has enough scares in it!!!!!! When dead people won't stay dead its up to this group of survivors to stay away from the dead or else they become one of them!!!!!! Like i said before Night of the Living Dead has been out for years and when they remade this one it was not as good as this one here and if you love horror movies then go out and pick up this true horror classic for you dvd collection!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Once upon a time a young girl and her brother traveled three hours from home to place flowers on the grave of their father. The brother started teasing his sister, telling her in a creepy voice, "They're coming to get you, Barbara." However, the joke ended up being on poor Johnny because they really were coming to get Barbara, only they got him first.<br /><br />In the believe it or not category I first saw "Night of the Living Dead" when I came home one afternoon and discovered that the Iowa City Public Library Channel was showing the film on cable. I have to admit, I was rather surprised that this cult classic horror film would be on at a time when kids could come home and discover it on television (one of the living dead is naked and they do like to eat human flesh), but Iowa was a state that thought caucuses are a good way of selecting presidential nominees, so what can I say? But "The Night of the Living Dead" is a horror movie that is even scary in the daytime with all the lights on.<br /><br />"The Night of the Living Dead" is a horror classic, which is rather surprising when you take into account that director George A. Romero made the film in 1968 for $114,000 without a cast of first time actors (extras who playing the zombies were paid $1 and a t-shirt that said "I was a zombie on Night of the Living Dead"). Filmed in black and white with Romero as the cinematographer, this film has a technical proficiency that is missing from other low-budget classics like "Dementia 13" and "Carnival of Souls." You can take or leave the various sequels to this film, but this one has to be on everyone's Top 10 list when it comes to horror films. I watched it again tonight for the umpteenth time, and it still creeps me out.<br /><br />The horror comes from the situation and the simple effectiveness of the slow moving, silent zombies in their growing numbers, their arms reaching out to find human flesh to eat. Barbara (Judith O'Dea) runs to an abandoned house, where she is joined by Ben (Duane Jones), who proves himself more than capable of dealing with the situation while Barbara is still in shock. After fending off the first attack of the living dead, they discover five more people hiding in the basement: Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman), his wife, Helen (Marilyn Eastman), and their daughter (Kyra Schon), along with a young couple, Tom (Keith Wayne) and Judy (Judith Ridley). Harry wants to hide out in the basement, but refuses to be trapped down there, and the two spend more time arguing about what to do than doing anything. They listen to the radio and watch the TV, learning that the dead are rising to eat the living, and try to figure out a way of getting out of the death trap in which they find themselves trapped. Meanwhile, the little girl in the basement is getting weaker and weaker.<br /><br />The only real weakness in the film is the attempt to explain why the dead are walking around as flesh-eating ghouls (which is, I believe, a redundant description). It has something to do with a satellite and scientific mumbo-jumbo that really does not mean anything to the people desperately trying to survive against the growing horde of zombies. Fortunately, the "why" does not matter in this story; just the "how" in terms of taking these creatures down. Besides, if anything clinches this one it is the end of the film, both with its final twist, and the use of grainy still photographs to show the end of the tale. Few horror movies, whatever their budgets, have an ending this memorable. Every Halloween, "The Night of the Living Dead" remains mandatory viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>This is the reason zombie flicks are made and almost all other horros, the film in 1968 by George Romero is a classic and for the price its great. How a movie like this is being sold for so little i could never understand. But for those who dont know its in black and white, but that means nothing, to me atleast. If you know what great horror is then this is one to have. Like I said the one that started it all and if you know whats best for your collection you will get this flick highlyrecomended. Also loook to buy the other 2 ZOMBIE flicks by Romero Dawn of the dead 1978 and day of the dead 1985 also the remake of night of the living dead 1992, I believe is directed by Tom savini.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>"Night of the Living Dead" is the greatest horror film of all time, and probably the most important one of the last 50 years.  Much of the time, groundbreaking films are not particularly remarkable artistically-- they simply get by on doing something that had never been done before.  NotLD is a particularly glaring exception because it is so effortlessly and organically transgressive.  A film like "Last House on the Left" seems to exist exclusively for the purpose of pushing the audience to the edge, but NotLD never announces that it is a new, darker sort of horror film.  One gets the impression that Romero and Russo and all the others didn't even specifically intend to make a more graphic horror film when they started out.  It appears almost normal, initially, but moves inexorably towards the horrific conclusion, at all points defying the expectations as to who ought to survive, or whether or not bravery or cowardice ought to be rewarded.  It never feels self-conscious or scripted, and that's why it holds up so well even after it is no longer a particularly morbid or gruesome film.  Despite the supernatural elements, NotLD is disturbingly authentic.<br /><br />Horror films tend not to be to big on plot, and "Night of the Living Dead" is no exception.  It is your standard zombie apocalypse plot, though, of course, no such thing existed at the time.  Most modern zombie films take the action-horror route along with an urban setting, but NotLD is pure horror, and takes place inside a desolate farmhouse out in the Pennsylvania countryside. As the film opens we are introduced to Barbara and Johnny, brother and sister.  These are characters we've seen before: Barbara is snippety and uptight, and seems to be well on her way to becoming an old spinster.  Johnny feels like the hero, and he'd probably feel at home in a 50's Sci-Fi or Horror flick, as he's whiny and jokey and teases his sister.  Still, he seems to have a good, courageous heart, however, as he immediately comes to his sisters aid after she's assailed by a strange man in the graveyard. But Oops! Johnny gets his brains bashed in only a few minutes into the film.  And though she's technically alive Barbara is more or less out for the count for the rest of the film, and mostly lounges about in a nearly catatonic stupor.<br /><br />Barbara flees to an apparently abandoned farm house, and we are shortly introduced to the films real hero, Ben, played by Duane Jones.  The acting in the film isn't exactly  terrific, but Jones is good as Ben, and helps create one of the most appealing protagonists in all film.  He's smart and capable but certainly not a saint-- Notice how he decks the hysterical Barbara after she slaps him  during her vain attempt to get them to search for the now very dead Johnny.  Much has been made out of the fact that he's black.  Romero will tell you that this means nothing, or nothing more than that Jones was the best actor they could find for the part, regardless of race.  Again, the roots of NotLD's greatness are exposed-- They were neither conforming to nor defying tradition.  They simply made it their way.<br /><br />The core of the film is not especially eventful: Ben works to barricade the house, and eventually argues with the unexpected tenants in the basement, two couples and one child.  These scenes show that Romero really knew what he was doing from the very beginning, and that his experience in industrial films and commercials wasn't wasted.  The film somehow maintains a slightly hypnotic intensity in the section as Ben seals of the house while the all to calm radio announcer drones on and on in a hopeless attempt to get a grip on the whole extraordinary situation.  Romero keeps the camera moving and the editing sharp so that even after over 10 viewing my mind never wanders in this seemingly uneventful section of the film. (This is a good description of the visual style of the film in general, as it is far from flashy and very realistic, but still energetic enough that it never really feels flat.)  And then there is, of course, Ben's dramatic monologue about his first encounter with the "things".  This scene has been surpassed a few times in later films, like "Jaws" or "28 Days Later", but it still holds up very well.<br /><br />Eventually, the majority of the farmhouse's residents determine that it's best not to simply wait around for help, and plan a fairly reasonable escape.  Suffice to say, things do not go well.  I don't want to go into too many specific as it'll hurt the film, but this part is really quite brilliant.  Their plan seems really quite reasonable on the face of it, but it proves disastrous.  Fate and human error intervene, and we a treated to one of the earliest gore scenes you'll ever see outside of an H.G. Lewis film, as the ghouls feed on charred remains while ominous, amelodic electronic music drones on in the background.  Again, this isn't remarkably gruesome by modern day standards, but it's probably the creepiest zombie-feast scene ever filmed.<br /><br />Shortly after this things spiral out of control between the survivors, and all hell break's loose, leading up to one of the greatest endings in all film.  Again, I won't go into specifics, but it's just such a classic, senselessly tragic endings.  It's been knocked off many times, but the ending here still has the sorta authenticity that you find in all the rest of the film.  This isn't a morose, violent ending that a supposedly edgy director stuffed on to prove how far he'd push boundaries This is just they way it happened to turn out.  Just a great film.<br /><br />The Elite Millenium Edition is the only way to go.  Good transfer and sound, nice extras.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>The Night of The Living Dead is one of the scariest films ever made, and one of my all time favorites, a classic film that has earned through the years a cult and loyal following worldwide, an excellent feature debut of underrated director George Romero.<br />So a 30th anniversary edition was eagerly anticipated, trusting the filmmakers and studio to offer fans a real treat that is worthy of the status the film enjoys.However,I was disappointed for several reasons,<br />There are many classic films that have additional unseen footage added to their DVD release or re-release, scenes that were too long to inculde in the theatrical release (Dances with Wolves, Amadeus),or scenes that the director and/or studio decided to cut for artisitc reasons (Exorcist), only to be added later and marketed cleverly. However, it is a rarity that filmakers would go to the trouble of filming additonal footage and drop it in the original.This can be a hit and miss venture, a very precarious decision that can enhance the film or diminish it.<br />In the case of Night of the Living Dead, the new scenes were added, primarily as the film makers claim to give more backgroud to the story, more than they could have done back in '68.But personally I think it was a mistake (for me what makes Night of Living Dead a classic is the when and where and not the why of zombies). The first mistake is to include new scenes at the beginning and end of the film, a very sensitive area to tamper with, for the original film's power lies in the opening scene of the car driving through the cemetry, setting from the first second a mood that is carried through till the last frame. To add a new scene of the burial of the original zombie, kind of deflates this mood.<br />The ending of the original film is extremely powerful, unexpected and ironic and leaves the viewer with a sense of tension that lingers long after, and to add scenes of the reporter and a demented priest to the ending gives the film an unnecessary reasoning. While the few additional scenes dropped in the middle of the films of zombies roaming the woods do not add anything to the film.<br />Finaly I was disappointed with the making of featurette. For the 30th anniversary I would have imagined that there will be many on camera commets and anecdotes (this is reserved for the audio commentary), and what we get instead is just a nine minutes long making of the new additional scenes featurette.<br />So if you are a fan of the film, by all means add it to your collection, for it is a disturbing horror film the kind of rarely made these days, one that should remain untouched.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E15WYG9C47X1.html">A1E15WYG9C47X1</a><br/><p>Night of Living Dead is one of my all time favorite movies, and certainly one of the scariest ever made, a brilliant feature debut by George Romero,so I very much looked forward to this edition, expecting a lot, but unfortunately being disappointed for several reasons,<br />Many films for their DVD release or re-release have additional scenes included, usually scenes that were cut from the original due to lenght restriction (Dances with Wolves, Amadeus) or ones that the director at the time decided to cut for artistic reasons only to be restored later (Exorcist).With Night of the Living Dead, the filmmakers decided to film new scenes and drop them in the original film, to add and explain ,(as they claim),more than they could have done back in '68. Having watched both versions, and being a fan of the film for years, I did have a problem with that.For one, the added scenes did not really add much to the film itself, on the contrary, the scenes added at the beginning and end of the film took a lot of power from the original. The opening scene of the car driving through the cemetry which immediately set the tone and atmosphere of the film,is preceded in the new version with a scene of the burial of the original 'zombie', as if to give a background for what will happen next. But for me personally what I liked so much about the movie is the when and where and not the why the zombies roam.Moreover,the last scene in the original film was extremely powerful, unexpected and ironic, to add new scenes with the reporter and a demented reverend is not only totally unnecessary but it somehow ruins the 'in your face' raw ending.<br />The other disappointment is the making of featurette. For a 30th anniversary edition of this classic, one would expect a feature lenght making of segment, for I believe there would be so many on camera contributions and anecdotes, but the real making of we get comes from the audio commentary, and instead the making of on the DVD extra is just 9 minutes long, and mainly about the filming of these new additional scenes.<br />However, the new transfer of the original film is of excellent quality, and it does enhance the enjoyment of film.<br />So my full marks go to the original 1968 version on this DVD, since a Night of the Living Dead is a classic that should remain untouched.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This anniversary edition is very well done and the added parts fit in well with the film and are hardly noticeable except for showing a sharper picture than the rest of the movie.

I liked the way that Barbra sought refuge first with her brother, to no avail, then in her car, again without success, and then in the house. This is a good way of building up the fear and the audience's knowledge of the power of the ghouls. It is worth noting that in a crisis such as this the danger might not come from the so called baddies, but from the idiots who are supposed to be on your side. There are some nicely composed shots but the overall effect is spoiled by poor editing that often gives the effect of jump cuts. The acting is variable. It's lucky that Duane Jones is reasonably good, because the main female lead Judith O'Dea is awful.  Having said that, the overall effect is quite clever, with feelings of relentless attack and claustrophobia heightened by the old farm house setting. The creatures' origins are explained in a radio broadcast which must be a homage to Orson Welles's version of H.G.Wells's War Of The Worlds, and the television broadcasts seem quite realistic too. It's worth noting that nowhere in this film is the term 'Zombies' used, these are just recently dead people who came back to life and started committing murders! All in all, a good film which set the pace for the slasher movies of the 1970s and 1980s, and a promising start to a directorial career.</p></br><a href="../users/A23XVF23C7BHP0.html">A23XVF23C7BHP0</a><br/><p>There are some good ideas here which could have benefited from more attention to detail.

I first saw this when I was in second grade I think at a friends house. I had a frightening bike ride home that night. I never forgot the opening of the movie, twilight in the graveyard. AMC or some station was showing classic horror films and I only saw bits of pieces of this but I found the crisp back and white and the shaky camera work very beautiful. I consequently purchased the millennium addition and enjoyed every second of it. I still like the beginning the best including the part when she first stumbles upon the house as she is running from the zombies.

Now onto the film.  George Romero forever revolutionized the horror genre with this chilling story of a group of people barracading themselves inside a house to withstand a horde of re-animated corpses who have a taste for human flesh.  However, what set Night of the Living Dead apart from other horror films (and many other following horror films to feature zombies) is that Romero uses the people trapped in the house as a case study on human nature, and the results prove more chilling than the flesh eating ghouls trying to break in.  Also when watching the film, as one previous reviewer has already stated, the word "zombie" is never mentioned once.  Over the years many films featuring zombies would follow, such as City of the Living Dead, the gore classic Dead Alive, and Dan O'Bannon's homage to this film Return of the Living Dead; and while they were all great in they're own right, the original Night of the Living Dead remains a horror staple and one of the most chilling films of all time.  Also worth checking out is legendary gore/makeup effect master Tom Savini's remake of the film which was released in the 90's.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EAI4948TW53X.html">A2EAI4948TW53X</a><br/><p>What can i say?  this is the best zombie movie ever made.

I cannot tell you enough times not to purchase this edition.<br />Confound you, ambitious filmmakers!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Like its zombies, Night of the Living Dead just seems to keep coming back from the grave.  The latest DVD release of the classic is a 40th anniversary edition that comes with an outstanding set of extras.  There's no doubt that Night of the Living Dead is one of the most influential horror films of all time.  George Romero and John Russo didn't invent zombies on film, but their prototype of the shambling, flesh-eating, shoot-the-head to kill them, has become the zombie of choice in popular culture.  Without Night of the Living Dead we probably wouldn't have Max Brooks' World War Z or other popular zombie fiction novels; we probably wouldn't have video games and film series like Resident Evil.  When you consider the film was made on a budget of around $100,000, produced and acted by essentially amateurs, it makes its status all the more incredible.  The film was a community effort.  The actors served as producers, directors, and make-up artists.  Everyone did multiple duties.  If the film did have a bigger budget it likely would not have the same impact.  Can you imagine it being in color rather than its stark black & white?<br /><br />The lack of funds forced the crew to be creative.  Chocolate syrup stood in for blood, mortician's makeup was used to fashion the zombies, and a fireworks expert created the gunshot effects.  The eerie soundtrack was stock music taken from a variety of sources.  If some of it sounds like it came from a campy 1950's Sci-Fi film you'd be right on the money as some of it did come from the 1959 film Teenagers from Outer Space.  Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman who played Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, also provided the sound effects and Eastman did the makeup.  Modern critics have lauded the film for its subversive qualities and Vietnam-era take on American Society.  But when you hear the actors talk about the film you don't get the idea that they were trying to send any messages to viewers.  They were just trying to make a scary horror film.  Night of the Living Dead is an instance where the planets aligned just right and in a remarkable confluence of events and efforts, a near perfect horror film was created.  The amateur actors work because they are real people and not professionals.<br /><br />This 40th anniversary edition features a fully restored and re-mastered cut of the film with features overseen by George Romero himself.  First, there are two audio commentaries:  One featuring Romero, Karl Hardman, Marilyn Eastman, and John Russo.  The second features Producer/Actor Russ Streiner (Johnny), Judith O' Dea (Barbra), Kyra Schon (Karen Cooper), and Karl Hinzman (cemetery zombie).<br /><br />The main attraction of the 40th Anniversary Edition is the brand new, 83-minute documentary that covers the film from beginning to end.  The documentary opens in black & white as an SUV drives through a cemetery.  The film switches to color as Streiner and O'Dea visit the same grave where they placed a wreath forty years earlier.  The documentary features comments from almost all the surviving cast members including Eastman, Hardman (who just passed away recently), Schon, Hinzman, George Kosana (Sheriff McClelland) Bill Cardille (reporter who played himself), and Ella Mae Smith who played a zombie, along with Romero, Russo, and others in the crew.<br /><br />It's fascinating to hear their stories and memories about making the movie.  Russo and Streiner returned to the infamous basement where little Karen killed and ate her mother.  The basement was actually in an office building in Pittsburgh and looks much the same today.  Streiner laments about a flood, which destroyed a number of the film's assets including prints and press kits.  Hinzman (who looks actually younger now than he did as the Cemetery Zombie) talks about the problems he had breaking the window of Barbra's car with a rock.  They also discuss the mistake made in not copyrighting the film, which fell into public domain a few years after the release where it remains today.  The documentary alone makes this edition a must have.<br /><br />"Speak of the Dead" is a 15 minute Q & A with George Romero that took place at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto in August of 2007.  Romero discusses many of the film's influences including the EC Comics from his youth.<br /><br />"Ben Speaks" is an audio only interview with Duane Jones.  The last interview the reclusive actor and professor gave in December 1987.  He would pass away the following Summer.<br /><br />There's also a still gallery and a copy of the script in .PDF format.<br /><br />Because of its public domain status there are a lot of versions of the DVD available but this is the only one you MUST own!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>I've been wanting to see this movie for years.  Unable to find it for rent, I decided it was better to buy the cheapest DVD version available that kept the original soundtrack.  Thanks to countless reviews on Amazon, I avoided the '30th Anniversary Edition" which is supposed to be a butchering of the original cut.  I decided against the Elite version because it was too expensive, and would have kicked myself if I hated the movie when it arrived.<p>After watching my chosen "Good Times" DVD, I am glad I spent the very low amount to buy this movie.  While the transfer isn't brilliant, it's far from poor.  It's watchable, and the original soundtrack is satisfactory.  The movie itself ended up not really being my cup of tea so I'm glad I didnt opt for the Elite expensive version.  <p>The "Good Times" version states that its Digitally Remastered.  I think they've done an okay job on the transfer.  Like I said earlier, it's not great, but for [money], what more could you ask for if you a first timer to this movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A classic that will have many babies. The situation is simple and we all know it : a few normal people attacked by recently not yet buried corpses that have been revived in the brain. Living dead in a word. But this classic goes beyond this simple anecdote. It tries to explain - a sign that we are before the horror wave that will come soon - the phenomenon with some kind of radiation from Venus. But the main interest is the study of the reactions of people in front of such a situation. Fear of course. Self-protection and survival even if you have to kill your next door neighbor. Absolute egotism. Among them a black man who has some natural authority but who will have to kill all his fellow survivors because either they turn against him out of fear or they turn into living dead after having been killed in a way or another. The second interest is the organization society puts up to solve the crisis : a general posse that can ? kill ? (but how can we kill living dead who are already dead ?) at will and to the finish. And the finish will be to kill a live man because there is little difference between a living dead and a live man when both are on the other side, in front of your gunbarrel, and irony of irony, ..., but you have to see it. The moral of the story is that humanity is not very brilliant when it is confronted with a crisis in their own midst, coming from inside their ring.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></br><a href="../users/A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG.html">A3TUQ1JB7ZZNZG</a><br/><p>One Saturday afternoon my parents went out and left me in the house all alone, and they had just bought me a copy of Night of the Living Dead to keep me busy. I rarely get scared at black and white horror films (Exception-Psycho) but this movie had me jumping around like a fool by the end. Night of the Living Dead was directed by George A Romero who hit with two other sequels in this same field. Shot on a shoe string budget of just over,$110,000,it is the story of the dead coming back to life and eating the living. However that is just the start. In the beginning we meet Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) and they are attacked in a cemetery where they have come to put flowers on there fathers grave. After Johnny is killed Barbara runs to a nearby farm house. A man passes in looking for gas named Ben (Duane Jones) and he decides that they should just stay put and board up the house for protection. More people show up like the cantancorous Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman),his long suffering wife Helen (Mayilyn Eastman),their daughter who had been bitten by a ghoul, and a young couple who is just scared. Ben and Harry hate one another from the outset and continue to fight throughout the film.<br />Night of the Living Dead works on many different levels and in the end it is just a really good horror movie, but it also say's somthing about the fact that no matter how bad things are outside, inside we still can't get along. The acting is very good,(Eastman,Hardman,And Streiner all worked off camera as well and were there from the biggining) and the violence is not very graphic although it is at time a little disturbing but if you see Dawn Of The Dead or Day Of The Dead, or even the remake of this film you will be amazed at just how tame it is compared to those others. This is the film that started all the zombie movies and it has never come close to being equeled. Most of the Zombie movies that come out now are nothing more than an excuse show how much blood and gore they can pack into 97 Minutes (See Lucio Fulci's Zombie if you don't believe me).<br />A remake made of thius film in the early 90's by make-up wizard Tom Savini that was a really bad movie. He should have left well enough alone and remade Plan 9 From Outer Space, at least then we would have seen his movie being intentionally funny........</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Some blu rays are region one(north america) some are region 2 (europeon) and most are all region.

A film that dares to show you some truly shocking scenes of gore and cannibalism.  A film which portrays a world gone mad, where the dead rise from the grave, where a women is so scared she wanders around in a state of shock and the person who helps her is a young black man.  It's the late 60's remember. <p>This film is going to go too far, it's going to show you things you have never been shown before.  It's going to keep the tension going not for just a few minutes but for much of it's running time.  Yeah, some of the acting is really over the top, but give the amateur actors their 15 minutes of fame and realize with the equivalent amount that the recent Blair Witch Project film was made for, George Romero and company made this classic-- which has inspired hundreds of horror films and nearly as many film-makers.  The 30th Anniversary edition gives you a pristine print of the film and an only at times interesting commentary track that features the co-writers and some of the cast but NOT George Romero.  The recently shot footage that is inserted into the film doesn't work. Cheap Junk to market this DVD and make money for the co-writer of the original film which is now in public domain.

It doesn't matter what you do, where you run, or where you hide. They are there! There is no escape! They won't stop til you are dead! The original 1968 Night of The Living Dead is a true horror masterpiece. The zombies are...awesome, to say the least. When a few characters are killed by an exploding car, the film continues with a grotesque display of the zombies eating the left over body parts. The actors (especially Duane Jones) did a wonderful job, especially since this was their first movie! The ending, in my opinion, is probably the best ending in any movie of the genre. I won't spoil it for you, but even the grizzly images during the credits will make you think.<br /><br />As for the 30th anniversary edition, I advise everyone who is a fan of this film, or someone who has never seen this film before to avoid it as much as possible. They add a new beginning with two guys driving the casket of the first zombie (the first one we see in the cemetery played by Bill Heinzman) from the prison where he was just executed to the cemetery where he's to be interred. A cheesy bald priest and the parents of the little girl that the dead guy apparently killed are there waiting for the body. The girl's father wants to see his body to make sure...and then spits on it and leaves with the girl's mother. The dead guy stirs, gets up, and bites the priest...then he wanders away leading us to the REAL beginning of the movie. They took out the whole "driving up to the cemetery" stuff from the original, and begin the older footage with Barbara and Johnny stopping and getting out.<br /><br />During the film, they've added a car crash family of zombies, as well as some zombies from the Diner where Ben came from (all played by family members and friends of the "film makers"). Some feeding stuff...nothing big.<br /><br />Finally, at the end, after Ben is shot, they superimpose a "One Year Later" and show some reporter going to visit the cheesy priest in the hospital. He didn't die from his wound, because of "prayer" and crap like that. Oh, and he has a dog named "Mewshew" (not sure if that's the spelling...but that's definitely the pronunciation) that he has so that, in case he DOES turn into a zombie, he can chow down on it rather than some person who's near by.<br /><br />Anyway, it's HORRIBLE. The acting of the new people is just pathetic...especially the priest (who just happened to do the new score for the movie...which was equally horrible). Also, they said how they "seamlessly" intercut the old footage with the new, and how Bill Heinzman looked exactly how he looked back then due to the great make up FX...but that was utter *beep* Very sad. Very pathetic. Avoid it.<br /><br />The original Night of The Living Dead is a true horror classic that should not be missed. Avoid the 30th anniversary edition!<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>In 1968 George A. Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers).  These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head (via gunshot or clubbing).  Naturally these aspects would lead these monsters into being the most common form of canon-fodder in today's video games.<br /><br />In recent years the zombies, due to their stupidity, and the fact that they are easy to kill, have made them nothing more than things for the heroes of a film to blow apart in increasingly gruesome manners (so long as they're zombies the MPAA does not care how the characters go about killing them).  So what is it about Romero's first Dead film that makes these creatures so darn scary?  Two out of the three sequels to this cult classic (the classic Dawn of the Dead, and the more resent Land of the Dead) have used these creatures to create socially satirical environments exploiting human nature, while never bringing real spine tingling moments, the concepts (at least in Dawn) were equally frightening to the horror of Night of the Living Dead, just in a more psychological aspect.<br /><br />How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film?  I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place.  In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability.  They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures.  Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.<br /><br />The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave.  The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man.  Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins.  Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of.  Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.<br /><br />During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar.  There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen.  Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows.  Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will).  In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.<br /><br />I must point out the Ben character played by Duane Jones because he is obviously the star of this film, and for good reason.  Considering this was the 1960s, and racism was still a huge factor throughout the country it feels remarkable to see such a well done performance by an African American actor, with such great intensity, especially with such a low-budget.  He is strong willed, and won't let people change his mind, even to the point of ignorance, but he does so with such passion we, the audience, can't help but side with him as the character, even when he is clearly wrong at times with his decisions.  His survival techniques are not perfect, but with his strong attitude he is able to make the survivors inside the house side with him, over the over-cautious (yet, in all fairness, intelligent) Harry Cooper.<br /><br />This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile.  Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures).  Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor.  How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film?  Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night.  This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen.  If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived.  This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me.  Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it.  Let me put it this way, most classic horror films that truly deserve their status don't scare me when I'm watching them, but end up poking my mind later on in the day (Examples are The Shining and the original Nightmare on Elm Street).  With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.<br /><br />The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today.  This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was).  The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could've easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.<br /><br />Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore.  For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims.  Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet.  The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.<br /><br />This is the best film of the living dead subgenre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film.  The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day.  Though the zombies are most associated with gore, and for the 60s this film surely had it, this is a film with more brain than blood, and that's why it has terrified people for so long, and will continue to do so, even as the creatures continue to become even less threatening through video games and modern interpretations (which happen to be video game based, for the most part).  With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.<br /><br />5/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>If you want to learn the art of making a horror movie, just watch George Romero's macabre masterpiece Night of the Living Dead.  So many times, when it comes to horror, simpler is better, and this is actually a pretty simple film.  It manages to create an atmosphere of rising fear while, at the same time, serving as a veritable study in the psychology of terror.  It also has the perfect amount of humor that makes horror all the more enjoyable to me, and the truly classic ending of the film ranks among my favorite endings of all time.  This ain't Abbot &amp; Costello Meet The Mummy; this is gritty, atmospheric, gutsy horror at its best.  It no longer offers the actual fright that was its bread and butter when it was released in 1968, but it's still nightmarish enough to make many a person squirm in anticipatory dread if nothing else.<p>Who can forget the opening scene of this masterpiece?  A brother and sister drive 200 miles to lay a wreath on their father's grave, with their banter culminating in dear old Johnny's teasing his sister by moaning the words, &quot;They're coming to get you, Barbra.&quot;  Much to his surprise, &quot;they&quot; are coming to get her, and him, and untold numbers of innocent people all throughout the eastern half of the United States.  Barbra (Judith O'Dea) flees to a farmhouse, where she commences to wig out in a quiet, childlike sort of way.  She is soon joined by a young black man named Ben (Duane Jones), who becomes the driving force of the movie.  He begins boarding up the house, getting little help from his near-comatose compatriot, but it turns out that there are also five people already holed up in the cellar.  The meeting of all these minds leads to a bickering marathon, with Ben claiming authority and the measly-mouthed Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) resisting every step of the way.  Trapped inside the house, the band of survivors does have access to radio and television, whereby they learn the extent of the unbelievable epidemic of mass murder and, later, get the news that the killers are recently deceased bodies (who have come to life in a hokey way I'll refrain from mentioning) who share a common passion for cannibalism.  The group's struggle to survive is one of increasing intensity, making for a completely absorbing movie.  Those of a psychological turn of mind can enjoy studying the widely varying reactions of each individual to what is essentially unimaginable terror.  And the ending, as I've said, is just a wondrous thing to behold.<p>You just don't necessarily need a huge budget to make a genuinely scary, classic film.  Just get a bunch of people, throw some pale makeup on them and tell them to walk funny and slow, then hole up a gang of strangers in a house surrounded by your zombies, and you've got the basic ingredients for your very own Night of the Living Dead.  Of course, only a director as talented as George Romero can turn such a film into a masterpiece, which is accomplished in no small degree by his brilliant use of black and white rather than color film.  Night of the Living Dead may well be the most famous zombie film of all time; it is without question one of the best.  If you don't have a copy of this film in your video/DVD library, even this inexpensive, bare-bones version, then your true horror movie addict credentials are a little suspect.  If you see only one zombie movie, Night of the Living Dead should be the one.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Night of the Living Dead is by appearance a timid zombie film in regards to many others that feast in splattering gore and gruesome zombies devouring the flesh of people.  The heroes in the film are just plain old average people found in every town in every state throughout the United States. The film was shot in black and white to save money while the filmmaker George Romeo had a very strained budget that he had to juggle with.  How could this film create such a wave of dedicated supporters for almost four decades while acquiring cult status?<br /><br />Simplicity!  George Romero had to maximize on the budget by simplifying the story and maximizing on aspects that were inexpensive.  The story that Romero co-wrote with John A. Russo illustrates that they were aware of the cost of frequent location changes, as they shot the entire film in a very few locations in an area within driving distance from Pittsburgh.  The choice to shoot the film in black and white accentuated the contrasts within the film and together with efficient use of light produced several haunting moments.  The cast consists of a number of unknown actors, which also increases the genuine atmosphere.  A star would have reduced the authenticity of the atmosphere and probably cost much more as well.  Lastly, the moments of humor within the film add a level of humanity to the film that builds a bridge between the story and its audience.<br /><br />Watching the opening scene at the cemetery is an ingenious move by Romero, as it quickly captures the audience's attention through the symbolical meaning that a cemetery provides in connection with horror films. The trepidation continues to intensify within the scene where a brother spooks his sister with, "The are coming to get you, Barbara. They are coming for you."  Ironically, they are coming to get her and everyone else, as the first stumbling corpse ends up in a struggle with Barbara's brother while she tries to escape.<br /><br />Barbara seeks shelter in an abandoned house where most of the film takes place, as a number of other characters come to seek shelter in the house.  Isolated from civilization with a growing number of uncoordinated corpses trying to find a way inside to gobble on their flesh they begin to fortify the house by barricading the doors and windows.  Some are getting hysterical while others take on leadership roles, as the dead are inching closer to the house under the darkness of the night.  The night is accentuated through the black and white photography, which increases the suspense and anxiety that the film intends to generate.<br /><br />Conclusively, Night of the Living Dead still haunts its audience after more than 30 years of its initial release.  The film even had a 30th anniversary release in 1998.  The zombies might not look as genuine, as in more recent zombie films, but their strange psychomotor dexterity is what helps generate the lingering fear within the audience, as they appear both bizarre and creepy.  Several directors still employ this movement in their zombie films in order to generate a similar result.  Romero created a cinematic experience comparable to a car accident; it is bad but one cannot help but watch as curiosity takes over.  However, this film is far from bad.  It is an illustration of how dedicated work can pay big dividends to those who pursue their visions, and Night of the Living Dead became the beginning of a number of intriguing zombie films by Romero.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Some people are commenting on the 30th Ann. edition and their comments are spilling out onto this version.

Your influential zombie movie came out in 1968 and it still holds up today.  Dozens of walking zombies terrorizing some people trapped in a farmhouse makes for a fun and frightening movie.  This review is of the 40th Anniversary original black-and-white movie DVD, not the one that has both the black-and-white and colorized versions on the same disc.  And not the pitiful 30th Anniversary edition.<br /><br />This 1968 cult classic stars Judith O'Dea, Duane Jones, Marilyn Eastman, Karl Hardman, Judith Ridley and Keith Wayne.  Basically the plot is this:  Zombies have risen from their graves to feed on living humans.  They are chasing (actually slowly stumbling around) people all over about 1/3 of the country.  One of these people being chased is Barbra (Judith O'Dea), who had been with her brother Johnny (Russell Streiner) at a cemetery visiting their father's grave.  Her brother comes into contact with a wandering zombie and dies.  Barbra escapes and comes across a farmhouse where the residents are not there.  She hides inside.  She is shaken and in shock and comes across as being quiet and helpless for most of the movie.  Soon after, Ben (Duane Jones) arrives at the farmhouse in a pickup truck for shelter and a safe haven as well.  In all, seven people (five of which were in the cellar before Barbra and Ben even arrived) are seeking refuge in this farmhouse to try to get away from the swarm of zombies outside.  Ben had arrived at the farmhouse in a pickup truck, but the truck's gas gauge is on empty.  The people inside the farmhouse board up the place and look for an escape route when the opportunity presents itself.  There is a lot of infighting between the people inside the farmhouse.  It gets violent at times.  Some of the people who came in contact with the zombies become zombies themselves.  That's the story in a nutshell.  I don't want to give away too much.<br /><br />The acting in this movie isn't worthy of an Academy Award for anybody, but it's at least adequate or pretty good and the important thing to realize is that this is an independent film with unknown actors.  Barbra is helpless and quiet while Ben is a "take charge" kind of guy.  I find this movie very entertaining and frightening.  It's also very gorey.  Shockingly gorey.  The movie's atmosphere and music are good.  This was truly a groundbreaking movie that paved the way for other zombie films in the decades to come.<br /><br />This 40th Anniversary DVD comes with very good special features, including audio commentary by members of the cast and crew, a feature-length documentary, a Question and Answer session with George Romero, an interview with Duane Jones, the theatrical trailer, a still gallery, and the original script.<br /><br />If you like and appreciate independent horror movies that are low budget but "do the job" and don't have Hollywood's influence, then this movie falls into that category and you should enjoy it.  Very highly recommended.</p></br></body></html>

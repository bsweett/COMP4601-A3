That's a big problem.  Still, while you don't for a minute believe anything that is happening on screen in The Interpreter and the Penn-Kidman chemistry is deader than a dodo, this is a good (in the wonderful Spanish word) "pasatiempo" -- which I roughly translate as "mindless entertainment."</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>THE INTERPRETER was well-acted and pretty to look at, but the story was incomprehensible and vague. I'm still not entirely sure what the heck happened, to be honest. Sean Penn's character is given a ridiculous backstory. The centerpiece bus scene took about 5 minutes too many to set up. And the ending was a dud.<br /><br />My friend Black and I tried our best to discuss it last night, but there wasn't much to discuss.<br /><br />"Could you figure out what was going on?" Black asked me. "I got lost in it really early, and I still don't know what happened."<br /><br />Though I'm not exactly sure happened in the film, with its one to five assassination plots explained away while the pacing seemed so slow, I am sure it was not as well-done as it could've been. The movie needed more time inside the UN, a more coherent plot and a lot more Catherine Keener.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>To be fair, the script has possibilities, but it would take the pacing of Hitchcock's direction and the narrative expressiveness of Jimmy Stewart's acting to save it from becoming perhaps the new millennium's slowest film to date.  Unfortunate, because in a sense all of us are "interpreters" of the actions of others, frequently tempted, moreover, to "over-interpret" by taking the law into our own hands, countering terrorism with vengeful personal righteousness that merely contributes to a terrorist mentality on an ever-widening scale.  The political message is sound; the entertainment value conducive to a sound sleep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>Director Sydney Pollack creates a well-crafted thriller in his film, The Interpreter. Tapping into the global paranoia of a post 9/11 world, the story acts as both a standard political thriller and a rallying call for peace through better communication. The screenplay was written by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank, and Steven Zaillian.<br /><br />When Silvia Broome, an interpreter for the United Nations, overhears a conversation concerning a plot to kill a controversial political leader from Africa, she is thrust into a dangerous world of international intrigue. When she reports what she's heard, no one believes her. When a government agent named Tobin Keller is assigned to uncover the validity of the potential threat, he at first disbelieves Silvia's story... until she herself becomes a target. Then Tobin, who recently lost his wife in an automobile accident, begins to bond with Silvia, who herself has a tragic past and is very familiar with loss. As it becomes clear that there really is a plot, Tobin and Silvia must rely on one another in order to find out who is behind the conspiracy. But the more that Tobin learns of Silvia's past the more apparent it becomes that it was no coincidence that she overheard the conversation to begin with. Is Silvia involved in the plot or was she targeted from the start? And can Tobin protect her from the many dangers that they now face?<br /><br />The film stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as Tobin Keller. The supporting cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, and Curits l'Cook. Director Pollack also has an uncredited role as Chief Jay Pettigrew. The entire cast gives great performances, and Kidman, in particular, gives a powerful sense of loss and moral confusion.<br />While the film may not be Pollack's most impressive directorial effort, it is a remarkable written and acted film with some surprising twists. Unlike most thrillers of this kind, the two main characters never consummate their relationship in a sexual manner. Instead the screenplay allows Kidman and Penn to give subtle performances with nuance and believability. What makes The Interpreter so suspenseful is that we, as an audience, are given time to become emotionally invested in the characters as they are tested emotionally, physically, and morally.<br />Also adding to the believability of the film is the fact that many scenes were actually shot at the United Nations, which had never before allowed a commercial film to shoot within their walls. So in a way, Sydney Pollack has made movie history by earning permission to film there.<br /><br />The DVD includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room featurette, Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen featurette, The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations featurette, and an insightful audio commentary by Pollack.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IRE6">Nick of Time</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F12J0C">The Bourne Trilogy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JN2Z">Collateral</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQUOE">Crash</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO">Lord of War</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C65Z1G">The Constant Gardener</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJF4">The Last King of Scotland</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQFC18">Babel</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGPY">Michael Clayton</a></p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman might have never looked so beautiful as she did playing the haunted UN interpreter Silvia Broome.  And Sean Penn has this masculine arrogance that somehow holds her attention long enough for her to forget about her pressing problems concerning Africa.  I saw this film again last night on cable TV and it was much more confusing the second time around.  Probably should invest in the DVD so I could access the deleted scenes which (maybe) explain everything.  There must be deleted scenes like crazy involving Catherine Keener talking to her agent and listening to the agent explain why she really needed to be in this movie, for they might as well have hired Nicole Richie so little acting ability was needed for her brief scenes with Penn.  Keener's mumbling, thin lipped accent made Nicole Kidman sound almost human.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack must have felt bells clicking in his head when he glimpsed Nicole Kidman and heard a tape of the various accents she has essayed on screen.  Not since Meryl Streep has anyone done so many so promiscously, and it is said that Pollack forcefed Kidman hours worth of tapes of Meryl Streep doing the famous "I had a farm in Africa" opening to OUT OF AFRICA, of which I now consider THE INTERPRETER an unoffical remake.  The implication is that Kidman, and her doomed family the Broomes, are the real inheritors of Africa, and that the black revolutions and counterrevolutions that have destroyed the Broomes are hopelessly evil and subhuman.  Why, Nicole, why?  Maybe you wanted to show you weren't afraid of big issues, but why play an African saint when so many talented black actresses were out there just longing for a big meaty part opposite Sean Penn--and many of them much more able to adopt a whispery Danish slash Dutch accent than you (not to mention playing the flute).  Do the DVD scenes tell us why the screenwriters decided to have her play the flute anyhow?  Was it just to get her back into the building after hours?<br /><br />Couldn't she have just forgotten her Metro Card or her purse or something?  No, no, it had to be musical--tragically musical.  John Garfield spent four months at Juilliard learning to play the piano for HUMORESQUE (1946), but Nicole Kidman learned the flute in under forty-five minutes on the set of MOULIN ROUGE.  Ah, the pace of modern filmmaking!  No wonder she seems to make even more movies than the stars of the Golden Age Hollywood cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Kidman and Penn, what a great idea (truly) to have them together. But. Throw together a plot that is so plodding and boring and convoluted my husband had to wake me up on the sofa.  This film had a few good and interesting scenes, it just took forever to get through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>Long, boring, and incoherent, this is one of those 'global' film experiments that falls flat on its' face. I think Angelina Jolie is the only one that got it right on 'Beyond Borders', but this film takes Aussie Nicole Kidman and places her in the UN, where the poor thing is supposed to convince us that she can speak a variety of languages.<br /><br />The problem is, Nicole sounds like she's speaking Australian English even when shes speaking Swahili, which obviously isn't a good thing. The high power star cast does nothing to clarify the confusing, meandering plot, and by the time the end comes, you're left wondering why it is you're supposed to care. I had more fun watching the unintentionally hilarious 'Original Sin' starring Antonio Banderas.<br /><br />This film looks like it wanted an Oscar so badly, that they got the best director, and cinematographer to work on it. In the process, they forgot to concentrate on the script, and Nicole playing a South African who is 'patriotic' really got on my nerves. Why couldn't they cast a black actress in her role if they really cared? It would have made more sense. In the end, we get the feeling that this blonde, blue eyed beauty is some sort of Africa-loving philanthropist, and I didn't buy that.<br /><br />Next time, they should cast someone really good like Thandie Newton in a role like this, and respect the real crises that Africa is going through, instead of glossing it over and giving us guilt-ridden Caucasians in lead roles that so obviously belong to a black person.<br /><br />Even Two Stars is generous for this narcissistic mess.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>First, adjust your expectations and open your mind and you'll be fine as you watch this first-rate movie. Secondly, could reviewers please separate opinions of Mr. Penn OFFSCREEN from his performance ON SCREEN and just concentrate on the movie, the art itself? No fair panning a movie because you don't like the way a guy conducts himself at the Oscars - or whatever. Thanks.<br /><br />  Now, as to that movie... Nicolle Kidman plays Silvia, a U.N. interpreter and her motives are left somewhat unclear for a good part of his movie. Is she truly someone who has overheard what she should not and is the target of bad guys? Or is she possibly one of the bad guys, with her own, complicated agenda, one she can't own up to?<br /><br /> Penn plays Keller, a federal agent who is sent to figure out what is going on and separate truth from speculation and his emotional tension is palpable. In fact, tension, suspense and paranoia are major elements of this film, which was plenty strong enough to hold my interest.<br /><br /> But I was also riveted by the personal pain of the main characters. Keller has lost his wife, Sivia has lost much of her family (I don't want to give away too much of the plot so I'm being intentionally cryptic here, better you watch it unfurl yourself).<br /><br />  I'm sure the movie will get mixed reviews as it wasn't without flaws (it isn't formulaic and it does challenge the viewer; some people don't like that) but I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me think of the ramifications of all sorts of political scenarios and "what ifs?" and it haunted me for days, burrowing into my subconscious and bringing up ideas and impressions at odd moments. I love films like that, the ones that stay with you long beyond the drive home from the theatre.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter" is intelligent, well intentioned, and stylish but unfortunately lacks an involving narrative and characters one truly cares about.  Maybe it's shallow of me, but I really think this movie needed a little more "punch" and good old entertainment value.  In the end, the film is watchable and interesting (and its dialogue about human rights issues is certainly honorable) but it could have been a lot more.  Fans of sterile, more intellectual thrillers will likely be more forgiving, but I personally like my thrillers to be more, well... thrilling.  The DVD features a crisp, clean widescreen image and generous extras that flesh out many of the issues discussed in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Who says this isn't a well-oiled thriller, its twists may come undone to some but they are far from witless. I saw the denouement three quarters of the way, but in all fairness the screenplay had me engrossed and thinking twice about every bathroom break I needed to take.<br /><br />The script is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest -- United Nations, mistaken identities, intense chases and shadowings -- but Pollack's keen sense of narrative makes sure The Interpreter plays with a full deck.<br /><br />Most refreshing feature: it doesn't tiptoe around political messages despite its Hollywood roots. It audaciously sports a white African as the pivotal character. Anyone who's lived in modern day Africa knows that much of the continent's violence is now instigated by its own indigenous reprobates, not by Apartheid. The leader "Zuwanie" and the fictitious nation of "Matobo" may well be ill-concealed allusions to General Mugabe and Zimbabwe, so the theme should be doubly resonant to those with an eye for current affairs.<br /><br />The script couches several well-meaning lines about war and international politics, and of course, the raison d'etre of the United Nations. I found most of it credible, but caveat emptor to people who are disillusioned by the UN as it stands today: prepare to plug your nose in some scenes.<br /><br />Thankfully, there's a smattering of other reasons to watch this fine production. Aerial shots of NY's streets are slick. James Howard's music employs silence to great effect, building to sensational crescendos when a standoff could be so accentuated. I gather this is the first Hollywood crew to have been allowed access to actual U.N. premises, a privilege that Pollack takes full advantage of.<br /><br />While there is some merit to the gripe that it wallows in its characters' muddy pasts, it crackles in every attempt to unravel who is playing for whom, and more notably, why. Penn and Kidman's chemistry has attracted much commentary, though I was more taken by what keeps them apart than what brings them together.<br /><br />All in all, as balanced and wholesome a thriller as any in recent memory, recommended with unbridled enthusiasm.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely lifeless performance as the interpreter of the title in this curiously flat Sidney Pollack film. THE INTERPRETER is unique as it is the only film ever shot on location inside the United Nations building in New York.<br /><br />Kidman plays Sylvia Broome, a minority White expatriate from a politically torn racially-mixed African nation. Members of her family have died due to the violence in her native land, and other friends and relatives who have remained behind are backing one or another contender for the Presidency of the fictional country. Kidman becomes the centerpiece of a massive international investigation after she ovehears discussion of an assassination plot against the despotic President, who is scheduled to address the United Nations. Sean Penn plays the govenment agent who is assigned to simultaneously protect Kidman, foil the plot, and find out what she really knows and where she really stands.<br /><br />THE INTERPRETER has all the elements to make up a grand espionage drama, but Pollack and the all-star cast fail to ignite this film. THE INTERPRETER should have worked but it doesn't, leaving it the sort of film that cries out for a remake the day shooting wraps. The story plods along at an elephantine pace; the willowy Kidman is too morally ambiguous to gain the audience's sympathy; Sean Penn is convincing but cranky. No one seems to speak over a murmur even at the most dramatic moments. The contrivance of a fictional country is far too quaint for the world-is-the-size-of-a-grape 21st century. In the end, the requisite suspense simply never builds, leaving THE INTERPRETER an intelligent, well-made, well-acted, and supremely boring film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>'The Interpreter' has strong cast, slick direction, and authentic mood (the film being pastly shot in the real United Nations building).  If the film had been shot in the 70s, the incredible story (and especially its ending) might have sounded more plausible.  As it is, with today's more complex political situations surrounding the UN, 'The Interpreter' remains just an OK thriller -- entertaining, but ultimately unbelievable.<br /><br />Of course, you don't have to make everything believable in thrillers, but I point out this obvious thing about reality because 'The Interpreter' starts with an excellent premise.  While in a booth in the UN Headquarter in New York, an  interpreter Silvia Bloom (Nicole Kidman) happens to overhear part of conversation (in one African fictional language Ku), which strongly suggest that one assassination plot is going on.  And that assassination, as she learns later, might happen here, in the UN.<br /><br />Consequently, security agent Tobin Keller is called in, who at first does not buy her story.  However, as the story unfolds, several incidents happen to Silvia, and Tobin starts to guard her with his men, thinking that there is a possiblity that she is still lying to him, or to us audiences.<br /><br />You get two superstars -- Nicole Kidman as UN translator, and Sean Penn as security guard.  Both do not disappoint us, but I must say there is no chemstry between them.  As the film is basically a thriller, well, I can ignore that flaw, but not this one, which is the film's too complicated and incredible story about assassnation.<br /><br />Think about this.  If you're a president of some country, and is being accused of tyranny (I hope you're not!), would you come all the way to New York City where most likely you will not be welcomed?  And when you might be assassinated?  His motive is explained in the end, which -- excuse me for using strong words, but ... which is an insult to our intelligence.  And Nicole Kidman's character, at first a pretty credible one, gradually becomes awfully contrived and even ridiculous (sorry I cannot revela that part).  Do you believe all of her 'past'?<br /><br />Despite the great cast including Catherine Keener, Yvan Attal, Jesper Christensen, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Clyde Kusatsu, and Michael Wright, their characters are all pieces of a big puzzle, which is not uninteresting itself, and considering the complexity of the material, Sydney Pollack did a superb job with his slick direction (as in seen in 'The Firm'), but all in all I was not intrigued by the whole film, of which politics are outmoded, and even silly in this post 9/11 world.  Good acting, lots of suspence, not-so-good story.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>I thought this was a solid, adult suspense thriller, heavy on police procedure and light on romantic cliches. Silvia Broone (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter at the U.N. Her speciality is African languages. One night, when she's in her booth alone overlooking the dark, empty General Assembly, she hears a brief whisper from a wall speaker that suggests a visiting African head of state, a man who has turned into an aged, bloody dictator, will be assassinated. (The opening of the movie establishes the kind of murderous reign he has instituted and is very effective.) Assigned to investigate is Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a member of the Secret Service section that protects visiting dignitaries. Both have tragedies they're dealing with. Most of Broome's family was killed when the dictator repressed everyone who threatened his rule. Keller's wife has just died in a car accident.<br /><br />Sydney Pollack takes us through the development of these two people's characters and lays out the bones of the plot. The race to find the assassins builds upon methodical police investigation, which is complicated by Broome's own ambivalence. There also are one or two red herrings. The settings add a lot of atmosphere and energy to the movie. Much was shot inside the U.N. building and a great deal was shot on New York City streets.<br /><br />There are one or two times when coincidence seems to play a role, but the action happens fast enough that you don't notice this until the movie's over. The only unsatisfying part for me was the conclusion of the assassination plot. There were a few minutes of heavy melodrama involving Broome, Penn and the aged dictator which seemed to me was designed primarily to show that Kidman and Penn were "actors." That aside, I thought this was a fast-paced, professional film that was fun to watch. And there were some fine performances in the secondary roles, especially Catherine Keener as Keller's Secret Service partner and Jesper Christensen as the dictator's head of security.</p></br><a href="../users/A267IXCC7UK1HY.html">A267IXCC7UK1HY</a><br/><p>The story is fine but I find the acting terrible. Sean Penn has just one facial expression throughout: a solemn wrinkled forehead and dead pan. Kidman keeps forever getting her hair to cover her right eye.

Its just one of those films that you can watch, and say OK, and just move on. Its forgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is a high three!!!

Well, it may be by political, but it's anything but thrilling. The Interpreter, with all its trumped-up hype, and its pretensions towards being a "serious" movie for adults, is really just a B grade movie that is dressed up trying desperately to be A grade.<br /><br />There's no doubt The Interpreter is a handsome production, and thematically it comes at an important time with a beleaguered United Nations that is desperately trying to remake itself in a post 9/11 world, but the film all too often gets over-involved in self importance, and ultimately sinks under the weight of a rather plodding exposition and tension that is obviously fake and manufactured.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman (ravishing as usual) plays Silvia Broome, an interpreter at the United Nations. However, Silvia more than just an interpreter, for she possesses a steely resolve that discussion and dialogue are the only way to outwit the guns, violence, and corruption that are fast spreading around the globe. She believes fearlessly in the United Nations because it represents exactly the goals and ideals that she's fighting for.<br /><br />A refugee from the African content of Matobo, Ms. Broome seems to be the embodiment of African suffering - both white and black. And although she has a characteristically European education, her roots and her memories are still with the troubled (and fictional) African nation. Her past is fraught with heartache: her white farmer parents were brutally killed by a despotic regime, and her brother, having just been betrayed, is indiscriminately gunned down at the hands of rebel leaders. Silvia has every reason to be angry and bitter.<br /><br />Matobo is currently ruled by Dr. Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), a corrupt Robert Mugabe-like despot who came to power promising to bring wealth and liberation to the people of Matobo, but soon turned into a genocidal maniac. Zuwanie has misspent the hopes of his people with his ambassadors are now forced to play lip service to an increasingly critical United Nations. The UN member states all agree that he should face some kind of justice, as do his two main rivals who are currently exiled in the U.S. - an old-school socialist (Curtiss I' Cook) and a supporter of capitalist development (George Harris). Both have put aside their differences to oppose him more effectively.<br /><br />The Interpreter begins a few days before Dr. Zuwanie's visit to New York to address the General Assembly. Silvia, returning to the office to retrieve her African flutes, overhears someone plotting to kill him when he makes his speech. Frightened and fearful, she is given some protection in the form of two FBI agents Tobin (a terrific Sean Penn) and Dot (a criminally underused Katherine Keener). Tobin is highly suspicious of Silvia's story and thinks she could be fabricating it  - everything just seems too convenient and to be entirely coincidental.<br /><br />As Tobin digs deeper into Silvia's background he begins to suspect that she is more deeply entangled in Matobo's intrigue than she lets on. She's hesitant to come forth with whom she's been talking to and where she's been. Tobin knows Silvia's emotionally if not politically involved in the country's affairs, but just how much she's involved is one of the big revelations of the story. Both Silvia and Tobin are damaged and grieving people. She's still inconsolable from the death of her family, and he is also dealing with personal tragedy. As their respective heartbreaks become clearer to each other, their relationship deepens, not in a sexual way, but as a kind of mutual exercise in learning how to cope.<br /><br />While Nicole and Sean deliver their trademark dramatically strong performances, much of The Interpreter trundles along desperately searching for an identity. Does the film want to be a savvy, tension-filled political thriller? Is it an exercise in the geopolitics and the sociopolitical machinations of the United Nations? Or perhaps it's a plea to end third world corruption and hardship? This viewer was never really sure.<br /><br />There are some fabulous aerial shots of the Manhattan skyline as Zuwanie's motorcade heads towards the UN Building, but the heavy-handed, and overly dramatic music tends to overwhelm the enjoyment of the vista. And it should be said that the organization's headquarters building on First Avenue at 44th Street in Manhattan is beautifully shot, both from without and within. Darius Khondji's cinematography captures the clean, elegant modernism that at once expresses the building's idealistic purpose and places it in a bygone era of internationalist optimism.<br /><br />There are a lot of manufactured, forced, and gratuitous action sequences mostly in the form of people in suits walking around talking frantically on cell phones and walkie-talkies. Many of the plot twists and turns are also pretty evident early on, and there's a bus explosion that is too obviously inserted into the film to give it some dramatic life (although it is the best-filmed sequence in the movie). Unfortunately, The Interpreter is somewhat of a disappointment, because it just doesn't necessarily incite the bonafide suspense, anticipation, or political intrigue that should be a hallmark of films of this type.

This phrase, we come to learn is an African philosophy that Silvia proclaims to follow.<br /><br />I was on the edge of my seat on the plane as I was watching "The Interpreter" on the Dig-E viewer I had rented from the airline. This is one of the few movies I have seen in the past two years that had me so entranced. In fact, it was the last movie I had seen with Sean Penn in the lead role, which had me this engrossed. Nicole Kidman, as Silvia Broome, a South African transplant to the UN, really stole this movie. Her portrayal of the Interpreter was solid, low key, likeable and brilliant. She was a real person, with emotional trauma, and her response to the conversation she overheard at the UN and its aftermath was real and poignant. Sean Penn, as Toban Kellor, the Secret Service agent whose job it was to protect her and to question her, was low key and right on.<br /><br />This movie takes on a political edge as World Peace and Terrorism is questioned and played out in real life. The opening scene of a traumatic nature is so vivid and unyielding that we understand this is a movie to be reckoned with.  Silvia Broome has a romantic job as an interpreter at the UN. She is good and she is professional. She is living her life of simplicity and as peacefully as she is able. We come to realize that this may be a scam but it is up to Toban Kellor, our hero to delve into the mysteries of this woman. Along the way, we come to learn more about Siliva, her deep, dark secrets. And, we also learn about Toban Kellor and his silent moodiness.  We meet Tobin while he is in a bar, and he unplugs a jukebox to insert his coins and play a song that has meaning to him. One of my all time favorite singers and songs is picked by Toban, and I am suddenly very alert.<br />The song Toban plays on the jukebox when he calls his answering machine is Lyle Lovett's "If I Had A Boat". "Lovett claims that this song is based on a true story. He once tried to ride a pony across a pond. Hopefully it was not a deep pond and the pony was never uncomfortable. As far as we know, Lovett is good with animals and children, and thought it would be easier if he had a boat."<br /><br />"If I had a boat<br />I'd go out on the ocean<br />And if I had a pony<br />I'd ride him on my boat<br />And we could all together<br />Go out on the ocean<br />Me upon my pony on my boat"<br /><br />The drama, action, suspense, mystery and reality of this movie had me hooked from the get go. A story of two people within a larger story of the quest for peace and the reality of terrorism. This is a movie to be enjoyed while on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb. The ending a little unsettling.  All in all, highly recommended. prisrob</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed  inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter", directed by Sydney Pollack, is a very smart political thriller.  Critics have called it an "old fashioned" movie and that it is an "old school" political thriller in the vein of a "Manchurian Candidate".  This is meant as a compliment and high praise.  Being called old fashioned may not seem like a positive thing these days, but when talking about "The Interpreter" the critics are saying that this is a well crafted, well written, well acted film which pays attention to building a believable story where the tension builds and builds.  It all means something and has a point, rather than the flashy style without substance that many of today's films seem to be using.<br /><br />Sylvia Broone (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  She is a white African from the fictional nation of Motobo.  Having to return to the UN late one night to retrieve a bag she left in her booth, she overhears a conversation in the language of Motobo.  Before she believes she is spotted, she hears a whispered discussion talking about an assassination.  She doesn't at first know who the plot is against, but later realizes that the plotters are talking about assassinating the leader of her native Motobo.  When she reports the threat to her superiors, the United States Secret Service is brought in to protect the leader of Motobo when he arrives at the UN.  The agent in charge of this investigation is Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a man dealing with his own pain even as Sylvia seeks to hide her past for reasons she won't reveal.<br /><br />It builds.  Little by little Sydney Pollack gives the viewer a deeper glimpse into the world of Sylvia Broone and who she is.  Keller is suspicious of anything he doesn't understand and Broone does appear to be hiding something.  Little by little we find out more of what is going on in this movie and the tension grows and grows.  Younger filmmakers can learn something from Sydney Pollack.  He doesn't play all of his cards right away but gives enough that the audience remains engaged.  Nothing in this movie is clear cut, and nothing is the way we initially perceive it to be.  Pollack keeps us guessing long enough through the movie, but without insulting our intelligence by throwing swerve after swerve.  Sure, there is a twist or two, but that much has to be expected.<br /><br />It must be noted that this is the first film which was given permission to actually film within the United Nations Headquarters, and the UN itself feels like a character.  Even Alfred Hitchcock was denied permission to film there.  Pollack is respectful of the mission and the work of the UN while still expressing reservations about the shortcomings and shortsightedness of the organization.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" is a very good movie, and a very smart movie.  In a week where the other big movie is the remake of "The Amityville Horror", "The Interpreter" is a welcome breath of fresh air in what has otherwise been a fairly dull season for movies.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>We suspend disbelief all the time. But the ending is plain insulting. That a character could hide, as suggested here, just ruins the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This complex thriller concerns U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), who grew up in a war-torn African country, now ruled by dictator Dr. Zuwanie.  She overhears (or does she?) a plot to kill Zuwanie at the UN in three days.  Secret Service agent Keller (Sean Penn) is assigned to protect her and to see if she has any involvement in the plot.  He learns Silvia was active in the anti-Zuwanie movement back home, where her parents and siblings were killed by him.  As the day of Zuwanie's appearance at the U.N. approaches, several attempts are made on Silvia's life.  But is she an innocent caught up in a political storm or is she an assassin?<br /><br />Kidman is great as the mysterious interpreter who is filled with her grief and her ideals, and maybe is not what she seems.  Penn gives a refreshingly understated performance as a dedicated agent and recently-bereaved husband.  The script avoids a clich&eacute; romance between the two stars, but shows their connection to be heartfelt, nonetheless.  Filmed entirely in New York City, there is a constant sense of danger, helped by an intense and energetic soundtrack.  This movie is not particularly scary or violent, but succeeds because of the fine acting of the two stars and a script that makes you pay attention and think about what you are watching.  Heartily recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Filmed in the superb building of the ONU, this film has overthrown possibly all the similar films, due its absorbing character.<br />A President of an African nation, has developed behind this mask of victim role, a very well built stage to trick the whole world his countless murederers beneath the well known argument of the National Security.<br />There are so many analogies with many nations in the world pitifully, but this compelling film focuses about not only the gradual process of political puzzle, but its inner and even outer consequences; that's the case in Silvia Brome who has lived the hell before her eyes, and tries by all means to guarantee the peace and the justice in her beloved country.<br />The long arm of the policial investigation will come perhaps with certain delay, and so meanwhile we will be the silnet witeness of a turbulent web of scandal, corruption, double cross and betray of the highest order.<br />Sean Penn will be the assigned officer whose mission will be working out as the bodyguard of Silvia while certain facts don't fit in her previous confession. She states she listened a whisper in which she has known about a possible attempt of homicide on the figure of the President, but someone watchs her and the tension acqires a multidimensional complexity.<br />Sidney Pollack made at last a solid, realist and passionate drama without restrictions playing hard with such script loaded of violence and undeniable actuality.<br />Don't miss it under any circumstance this overhelming picture!</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter for the United Nations who accidentally overhears a conversation she thinks is linked to a possible assassination plot.  Sean Penn is the Secret Service agent assigned to investigate and/or protect her - it's never completely clear.  The movie holds together well for about the first hour, beginning with a tense scene set in Africa.  Gradually, we learn about Kidman and Penn's characters.  Penn is initially skeptical of Kidman's claims, which adds some nice tension.  However, the plot shifts dramatically during a confusing bus ride, and the movie's believability subsequently went out the window for me.  The script for "The Interpreter" reeks of doctoring - indeed Scott Zallian (Schindler's List) and others were supposedly brought in for re-writes.<br /><br />A major problem aside from the muddled plot is that Nicole Kidman's character is quite remote.  It's hard to sympathize with her when you never have any idea what she's thinking or feelings.  In this respect, her work and character here reminded me of her movie released just prior, the dismal "Birth."  Penn is solid in his role, but he's certainly had more to work with in other recent films (Mystic River, 21 Grams).  Unfortunately, the brilliant Catherine Keener is wasted in yet another movie.  Her role is generic, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason for when she appears.  She seems to be Sean Penn's partner, but then he seems to work alone quote a bit.  Anyway, she's sadly wasted here.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" made a bit of press as the first major release filmed at the United Nations.  This setting does help with a few scenes, particularly those featuring the General Assembly.  However, many of the U.N. scenes consist of stairwells or small offices, even a bathroom.  The overall effect is probably not worth the hassle, as Sidney Pollack reportedly had to fight voraciously for permission to film there.  Speaking of Pollack, "The Interpreter" is only his second film in the last decade, following the bomb, "Random Hearts."  Pollack was one of the most talented directors working from the late 60s (The Shoot Horses, Don't They?) through the mid-80s (Out of Africa), so it's somewhat perturbing to see him floundering with a mediocre thriller.  He has even contributed to this genre previously with the far superior "Three Days of the Condor" (1975); even "The Firm" (1993) is arguably better.<br /><br />In sum, "The Interpreter" is a decent thriller and time-filler, although it is rather old-fashioned in its storytelling and pacing.  In that respect, it has the feel of a 1970s thriller, although a weak one at that.  Extras include an unremarkable alternate ending and a very sedate director's commentary from Sidney Pollack.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Just got done watching The Interpreter and I must say, it just lacked something. I really like Nicole Kidman and think she is a good actress. I also like Sean Penn in most of the work he has done and Katherine Keaner. But this movie just wasn't that good. First I found no chemistry between Penn and Kidman which would have been fine if they wouldn't have tried to throw in this stupid connection or love story with them. If it would have just been cop and the person he was protecting/suspecting it wouldn't have been bad that they didn't click together. They for some reason decide that Penn, who has only met this woman a day or two before and thinks that she may be a conspirator and possibly an assassin, for no reason at all is going to bear his soul to this complete stranger about his wife being killed just recently and how much he loved her and wanted her back and that she was coming back (which they show you by having him listen to his answering machine with a message from her saying she was coming back right before she was killed and how much he despised the guy she ran off with). No we are suppose to believe that he would tell somebody he doesn't even know this and show this total vunerable side of himself to a stranger but we are also suppose to believe that even though he is grieving the woman he loved more than anything and that she has just recently been killed that he immediately is falling for a woman that could be a killer. This is just forced, stupid and adds nothing to story but actually adds more time and makes it even more bogged down. If it would have been Kidman being a master manipulator and playing on Penns vunerablilities and using him, fine. But this was just crap that hollywood feels they have to add so they can have some love story that doesn't even need to be there.<br /><br />The pace of the movie is also slow. There are also so many African politicians, rebels, security, bodyguards and FBI, Secret Service, cops, survielance and UN Officials and interpreters that were unremarkable that I had a hard time remembering who was who. Keaner was also underused and simply a character that could have been really interesting but was basically just somebody that could say, "are you alright?" and "you need to go home" to Penn every other time she spoke.<br /><br />Its worth watching once but I really wish I would have rented it and not bought it. I wouldn't recommend it. Not one of Penn or Kidmans best efforts but that may be because of the story and direction which was a suprise cause Sydney Pollak (who makes his usual cameo) is usually very good and right on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>It is the slowest dullest movie to hit the screens in recent times.  Kidman plays an Interpreter working at the United Nations who overhears an assination plot.  From there the film just goes downhill, and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. Sean Penn acts like he doesnt really want to be there, and Kidman is unconvincing as the South African.  The other problem with the film is that it goes on for too long!<br /><br />To market the film, they have plasted Sidney Pollack as Director all over it (as if it guarantees a sure-fire hit) and the fact that it was filmed in the United Nations Building.<br /><br />I really wanted to enjoy the film but found it uninteresting, dull and a big try-hard.  Definitely one viewing is enough.  Can't understand the box office bliss that it got on its opening weekend.  Assume it was because nothing else was on.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Late one night, Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a United Nations translator, returns to her booth high above the floor of the General Assembly, to retrieve a bag she left behind. She overhears two men talking about an assassination plot involving the genocidal dictatorial leader of Mobatu, a small African country. The next day, she learns that this same leader is coming to the UN to address the General Assembly on Friday. She reports what she heard and Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) are the Secret Service agents assigned to the case. At first, Silvia assumes that she is going to be protected; she thinks that the men having the conversation may have seen her. But Keller soon explains that it is the Secret Service's job to protect the foreign dignitary in question. Not her.<br /><br />So begins "The Interpreter", the new film from Sydney Pollack. Pollack is the director behind such films as "Out Of Africa", "Three Days of The Condor" and "The Firm". It is one of his better films, but still lacks a few elements to help it join "Condor" in the top tier of great movie thrillers.<br /><br />Actually, the film begins in Mobatu. It is almost eerie how closely this scene resembles some of the recent headlines out of Iraq. This memorable prologue helps to quickly and efficiently establish the people and place the remainder of the film is about.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are both great. Kidman plays Broome, a woman who grew up in the small country of Mobatu and then lived in a number of European countries, making her a perfect candidate for a UN interpreter. At one point, Keller says `she is the UN' referring to her training and upbringing. Throughout the story, Kidman walks a fine line, balancing opposing parts of her character, which is quickly called into question. Keller has trouble believing that she overheard two people, late at night, talking into a microphone, on the floor of the General Assembly, in a language that only Silvia and a handful of others understand, talking about the assassination. As he digs further into her background and motivations, Kidman walks a fine line between victim and instigator, diplomat and revolutionary, helpless and in charge. These shades of her character are revealed gradually, as her back-story unfolds, lending a subtlety to the performance. Also, the film occasionally backtracks, as Keller's investigation proceeds, and Broome's character changes even further. The character and the performance are equally complex, adding great depth to the story.<br /><br />Penn plays Keller, a by-the-book agent for the Secret Service who has just returned from leave. He is experiencing some troubles in his life and his boss (Sydney Pollack, in a cameo) isn't sure he is ready to return to work. Preferring to stay busy, he wants to be out of his apartment as much as possible, going so far as to sleep on the couch of his office. The interesting thing about this character is that Keller is experiencing the same sort of feelings Broome has experienced many times in her life. In one of their conversations, she reveals how the people of Mobatu deal with similar problems and this seems to give Keller a degree of comfort.<br /><br />Thankfully, the filmmakers shied away from making these two characters lovers. Keller does bond with her, but he simply wants to protect her and figure this whole puzzle out. Naturally, Broome is drawn to Keller, but only because he is her protector. It is a relationship of convenience and provides some interesting conversations.<br /><br />Catherine Keener's Dot Woods is a memorable sidekick. Keller's partner, she is the equivalent of the comic relief character that all agents of the FBI, DEA, Police department, etc. have in films. But Keener's character is more intelligent, her remarks are more deeply observed and she doesn't live to provide comic relief. Woods is the longtime partner of Keller, it almost seems as though they can read each other's thoughts, and she knows a lot about him and his problems. This knowledge is what leads to her `witty remarks' and they also help us to learn more about each character.<br /><br />All of Sydney Pollack's films are created with the highest quality craftsmanship. They look great, the editing is superb, and the locations are real and believable. These films are crafted with skill and love by people who love to make films. "The Interpreter" is no exception. The fact that Pollack was granted access to film within the UN speaks volumes. Hitchcock didn't get this when he was making "North By Northwest". This adds an element of authenticity and interest to the story, especially when Keller and Woods uncover security problems within the institution. Why would the UN allow a story about security breeches to be filmed within it's walls? Of course, the story is fictional, and I strongly doubt all of it would be as easy as it seems, but it seems a bit strange.<br /><br />The film contains a terrific set piece, more or less halfway through, which serves to ratchet up the suspense a couple of notches. As we watch this scene unfold, we believe that it could happen, because all of the elements leading up to it have been planted throughout.<br /><br />One complaint is that this is the highpoint of the film, and it happens too early. The final showdown at the UN is good, but doesn't have the bang that the earlier scene does. These two scenes, and the scene at the beginning of the film, set in Mobatu, serve as bookends for the more dialogue heavy scenes. Because the middle scene is so good and the other two are more subdued, it makes the film seem slightly uneven.<br /><br />My other complaint is that the pace, at times, could best be described as `languid'. In "Out of Africa", the pace works for the story. We watch the characters build a life on a coffee plantation in Africa. They work hard and when they are not working, they relax and talk. It adds a beautiful element to this outstanding romance. In "The Interpreter", a thriller, the same pace slows things down considerably. Shaving ten minutes out of the running time might have improved the pace of the film considerably, and improved the film as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, "The Interpreter" is the type of intelligent, though-provoking thriller that adults crave. If only it had delivered a little more bang for the buck.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>Non-stop suspense is the order with Sydney Pollack's deftly directed "The Interpreter" as Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, two talented Oscar winners, interact fluidly in a film that, in addition to entertaining, has a good deal to say about the current international political scene.<br /><br />Kidman, a United Nations interpreter who has come to New York in hopes of working for peace, overhears a telephone conversation in which two men talk about assassinating a controversial African head of state.  Kidman is one of the few people in town capable of understanding the conversation since the language is that of her home country, an African nation headed by a ruthless strongman who was once a popular military leader but was corrupted ultimately by power and turned against his own people.<br /><br />Sean Penn, in the midst of tragedy following his wife's death only three weeks earlier, works in a special branch of the Secret Service. When asked to investigate Kidman's revelation he is initially skeptical, but when activities begin heating up and an African is killed by his roommate he realizes that danger lurks.<br /><br />Circumstances are compounded by the fact that the UN wishes to pursue legal means through the International Criminal Court and that an assassination could make the victim a martyr in the eyes of the people of his nation and further compound instability there.  In the interim the dictatorial strongman is on his way to the UN to address the General Assembly in hopes that he can sway negative public opinion in his direction.<br /><br />As the story develops it becomes clear that Kidman has a personal stake in the outcome of the emerging tragedy beyond being a citizen of the nation in question.  It is learned that the dictator victimized her family, and that previously she along with so many of the nation's citizenry had admired him greatly.<br /><br />As the film nears its breathtaking climax Kidman has an opportunity to speak with the dictator.  The question is whether she will attempt to deal with him on her own rather than letting international law take its course.  Penn is on the scene and uses his influence to steer matters to a peaceful conclusion in which legality will prevail.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The Interpreter is an extremely packaged political thriller that contains only a little punch.  Unfortunately the good acting can't overcome the weak script. I felt like the story was still a 2-3 drafts short of being ready for the screen. The biggest problem was that there are plot holes you could drive a truck through. I also felt the movie dragged through most of the middle as they tried to develop the strained relationship between the principle characters.  If you are a plot-driven movie fan, as I am, the movie is likely to be a disappointment.<br /><br />Even though "The Interpreter" was enjoyable the ending was definitely a disappointment. It wasn't that it was necessarily wrong, just that you knew what was coming.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>I should have guessed that Sean Penn and Hollywood would become increasingly unable to make good decent film without using them as a springboard for their political views (most of which are wrong of course).<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film and only gave it 2 stars because of Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />The story plods along SLOWLY and PAINFULLY with no tension, no anxiety.... in fact, you dont care for any of the characters in the least.<br /><br />This feels like on of those 70s films like "All the Presidents Men" that simply puts you to sleep.<br /><br />Lost of talk and attempts at creating a storyline about attempting to stop the supposed assassination of some tyrannical leader of a 3rd world country.<br /><br />It's hard to care to much if he gets knocked off or not.<br /><br />Penn and Kidman's characters seem stilted and stiff.<br /><br />Simply put...... the film has ZERO suspense, ZERO tension, and stirs ZERO interest for the characters.<br /><br />It simply does not come together and WORK like a good "magical movie" like Shawshenk Redemption, Door to Door, Straight Story or other great non-action movies do.<br /><br />A high budget clunker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>Sydney Pollack? N.Kidman and S.Penn? Does such heavy artillery need to be utterly wasted in order to make a remarkably boring film? Questions, questions...And who wrote the excuse for a script for this? Whoever it was he/she needs special mention. One needs talent to write something as low quality as this.<br /><br />  Nitty gritty time. A blond woman (guess who) is being hunted by bad, bad, bad african characters who work for a corrupt, corrupt, corrupt african leader from an imaginary country which according to the script has a major blond and/or white  population but is otherwise in no way connected or influenced/manipulated by the west. This was by the way a touch i seriously loved. Kudos to the scriptwriter again.<br /><br />  A black haired cop (guess who) comes in to save the blond african girl (the tears, the tears). The blond african girl is an interpreter who -we're told speaks "Koo" but in the process of the film winds up speaking several other languages in a moment's notice. Now, pay attention, the blond african girl overhears some bad Koo-speaking black Africans plotting the assasination of the soon to come to the U.N to give a speech in English bad African leader of Kurduboo (or something like that, the country is fictional) who also speaks Koo. Koo is very trendy in the film.<br /><br />  This sets off the slowest hunt in the history of bad movie making. The bad Koos chase the good Koo and the Brooklyn accented copper almost learns Koo himself in the process cuzz he spends more time doing the Koo thing with the blond african girl than anything else. Oh no, this doesn't mean they get to do the hot thing if you get my drift. But they sure beat it a lot around the Koo bush trying to get there. Confused? Hey, it's not me, that's the film i'm describing here.<br /><br />  A bus explodes, some more Koo gets spoken, Penn and Kidman seem to be undetered in their quest for the slowest advancing romance ever, and the world meets in the U.N to hear some more Koo. You get the picture.<br /><br />  I really dont know (not sure i want to either) why actors of such caliber chose to participate in a heavily disguised mediocre comedy such as this. I suspect in horror they thought the script was good. But i dont want to believe it. The film is promoted as a "political thriller". It's neither political nor does it thrill. It fails even as a comedy. It fails in fact in so many aspects you can easily lose count. But it sure inspires you to write about it.<br /><br />  As a last note i'll say this. The holes in the story were only outmatched in number by the sheer size of them. In a display of pure professionalism the scriptwriter kept the biggest hole for the very last scene where the entire security force of the U.N watches Kidman through a camera hold a gun to the head of someone (plus breach all levels of U.N security in the process) only to walk breasy-easy free afterwards cuzz she was doing the right thing.<br />Brilliant, simply brilliant.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>It takes itself a bit too seriously.  The casting is far stretched also.  A silly piece of work.<br /><br />Halle Berry would have been perfect in the role of Sylvia, but Nicole Kidman?  She is supposedly African, with an African lover, and in all the photographs within the movie and among all the other people shown as her countrymen in the USA, she is the only one who is not black.<br /><br />There is no credibility on any count, whether the casting or the very, very weak story.  Neither are the views of Manhattan, particularly in the last scene where it looks like a pastel backdrop rather than a view of the east side of the island.

Everyone involved in the production - from writer to director to actor - seems to be just going through the motions here.  In the inevitable romantic scenes, Penn and Kidman generate zero charisma together, and Keener is essentially wasted in her role as Penn's unsmiling, cynical partner.<br /><br />On second thought, there is one aspect to "The Interpreter" that might, be deemed offensive by some - and that is the film's willingness to use sensitive topics like genocide and terrorism as mere window dressing for what is, when all is said and done, a pretty lightweight whodunit confection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>I liked it better last year when it was called The Manchurian Candidate...and even that wasn't so hot<br /><br />Everyone seemed to like Kidman in this, I thought she was trying too hard.

I was expecting a classy thriller, what I got a watered-down, pretentious 2-hour bomb. I like Kidman but when was the last time she did a movie that was actually good?! And what is so great about director Sydney Pollack? He is highly over-rated.Avoid this disaster, you will be fast-forwarding this one to end just to see the pointless and stupid ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is the type of movie that you need to see on DVD instead of the theater because it is hard to follow and you may need to re-watch earlier scenes several times to understand everything.<br /><br />The beginning scene is pretty hard to watch because two guys are slaughtered by some kids.  You know that somehow this scene will have a bearing on the movie.  The next scene shifts to the UN and Silvia (Nicole Kidman), is working as an interpreter during a session.  There is an issue with one of the metal detectors not functioning so the security force shuts down the building until they can check that nothing has been snuck in (of course something was snuck in but we will only find out at the end).  For some strange reason Silvia needs to stay late (apparently to retrieve her flute) and hears a conversation in the seemingly empty conference hall.  Surprisingly it is in an African language which just happens to be her native tongue.  It implies an assassination attempt on the heard of her country (How does a woman with an Austrailian accent happen to be a native African?).<br /><br />Sean Penn portraying a secret service agent is called in to investigate and initially does not believe Silvia.  As the story goes on we now that Penn is saddened by the recent death of his wife and Silvia, by the slaughter of her family in Africa.  Everything in this movie is not what it seems to be and anyone that might have seen The Manchurian Candidate can later figure out what will happen.<br /><br />I found this movie very slow and disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KG8WLR1AKO12.html">A2KG8WLR1AKO12</a><br/><p>The Interpreter's utopian perspective of the United Nations provided by Sydney Pollock and his crew doesn't pass the laugh test.  Never mentioned is the real one's financial corruption and consistent kowtowing to dictators.  There are even a couple of snide remarks regarding the United States' decision not to fully comply with the UN war criminal courts and how most of the world supposedly (and implicitly with good reason) hates us.  All of the UN officials come across as benevolent and more than willing to bluntly confront national leaders suspected of genocide.  These people are remarkably efficient and relentless in the pursuit of world justice and peace.  Leni Reifenstahl would have been proud. Pollock lacks her genius ability to frame a shot, but he's the late film maker's equal as a propagandist.  This film is pure liberal propaganda.  Of course, what should one expect?  Sean Penn is an unapologetic spokesman for the radical Left.  There's no way that this ideologue would not push his peculiar point of view.  How did the investors get suckered into putting their money into this project?  Couldn't they sense a train wreck in the making?<br /><br />The plot is overly complicated and implausible.  The relationship between Sean Penn as a secret service agent and Nicole Kidman as the UN interpreter seems inauthentic.  Sparks do not fly between these two individuals.  Conservatives will shun The Interpreter, and liberals will feel uncomfortable with the violence. The latter prefer not to know that evil people truly exist. Political moderates will leave the theater bewildered and dissatisfied.  In two weeks, this film will be on its way to the video stores.  Nobody involved in this project will receive an Academy Award nomination.  Some things are best quickly forgotten.  This is definitely the case with The Interpreter.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>Sean Penn comes off as a real doofus in this film.  Is he asleep throughout?  Kidman does a wonderful job as the interpreter, she is beautiful and believable.  We believe she is frightened, but Penn seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Keller.  Hello?  Somebody smack him awake, this beautiful woman's life's in danger!!<br /><br />I was really disappointed in Sean Penn's performance.  He failed to pull out some real emotion and compelling character.  He's not even believable as the grieving widower.<br /><br />Sadly, a forgettable film. Kidman's performance was wasted.  No action, slow pace, needed more suspense, a car chase, or something.  I've seen episodes of Fox's '24' that were more of a thrill!  The bus scene was THE highlight of the film.  The Interpreter is surely not in the class of "Three Days of the Condor", "Ronin", or even "Bourne Identity".</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter" is an excellent movie. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, an African-born U.N. interpreter who overhears a conversation about a plot to assassinate the dictator of Matobo. Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is then assigned to protect Silvia and crack the case.<br /><br />This is a great suspense thriller with an interesting and witty plot. It's also a psychological drama of sorts: Tobin and Silvia are both coping with personal losses while trying to deal with the stressful situation at hand. Kidman and Penn are both amazing Oscar-winning actors, and they turn in amazing performances in this film.<br /><br />My favorite thing about "The Interpreter" is that it is the only feature film that has ever been shot on location inside the United Nations. It was great to see the details of these famous and somewhat intimidating government buildings and watch this exciting story unfold. (There are also some really great scenes shot in the streets of New York as well.)<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about this movie was the ending. Silvia kind of flips out at the end of the film, and although she definitely has clear motivation for what she does, I had a hard time buying into the fact that she wigged out to such an extreme, and also that her little speech to the dictator appeared to have such a profound effect on him. The story wraps up pretty nicely at the end, though, so that one little inconsistency can easily be forgiven.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller: good movies are hard to find these days, and "The Interpreter" is definitely one you don't want to miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter" has the distinction of being the first commercial movie to be filmed inside the United Nations building in New York City. The UN Charter prohibits commercial use of the building, but director Sydney Pollack was able to get permission to film from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on the grounds that the film's themes support the UN mission. It helps that "The Interpreter" was able to film on location inside the UN, as that building's huge open spaces and natural light improve the film's aesthetics considerably and would have been impossible to recreate. The premise is that Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), a simultaneous interpreter at the UN, overhears a conversation about an attempt on the life of Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), President of the fictional African nation of Matobo, who is scheduled to give a speech before the General Assembly. Secret Service Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) of the Dignitary Protection Squad, and his partner Agent Woods (Catherine Keener), are assigned to protect Zuwanie and to investigate Silvia's claim. Even when it becomes clear that her life is threatened, Silvia's politics concerning Zuwanie and her involvement in the drama are still suspect.<br /><br />Silvia Broome and Tobin Keller are not what I'd call well-written characters, but Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn give them more weight than lesser actors would. Silvia has a bizarre, unidentifiable accent. The character has one British and one white African parent. A South African accent would seem appropriate, but that's not what she has. The Matoban language "Ku", which Silvia translates, was created for the film at the South African Language Institute in London. It is a cross between Swahili, commonly spoken in East Africa, and Shona, a language of Southwestern Africa. "The Interpreter" is a suspense/thriller, so what the characters and audience don't know is what makes it work. Edmond Zuwanie's enemies may want him dead, but his supporters also want to prevent his speech at the UN, so it's anybody's guess which camp the assassin might come from. Silvia Broome is far from disinterested in the politics of Matobo, her home nation, but is she acting on her interests or her ideals? Those are the questions that keep everyone guessing. "The Interpreter" isn't a great thriller. It didn't have a script -or rather, the script was written as they were shooting, and it shows. But if you're looking for a reasonably entertaining film featuring talented stars, "The Interpreter" fills the bill. 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2005): Bonus features include a less probable Alternate Ending (3 minutes), 3 deleted scenes (2 minutes), 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In "Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room" (10 minutes), the director talks about what he likes about directing, the challenges of filmmaking, and shooting this film without a script. "Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen" (5 minutes) is Pollack's explanation of why he objects to pan and scan. "The Interpreter" is the first film Pollack has shot in wide screen in a long time, as he felt compelled to shoot in full screen format because his movies were being panned and scanned for television and video. "The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations" (8 minutes) talks about shooting inside the UN building. "A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters" (8 minutes) is an interesting look at the challenges of simultaneous interpretation, explained by Diana Liao, Chief of the Interpretation Service at the UN, and Brigitte Andreassier-Pearl, Chief of the French section of the Interpretation Service at the UN. The audio commentary by director Sydney Pollack is sporadic, with long lulls, but it is interesting. Pollack discusses the intention of the scenes on which he comments, what he added after shooting and took out in editing and why, story, locations, and some technical challenges. Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish and French. Captions are available in English. Dubbing is available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QHM5HBSIXRL4.html">A2QHM5HBSIXRL4</a><br/><p>I think in many directors' hands, "The Interpreter" would be run-of-the-mill stuff.  Thankfully, Sydney Pollack isn't run-of-the-mill quality.  He's crafted a really suspenseful and - in my mind - realistic thriller that keeps you fully engaged throughout the entire film.  [And, I might add, Pollack - as usual - acts here as well and he's as engaging on camera as he is talented behind it.]<br /><br />Now, I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan ("To Die For" aside), and the coquettish whisper in which she delivers every line in this film is certainly distracting. Thankfully, Pollack gets solid performances from Catherine Keener, Sean Pean, George Harris (on a roll after "Layer Cake") and the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.  Christensen, in particular, makes the film in my estimation.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy, you're never quite sure.  [In fact, in the 'Deleted Scenes' on the DVD, you can see Pollack stripped out a couple of scenes that give away some of Christensen's character and motivations too early.  That's a master touch because the end product keeps you guessing without losing any of the narrative drive.]<br /><br />At the heart of tale woven by Pollack is the story of African dictator 'Zuwanie,' as portrayed by the regal (and then-88-year-old!!) Earl Cameron, a dictator in the Mobutu mold (colonial liberator slowly morphing to repressive, gun-toting dictator).  Will he be killed on an upcoming trip to the UN (as Kidman's character has overheard) or will a staged and failed assassination attempt consolidate and strengthen his hand back home (as Harris' 'Kuman-Kuman' suggests)?  Again, Pollack's editing is what keeps the balls in the air on this question and it'll keep you hooked until the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>The Interpreter, I thought, was a very interesting story about assasination plots within the U.N. and whehter or not people can believe the threat as true. Nicole Kidman gave a great performance as the lead character in this movie. It's not flat acting seen, but just the personality of the character who is very stressed out at this point of the movie. Sean Penn also did a great job as the agent trying to figure out the truth. It being filmed in the U.N. makes this film really unique and realistic, especially with the protestors outside that add an extra touch to this film. Overall, this movie is worth seeing. It may not be the greatest movie created, but it is still a very interesting one if you like good drama and stories about the government.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>It's always a nice surprise when movies turn out better-than-expected. The Interpreter, thanks to Nicole Kidman, was not just thoughtful, but involving. As with anything having Sean Penn in it, it was somewhat top-heavy in the 'message' department, but Kidman's elfin grace saved the day. Her portrait of a 'white' woman-and fair-haired as well; which kind of drives home the point-whose 'home' is a country where white skin is a cause of social displacement, discrimination and alienation, was understated and therefore effective. By comparion, Penn was ponderous and colorless; which is possibly as it should have been. His character, despite a contrived background that served mainly as a tool for some contemplative philosophy of life and death, remained essentially shallow and undemanding.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was uneven, but in this instance that was an asset. There was too much heavy stuff in here, which required some down-time on the part of the audience. All in all, the dosage was well measured and applied judiciously.<br /><br />For those who wonder, after they saw the movie, just what exactly was the 'point', or what it was all 'about'-apart from it being a political polemic, which, of course and sadly, it was to a large extend...<br /><br />Well, it's all in the ending-which in this movie does wrap things up, showing up the dismal and near-uncrossable gulf that will always exist between people who have something to live for and those who basically don't.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman plays a United Nations interpreter who overhears a plot to assassinate a dictator from her native country in Africa, where her family was brutally murdered.  Sean Penn is the CIA agent assigned to the case.  At first, he doubts Kidman's story and he subjects her to a lie detector test.  The U.S. security agencies are determined that an assassination will not take place on U.S. soil, but it is difficult to tell the good guys (or in Kidman's case, girls) from the bad ones.  This is a well-done movie with plenty of political intrigue and a growing relationship and mutual sharing of grief between Kidman and Penn.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>The premise in this tightly wrought thriller directed by the very accomplished Sydney Pollack is that Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the old dictator (once "freedom fighter") of an African nation called "Matobo" is coming to New York to make a speech in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter at the UN, overhears part of a conversation after-hours that leads her to believe that there will be an assassination attempt on the leader's life.  She tells security.  Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is called in to investigate and help prevent an assassination.<br /><br />Keller quickly discovers that Silvia is from Matobo where her parents were murdered by some of Zuwanie's henchmen and where she was subsequently involved in some political/paramilitary activities.  Two questions that Keller must answer are, does she have some sort of motive to lie and how is she involved?<br /><br />The problem with the film (aside from some of the usual improbabilities and contortions found in Hollywood thrillers--and to be honest there weren't that many in this one) is the ending.  Without giving anything away, the probability of Zumanie being left alone after what had happened is something like zero.  But the real problem is what happens between Tobin and Silvia at the end.  They are both very available and after they have had the opportunity to bond under very difficult circumstances, can you guess how their relationship is resolved?  I understand there was an alternative ending.  Maybe Pollack should have employed it.<br /><br />Pollack's films going back several decades are characterized by diversity of subject matter, excellent scripts, and star power.  Four of his best are They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969) (depression ear dance marathon drama starring Jane Fonda); Tootsie (1982) (romantic comedy starring Dustin Hoffman); Out of Africa (1985) (adapted from the famous book by Karen Blixen under her pen name "Isak Dinesen," starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford); and Sabrina (1995) (splendid remake of the Audrey Hepburn film this time starring Julie Ormond and Harrison Ford).  But he tends to like action/adventure as much as comedy or drama.  He is one of filmdom's most versatile directors, and this film, while not his best, is very representative of his work.<br /><br />But what carries the film is the charisma of the stars, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, especially Kidman who seems the very impersonation of what an interpreter at the UN might be.  She manages to be delicate but tough, thoroughly professional and beautiful.  I have seen her in seven or eight films and can say that she is as talented as any actress currently working.  In her ability to concentrate and to completely immerse herself in a role she is comparable to Meryl Streep.  Some early films of hers that display her youthful vitality and the natural sophistication and nuanced manner of her style are Dead Calm (1989), Flirting (1991), and To Die For (1995).<br /><br />By the way, "Matobo" is not an actual nation but is the name of a national park in Zimbabwe and as far as I can tell "Ku" is not an actual language.  (I have no idea what they were speaking.)<br /><br />Bottom line: Can a film directed by Sydney Pollack starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn be anything but worth seeing?</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman (Dogville, The Hours, To Die For) plays Sylvia Broome, an Interpreter for the U.N. who over heard something up in the booth that she works in that may have been an assassination on the president of Matobo, Zubwanie.

The pace is quick, the general premise interesting, and the actors excellent, but in the end the movie is just good, not great.<br /><br />The main character is Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter working for the United Nations, who lived a long time in Motobo. One day, Silvia returns to the interpreters' booth in order collect some things she forgot, and by chance hears some conspirators whispering in Ku (the language of Motobo) about a plan to kill Zuwanie. Unfortunately for Silvia, they see her, but she manages to escape. The following day, Silvia goes to the police to tell them what she heard. The problem is, they are not totally sure they believe her. And as events develop, one of the officers in charge of protecting visiting dignitaries, a very troubled Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), begins to suspects that Silvia has more reasons that anyone else to kill Zuwabi. In the end, it is difficult to know who is lying, and why.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat surprising, but it feels a little contrived. Also, there are hints throughout the movie of an emotional connections of sorts forming between Silvia and Tobin, but nothings gets round to happening, and some spectators will end up saying aloud "Is that all?" at the end of the movie. At least, that is what happened to me.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that, I would like to point that I specially enjoyed two of the extra features included in the dvd, "The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations" and "A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters". My favorite was the first one, in which the director and part of the crew talk about the process of gaining permission to shoot in the building, and what it meant for them to get it, turning "The interpreter" into the first film to be shot inside the United Nations Headquarters. That feature also shows extra shoots of the building, the General Assembly and the room where the public sessions of the Security Council are held (depending on the issue, there are also private meetings not open to the public).<br /><br />On the whole, and despite the excellent acting, I think that this movie was no more than adequate. Truth to be told, the thing I'll probably remember more about "The interpreter" is its set, that is, the United Nations' building. But... I believe that something is wrong with a film when the most noteworthy feature is the setting.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>The trailers for "The Interpreter" make it look like a taut suspenseful thriller, here we have a case of the trailer being better than the movie.<br /><br /> This Sydney Pollack film is about a United Nations interpreter (Nicole Kidman) who happens to over hear an assassination attempt on a African dictator (Earl Cameron). After Siliva Broome (Kidman) reports what she heard the secret service get involved (Sean Penn and Catherine Keener) and soon we are engaged in a guessing game of who could possible want to kill the African leader. So far pretty straight forward, right? What I dislike about the movie though is as it's setting up its characters we can tell who's going to do it. At first we think the movie is just trying to make us beleieve it's "so and so" but by the end of the picture we see that it actually is "so and so". The movie never should have done this. What this did for me was lower the suspense of the situation. The movie is actually leading us down the right path.<br /><br /> Another problem I have witht he movie is Nicole Kidman's performance. She has a murky past, and at first agent Keller (Penn) isn't sure he can trust her. She's keeping too many secrets. Now clearly the movie is doing this to create suspense and have us suspect Kidman but the way I interepreted her character was as someone who is non-cooperative and making things harder than they have to be. Kidman's character fears for her life and yet she will not fully cooperate with the police. What's wrong with her? She could die at any moment and refuses to tell the police what they need to know. After a while I lost all sympathy for her which is bad because now who does the viewer have to invest their emotions with. This cat and mouse game betwen Penn and Kidman, while interesting at first, becomes annoying.<br /><br /> Now I should point out my high opinion of the talent involved. I think with the exception of Naomi Watts, Kidman is the best actress working today. Sean Penn is without doubt the best actor of his generation. While he may not have the box-office appeal of a Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, I think he can dances circles around them. Performance after performance he demonstrates his wide range: "Mystic River", "21 Grams", and "Sweet and Lowdown". I also have a lot of respect for actor\director Sydney Pollack who has directed some films I've enjoyed very much. Given my opinion of the people involved you can imagine my disappointment.<br /><br /> Much has been made of the fact this movie was the first to be shot inside the UN. I think once we start paying more attention to the locations than the story we're in trouble. So what if this movie was shot inside the UN. I didn't think much was made of it.<br /><br /> I want to go back to Kidman's performance because I was bothered by it so. There's a moment in the film when Penn asks 'What do we know about this woman?' What's her religion? Does she vote? Is she a Democrat or a Republican? In short who is she? The question is asked but I never quite felt we get an answer. The movie spends too much time trying to hide her past and not enough time activately involving her in action.<br /><br /> But perhaps I'm being too hard on the film. I don't know. There were moments when I enjoyed Penn's performance and thought the film had some suspenseful moments, a bus scene comes to mind. Despite everything I even thought Kidman has one or two good scenes and Sydney Pollack does a nice job of holding everything together. He knows how to handle the material. But overall I just can't help but feel the movie doesn't quite live up to what could have been.<br /><br />** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br />p.s. I noticed a goof in the movie. Pay attention to Kidman's hair in the scene where Penn questions her about a photo and a scene in a bar. Notice how her hair shifts position.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Mildly disappointing film that has a wonderful cast that doesn't quite live up to what could have been. Has some goos scenes but left me wanting more.</p></br><a href="../users/AL277B4AQCWBG.html">AL277B4AQCWBG</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter" is a fundamentally sound suspense thriller made unconscionably tedious by the imposition of a romantic subplot.  It looks great, sounds great, and when it sticks to the smart-thriller game plan it really works.  Scott Frank's wonderfully old-fashioned sensibilities and Steve Zaillian's epic tone are both evident in the screenplay which does a fine job of making global-historical issues tangible and compelling.  In the best sequences - the opening, the bus, and the high-stakes finale - Pollack's direction is typically strong and assured.  But when the Broome/Keller (Kidman/Penn) relationship strays unnecessarily from stressed-out, suspicious professionals to would-be lovers, you're inevitably reminded you're watching a movie which probably owes too much to nervous executives and low-scoring all-female test screenings.  The apparent willingness of Keller to contemplate bedding Broome when his own dead wife is barely cold is a character curve ball that adds nothing to the story but distaste.  Had the chemistry been left to the performances rather than corny, hamfisted dialogue or, better yet, had the relationship been restricted to the more interesting ground it ultimately regains - two inconsolable people helping each other through grief - then this would have been one of the 5-star movies of the year.  As it stands, "The Interpreter" ends up being one of those most frustrating cinematic experiences - a very good film that is nonetheless strangely disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. I am a big fan of political thrillers, but this one.....something is missing here. First off, I will admit that Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman give good performances. They're very convincing in their respective roles. The dialogue is sharp, I'll also give credit to that. But then, their chemistry is very uninteresting. It's almost the weakest element in the film. But it's not: the weakest part of The Interpreter is the lack of tension throughout the film. Usually, with such a fascinating plot, there would be plenty of suspense between the protagonists and the unknown force that's binding the story (in other words, the unknown antagonist). But there's hardly any tension, and that's mostly because the chemistry between Kidman and Penn's characters mostly get in the way. Just when you think that the story would progress, then in comes the the scenes involving the two characters' friendship. And then, there's the ending, which was relatively predictable.<br /><br />The Interpreter isn't really that bad, but it's not great, either. The film is marred by lack of suspense, unnecessary chemistry between Penn and Kidman, and a fairly predictable ending. Our two actors give very nice performances, though, and if you're a fan of either of them, you MIGHT feel satisfied with this movie.<br /><br />Grade: 5.4 out of 10</p></br><a href="../users/AS28WVBBZ3G99.html">AS28WVBBZ3G99</a><br/><p>Interpreter is a suspense thriller about the brutality of African politics, an assassination plot, and an UN interpreter who overhears an incriminating clue.

Zuwanee ascended to lead his country and was praised as a savior but soon his administration degenerated into a policy of racial genocide.<br /><br />U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome, played by Kidman, a native of Matoba inadvertantly overhears an assassination plot against Zuwanne through her headphones at a time the building was being evacuated for security reasons.  She reports the conversation to authorities and within short order Secret Service agent Tobin Keller played by a haggard looking Sean Penn commences an investigation.  Penn and partner Dot Woods played by Catherine Keener work in a division responsible for security for foreign dignitaries.<br /><br />Penn must investigate Kidman to ascertain the veracity of her claim.  As he digs deeper events surrounding the arrival of Zuwanee point more and more to the possibility of terrorism.  Penn also soon learns that Kidman's radical political past give her ample motivation to be involved in the plot.<br /><br />Pollack did a fine job in creating a multi layered film that was both topical and relevant.

Pollack, the veteran director behind "Out of Africa," returns to the thriller genre that served him so well with hits like "Three Days of the Condor" and "The Firm." In recent years, Pollack's output has repeatedly flatlined ("Random Hearts"), but that changes with "The Interpreter," a relatively, smartly mounted thriller.  A 71 year-old man in what has unfortunately become a young person's business, Pollack uses his years of patience and respect for the audience to help maintain his picture's pace and reluctance to spell things out; "Interpreter" isn't some gaudy, ridiculously half-baked piece of pop film-making. While it clearly relishes its thrills, the picture is a much more restrained experience that leans heavily on character exploration and tension than on goofball money shots.<br /><br />One late night while retrieving some personal items, United Nations African interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) accidentally overhears an assassination plot involving a controversial African dignitary in town for a visit. Calling for protection, Silvia meets F.B.I. Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), who initially sees Silvia as a threat, but quickly comprehends that there is more to this story than she's letting on. Fearful for her own life, yet reluctant to give Keller all the facts, Silvia finds herself in a hurricane of intrigue as the days count down to the dignitary's volatile appearance.  As Keller gets closer and closer to the truth behind Silvia's estranged past and the essence of her involvement in the U.N., he must also determine the best course of action to keep Silvia alive and ensure the safety of the United Nations all at once.<br /><br />Kidman has one of the best opportunities in her distinguished career to shine; shifting from being a possessed, driven woman who wants to ensure the safety of the U.N. and a paranoid schizophrenic whose prime concern is her own personal wellbeing.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, plays a Keller a man suffering from insomnia. He gives a mannered reading to this man that can't accept what fate has dealt him and appears to be sleep walking in most of his scenes. While being not one of Penn's most felicitous appearances in front of the camera, one wonders if it was because of problems with the director, or just a lapse in Mr. Pollack's judgment about this character.  The international cast put together responds well to the director. One casualty is the enormously talented Catherine Keener, who has little to do. Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron and George Harris are seen in minor roles.  Pollack has always constructed films beautifully and "The Interpreter" is no exception; however, the film lags frequently and the innuendo between Silvia and Keller seems fairly redundant and below the standard of such a fine director.  A good, yet not great film from a director the film industry is glad to have back on board.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A good political thriller, the Interpreter brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates.  It is the story of an interpreter who works for the United Nations in NYC.  Things get a bit more complicated when she overhears a conversation indicating a plot to assassinate an African leader during his upcoming visit to the UN...<br /><br />The film combines drama, action and adventure making it highly enjoyable.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, and the rest of the cast have done a very good job with their performances!<br /><br />In short, though far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ.html">A3AEYDNYCWH2IZ</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be done very well. There was a lot of suspense and made you think about what was happening. If you want a movie that leaves you with a good message at the end then do not miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>A pedigree of Oscar winning actors and a director are sadly wasted in THE INTERPRETER.  I consider myself of above average intelligence and attention span, but the convoluted script for this movie takes so many turns and the pace is so slow that it is hard to become truly involved in the outcome.  Nicole Kidman gives a glowing performance as always as a UN interpreter who overhears the assassination plot for a visiting African dignitary.  Sean Penn is the SS agent haunted by the recent death of his estranged wife, and the agent who handles Kidman's accusations.  Catherine Keenar is wasted as Penn's partner, a cardboard character whose presence is nominal to say the least.  Director Sydney Pollack turns up in a cameo as Penn's hardnosed boss, but his direction is certainly not Oscar caliber.  I'm not sure what the scriptwriter's intentions were for this movie, but as a thriller it misses the mark and as a character study, it barely sustains interest, in spite of the noteworthy performances.  A shame to see such talent squandered.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>Pollack is a wonderful director, isn't he? I enjoy his body of work immensely and the Three Days of the Condor film, now 30 + years old, remains in the top 3 or 4 of the 'Hitchcockian character up against the evil empire' movies. And the evil empire ain't the Russians!<br /><br />I don't think the Interpreter compares favorably to Condor, for argument's sake, and while Kidman and Penn surely hold their own against Dunnaway and Redford, I think the script was if not weak, confused.<br /><br />First of all, that these two characters, Silvia the interpreter (Kidman) and Keller the Secret Service Agent (Penn) are damaged goods make them so much more interesting. They are superior actors and they strut their stuff well. And that Pollack doesn't take the easy way out and get them into bed shows great retstraint and a powerful sense of human caring as opposed to that other thing.<br /><br />But she was an armed rebel in a foreign country. Her family was murdered by one of the member nations of the United Nations. Do we really think she's going to get a job passing extraordinary scrutiny to be within reaching distance of the 191 most important people in the world?<br /><br />And he's married to a (and I certainly don't mean to denigrate the profession) a stripper, I believe, who finds other men, has passionate affairs with them, leaves Sean and then comes back. Time after time. Over and over. This time, 10-14 days ago, she's in a drunken accident and dies. Now Sean Penn (Tobin Keller) is the guy who guards the President. Do we think he can pass a High School psychological test much less one for the Secret Service?<br /><br />So ill fated people meeting eachother is a good start to a good mystery - thriller. It's just hard to believe it's going to happen in the UN.<br /><br />Kidman gets more beautiful and gifted with each film. Sean Penn is everything Deniro and Pacino had 30 years ago. The guy is great. The two of them carry the movie gratefully beyond the limits of the script. Pollack's film direction is always good. It just seemed as though the movie was in place before the decision was made as to where they wanted the script to take them. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>This film was good. That's right, just good. The storyline is suspensful and manages to do just enough to suck you in, but I wondered aloud to my friends if they, or I, would even remember the plot after two months. I doubt any of us will.<br /><br />The reason for this is Sean Penn. I have always liked him, especially in roles like The Thin Red Line (which was perfect for his gloomy demeanor), and Mystic River, as well as his ability to direct (Indian Runner and The Pledge come to mind). But here, alongside a strikingly beautiful Nicole Kidman (who does a wonderful job in this film), he loses his audience as a Secret Service Agent.<br /><br />There are long lapses of time when Sean Penn does little more than manage to move a single facial muscle and speak above a monotone. Some would say this is classic Sean Penn being loosed and allowed to act the way he has admittedly craved, but I disagree. Wanting him to move past that classic depressed Sean Penn resonance, I found myself disappointed once more, because Sean fails to do so again.<br /><br />A good film but certainly not what the critics are calling it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Only liberal Hollywood would cast Sean Penn as - of all things - a Secret Service agent and fulfill his egomaniacal dream of actually standing at the podium of the UN General Assembly.  But I'm going to try and rein in my feelings for Sean Penn and the UN here - although it will take a great show of will for me to pull that off.  Suffice it to say, I had sworn a solemn oath to never, ever watch a Sean Penn movie - and then Nicole Kidman, one of my personal favorites, goes and makes a movie with the guy.  Thus, this was an unusual film for me to sit through - and, as much as I dislike Sean Penn for a myriad of reasons (not just political - the guy did marry Madonna back when I had a teenager's crush on her, after all), he delivers a darn good performance in this movie - he was even better than Nicole.  Were it not for the fact that I have an issue with the ending and the matter of a few plot weaknesses along the way, I might have considered giving The Interpreter 5 stars.<br /><br />It's hard to judge Nicole's performance because I'm not sure if I was supposed to truly like her character.  Silvia Broome (and how ironic is it that Nicole plays a witch and a character named Broome in the same year?) is fairly remote, mysterious, and secretive, and I never really warmed up to her.  This is the first time I've ever not liked or loved a Nicole Kidman character - I even loved her in To Die For, and she wasn't exactly Miss Sweetness in that one.  Here, she plays a UN interpreter who just so happens to overhear a whispered conversation (in a language only she and a handful of other people understand) pointing to an assassination attempt against President Zuwanie of the (nonexistent) African nation of Matoba.  After learning the next day that Zuwanie is planning on addressing the General Assembly in a few days, she reports what she has heard.  Now a lot of summaries tell you that Tobin Keller (Penn) is assigned to protect Silvia, but this is not accurate (not at first, anyway).  Keller's job, as a part of the Secret Service branch overseeing the security of foreign dignitaries, is to protect Zuwanie from the time he enters the US to the time he leaves.  He initially thinks Silvia is lying about the purported assassination attempt.  It's certainly true that she isn't divulging a heck of a lot of relevant information.<br /><br />There are a lot of subplots and gradually revealed secrets throughout this film - and the writer and director earn major kudos for making sure all of it makes sense and doesn't cause great confusion.  In fact, it's all laid out so well that what might be considered surprises toward the end aren't surprising at all.  I wouldn't dream of going into any of the intricate details in my review, though - just know that the story is complex and very well told.<br /><br />There are some definite Hollywood elements to the story, especially in terms of the ins and outs of the UN.  One would hope that UN security is better handled in real life than it is here.  Background checks, people.  Security sweeps really should involve more than someone walking through a room without actually checking anything.  And that safe room - here, it should be called a "well, we might have checked it a week or two ago room."  We all know the UN is corrupt, but it can't possibly be this vulnerable to security breaches.  And why were there any General Assembly microphones on at all when Silvia went back after hours to retrieve her bag?  Of course, all of these things can pretty much be forgiven - this is just a movie, after all.  It's amazing to me that the United Nations allowed Sydney Pollack to shoot a number of scenes in actual UN locations, including the General Assembly and Security Council areas.  The shooting was done on the weekends, but still - why let a brood of movie crew members traipse all over the place?  I wonder if they did background checks on these guys - and whose hands they had to grease to get the OK to film there in the first place.<br /><br />In closing, I'll just say that The Interpreter surprised me - in a good way.  It was a far more intelligent, suspenseful story that I expected, and Sean Penn's presence didn't ruin it at all for me.  That's not to say I plan on watching any other Sean Penn movies, though - not unless he costars with Nicole Kidman, Jodie Foster, or Aishwarya Rai.</p></br><a

Kellar,along with a nice supporting cast.The film pulls you in from the start and Pollack is on game,revealing plot elements like pieces in a puzzle;with a very pleasing but different end result.<br />The film opens in Matobo,a fictional African country,full of strife and internal violence,run by its dictator Edmond Zuwanie(Earl Cameron).Three people drive up to an old stadium,in disrepair, for a rendezvous;one is a black interpreter,one is Kidman's brother Simon and one is a friend of Simon and Kidman's,Phillippe,a photgrapher,who arranged the meeting.Phillippe stays behind in the vehicle as the other two enter the stadium.They find three young boys playing soccer and one of them leads the two men under the stadium to view several dead bodies,from a recent massacre.After a few moments the boy yells to the men that someone is coming.As they rush out they are confronted with the boys who now are armed.The two men are shot dead.Phillippe hears the shots,as one of Zuwanie's men drive up.Phillippe hides,then flees the country.<br />Back in the States we start to follow the life of interpreter Kidman,who works at the UN.One day an evacuation is called in the building,and all personnel leave.Kidman,who forgot her satchel,returns to her office to retrieve it and hears some chatter on her headphones.It is a conversation about the killing of the teacher(Zuwanie),who is coming to speak at the UN.As she listens the lights in her room come on and she frantically switches them off,but the voices appear to know she is there and she flees.The next day she reports what she heard and secret service man Penn and company show up.In short time he/they doubt her story and she goes through a battery of testing and interrogation.They cannot shake her story,as she is adamant about what she heard and its intent.We learn Kidman is originally from Motabo and her sister and parents were killed there,years before.She took up arms briefly with her brother,but left after killing a young boy,who was about to kill her.<br />As the film progresses,Kidman is being followed and fears for her life.In fact an intruder enters her apartment,taking a mask,then appearing on the outside fire escape and running off.That man leaves behind a trace of hair and a Motaboan killer,the same one seen outside the stadium where her brother got killed,appears and snuffs out his underling for his sloppiness.Kidman knows of a  rival of Zuwanies in New York,Kuman-Kuman(George Harris).She meets him on a bus,accusing him of much of the violence in her home country.He denies the charges and says he will see what he can find out about her brother.In the meantime,the Motabaon killer has come on board with a satchel in hand,along with one secret service agent following Kidman and another following the killer.It's a cozy set up until Penn asks his men via radio ear buds,whether the man is carrying anything.Penn and his associates have found the killers victim and some explosives.When the killer gets off it first appears that he has taken everything with him.Penn tells his men to get off,Kidman and one agent do,as a woman finds what she says is a lunch bag the killer left behind.In seconds the bus blows up,killing many aboard,including the agent and Kuman-Kuman and his entourage,along with others on the street.<br />The day of Zuwanies speech comes and Kidman is taking a shower,at least that is what Penn thinks;as he and his colleagues have been sitting across the street monitoring her room and activities.However she leaves the shower water running and escapes out the bathroom window.She goes to the UN and waits in a safe room,the place in which she figures Zuwanie will be taken to,if anything should happen.The scene switches to the UN where all precautions have been taken inside and out,as Penn suspects this is going to be a suicide bomber,and the bomb,he thinks,is already in the UN.As Zuwanie stands before the UN giving his speech a hitman has entered the sound control booth and he is putting together a rifle.Penns hunch was wrong but when he spies a hole cut in the booth glass,pieces of the puzzle come together in his head and in short order, is quickly climbing the stairs.I won`t reveal the ending as such,but it brings together alot of the puzzle that Pollock has laid out before us through the films progression.The ending is bittersweet also,but a fitting one.<br />Pollock himself appears a few times in this film as Penn`s boss and did a great job(not the first time he`s appeared in films,either his own or someone elses).After that shooting takes place in the opening scenes Pollock has our attention straight away.From then on we switch to the States and the puzzle and its pieces are laid out bit by bit, building on one another.Pollock weaves a compelling tale and the climax is quite the culmination of layers of many elements.Smart,well presented and edited,this is definitely one of my favourite Pollock films.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes,an alternate ending,three featurettes and a short on Pollock discussing widescreen vs Pan and Scan.The latter I watched and it should be mandatory viewing for all movie goers and watchers,especially the home bound crowd.It also should be mandatory viewing for ANYONE involved in the distribution of movies,in any capacity.<br />All in all an excellent and engrossing tale about African corruption and violence,coming to US soil and its ultimate consequences.Pollock,along with his two main stars do a bang up job throughout.4-4 1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Nicole Kidman plays an interpreter who works at the United Nations.

In the meantime, half a world away, three men enter an abandoned soccer stadium, and after seeing a room full of bodies, are in turn killed.<br /><br />One night she returns to work after hours to retrieve a bag she left there, and incidentally overhears some men over the UN's translater system.  She doesn't know what it means, at first, but the US Secret Service gets involved, because an extremely unpopular leader of a southern African nation is coming to the UN to address the assembly.  Sean Penn plays the officer who leads the team in charge of the investigation.<br /><br />That's the set-up.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was fairly impressed by the series of plot twists and intertwined story lines that were woven together in this film.<br /><br />Kidman, originally from Australia, plays a convincing southern African.  Penn, though clearly aging, does a good job of playing a grieving widdower who believes that working will help him deal with his loss.<br /><br />The development of the story line, illumination of character after character and how they are connected with each other made for a great movie-watching experience for me.  This is not, however, an action adventure film, it is a political thriller.  There are no high speed chase scenes, no spattered automatic weapons fire, but there are plenty of scenes that build significant suspence, and enough other scenes when the tension is released that it worked, at least for me.<br /><br />This film is, all in all, a solid film, and I recommend it, but it won't ever be a 5-star classic in my book.  it is well worth watching a time or two.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Escalating events begin when African-born U.N. translator Silvia Broome alleges that she has overheard a death threat against an African head of state, spoken in a rare dialect few people other than Silvia can understand.

Boasting a cast of Oscar winners (Kidman and Penn), and a slightly convoluted story, "The Interpreter" is also gripping entertainment. Pollack begins his story in South Africa with the killing of 2 journalists and then segues to the UN where Kidman as an Afrikanner interpreter works.  As the story slowly unfolds, we find that her knowledge of a planned assasination could put her life in danger and that's where a cynical FBI agent (Penn) comes in to check up on her story.  What begins as a tentative relationship between the two slowly unfolds as they become intricately involved but without actually having a consumative relationship which marred Pollack's own "3 Days of the Condor" (I could never buy the relationship between Redford and Dunaway).  In this era of short attention spans, Pollack should be applauded for taking his time in developing these relationships as well as slowly involving us in their dilemna (the slight twist near the end was nice).  This film is a fitting testament to the legacy of Sidney Pollack who also uses the widescreen format to excellent effect here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Normally, I am not fond of Nicole Kidman's acting abilities, but in this movie, I was pretty impressed with her skills in playing the part of Sylvia Broome a multilingual interpreter at the United Nations.<br /><br />Sylvia Broome overhears a death threat against a controversial African leader, but is unable to identify the speaker due to the circumstances.

Sydney Pollack's thriller suffers from a bit of an identity crisis - does it want to be a Hitchcock suspenser, conspiracy thriller, character piece, morality play or poltical drama? To which the answer is, probably. Throwing away its Hitchcockian premise, it wears the conspiracy clothes most comfortably, but the plot is easily guessed thanks to two massively unsubtle hints and, aside from a good sequence on a bus, builds up to what would be a serious anticlimax if the rest of the film were any better. Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, the latter looking like a bizarre deflated hybrid of Walter Matthau, Dustin Hoffman and Pollack himself here, do ok by their cliched parts and the casting of Earl Cameron, one time elder statesman of British race-relations pictures like Sapphire and Flame in the Streets, as the Mugabe-like liberator-turned-dictator is clever. It's watchable in a once-only way, but it's a long way from the quality of Three Days of the Condor.

Is she involved?  Is she making the whole thing up?  Is she in danger?  Is he in love?  The film is tragic and dramatic and on the edge of your seat exciting.  Kidman is amazing here, brilliant performance proving she is one of our greatest living actresses.  Penn does well, but it's no oscar winner thats for sure.  The thrills don't quit as Silvia is harrased by the men wanting to assasinate the president of some african country.  Questions keep getting raised and you think you know the answer but then you know you don't so you just have to keep watching and expect the unexpected.  As Silvia's past unravels new questions come up that question her intentions and makes it hard for Tobin to trust her fully.  The problem is that Silvia is not willing to explain.  Does she want Zuwani (the african president)dead?  Is she in on it?  Is it really happening?  What exactly did she hear?  Keep asking them but you will have to wait until the gripping conclusion to know the full truth.

The 2005 result has several effective scenes though a sometimes muddled storyline that strains credibility toward the end. Despite a few pyrotechnics, there is no pumped-up music or over-extended special effects, and I am grateful that Pollack keeps the tension at a human-sized level. In fact, there is a pervasive old-fashioned feeling about the whole venture perhaps because Pollack has done a similar-feeling thriller back in 1975 called "Three Days of the Condor" where the protagonist gradually unravels a major conspiracy.<br /><br />In this film, the mystery focuses on the protagonist herself, Silvia Broome, a native of a fictitious African country called Matobo. Working as an interpreter at the United Nations, she accidentally overhears what might be a plot to assassinate Matobo's bloody tyrant, President Edmund Zuwanie, when he is scheduled to address the General Assembly to respond to charges of genocide. Of course, she becomes endangered and is placed in the care of no-nonsense federal agent Tobin Keller, who himself is grieving over the auto accident of his wife two weeks earlier. There are two warring factions wanting to overthrow Zuwanie, and the subplots multiply until the tense and somewhat contrived finale. In his accompanying making-of featurette, Pollack says he was working without a final script in hand with no less than five writers working on the screenplay including Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian. It shows in some of the convolutions of the story that don't hang well together, in particular, the growing attraction between Silvia and Tobin after their convincingly antagonistic battle of principles.<br /><br />With an especially clipped, Afrikaan-sounding accent, Nicole Kidman portrays Silvia effectively as both mystery woman and na?ve idealist even when she has to spout some patronizing lines about the value of the UN. She conveys her character's cryptic motivations fluidly as each revelation about her background comes to the fore. However, Roger Ebert and I had the same thought - how much more texturally interesting it could be to have a black actress play Silvia and how Angela Bassett comes to mind. Like a Method-version Bogie, Sean Penn plays Keller in a world-weary manner with moments of teary-eyed vulnerability as he thinks of his wife. It's a good turn by Penn though I feel the role is definitely below his skills, and there is an odd lack of chemistry between him and Kidman that actually works in the movie's favor until the mutual attraction becomes pronounced.<br /><br />The rest of the serviceable cast is given short shrift by the story, including Catherine Keener, who still shows shades of her dry wit and quirky manner as Keller's sympathetic partner, Dot Woods. The real UN locations help considerably in lending authenticity to the story, and other scenes garner the right amount of suspense, such as the what-does-that-mean opening in the soccer stadium and the Brooklyn bus incident where several plot strands come together. Even the fictitious language sounds real even though it was apparently made up as a blend between Swahili and a native language of Mozambique. The ending comes up a bit empty, but the movie does pop and crackle when required.<br /><br />Along with the making-of featurette which is as much about Pollack as it is about the movie, the DVD has several good extras. He is the sole voice on the commentary track and consequently, his informative contributions are separated by many unfortunate dead pauses. There is an alternate ending which is a more pointedly sentimental variation on the one used, and I agree with its excision since it is far more contrived. Three deleted scenes are included of which only one is of interest as it provides an interaction Dot has with Silvia and a predictable revelation. There is also an eight-minute short on the UN and how filming was handled there. Two other shorts offer genuinely interesting insight - the first is a fascinating presentation by Pollack in which he explains the difference between widescreen (which he uses here) and pan-and-scan formats, the second is about how real interpreters work at the UN.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>This is an above-average international political thriller, bringing African politics and genocide to the game of American spy movies.  The moviemakers created a generic African country with a fake name to represent a number of tragedies on that continent in recent decades, and female lead Nicole Kidman plays a UN interpreter who grew up in the strife-ridden African country and has some revolutionary experience of her own.  Kidman's agenda is never really clear to her government handlers or to the viewer, and the plot is full of twists and turns.  This is one of the better thrillers of the year, so check it out if you enjoy this type of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Yes, if you look hard enough, you can find a few errors in the plot of this movie.  Big deal!  The overall plot is completely believable, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman have excellent chemistry on film, and the movie has just the right mix of action and interesting dialogue.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays the mysterious interpreter Silvia Broome, a woman with a very mysterious past, though throughout the movie the viewer is never sure just how mysterious.  Kidman is perfect for this part.  She seems just as mysterious in real life, so this role did not require a whole lot of character change.  Still, she makes her character come to life on the big screen.<br /><br />Sean Penn plays a Secret Service agent assigned to investigate (and later on, protect) Kidman's character.  He doesn't deserve an Academy Award or anything, but he pulls off the job quite well.  Sean Penn is just a fun actor to watch.  I don't think he copies anyone else's style.  He is unique in his approach to his craft.<br /><br />I don't want to giveaway the plot of this film, so I will just say that there are a few turns and twist that keep the viewer guessing.  The rest of the cast, the directing, and the filming are all topnotch and enjoyable.<br /><br />As I said with the title, this movie is solid entertainment.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>The first time that I saw a preview for this film, I thought to myself, "Nicole Kidman looks great in that".  That's about it.  The previews kind of made it look like a generic movie that everyone has seen dozens of times already.  Then it was released, and good press started to come in by the barrelful.  So I decided to check it out after all.  As the title of this review suggests, for the most part, this is a pretty good political thriller, but it kinds of runs out of gas at the end.  I don't know, maybe the writer couldn't come up with a good ending twist.  Whatever the case was, it's too bad, because with a better ending, this could have been a memorable classic in years to come.<br /><br />Anyway, the story centers around Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an African-born Caucasian who is filled with a desire for change in her homeland, but has chosen to do so with words rather than bullets.  She has become an interpreter for the United Nations (this is the very first movie to actually shoot on location at the UN building).  One night, while retrieving some of her belongings, she overhears some people discussing an assasination of a much-hated leader in Broome's home country.<br /><br />When Broome reports this, US Secret Service assigns Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) to protect/interrogate her.  Keller, while a very good agent, is a little on edge, due to problems involving his wife.  He is so ridden with angst and despair that he calls his own telephone number in order to hear his wife's voice on the answering machine.<br /><br />As time goes on, the pair gets more and more involved in the conspiracy as people try to frighten them away from investigating the matter further.  Along the way, we discover some interesting facts from Silvia's past.<br /><br />Both Kidman and Penn give great performances in their respective roles, and the acting is pretty good all around.  As I already stated, this is the first time that the actual interiors of the UN building has appeared in a movie, and they are definitely a sight to behold.  The one thing is that the ending didn't really do it for me.  It seemed as if the writers took the easy way out instead of coming up with something truly shocking.<br /><br />I guess I would still recomend this movie, although I do think that it is being slightly overhyped.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good thriller that can be a little long winded at times, but still managed to keep my interest throughout the two hour running time. The acting by Nicole Kidman is some of the best she has done in quite some time (a great comeback after the horrible "Stepford Wives" remake) and Sean Penn takes a more laid back approach to his character here and it works to his benefit. It's hard to describe this movie without giving anything away (it has a pretty standard political assassination plot), but if you are the mood for a political thriller which focuses on the character drama just as much as the thriller aspect, you might enjoy this one. I don't regret seeing it in theater, but I kind of wish I waited to see this one on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>In the DVD bonus materials, Sydney Pollack admits that casting and shooting on this film started without a script.  His comments suggested that this movie was written as they went.  All the silly plot and character twists are proof that approach was taken to this movie, start to finish.<br /><br />The Interpreter starts quickly, suspensefully, gets bogged down in the middle, and has a corny, boring ending.  The first hour of the movie is promising.  The second hour is almost regrettable.<br /><br />What derails it is the forced twists and turns that only make sense due to the injection of a (rather uninteresting) back story.  Because I do not want to spoil the entire film, I'll leave out details.  Suffice it to say, the movie would have been better had it followed the plotline suggested very early on, i.e. that Nicole Kidman's character, Silvia Broome, simply stumbled upon an assassination plot.  Instead, her past is tied in with the events that unfold throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />It's as if Hollywood writers and/or directors these days cannot resist bringing multiple subplots together to (artificially) create suspense.  Not every so-called "action thriller" needs an ironic climax.  Most films in that genre do not seem to use the device particularly well -- most seem to overuse it -- and The Interpreter is one such film.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman does a great job with the character and "script" but her character is ridiculously improbable.  At the risk of giving away too much, a person of Ms. Broome's (political/activist) background would never get a job as an interpreter at the UN.<br /><br />Sean Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is interesting and well-played, but he seems more New York City detective, maybe low-level FBI, than Secret Service Agent.  Looking at him on the screen you can almost smell the alcohol on his breath.  While clearly a bright guy that knows his job, Keller does not seem like the buttoned-down, highly-disciplined prototypical Secret Service agent.<br /><br />The portrayal of the UN as a body that is greatly concerned about "genocide" in Africa rings hollow.  In reality, the UN has sat by idly while various African nations have torn themselves apart through civil war, inter-tribal fighting, genocide, political corruption, AIDS, and a score of other ills.  Given the reality, Pollacks' UN lovefest is puzzling to say the least.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>I was riveted by the performances of Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn in Sydney Pollack's "The Interpreter".  As the film unfolds, both of their bleak outlooks on life - his worn on his sleeve, hers hidden beneath the steel resolve of a life that is acetic, on the surface - meet to dance a little with each other, and Pollack, wisely, does not pursue romance, just leaves the watcher believing that the two of them will remember each other for the rest of their lives.<br /><br /> Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is with the Secret Service.  He has recently lost a wife, in more ways than one.  Sylvia Broome (Kidman) has lost a brother.  You see him die in the opening scenes, but don't know he's her brother until much later in the film.  Both are reserved and steely in their resolve.  Their mistrust and wonderment about each other is cloaked in elegance.<br /><br />The setting is the United Nations, and Pollack filmed much of the movie there, a first.  His cinematography (by Darius Khondji) makes you intimate with the UN, it is crisp and alive.  Sylvia is an interpreter there, one of few who can speak Ku, the primary language of the African country, Matobo.  (Matobo is fictional).  Some of the political heat that Pollack has taken about the film is in the "fictionalization" of Matobo.  In character and events, there is much that is reminiscent of real life African countries; Pollack has merely given us a hodge podge of likely events.<br /><br />Broome's knowledge of the language allows her to overhear a threat against Matobo's dictator, who is to visit the UN.  The threat is brought through channels, and the wheels of security begin to invade Sylvia's and the UN's existence.  Assassination of Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) would be devastating for the world opinion of the UN, and cause even more instability in his little corner of the world.<br /><br />In tense sequences, the drama plays out with the UN backdrop; the most exciting scenes taking place with a potential bomb on a bus - here Pollack shifts incessantly between the bus and the security forces who track and follow it from various venues in the city.  There's also a remarkable scene for Penn when he finds, without really seeing, an assassin in Sylvia's apartment.<br /><br />It becomes obvious that Sylvia is no innocent bystander, that she has an agenda, that unlikely as she seems, she is an activist; is she, in part responsible for the threat?  Tobin Keller does not really know, he just begins to trust his instincts about her.  As the film moves rapidly (it is a long film, but the time seems to go swiftly) to the end, the filmgoer realizes that he/she's been caught up in the performances strung together with some well-filmed action sequences, but that the message that Pollack was trying to convey got a little lost, and dragged its feet.  As such, the time spent viewing it is well spent, but, as you reflect on the film, you're not certain it will have a lasting affect on you.<br /><br />Some points that need to be brought up - Catherine Keener is a welcome presence as Tobin's partner.  She's dynamite in what is little more than a cameo.  And the DVD has some excellent extras, notably:  A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters, and a feature on the use of the UN for filming, The Ultimate Movie Set:  The United Nations (I was less enthusiastic about the features I normally like, an alternate ending, the deleted scenes...good thing they were deleted... and scenes of Sydney Pollack at work at the set).<br /><br />This is a film that should be watched for its context, particularly in light of where we are and where we are not in the world today; a film that should be appreciated for its nuance - but the action sequences will be more attractive and it is the disconnect between the film's intellectual value and the action that is bothersome.  This coupling was done far better in "Hotel Rwanda", for one.<br /><br />See it, but rent it.</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>The actors selected for this film and the excellent writing, directing, editing and plot development make this flick a great choice for those who enjoy both action and intrigue. Major plot avenues are fully travelled and definition and complete attention are still given to fine details. Character development, coupled with suspense, make the film and edge-of-your seat experience. If you enjoy films like The Bourne Identity and The Firm, you will definitely like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Physically beautiful, produced in a style that harkens back to the "big" movies of the 70's and 80's Sydney Pollack's (The Way We Were, The Day of the Condor) "The Interpreter" incites reactions from its audience for some of the wrong reasons. It's gorgeous to look at, it's directed to within an inch of its life, the actors look great and seem sincere and yet the experience is very much like eating Low-Carb Ice Cream: it just ain't the real thing...something is missing and that something is a decent script, which at the very least should make an honest attempt to piece together the disparate plot threads into a cohesive hole. No such luck: this script is muddled at best, incomprehensible at worst.<br />On the other hand Pollack directs a scene that is shot simultaneously on a bus, in several cars and features all the key actors that is terrifically exciting and makes you marvel at a style of film-making, both in the directing and the editing which can cause such a tremendously visceral reaction.<br />Also, on the plus side, Nicole Kidman as Sylvia Broome, a UN Interpreter with a dicey past, is so magnetic that your eyes follow her every move and when she begins to speak in KU, a made-up language of the ficticious Matobo people of Africa...you buy it hook line and sinker. Kidman once again plays the ice-queen but at least here she has a back-life that is mysterious, murky and ultimately spells trouble for all concerned.<br />Sean Penn as the Secret Service man assigned to investigate Sylvia, Tobin Keller seems to be stuck in a groove playing men who have recently lost something (21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon) or someone and are in deep despair and mourning. Here, Keller has just lost his wife 3 weeks before the film starts and he cries a lot of the time. Don't get me wrong: it's great to see this fine actor cry on the screen but Sean... do yourself a favor...do a comedy, what don't you? If  De Niro can, you can.<br />Catherine Keener does her, by now patented smart-ass, dry-witted best to add levity to the proceedings and for the most part she succeeds.<br />"The Interpreter" is a good way to spend an afternoon: it's pretty, it has good manners and it says please and thank you. I just wish it would have been less polite and kicked ass a little more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>I heard and read some bad reviews besides I never liked Nicole Kidman so I thought it would be just another so-so thriller. And I was pleasantly surprised watching it as I wanted the film to last as long as possible - I was enjoying it that much. I liked every scene, every dialogue (they all were brilliant and very living), every line.<br />This is one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen but there were something more to the film so I can say it's not just a thriller. It's a very tender and sensitive story about two life-beaten persons who are trying to cope with life's difficulties and find love maybe. We can't speak definately about love here, because everything remained rather hazy in the picture, but I found a lot of love there - much more than in any regular love story. Kidman and Penn were so convincing in their roles, and Sydney Pollack executed such an elaborate and delicate directing, so that for me this is one of the most truthful movies about love between two people, although there are no love scenes and even no kisses. It's so rare these days we get a chance to see something really worthy like this. It's the exact case when we can say for sure that the film was done by real professionals. Don't miss this one of the best movies of the year. Bravo, Mr. Pollack!</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>The cast of The Interpreter obviously saves this movie. Although the plot is intelligent enough, no way this movie would have been an outstanding success without the acting capabilities of Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman!<br />After Interpreter Kidman overhears some information she shouldn't have the rising tension is being displayed very well. However there is a very remarkable fact in this movie, that doesn't make any sense. Why isn't Kidman's part played by a black actress? Having white Kidman speak a native African language like this Ku is absolutely ridiculous! What was going through Sydney Pollack's mind when he had Nicole Kidman say lines like: "I'm going back to my people in Africa!"?

The movie works during the first 30 minutes as a US interpreter hear about a possible assasination attempt on a controversial African leader.  Then the film goes into a lull of boring dialogue for the next 25 minutes.  Then the suspense starts up again as we find out she's being followed by unknown assassins.  Then another boring lull of dialogue!  The climax of the film finally brings all the pieces of the puzzle together, saving the film from certain destruction.  There's enough mystery and suspense to keep you entertained.

The audience<br />could guess a lot of what is to happen, and Penn's opening scene where he drops his wedding band into an empty booze glass<br />is nice symbolism, but really gives away easily everything about this character.

I had been led to believe that this film was a bit of a pot boiler that should have gone straight to DVD.  In fact, I only saw it by accident when the DVD was left with me.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman plays an African interpreter from the Republic of Matobo who overhears a threat to the life Matobo's dictator.  She is assigned protection from Sean Penn who plays a federal agent.  The plot is ultimately foiled although not without some close shaves along the way.  Both actors a totally plausible, especially Kidman, who seems relaxed "in the skin" of a young bookish woman with a background in languages.<br /><br />Much of the film is shot on location both in New York and actually within the United Nations building in Manhattan.  I understand that this is the only time that the U.N. has actually given permission for such filming.  Even Hitchcock's opening scenes for "North by Northwest" were shot in a studio.  The U.N. location certainly gives the film some added cred.<br /><br />See this film.  It is a real surprise.  Director Sydney Pollack has done his job well.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman put on a master acting class in "The Interpreter." Set amidst the shifting political alliances of the United Nations, it isn't groundbreaking or jarring, but it is thoughtful, partially because these two actors know what to do with a scene when they get a couple decent ones.<br /><br />Kidman is Sylvia Broome, a native of the fictional African nation Matobo, an UN interpreter who overhears an apparent assassination plot of Matobo's leader, Zuwanie, a once-reformer who, not unlike Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, has turned his nation toward a military dictatorship. Sylvia has her reasons for wanting "The Teacher" dead, but here she is, reporting the plot to Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn).<br /><br />Keller's assessment? "She's lying," he tells his partner Dot (Catherine Keener). And Sylvia is - about her past, her connections to the Matobian resistance movement, maybe even her own motives.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack, out of the game since the bomb "Random Hearts," allows "The Interpreter" to burn slowly. Keller, conversation by conversation, inches closer to Sylvia, who hides her nationalistic fervor with an idealism that seems like a front until the end, when its ironic source becomes clear, and undergirds the most critical decision of Sylvia's life.<br /><br />In between is the mystery - not all that mysterious - of who, if anyone, wants Zuwanie dead, or maybe just targeted for death. Let it be said that The Teacher's head of security (Jesper Christensen) hangs around the investigation a lot. One of Zuwanie's opponents (Yvan Attal) is assassinated in the movie's opening sequence; the other, wonderfully named Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) is part of movie's most suspenseful sequence aboard a NYC bus. Other scenes stand out: The dictator, Zuwanie, recalling a parade on the George Washington bridge in his honor the last time he visited New York; a quiet moment inside the United Nations, with its comfy earth tones and swooping ceilings.<br /><br />But the chief pleasures are Penn and Kidman. They're A-list stars now, capable of carrying a film on their presence and talent alone.<br /><br />Starting with "Mystic River," Penn tapped into middle-aged weariness with authority; it never would have been said of his early career, but he now embodies "old-school" man like Jeff Bridges does - virile, wise, angry. Kidman seems to play a broad range of characters, but they're all intellectually intense, often emotionally fierce, generally challenging. Kidman pushes her acting somewhat - "spunk" can be the residue of trying a little too hard - but at least it's not a mail-in. Both peel back their personal layers haltingly until they acknowledge they're kindred spirits.<br /><br />Love never develops between Keller and Sylvia, but they merge as angry, romantic souls. Were political futures actually settled by people other than lifetime government employees and the Condi Rices who've spent lifetimes in library basements, you'd prefer this good-intentioned passion.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>The Interpreter proves to be a solid but uneven movie about this woman played by Nicole Kidman who overheard an assassin plot against this dictator of a fictional African country while at work in the United Nation. Ironically, she is also from that country as well long ago. Sean Penn played a Secret Service agent who had to investigate and access the threat to that dictator who will be coming to the UN and also checked out Nicole Kidman's character as well.<br /><br />The general story moves along pretty well. The main characters are well developed. The movie played along as a some sort of a "spy thriller", a lot of cloak and dagger type of theme. Both Penn and Kidman's characters shared a same common problem of losing love ones and dealing with it. Both actors proves to be quite good in their roles. I am pleased that for once, Sean Penn isn't his usual outrageous self that some fans like him to be. He is very restraint in this movie, letting his body do his talking for him. Kidman I thought, was quite believable character and she proves herself to be a solid actress despite of her good looks. (Some reviewers actually panned Penn because he was so restraint.)<br /><br />Overall, the story works but only up to a certain point. The script wasn't as tight as it should be. By middle of the movie, you began to see thing far more clearly then what the director intented. The only real killer however, was the ending. After all that talk about forgiving, why would the movie end the way it did?? And what govenment would released a would be assassin based on a word of a secret service agent. Maybe I am giving away too much here in this review but overall, the ending hurt the film because its lack creditablity and believablity in contrast to the rest of the film.<br /><br />Amazingly, no sex scenes, no romance between the two leading actors, I guess they were just too busy staying alive and doing their jobs. That proves to be quite refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, pretty solid movie like I wrote before. But it could have been so much better if the director and scriptwriter didn't fall flat on their faces at the end. (I would give it a 3.6 stars rating if I had a choice.)</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Seldom has an ending been so disappointing and ruined a good film as this one.<br /><br />For most of the way, this was a slick thriller, nicely photographed and nicely acted. Sean Penn is outstanding in here. I like to see him play low-key characters instead of hot-headed sleazeballs. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Sometimes her classic beauty hides the fact she can act.<br /><br />The story was pretty involving, hard to put down once you've started. My only complaint up to the ending was the obvious plug for the United Nations. This looked a public relations piece for that organization.<br /><br />However, then came that ending - a real insult to anyone's intelligence. In a nutshell, nobody would go the extremes they went to here to protect a visiting dignitary, using all that manpower and machinery....and then leave him all alone in a room at the end! Are you serious??? It was unbelievably stupid and ruined what had been an entertaining and somewhat- smart film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Interpreter" is a riveting suspense thriller!

Sean Penn plays the U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to investigate the interpreter and see if she did hear what she says she did.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" is Sydney Pollack's first film since 1999's flop "Random Hearts".  Pollack's directing is one of the two high points of the film.  The other is the cast.  Kidman and Penn are both very good and, paired with Pollack's directing, they keep the film going.<br /><br />Other than those points mentioned above, the film has little going for it.  About fifty minutes through the film I was sick of it.  There's very little originality in the film; it's cliched and predictable.

I thought it was a dull, cliched thriller, simple as that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>The movie "The Interpreter" is the first ever to be filmed inside the actual United Nations Manhattan complex and the inside look at the building, hallways and conference rooms is a main attraction for me and a show how important and powerful Hollywood has become. Take for instance the 1959 thriller "North by Northwest." Denied at the time even the chance to film the exterior of the building Hitchcock's people had to resort to covert means to grab the shot of Cary Grant approaching the entrance (legend has it that the camera was concealed in a van.<br /><br />So here we are almost a half-century later and the United Nations opens up its doors and they couldn't have chosen a more intelligent and globally relevant, classy effort by veteran moviemakers.<br /><br />The story begins with simultaneous translator Silvia Bloome (Nicole Kidman) overhearing a whispered exchange in Ku, the little-known language of the fictional South African nation of Matobo. The message may signal an assassination attempt on Matobo's President Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), soon to arrive at the U.N. to defend himself against charges of in humane acts.<br /><br />The threat activates the Secret Service's Dignitary Protection Squad, in particular Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a troubled and weary man soon fencing with the glacial, guarded and lonely Silvia.<br /><br />Is Dr. Zuwanie a patriot or a terrorist? Is Silvia herself a target or a sleeper? The trail leads to immigrant walk-ups and a Central Park rendezvous. The players assemble -- Zuwanie's head of security Lud (Jesper Christensen), his political enemies Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) and Xola (Curtiss Cook), plus a photographer who has seen too much (Yvan Attal). Bodies begin to accumulate. The key is in what Keller will be able to extract from Silvia's murky past as their private lives begin to merge.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" builds a creditable sense of claustrophobia and dread, with the occasional heart-thumping spike, but is more often a long stall with the phrase "It's got nothing to do with you" used once too often. This is one movie where unraveling the plot complexities may need a second viewing, but no matter because Pollack is one of the best in the business.<br /><br />That face, that marvelous face -- Penn's, of course -- with its furrowed brow and great pendulous nose. His Keller has a nothing-left-to-lose swagger to his walk, and we soon figure out why.<br /><br />"Interpreter" also gets mileage out of Kidman, perhaps as beautiful as ever she has been with her low, richly sculpted voice and schoolboy clothes. That's another of the problems: Both of them are gamin and tousled. This movie is said to be a make-or-break for her after some problems in recent duds and I would lay my bets on her emerging from this springs movie  lineup in good shape.<br /><br />To get to the sophisticated stuff, we will have to swallow a plot implausibility or two, beginning with why conspirators would discuss their plans in the General Assembly.<br /><br />It's too bad; the movie throws out scenes of unexpected power, for example, when, on a dusty African road, two men with an agenda pass a man with no eyes.<br /><br />Will a summer-primed audience accept a thriller without action, an adult, if dry, psychodrama? Only time will tell, but I think this will be mentioned in future promo's for other movies when the posters of other features proclaim loudly "From the Director of The Interpreter."</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Words have a significant meaning when expressed with genuine honesty.  This is also the easiest way of communicating, as it quickly can convey the meaning of something important.  When communicating in a different language, skills are necessary to decipher the foreign language.  If the language skills are lacking, or not proficient, it could lead to misinterpretations, which could have dire consequence.  Thus, it is essential for an interpreter to be able to translate a language proficiently without errors in order to eliminate misunderstandings.  When Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) works at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York, she translates different languages and she is fully aware of the importance of clear and concise interpretation.<br /><br />The Interpreter opens in Matobo, a small African nation amidst brutal ethnic cleansing, where the audience witnesses the cruelty of weapons and hateful teachings.  This brutality provides some hints to what the story is about, yet it leaves the audience in complete darkness as it is not clear how these characters are related to the story, as it takes place in New York.  One evening after a failing metal detector Silvia returns to her working place, the UN Headquarters, to pick up a bag that she left behind.  As Silvia enters the room with her bag she accidentally hears a conversation in a foreign langauge, which she was not intended to hear.  What was said, remains a mystery to the audience, as subtitles are not provided, which enhances the suspense in the story.<br /><br />Eventually Silvia figures out the seriousness of the conversation that she overheard, as she reports it to the security of the UN Headquarters.  Consequently, the Secret Service arrives to the location in order to investigate the situation headed by Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) who personally is struggling with the loss of his wife.  When Tobin and Silvia meet for the first time there is tension, as Tobin finds her insincere, yet he cannot place his finger on what makes him feel this way.  Nonetheless, the audience learns while the story unfolds that this political thriller has a several layers colored by personal feelings and powerful political undercurrents sweeping through the UN and the Big Apple.  Cleverly, the director Sydney Pollack only discloses the crucial facts at the critical moment, yet it is also here where some of the weakness rest within the story.<br /><br />One of the more important notions conveyed through the film is the importance of forgiveness.  Initially, Silvia tells Tobin about a custom in Matobo where they do not utter the name of the dead until the mourning feel that they can move on.  She also tells him about the tradition where they throw a murderer into the river while the surviving victims can choose to save or let the murderer drown.  If the survivors decide to let the person drown they live and will continue to live in disharmony, as they have acquired their vengeance.  Yet, harmony can be salvaged by saving the murderer from drowning.  Another layer of the story that Pollack illustrates is the blindness of vengeful hatred and anger, which flushes away any kind of existing sympathy.  Tobin thoroughly describes in a scene what he would do to the murderer, as clouded thoughts prevent him from seeing nothing but retribution.  The film cleverly depicts the aftermath of anger while it balances with harmonious forgiveness through both Tobin and Sylvia who are mere pawns in the big political game at the UN Headquarters.<br /><br />The Interpreter offers an intelligent political thriller that does balance human emotions with politics through the main characters.  Being able to shoot the film on location, the UN Headquarters, helped developed a genuine atmosphere where the audience can feel the tension between the nations and the individuals in the film.  It also offers an opportunity for the audience to reflect over the seriousness of the matter in the backdrop of recent political events in the world, which also builds up more anticipation and suspense.  Yet, the true treasure of the film rests within the emotional aspect of the story, as it provides a honorable lesson of human existence.  Unfortunately, some of these aspects come across a little too strong, as it almost feels too blissful and overly righteous.</p></br></body></html>

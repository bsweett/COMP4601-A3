Following his arrest and escape, we aren't really sure whose side Horn is on. How he struggles with his religious beliefs and his alliance to his country becomes central to the story. What I came to appreciate about this movie was portray of Horn as he struggled with his moral and religious convictions, and it is the dichotomy between these issues made for an interesting movie.<br /><br />I feel that Cheadle did a wonderful job with this role and anyone could benefit from watching this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this film, and it started out strong.  The cinematography is both gritty and gorgeous and true to the story: to begin with the sunlight is overpowering, the brights that flow through windows or doorways or from the sky are washed out, and the shadows and subtle variations of dark are clear and nuanced; towards the end the sun was less apparent, it always seemed overcast.  This reflects the moral ambiguities that increasingly enter into the characters' visions: that overwhelm the clarity of faith, or of rightness and justice.  The camera movements are both precise and volatile, conveying a sense of the urgency and uncertainty of the situations depicted.  One could learn a lot from paying attention just to the visuals of this film.  I noticed, in particular, that Don Cheadle was always lit in a way to highlight the range of tonalities in his face while allowing him to stand out against a relatively dark background - there is a big difference between the techniques of lighting for pale and dark skin and cinematographer J. Michael Muro deserves a lot of credit throughout for his exceptional work on this film.  (He was also DP for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66FB6">The Last Mimzy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LV63MW">Flicka</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGYMTM">Rush Hour 3</a> -- especially for the last three films I think that the cinematography was easily the best thing about them.)  The acting (especially that of Don Cheadle as Samir) and the settings were also quite strong.<br /><br />When it comes to story, things are a bit less subtle.  I think of fiction film as involving four major components: (1) the cinematography (the filming); (2) the "mise-en-scene" (the filmed: including set, actors, props, etc.); (3) the story; (4) the theme.  In the best films, all of these components are in the service of the story -- if the cinematography calls too much attention to itself, or if an actor's presence overwhelms the film, it doesn't quite work.  Likewise, and I think this is the case with Traitor, a film can fail because the story is in the service of the theme.  In the best films, the theme emerges along with the story, but it doesn't feel like the story is simply designed to convey a message: the story has a life of its own and because it feels true and alive it also allows us as viewers to see something about life and this insight is the theme.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in this film, it feels as if the filmmakers designed the plot and the characters precisely in order to convey a message.  Even more troubling is the fact that they appear to have unwittingly introduced a deeper and more problematic message by employing stereotypes that would give a shorthand way of conveying the primary message.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't entertain and doesn't enlighten -- it does --  but I think the message could be more profound if they had been more focused on telling a story than on conveying a specific message.<br /><br />Roughly, the explicit message of the film is that the war on terrorism is complicated, that Islam is complicated.  While there are some who, in the name of Islam, would like to wage a violent war on Western democracy and the American style of capitalism that accompanies it, there are others who, in the name of the same faith, reject that violence and see Jihad as implying an internal struggle.  Don Cheadle's character Samir is designed precisely to illustrate this tension: he is willing to accept violence as a means to fight against the usurpation of Islam by militant extremists, because he is ultimately a man of peace who aims to overcome his own anger.  Although this character seems contrived by the writers precisely to illustrate something, Don Cheadle breathes life into him and he does appear to be real.  What makes the message heavy handed is the way that characters are constantly stating to each other the allegedly profound insights we are supposed to be gleaning from the plot: Neal McDonough and Guy Pearce play FBI agents who express, respectively, the stereotypically patriotic American point of view and a more nuanced point of view that gradually comes to respect Samir for his faith (conveyed in a very heavy-handed way during an extremely improbable  encounter between the agent and Samir in the final scene of the film).<br /><br />But what undermines even this apparently nuanced message about Islam (that faith is not the enemy, and that Islam has within itself the resources to combat its more extreme interpretations) is the implicit message conveyed within the story.  It turns out that, according to the story, the real terrorists, the guys who run things and call the shots, are really just opportunistic hypocrites.  The leaders of the terrorist cell that is at the heart of this story have lots of money, enjoy wine and women and cigars and nice cars.  They are really just capitalists who are exploiting the faith of the pawns they use as suicide bombers in order to enrich themselves.  There may be a good deal of truth to this -- but I think it oversimplifies things, suggesting that the heart of all global conflict is just greed.  That's a message that is easy to swallow, but doesn't offer much in the way of insight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>The modern world is pulling at its own stitches -- religious differences, political conflicts, and crisscrossing loyalties. So it's an appropriate time for a movie like "Traitor," a brilliantly acted and morally murky tale that was written (weirdly enough) by Steve Martin, but which is also held back by its twisty narrative and a narrative that sounds better in theory than in practice.<br /><br />Sudanese Samir Horn (Cheadle) was born in Sudan, but after his father was killed in a terrorist attack he was brought to the United States and eventually became a part of the army -- a specialist who infiltrates terrorist organizations. But it seems his loyalties are no longer to the US army -- he's become entangled in a group of terrorists and imprisoned in Yemen. And, of course, his special skills and knowledge come in quite handy when it comes to terrorist plots.<br /><br />But something is not quite right in this equation. A pair of FBI agents, Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), are sent after Samir.... but soon discover that his loyalties are not so easily identified. Just who is he a traitor to? At the same time, a plot is being put into effect that would kill countless people on Thanksgiving Day, and Samir seems to be involved...<br /><br />"Traitor" is pretty clearly a movie meant to make you very, very uncomfortable, especially since it does some heavy delving into Muslim beliefs, divisions of loyalty, and the corruptions of text and belief that drive fanatical extremists to kill others. It gets too slanted at times -- the Muslim agent is portrayed as far more devout in his faith than the Christian one -- but it's a powerful piece of work, and a sympathetic look at the people torn between their personal beliefs and outside forces.<br /><br />Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff handles this in a more intelligent manner than your average action thriller, allowing the plot to seep and unfold gradually, and throwing new kinks into the storyline along the way. The violence is genuinely harrowing, and the script is pretty solid. The problem is that the complexity itself turns into confusing knots, and the ending falls rather flat compared to the tense, sleek movie that precedes it. I was left thinking, "... that's it? That's what happens?"<br /><br />Cheadle is, quite simply, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors -- and he gives a quietly compelling, intensely powerful performance as Samir, able to convey all the division and confusion that his character feels. Pearce is a good if slightly less nuanced counterpart, far more conventional in his thoughts and approaches, but who learns a certain appreciation for Cheadle's character and the knowledge that the truth is not simple or straightforward. Assuming you can find "the truth" at all, rather than someone's personal approach.<br /><br />"Traitor" leaves you feeling confused but exhilarated, and tackles the near-impossible questions of modern Islam and some of its fanatical followers. An intelligent movie, if a flawed one.</p></br><a href="../users/A24IJY3V0804WJ.html">A24IJY3V0804WJ</a><br/><p>Okay the movie is good. I do not know why I neglected watching the movie after having it for such a long time in my list. Don Cheadle gives a good performance, Guy Pierce acts well. A movie about terrorism and you get the mandatory foreign locations, the villains and some America bashing. I recommend it, if you like a fast paced movie experience. It is also a different take on terrorism after the influx of these movies after 9/11.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />Heck, the only real loser in this movie was the unlucky bus driver who was exploded to pieces along with the thirty terrorists...<br /><br />As for the film itself, it's good, nothing spectacular, but good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle is Samir Horn, a man who makes unlikely friends with a Middle-Eastern terrorist group.  Does he support their holy mission, in furtherance of the God he shares with them?  Or may he be the catalyst to bring this group down...from the inside?<br /><br />You can no longer count the number of movies about the global threat of Middle Eastern terrorism on one hand.  It is a topic that gets headlines around the world, and movie makers must salivate over the screenplays.  I have admitted my bias, and maybe that is what made this movie mediocre for me.  I thought the Americans were portrayed as ruthless, witless cowboys.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that viewpoint, but only that I grow tired of it.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is my saving grace.  He is one of the finest actors of this time.  He has a seriousness about him that makes everything he says worth hearing.  This movie followed him through some very difficult decisions and you feel torn in two directions almost more than he is.  He is a talent worth keeping an eye on.  He is also the only real highlight in this movie for me.  The rest of the movie was just another take on these now-popular, religious Crusades.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>It seems as though many people in the US have forgotten what happened on September 11th. Sure, the date remains fixed in our memories, but as the days progress beyond that point, we drift further and further away from the fact that an attack was launched on American soil that left 3000 dead. We feel complacent that another attack will never happen. It is such an attack that lies at the center of TRAITOR.<br /><br />The film begins with a slow buildup that delivers a final punch worthy of great thrillers. The action is used sparsely but the story is more full than most films of this sort. And the acting of Don Cheadle shows just how good he truly is.<br /><br />Cheadle stars as Samir Horn, born in the Sudan but now a US citizen. Having served in Afghanistan during the first initiative there, he made the decision to stay and to look deeper into the religion of his youth. This led to his becoming and explosives expert as well as an arms dealer.<br /><br />Involved in a major deal, he is captured along with the group's ringleader, Omar (Said Taghmaoui). During their confinement to the typical movie style Middle Eastern prison, Omar begins to see that Samir is not your typical mercenary. Samir believes in the Koran and its teaching as witnessed in his defense of a poor prisoner by the jail yard bully.<br /><br />The two become close and when the time comes for Omar to escape, he takes Samir along with him. Using his knowledge, expertise and ability to get the explosives needed for a major project they have planned, Samir becomes part of the group.<br /><br />Running concurrently with this story is that of FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Straight laced all the way, Clayton has been trying to stop terrorists abroad when his path crosses that of Samir. That ended when Samir went to prison. It begins anew after an explosion in Spain where Samir was sighted.<br /><br />The film deals with the life of a terrorist as he plots out the next major attack. It also runs into the spy thriller mode when it shows that this group has infiltrated the US with spy cells just waiting for the command to do damage.<br /><br />A major twist in the story presents itself late into the film that turns the whole story around. If you paid attention while watching the preview for the film you guessed it already. *SPOILER*  It turns out that Samir is actually working for the US government in the form of official Jeff Daniels, the only person to know this fact.<br /><br />The twists add to the story as Samir is conflicted in what to do. He lives to serve God and country and yet feels that to serving his country he has abandoned God. Driven to desperate acts to protect us from the terrorists, Samir does things against the teachings of God. Keep in mind we're not talking Christian/Judeo God, we're talking God from the Koran.<br /><br />And that's what makes this film good on another level. It looks at the beliefs of the Koran and how the terrorists use that belief to foment the youths that they gather to die. At the same time, the sentiments of the Koran for peace are discussed.<br /><br />The main plan that the terrorists have concocted is one that could happen. It involves numerous explosions all over the country at once. And the chances of Samir to stop it grow slimmer with each moment as he attempts to cover both ends of the spectrum on this plot.<br /><br />Cheadle is fantastic, showing the acting skills needed to make this believable and not just making Samir another James Bond suave, sophisticate attempting to blend in. No, in Cheadle's performance we see a man conflicted who believes strongly in his religion but who knows that evil is not defeated easily.<br /><br />Guy Pearce does his usual stand up job as the more by the book agent trying to protect his country at all costs. The rest of the casts do a great job as well with Neal McDonough as Pearce's more violent prone partner and Alyy Kahn as the nefarious leader of the terrorists group.<br /><br />Thrillers today seem more intent on gadgets and tricks than on the gut level approach to real problems in today's world. Make no mistake, the ideas seen here seem more real than most. And those who would do this country harm remain out there. While this movie might offer entertainment, action, adventure and a great performance, it is also a sobering reminder of where we are at today. And perhaps that's a good reminder to have.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Without Don Cheadle, "Traitor" would be just another international thriller about Islamic terrorists and the Americans desperate to thwart them.  Cheadle's Samir Horn, a conflicted man born in Sudan but now an American, manages to quietly charm and thus challenge preconceived notions of what it means to be a Muslim, what it means to be a terrorist, what it means to care so deeply about an issue that you are willing to risk everything, and what it means to assume you know what lies underneath.  That Cheadle can convey all this in an otherwise impassive expression is impressive.<br /><br />The film opens first with Samir as a boy witnessing his father's death in a car bomb, and then with him as an adult in the midst of a secret arms deal in Yemen interrupted by a surprise police raid.  When Samir earns the respect of fellow Muslim convicts, the film starts down the labyrinth of terrorist cells, motives, and subterfuge, followed step by step by two eager FBI agents (Guy Pearce, memorable as Agent Clayton, and Neal McDonough).<br /><br />When the film started, I was worried that it would play into all the stereotypes that put Muslims into a neat box labeled "terrorists," but Samir's girlfriend, whom he leaves behind, is an intelligent professional outraged  that the man she loves has dirtied the name of their faith.  And even some of the terrorists have doubts about what they are doing.  The behavior of the Americans isn't always ethical, either.  At the core of the movie, however, are two men, Samir and Clayton, who believe deeply in the line between right and wrong and who rely on their separate faiths.  Cheadle is more memorable in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007R4T3U">Hotel Rwanda</a>, and Pearce more memorable (ha!) in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a>, but both do admirable jobs in this film.<br /><br />Seasoned film goers will see the major twist long before it is revealed, but fortunately other, smaller surprises keep the plot interesting.  Although not the best thriller I've seen, Traitor is a solid, intriguing entry into the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>Well made, but not very believable. A Hollywood attempt to go "behind the scenes" of Islamic terrorism (and U.S. counterterrorism) that only manages to play to all the usual stereotypes and clich&eacute;s</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>This is another movie like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7WGOW">The Kingdom (Widescreen Edition)</a> where Hollywood feels the need to make up for their old easy Arab terrorist stereotypes with great swaths of verbiage about how Islam is peaceful and decent and real muslims wouldn't become terrorists, blah blah. Just kidding about True Lies and Gene Simmons. One wonders when rich freelance bad guys who want to rob Fort Knox will get their due.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie is that you're supposed to believe that Don Cheadle is a rogue agent turned terrorist instead of a double agent that's infiltrating the terrorist organization. That bit of fluff doesn't hold up for a second (even if the entire marketing campaign wasn't set to SPOILER ALERT) and Cheadle is doing his blandly virtuous role throughout. I miss the Cheadle that played Mouse in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767818075">Devil in a Blue Dress</a>. Without much tension on the Cheadle side, Guy Pearce has to do the heavy lifting but he's saddled with a Southern accent that goes between genuine and grating as all hell and a back story about being a Preacher's Son who studied Arabic in college.<br /><br />And every 5 minutes someone stops to say that Islam is peaceful. Really. Whether you got Cheadle preaching at his terrorist friends or Guy Pearce talking about the problems with profiling Arabs, there's the speechifying. Good intentions make for deadly dull viewing and this is a movie brimming with good intentions. The only part that I liked was the fact that there's no Big Reveal where Guy Pearce's sidekick turns out to be the FBI mole. Of course, there's no big reveal concerning that FBI mole so it's probably somewhere on the cutting room floor.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>Remember when Steve Martin used to be funny? Yeah, it seems so long ago. Nowadays he's expanding his horizons, going into more dramatic territory, but I'd never pen him to write a story about terrorism and double-agents. Unfortunately, when Neal McDonough appears within the first five minutes of the film, I could tell this was going to be less than fun/good/watchable.<br /><br />Neal is awful as always, Don is understated, but good, Jeff is in the film for all of two minutes, and Guy Pierce (not Ritchie), actually gives the best performance of the film, which isn't saying much. However, it might not be the fault of these actors, but instead their terrible characters. The movie gives no reason to like 99% of the characters, and when stuff happens to them, you're more like, 'Oh well, when is this going to be over?'<br /><br />But mainly, the main problem this movie suffers from is lack of a cohesive point. Is it entertaining? Not unless you find a fictional view into the life of terrorism entertaining. Does it make you think? What's there to think about? If it's about conflicts between Islam, the merits of terrorism and stuff like that, then I frankly don't give a crap. Is it a political movie? It certainly has enough politics to turn anybody off, and a general sense of uneasiness not seen outside most horror films. And it certainly isn't a thriller, so what is it? A Jason Bourne knockoff? Hardly. While Don Cheadle's character is touted as being this great soldier, only one brief instance of this is shown. The rest of the time he gets the crap kicked out of him. I care about the character even less, as he can't even fight.<br /><br />It would have been much more watchable if it had better direction and editing. First off, the first thirty minutes of the film has Don Cheadle undercover in a Yemen prison full of terrorists. Complete bore, and useless. Easily could have been cut to 5-10 minutes. Hour's gone by, nothing of real note has happened. Easily could be 20-30 minutes at this point. The point is, this movie should have been no more than an hour and a half. Then there's the direction, which is expected considering the only major credit the guy had before this was writing the global warming disastor movie, "The Day After Tommarow," which spell trouble right there. For example, there's an important scene on a bus, which done properly, would have been a great ironic moment, somewhat changing my negative opinion of the movie. As is, the scene is a confusing mess where you can't tell what the heck is going on.<br /><br />In summation, it's a thriller that doesn't thrill, a drama that isn't that dramatic, and a movie that wants you to think, but isn't worth thinking about. What movie these positive reviewers were watching, I don't know, but this movie suffers from bad direction and lack of a basic point. However, even with multiple trips to the editing room, and better direction, it's still a 3.5 effort at best with its drab subject matter. This movie was a traitor of my time. Don't let it betray yours.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Starz ~ Anchor Bay / Region A, B(?), C(?)<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / High Profile 4.1<br />Running time: 1:54:07<br />Movie size: 29,72 GB<br />Disc size: 33,07 GB<br />Total bit rate: 34.72 Mbps<br />Average video bit rate: 27.03 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  3762 kbps  5.1 / 48 kHz / 3762 kbps / 24-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby Surround<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#Featurettes<br />--Action!

After viewing the movie I can only compliment the filmmakers for picking such a wise and appropriate phrase to encapsulate what unfolds before its audience. The occidental mind has yet to come to grips with an Islamic mindset that encourages its most fanatical followers to strap explosives to their bodies and detonate themselves in crowded buildings, transportation centers or any high traffic venue that will best unsettle the security of its adversaries. It is "terrorism as theatre" and all the world is its stage.<br /><br />In `Traitor' Don Cheadle delivers a marvelous performance as Samir a Islamic, Sudanese born American immigrant who after spending years in U.S. military intelligence apparently has a change of conscience and joins an extreme terrorist organization after being recruited by Jihadist and future best friend Omar (Said Taghmaoui). Said is also magnificent, the on-going conversations between Omar and Samir discussing the Jihadist mindset and mission and how they compare with past and present acts of aggression by America are searing, thought-provoking and nuanced. For me they make this movie worth the time and effort. That's not to say that there isn't anything else worthwhile in this film, but it is there relationship and intellectual debate that raises the film to a higher level.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film, well this isn't one of your typical fast paced action films. The storyline unfolds rather slowly, too slowly at times. But it does build momentum about halfway through will firmly hold your interest to the end. `Traitor' offers the viewer great performances, intellectual stimulation and political relevance. There is in my opinion two flaws that keep the film from receiving a -5 Star- rating. The `Big Moment' at the end is rather unrealistic for reasons I can't discuss without spoiling the surprise and secondly, the ultimate decision made by Samir was a little too black and white for a storyline focused on exploring the gray areas of faith, conscience and choosing sides.<br /><br />Footnote: Guy Pearce also delivers a stellar performance as the FBI agent pursuing Samir.</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>"Traitor" tries to plow through the viewers' assumed ignorance or lack of understanding when it comes to Islamic terrorists and suggest a more nuanced explanations of motives beyond the simplistic "they want to kill us all" or "unless we don't fight them there will have to fight them here" or "they are going to follow us home and do unspeakable things to our defenseless families". Clearly, we have a much better understanding of terrorists movements such as the nationalist IRA or the various past and present Marxist or Maoist Red Army Brigades than we do of today's super-radical and super-desperate Islamic suiciders. It's difficult to 'get' what motivates young men and women, often well educated and sometimes coming from affluent families to blow themselves up for the dubious (at least to us) reward of taking 'some of us' with them in the process and the few no longer front page newspaper headlines and Tweets. What makes "Traitor" troubling is not its largely successful attempt to show us that there's a lot more than the promise of 72 virgins in Heaven that recruits 'suiciders' but its inability to go beyond hinting at what that might be - to borrow a famous line from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'... Anyone? Anyone? The possible explanations provided by dedicated terrorist Omar - who attended finishing school in Switzerland - that tend to come down to 'they killed many of us so we should kill many of them' may be part of the motive, especially when a family member was tortured or imprisoned or lost but individual revenge can't account for a movement and a cause.<br /><br />With the understanding that "Traitor" is maybe a baby step forward toward an open discussion of what makes 'them' hate 'us' so much and how can 'we' justify us voluntarily surrender so quickly our personal and civil liberties when facing a relatively small threat and in exchange for some largely illusory 'security', it is a tense, generally well acted movie. It's not clear what made Samir, a native of Sudan, join the US Army Special Forces - we see his father dying inside an exploding car but from that to an elite US Army career and then deep cover agent - before or maybe after having fought side by side with the Afghan freedom fighters (now known to us as terrorists) against Russian invaders? Omar, Samir's Islamic Brotherhood terrorist best friend meets him in a Yemeni prison and it's not clear how he ended up there either after completing finishing school in Switzerland. We do hear from Omar that he resents 'the West' for killing and humiliating his brothers and sisters but... from Switzerland to Yemen? Yemen is one of the least likely place to find Westerner targets. The US government agents, especially the FBI, get a more realistic treatment - arrogant, brutal, unable and unwilling to comprehend or adjust to an unfamiliar reality, all too willing to forget about the niceties of actually following our laws when the opportunity to brutalize a US citizen abroad presents itself, sloganeering when there's a need to defend or explain less then honorable activities.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, it's the expected spy thriller action movie. People are not always who they say they are, there's a lot of deception, a reasonable body count and, in the end, even though 'our side' seems to get the better of it, poor Samir is left trying to figure out for himself if whatever he did was right or even necessary while under intense bombardment from slogans and clich&eacute;s thrown at him by Special Agent Roy Clayton.<br /><br />"Traitor" is not easy to watch. Even hinting at what might be "the other side's" views and motivations tends to make us uncomfortable and, while not really coming close to touching the root causes and motivations for today's Islamic terrorism, it comes close enough to make watching difficult. Sadly, because it only hints at possible causes and motives without fully exposing them, most viewers discussions about what they just watched aren't likely to deviate from the standard, often repeated, short, simplistic, depressing sound bites fed to us by big and loud talking heads that our valuable mass media likes to squeeze between male enhancer pills and diet plan or abs commercials.<br /><br />Since I watched "Traitor" on a Blu-ray disc, it's probably worth noting that there's little in the image where the Blu would offer a significant advantage over a DVD. The dark subject is appropriately painted on the screen with dark shades of brown, gray and yellow and the viewer attention is likely to focus more on the plot and characters interactions than on the largely non-existent vistas. The same can be said about sound - Dolby TrueHD - it's adequate but this story does not call for tremendous surround sound performances. Explosions, even when they happen, are integrated into the context of the story. The Blu-ray package comes with a second digital copy disk which is quite appropriate because watching the movie on a computer screen should be as good an experience as watching it on a home theater.<br /><br />I hesitate to recommend "Traitor" as an outright purchase even though the current Blu low price (8.99) should make it tempting. I did buy my copy and I am probably going to keep it. However, if in doubt, you're probably better off renting it and HD vs. DVD resolution won't make a big difference.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Traitor is an intellectual espionage drama that will keep your attention.

I recommend the movie to anyone interested in looking at a realistic portrayal of this sad conflict.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle stars as former U.S. Special Ops Officer Samir Horn and Guy Pearce plays the FBI agent hot on his trail in "Traitor."  The film opens with Horn as a child in Sudan learning his Muslim faith from his father.  Then we see Horn witness his father's death via a car bomb.<br /><br />Hurtle forward into modern times and we find Samir trying to cut a deal with Muslim terrorists.  He is captured in a raid in Yemen and soon finds himself offered assistance by the FBI in return for crucial information on terrorist cells all over the world.  When he refuses to help, he is left to rot in a Yemeni prison where he forms a close bond with a fellow Muslim named Omar (Said Taghmaoui).<br /><br />The pair, along with a number of Omar's cohorts, escape the prison and meet up with the Islamic Brotherhood.  From there, the film goes across the globe, allowing the viewer to witness a number of terrorists acts that are headed up by Samir's knowledge of weapons and of the Qu'ran.<br /><br />Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clayton (Pearce) and his team are trying to find out who is pulling off all of the terrorists bombings.  Soon enough Clayton pegs Samir as a prime suspect and the chase is one.<br /><br />The viewer is forced to question the motives of Samir from the very beginning.  Is he truly a terrorist?  Perhaps he is just a loyal fanatical Muslim who believes that glory awaits those who strike down the infidel?  Maybe he's doing this all to bring down the real bad guys?  You'll have to watch the film to find out, since saying too much more will spoil the film.<br /><br />Cheadle does an excellent job as the mysterious Samir Horn.  Guy Pearce is wonderful as the minister's son-turned-lawman, Clayton.  Said Taghmaoui is brilliant as the highly intelligent and near-fanatical Muslim believer, Omar.  The supporting cast, which features Jeff Daniels, the always reliable and completely underrated Neal McDonough, Alyy Khan, Archie Panjabi and Hassam Ghancy, give solid performances as well.<br /><br />What I personally found enjoyable about this film is that Islam is dicussed by fanatics, loyalists and outsiders who both fear and respect the faith.  Samir's interactions with Omar and Clayton on Islam are brilliant, and show the viewer that there's a whole lot more to Islam than blowing up the infidel and declaring Jihad on everyone.<br /><br />While the film does run a bit slow at times it is, overall, a tight suspense drama with just enough action to keep it interesting.  It is an intelligent film and I highly recommend it to people interested in the subjects of espionage, terrorism and religion.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>I enjoyed the film, Traitor, as a suspenseful drama written around a serious and challenging topic. The film is held together by a great performance by Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, a Sudanese born Islamic American citizen. Guy Pierce gives a great performance as an FBI agent on the trail of Horn. The film also uses the story of Samir Horn as a character study of a complex individual. The FBI agent played by Guy Pierce serves as a proxy for the viewer for as Pierce fits the pieces of the puzzle together, so also does the viewer. Pierce is the proxy for the viewer unraveling the actions, loyalties, and deeper motivations of a complex man who may or may not be suffering from conflicting values and cultural systems.<br /><br />Much of the action revolves around the cat and mouse dynamics of terrorism and counter-terrorism. However, it is the character study that balances the action that makes this film get 4 stars. The film presents us with the ambiguity as to whether Samir is a rogue secret agent who has become a terrorist or whether Samir is a double agent who is out on a thin limb as he infiltrates an organization of terrorists with little if any back-up. Thus the concept of 'traitor' is part of the dynamics for we are not certain as to whether he is a traitor to the US or whether he is a traitor to Islam. The resolution of the conflict could be viewed as contrived Hollywood wrap-up, but give the film a break for even though it tries to explore complex issues working inside the mind of a complex mind, the film must also deliver entertainment with no strings left hanging. On this account it certainly delivers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>I am not going to give a plot synopsis as the twists are the whole point of the movie.  But without giving away the twists...<br /><br />Traitor is about a terrorist plot to wreak havoc in the heartland of America.  At the heart of the terrorist group is an Sammy (Don Cheadle).  He saw his father get blown up in the Sudan. He was raised by his American mother until he was expelled from school and joined the Army.  But he became disallusioned in the Gulf War and has fallen in with a group that has been terriorising Europe and is now ready to strike at America. Hot on his tracks are two FBI agents (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough)<br /><br />the movie is fast paced but this subject matter has been well trod by better movies and especially TV specials.  This is an good movie with the usual great performance by Don Cheadle. The remaining cast is equally great.<br /><br />This is a movie to see for the performances not for the script.  Definitely a good rental or download.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Don Cheadle stars in this movie which is complex, fast-paced, and thought-provoking.  He plays a Muslim named Samir Horn and the story begins in his birthplace of Yemen when he sees his father blown up by terrorists.  The action switches from the middle-East to the U.S. as FBI agents begin<br />pursuing the adult Samir who appears to be moving closer and closer to the center of a terrorist cell.  Throughout the movie Samir is portrayed as a devout Muslim, intent on living out his faith.  Cheadle makes the character believable and memorable.  Throughout the movie there is doubt as to which side Samir is on and the action is portrayed in shades of gray instead of black and white.  This is a fast-moving, entertaining, and interesting movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I thought this was a well produced and acted movie.  The storyline is interesting, with a nice mix of action and story.  Don Cheadle was fantastic and very believable in his role as a Sudanese/American Muslim.  This film is a real eye opener in how people can become fanatics and extremist.  It was also very interesting to see how a terrorist ring operates.  So besides being a nice little thriller, this film really makes you think.  Give it a try.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>Indeed, as the tagline for "Traitor" states, the truth is complicated.  As the film progresses, it becomes ever more complicated.  Soon Samir Horn, the traitor, is unable to tell anyone the truth about who he really is.  He is trapped in many prisons, both physical and spiritual, and is being pulled in many directions.<br /><br />  I am reviewing the Anchor Bay release of "Traitor."  Normally, I don't watch the DVD's special features; however, "Traitor" was so intriguing that I couldn't resist.  The commentary provided by director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (screenwriter of "The Day After Tomorrow") and lead actor Don Cheadle (who portrayed Samir Horn) was outstanding.  During many commentaries, the actors and production crew reminisce about past events that have nothing to do with the film.  Not so with "Traitor."  I soon learned that the Yemen scenes were filmed in beautiful Morocco.  Nachmanoff foolhardily didn't get a permit to film in London's subways.  Cheadle was clipped by a car while being filmed crossing a street.  Many of the Moroccan extras used in the prison scenes couldn't speak English but were fine actors in their own right.  Several Muslim actors gave advice on Muslim customs and beliefs that were incorporated into the film.  Nachmanoff's younger brother, a lawyer, gave him legal jargon for the film.  I also learned that Cheadle and Guy Pearce are very athletic and did a lot of their own stunts.  Most importantly, Nachmanoff stated how he wanted to focus on the journey that Samir Horn undertakes rather than the ultimate act of terrorism at the film's finale.  Don Cheadle so aptly describes his character as being ". . . Caught between a rock and a hard place."<br /><br />  The commentary was also educational.  I learned that Nachmanoff distinguished certain scenes from others by using the bleached bypass process which gives a scene a lighter, bleached-out look.  (Personally, I didn't care for this effect.)  Some buildings were extended by using CGI.  Cranes were used to create unusual overhead camera angles.<br /><br />  In order to give "Traitor" an international flavor, the film was shot in Morocco, London, Toronto, Marseilles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.  The viewer will appreciate and learn more about these locales, especially those in Morocco, if they watch the DVD`s special feature:  "International Espionage:  An In-Depth Look at Traitor's Exotic Locations."  (Morocco is gorgeous; I'd love to go there on vacation.)  It was interesting to learn that few sets were built.  Most scenes were filmed by small crews on location.<br /><br />  The viewer will see Cheadle train for the prison fight scenes in "Action!  The Stunts and Special Effects of Traitor."  This short feature was exceptionally fun to watch.  We learn that Cheadle has a background in fighting.  We witness cars and buildings explode.  We also learn how the stunt is performed when a young terrorist is thrown off a bridge and onto the train tracks below.<br /><br />  Overall, the features for the Anchor Bay release of "Traitor" are excellent.  My only complaints was that there isn't a special feature that provides the deleted scenes.  Cheadle and Nachmanoff spoke about them, making me wish I could view them.  Also, the print for the names of locations was very small.  I had to scoot closer to the television to see them.  Same with the subtitles for those speaking in Arabic.  You had to look hard and pay close attention because they were small and were soon gone.  Also, Anchor Bay's release didn't have a reproduction of the movie poster like so many others have had.  However, I am thankful that there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired, like myself, and the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Inside the DVD jewel case, there are two $3 coupons that can be used towards the purchases of "Righteous Kill" and "Surfer, Dude."  (I have scanned and posted the DVD jacket, the coupons, and the disc.)  Also, the trailers included on the disc are for the following features:  "Righteous Kill" (looks like an excellent police saga starring Al Pacino and Robert Deniro), "The Visitor" (great drama, which I have already reviewed), "Henry Poole is Here" (looks bizarre but warmhearted), and "Sleepwalking" (another sweet drama I'd like to see.)<br /><br />  As far as the film itself, I have not seen a more emotionally charged story dealing with terrorism since "The Siege."  Everyone gave excellent performances, especially Don Cheadle who deserves an Oscar.  His facial expressions were incredible.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, Samir Horn.  He is torn between his loyalty towards Islam and loyalty towards his country.  Most everyone thinks he's a traitor, including himself.  He begins to think that he has betrayed Islam for the innocent lives that have been lost.  To make matters worse, he virtually has no one to turn to but Allah.  Horn's mom, however, seems to have faith that he is still a good man.<br /><br />  Anchor Bay`s release of "Traitor" is highly recommended viewing for those who enjoy political espionage thrillers.  You will be on the edge of your seat for the last fifteen minutes, as I was.  My heart was pounding in my chest.  The ending was a shocker.<br /><br />Wa alaikum assalam.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3.html">A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3</a><br/><p>If you're 30 minutes into this film and still unsure of who's a good guy and who's not, don't feel alone. This story is purposefully set up to keep you guessing for quite a while, though things clear up again by the end. Unfortunately, that means you've got to be willing to invest yourself into this story or you're going to get lost quickly. This isn't something you watch while talking on the phone or while not paying attention. But if you're willing to stick with it, you're going to find a lot to enjoy here. It's a suspenseful ride that keeps you guessing until the final moments.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>"The truth is complicated," says the tagline to this latest Don Cheadle film. Too right it's complicated, especially in a movie like this, where the line between good and evil, right or wrong, is not so much a line as it is more of just...<br /><br />Cheadle plays Samir, a man who was born in Sudan. In 1978 his father, a devout Muslim, was blown up in a car-bomb attack. Shortly thereafter Samir moves to the USA and is raised by his American mother. He then goes for a career in the Army and then... well, then he apparently falls in with some unsavory characters.<br /><br />The movie chronicles his time working undercover with a terrorist group. Well, possibly undercover. Jeff Daniels plays his controller and makes several comments that might lead one to wonder what Daniels' character's real agenda is.<br /><br />In the film we see the inner-workings of a terrorist cell. We watch as they stage actions in Spain and France and gear up for action here in the USA, coming to the country by way of Canada and Mexico. If nothing else this serves well to highlight the international nature of the problem.<br /><br />Samir is showing as being very much a man in conflict. Clearly he abhors terrorism and loves Islam. He's asked to do things by his controller that he believes are evil, but he's also asked by the terrorists to do things that are even more evil, bringing to mind the question, "How much evil is allowed do be done in the name of good?"<br /><br />The performances all around are excellent. The script is tightly-written and well-paced. The action scenes are good and the locations are magnificent. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a good one and worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>This is a very fast paced action, suspense thriller with twists and turns that make you wonder which side of the fence you want to be on. When does right become wrong and who gets to decide the good from the bad? How far is one willing to go? These are issues being faced by an undercover agent as he trys to do his job as well as do the right thing.....or does he have that luxury? Don Cheadle does a wonderful job in bringing this character to life. Guy Pearce also did well as the persistent agent also trying to do his job. I think the moral of this story is...."You can't always tell your friends from your enemies". "As well as the lack of morals and principles will always lead to the breakdown of any society."</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>If you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor, then peep this movie and let the lightbulb turn on. Cheadle is amazing in TRAITOR. It's a credit to his ability to keep things internal yet unveil just enough of what's going on inside that not only are you uncertain as to his character's true allegiance, but you grow to care and you cross your fingers hoping that he's on the right side.<br /><br />What sort of person might you become had you, as a child, witnessed a loved one become a casualty of terrorism? The answer to this is what haunts this film, and is what truly drives the storyline. Young Samir Horn (Cheadle), having seen his father killed in a car bomb explosion, grows up to be an operative in the U.S. Army's Special Forces. But, years later, an FBI-affiliated raid in Yemen catches him selling semtex to a terrorist cell, and Samir ends up in a Yemeni prison. He eventually breaks out, thanks to a befriended jihad leader. His new friend gives Samir a choice: Samir can now go his own way or he can become part of the cause. Samir goes for the latter.<br /><br />Someone once told Samir: "It's clear to me that you're not a fanatic. An opportunist, perhaps, but not a fanatic." Early on I couldn't help wondering: Is Samir merely a mercenary arms dealer? Or is he himself a terrorist? Or something else?<br /><br />Back in Washington, the FBI Special Task Force sniffs out an alarming international conspiracy, connecting it to bombings which took place in Rome, Berlin and Amsterdam. And Samir's name surfaces. Special Agent Clayton (Pearce) is tasked with getting at the truth. And because this film is an intelligent, circuitous thriller, that truth is a hard-gotten thing. As he probes and prods and encounters traces of Samir around the globe, even amidst further bombings, Clayton unearths just enough contradictory facts to make him question Samir's role in these acts.<br /><br />I was surprised at how easily I was drawn into this movie. TRAITOR is dark and provocative cinema, and even though it boasts other fine actors, whether the film works or not hinges on Don Cheadle. Thankfully, plonk this guy down in any character-driven story and he'll shine. TRAITOR trades on politics and dirty espionage, and uses Samir Horn as a prism thru which it explores moral complexities and the underpinnings of faith and religion and what constitutes a good man. How far do you go to do the right thing? Is the big picture worth an innocent life or two? Cheadle kept me in the dark as to which side he's on, until the film decided it was time to show me. Yet the film makes it clear that Samir Horn is a devout Muslim (although, to segue a bit, when Agent Clayton describes Samir as a devout Muslim, Samir's mother corrects him: "He's a Muslim. I don't believe there is a sliding scale." This is one more religious contention brought up here). Even as Samir gets sucked in deeper and deeper into the world of terrorism, there's no questioning that Samir feels true remorse over the killings he's caused. The question is, is that regret enough to dissuade him? Again, which side is he on?<br /><br />Samir's friendship with a terrorist makes things murkier. Said Taghmaoui, who plays Omar, is very good, certainly good enough that I couldn't help but like the guy. It helps, I guess, that Omar, even though steadfast to his cause, is nuanced enough and conflicted enough that smidgens of humanity leak out.<br /><br />The bonus features on this single disc: an audio commentary by Don Cheadle and Writer/Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff; two featurettes - "Action!" (4:39 minutes, concerning the film's action set pieces) & "International Espionage" (5:11 minutes, concerning the film's international on-site locations); and the movie trailer.<br /><br />TRAITOR doesn't come with wall-to-wall action; the explosions and tussles and gun fights are spread throughout the film and done to serve the story, instead of as mere eye candy stuff. Samir Horn comes off as more realistic, in the sense that he may have been Special Forces but that doesn't mean he can go up against sheer numbers and win out. On a one-on-one, though, he can hold his own. And, we find out, he can't dodge bullets.<br /><br />I like that there's no easy way out here. As the film goes on, options narrow to inevitable, gut-wrenching decisions; the light at the tunnel's end grows dimmer. A man of true faith is caught in the crosshairs and forced to commit heinous acts, and then has to face up to what he's done. Don Cheadle completely embodies his character, and makes you feel Samir's soul-wrecking torment and revulsion. And, by this point, if you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor...</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This movie is a very thoughtful and well made espionage thriller that in the past would fit in with infiltrating Communists or drug gangs , Nazi's or whoever.  The story is a old one  in that regard , as the infiltrator begans to care about the some of the people he is now accepted as part of their organization. Like any undercover person the job is a rough one that takes a terrible toll on the infiltrator. Don Cheadle also gives a near perfect perfomance as the lead character and one can only hope that someday he gets the right role to land him a Oscar.  The supporting cast is excellent as well  and this is a A list movie with A list talent all the way. What makes this story interesting as well is the focus on the decent Muslims who feel that terrorists have hijacked their religion and then fight back against them. Sadly there are too many silent voices in that regard accross the world.  Like most modern movies this movie just shines on blu ray, there isn't a line or smudge in site.  Blu ray equals classy transfers and top notch sound.  So this very well acted terrorist espionage thriller is well worth a watch especially on blu ray.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>As a former spy and leading critic of the $65 billion a year spent by the secret world, I normally limit my DVD intake to hotels and airplanes, but this one attracted my attention and deservedly so.<br /><br />This is one of a tiny handful of decent depictions of the spy world, and I want to note that Jeffrey Nachmanoff, a name most will not notice, was also the screen writer for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMXX">The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.<br /><br />The over-all plot is credible, well-acted, well-filmed, and I was pulled in to give this my undivided attention.

It challenges us to consider the border between political and religious extremism and sincere, deeply held patriotism and faith.  I was a little surprised that Kennedy Center Honoree Steve Martin, better known for Wild and Crazy comedy, wrote the story Nachmanoff adapted into a taut screenplay.<br /><br />Don Cheadle should receive an Oscar nomination in the lead role of Samir Horn.  Samir is not a one-dimensional character and Cheadle embodies him with a focused yet larger than life performance.<br /><br />In the opening scene we see a young Samir in Sudan, in a room praying with his devout Muslim father.  Then something happens that we have no trouble understanding colors Samirs thoughts and beliefs and motivations for the rest of his life.<br /><br />We see Samir in modern times dealing sophisticated explosives to an Islamic terrorist group in Yemen.  Government agents burst in on the deal, taking Samir and the terrorists into custody.  It is implied in Yemen this involves frequent beatings and long imprisonment.<br /><br />We are introduced to a pair of FBI agents.  Max, the hot-headed one is played by Neal McDonough.  The thoughtful one, Roy Clayton, is played by Guy Pearce, who grew up in Australia but once again immerses himself in the role of an American so well I had no difficulty believing Roy is the son of a Southern Baptist Minister. (I'm the son of a Roy and a Southern Baptist myself.)  Roy is the second most important character in the film.  He became interested in Arabic culture in college, and now works for the FBI combating terrorism.  Astute and perceptive, he understands that Samir has a sincere muslim belief and is not simply interested in blowing up all things not muslim.<br /><br />We find later that Samir is deeper still.  Jeff Daniels plays Carter, a U.S. Intelligence officer, the only person alive who knows that Samir is a double agent sent to infiltrate a secret Islamic terrorist organization.<br /><br />Much of the suspense in the film is generated because Carter (and by extension the audience) doesn't know if Samir has "gone to the other side".<br /><br />Said Taghmaoui plays Omar, a member of the secret terrorist group who brings Samir into the fold, and in another fine wrinkle of the textured screenplay, we get to see many shades of gray even among the terrorists.<br /><br />The film asks difficult questions and does not imply that there are easy - or any - answers.  If you have the most sincere patriotism or faith, how many innocent people can you kill in the name of your country or faith?  Fanatics may answer "however many it takes", but Samir and Roy both have doubts, and you believe that their personal faith informs their decisions.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful thriller and if you're interested in such things - you should see it.  The Lord bless and keep you: As-Salamu `Alaikum.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Throughout both 2007 and 2008, moviegoers saw what seemed like an endless string of movies focusing on or around the ongoing War on Terror. For a majority of these films, which ranged from character dramas ("Stop-Loss" or "Grace is Gone"), political thrillers ("Lions for Lambs" or "Rendition"), to just good ol' fashioned action films ("The Kingdom"), the response from audiences was far from welcoming. Most of these titles, along with a few others I didn't mention, suffered through a rather brief stint at the box office and didn't enjoy much more success on DVD. To me the lacking success for these films would seem to be enough to get the studios' attention, and make them aware that audiences just don't want to go to the movies to watch something that involves a topic that can be seen daily on any news channel known to man.<br /><br />Regardless of all of this, the political thriller "Traitor" starring Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce was released to theaters this summer. If memory serves me, this is merely the latest film released in the War on Terror genre; I'm calling it a genre due to the surprisingly large number of movies based on the subject that has been released thus far. I personally question the reasoning behind even releasing this movie in the first place, especially in light of all the losses the studios have accrued over the previous films; but I guess the various studio executives share a sort of "It only takes one to make a difference" mentality. So, does "Traitor" have what it takes to win over audiences even with the touchy subject matter or does it fall prey to the same general lack of interest that has befallen the rest of the genre?<br /><br />After a series of terrorist attacks in various locations around the Middle East and Europe, along with a prison break in Yemen, the U.S. government is desperately seeking answers as to who is responsible, especially in light of a new threat targeting the country's heartland. Assisting in the investigation is FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) who finds himself with a rather short list of suspects, and one man on his list is raising his suspicions more than the others. The person of interest is a former U.S. Special Operations officer named Samir Horn (Don Cheadle), who appears to have become involved with the very group that may be responsible for the attacks. However, appearances may be deceiving as the further agent Clayton digs, the more evidence he discovers to suggest that perhaps the truth is much more complicated than it initially appeared to be.<br /><br />What are the key components that are vital to a movie for it to be considered a thriller? Is it a great story, terrific actors and actresses, a hefty dose of the unexpected, or a general sense of uncertainty that will cause the audience to be on the edge of their seats at all times? The answer is that it's not just one of these items, it is all of them. Each of these components are key to creating a top-notch thriller that will keep audiences entertained and enthralled from start to finish, and possibly creating repeat business if all goes well for the film.<br /><br />In the case of "Traitor" many of those items were present, but not all of them. For the ones that made it into the film, there didn't appear to be any emphasis on consistently maintaining the quality of these components throughout the duration. What I mean by that statement is when there were genuinely thrilling sequences or moments of the unexpected, they would either end in a way that made them feel unoriginal or be followed shortly thereafter by something so obviously tired and clich&eacute; that you would have to be a fool not to notice. Basically just when the movie seems to be heading in the right direction it falls apart prematurely.<br /><br />The story for this film is intriguing, and the fact that we are delivered a viewpoint from both sides, lends the film some credit for trying to flesh out the how's and why's of the ongoing war. However, writer/director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (writer of "The Day After Tomorrow"), fails to create a completely engaging film due to falling prey to numerous movie pitfalls; such as, an overuse of character stereotypes for both the terrorists and the government agents, predictability within the story, and essentially becoming too trite and generic in the end. Perhaps if the screenplay had been more polished and willing to go even deeper into the more unexplored areas of the war, which it drifted in and out of throughout the film's duration, and not been so overbearing with its various messages it was trying to get across; then perhaps the final product would have been better received, at least by this viewer.<br /><br />Even if the movie's storyline did run into its fair share of problems, one aspect of the film that cannot be slighted is the generally high-caliber cast, led by the talented Don Cheadle ("Hotel Rwanda"). Cheadle gives a terrific performance as Samir, a man who has sacrificed so much in this war, to the point that he wonders if it will ever be enough; especially in light of the regret he feels over some of the decisions he's had to make along the way. In the role of the closest person Samir has to a friend, and one of the terrorist group's masterminds, is actor Said Taghmaoui ("Vantage Point"). Said brings a fresh, new approach to the terrorist type of role, not allowing him to be portrayed in a hackneyed, cookie cutter cut-out sort of way that I had expected. At times he almost gives his character a sense of morality (twisted as it may be), while providing some form of reasoning and motives for why he is willing to do and plan the horrendous acts his group will commit.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the characters goes, the two listed above is where the truly developed characters meet their end, and the stereotypical ones begin. Leading the way are actors Guy Pearce ("The Count of Monte Cristo") and Neal McDonough ("Walking Tall"), who are both very talented actors in their own right, yet find themselves misused in this film. The two actors portray your typical, garden variety FBI duo; one of the agents is a level-headed, eternal optimist (Pearce) who believes in a suspect until he or she is proven guilty, and the other is a hot-headed pessimist (McDonough) who would rather lock a suspect up and throw away the key than actually get to any answers. Alongside them is Jeff Daniels ("Gettysburg") as your typical government handler who knows much more about what is occurring than he is letting on, and for the sake of his mission and secrecy (and the storyline), he keeps the facts from everyone.<br /><br />Lastly, the various actors portraying the many members of the terrorist group were given the least to do in the entire storyline. Aside from Said's character, the other terrorists were nothing more than a bunch of nameless, evil men with no rhyme or reason to their apparent madness, who want nothing more than wanton violence and destruction to engulf the "evil" United States and its allies. Please, spare me the same old semantics I've seen and heard so many times before, it's beginning to grow tiresome. It's a shame that more wasn't done to capitalize on the talent at this film's disposal. At least, the entire cast did the best they could with the material they were given, so even at its most predictable and unoriginal moments, the film remains better than average.<br /><br />While "Traitor" did manage to keep me moderately interested from start to finish, albeit to varying degrees of interest; the movie's various pratfalls causes the film to devolve into being just another generic political thriller with high aspirations, yet poor execution.<br /><br />"Traitor" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>**This review contains spoilers**<br /><br />Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) is an African-American Muslim who was born in Sudan and witnessed the death of his father in a car bombing when he was nine. He's raised by his mother in Chicago and spends some time in the Army in Special Ops. Eventually he sees action in both Afghanistan (with the Mujahideen) and fellow Muslims in Bosnia. Samir shows up in Yemen posing as an arms dealer and trying to infiltrate a terrorist network for a rogue CIA operative. Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance, Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI.<br /><br />After Samir and Omar escape from the prison aided by terrorist sympathizers, they escape to France where Omar introduces Samir to Fareed Mansour, Omar's boss in the terrorist network. Fareed is no Mohammed Atta (fanatic ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists) but rather an urbane yuppie-type who thinks nothing of drinking alcohol in front of Omar and Samir (supposed devout Muslims). Fareed justifies drinking of alcohol (a sin in the Muslim religion) by stating that it's necessary to blend in to achieve victory as the ends always justify the means. Somehow Aly Khan, an actor of Indian Muslim ancestry, seemed more like a stock Hollywood villain than a representation of an actual terrorist.<br /><br />Even less convincing is Samir's ideological disagreement with Fareed while they're having dinner at an outdoor caf&eacute;. Samir makes it quite clear that he feels that Fareed has misinterpreted the Koran to justify violence. It's obvious that the film's screenwriters are trying to make the point that Samir represents the MAJORITY of Muslims--that is, they are peaceful people who reject the methods of terrorists. Nonetheless, would Samir have risked blowing his cover by getting into an argument with the very man who he must prove his allegiance to? Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets by--but the screenwriters cannot help but continually remind us (in the character of Samir) that the majority of Muslims reject violence (whether you agree or not with that idea, it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to 'soften the blow' or 'balance things out' since the films' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists!).<br /><br />Samir is depicted as a man who totally abhors the killing of innocents. However (and here is the big problem with the movie), he is willing to hook up with a lone rogue CIA operative (an intelligence contractor as he is referred to in the movie), a person who he knows virtually nothing about, and plants a bomb in the US consulate in Nice at the behest of this shadowy figure, which accidentally kills eight innocent people. It just seems that there are too many action-thrillers today that trot out the tired storyline of inter-agency government squabbling, especially between the FBI and the CIA.<br /><br />How does this CIA guy pull off the bombing of the US consulate in France no less? To my recollection, most US embassies and consulates are pretty well-guarded. And why Samir would even take a chance in conducting an operation such as this when he knows that something could go wrong is beyond me.<br /><br />While the rogue CIA operative must end up getting bumped off precisely because he is amoral and unprincipled, the FBI fares better here. The two agents, Clayton and Archer, are your typical good cop-bad cop characters. Archer is the bad cop and punches Samir a few times in an early interrogation scene in Yemen. But Clayton (Guy Pearce) is the 'sensitive' good cop--he majored in Arabic studies as an undergraduate and ends up receiving important information from Samir via email at a critical point in the film's story.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it off--and this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorism--he manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time. Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present (Note that the main boss, Nathir, again is no scary Mohammed Atta-type--but rather an ordinary businessman).<br /><br />Traitor does a disservice in the fight against international terrorism. It makes it look all too easy with the good guys easily outwitting the bad guys. But in reality, terrorists such as the 9/11 conspirators were no pushovers; to remind everybody: they beat us--we didn't beat them! Some say that Cheadle's performance here was excellent. I would have to disagree. He comes off as too middle-class, too intellectual to be a former Special Ops guy who is able infiltrate a gang of terrorists. All the preaching throughout the movie reminds me more of a college professor trying to convince a bunch of undergraduates that his cause is just.<br /><br />In the end, 'Traitor' tries hard to be as politically correct as possible, arguing that the war against terror is not antithetical to the teachings of the Muslim religion. But it makes its argument in such a heavy-handed and obvious manner that the film becomes overly didactic. Coupled with a wholly implausible plot, 'Traitor' fails to convince us that we're watching a story that mirrors something that could have come close to happening in reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UUP58XPQW3GF.html">A2UUP58XPQW3GF</a><br/><p>There have been quite a good number of espionage thrillers and undercover police films. "TRAITOR" is equal parts detective story and equal parts terrorist thriller. The direction and screenplay by Jeffrey Nachmanoff is taut, gripping and well blends together elements from the Hong Kong hit "Infernal Affairs", the "24" TV series and the Bourne franchise, but it is also filed with social and theological undertones and messages.<br /><br />After an arms deal in Yemen had gone awry, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda) is arrested and imprisoned with the same men that he has been accused of sabotaging the deal, by contacting the authorities. Samir is under fire from both sides, as the F.B.I. is putting pressure on him to reveal his contacts. When Omar (Said Taghmaoui) orchestrates a jailbreak, has little choice but to join the terrorist leader in his quest to wreak havoc in the United States. But who is Samir really working for?<br /><br />The big draw of "Traitor" is its foreshadowing of Samir's intentions and motivations. The dialogue is kept at a pace to reveal only the minor details as the screenplay goes along, it makes the viewer work to figure out what Samir is really all about, and the script efficiently plays its cards right. Director Nachmanoff deals with certain factors to keep the tense atmosphere, and slowly leaks out more and more information about Samir's beliefs and character It was quite clever to show both the F.B.I. and the terrorist group going through his background. Samir is an ex- U.S. soldier and a very devout Muslim and much of the film focuses on him. There are some integral plot points as Agent Clayton and Agent Archer (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough respectively) to illustrate some of Samir's political beliefs and the intricate "motivational" speeches as Omar recruits new "martyrs" to their cause. There are also some disagreements between Fahid and Samir that give the audience some idea as to how different followers of Islam interpret the Qur'an. All these doses of dialogue are integral to the script as it manages to keep the viewer interested and intrigued.<br /><br />The film also has a lot of emotion and the building tension almost never stops. It is the manner of which the film builds suspense through dialogue and significant scenes that helps the film's pacing and story telling. I liked the fact that there doesn't seem to be any political motives in the film although it does promote some parallels and contradictions in government practices to the terrorist organization. Political ideas and theological teachings are shown being misinterpreted to further extremist goals. But Nachmanoff instead focuses on the evils that men do, that all men's deeds will have to answerable to God. I suppose this is a subtle way to say that extremists are using theological beliefs to intentionally misdirect or "brainwash" their followers. The film isn't very "family-friendly" and definitely not for mainstream audiences with its dark tones of government, radicalism and Islam.<br /><br />Now, the film's biggest credit would have to be Don Cheadle's terrific performance. Samir is a man of Allah and Cheadle bears his soul in his portrayal. Samir is also a skilled soldier, arsonist, bomber but above all, he is a man of God. Cheadle fills his character with an unorthodox sort of appeal, which makes his character all the more compelling and interesting. Guy Pearce (Memento) also does a good supporting performance as Agent Roy Clayton, in a way, he is a man of God but from a different belief--a son of a Baptist preacher. It was quite smart to have such a character dissect another's action. The film has a good pace and the cat and mouse game between Samir and Clayton make for very good entertainment.<br /><br />The film does pay off in the end but I am sure there will be some viewers who may say that the film doesn't offer anything original and I do partly agree. However, the film proved very interesting to me and this time around, the "journey" itself is rewarding. The film's great cinematography (by J. Michael Muro) is full of tense atmosphere that accentuates its mood. Those who are looking for an action-packed film may be a little disappointed as this one doesn't rely heavily on explosions and action scenes; rather it depends on its screenplay to slowly unravel to its revelatory final act. The film does rely on the frightening idea of another terrorist attack on American soil that may turn off some viewers.<br /><br />However, the film is highly-engrossing, a great film with a sensitive subject matter but doesn't dwell on political preaching but instead tries to go into the mindset of a man while using espionage-thriller elements. It is a nicely-shot, tense thriller with some food for thought and the strong performance of Don Cheadle just seals the deal .<br /><br />Recommended! [4- Stars]<br /><br />Video/audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen that diverts from its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35. But it is a nice transfer, natural colors and the overall transfer appears pretty nifty. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is clear and powerful, but sadly there is no DTS track on the Dvd.<br />Bonus Features: Commentary by the director and Cheadle and a 10 minute behind the scenes look. The disc is pretty bare-bones.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I love a good thriller, and Cheadle is a superb actor.  And while this movie was enjoyable, it's not one I'll rewatch.  I think perhaps the modern terrorist theme is just not good entertainment for me; like so many people who aren't interested in movies about the war in Iraq. It's too real.  And Islam always ends up looking bad (regardless of what side Cheadle is actually on).<br /><br />Cheadle's character is devout Muslin - and that is the only thing that is certain about him.  What his true intentions are, he may know but not even understand.  I think maybe the film tried too hard  (as evidenced by some reviewers saying it's difficult to explain the plot). In an effort to keep the audience guessing which side he is on, there is a lot of back and forth.  He's helping the terrorists (but isn't that how you gain their trust?); he's refusing to come clean with the FBI (isn't that just to maintain his cover?).  Every action could potentially be explained either way.  While this kept the suspense high, it also made the film slow if not a little boring.  Do I really care anymore?<br /><br />Overall, this is worth watching at least once.  Cheadle is a great actor and he carries this movie as well as he can with a somber/depressing topic.  This movie requires a viewer to pay close attention.  This isn't James Bond, or even Jason Bourne, (which are fun popcorn flicks) but it's worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie offers a good peek into Islamic belief. Mind you, I said a PEEK, not a complete overview or anything like that, of course. I enjoyed listening to the conversations between Samir and various Muslim men, especially the one he met at the prison and made friends with, their conversations were very enlightening and I learned a few new Islamic expressions.<br /><br />The idea of double agent is carried out rather well. I don't want to say too much in case of spoilers, but I will say that this movie takes advantage of the double agent idea very well and the scenes and pacing are rather even. It's also very exciting, since Samir is faced with some very tough choices, and also goes through a lot - he has to stay on his feet and a step ahead of both groups, which makes for a compelling movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Cheadle is exemplary in the role of Samir Horn.  The title gives away nothing, as you spend the entire plot attempting to understand who is traitor to what, to whom.  It is assumed that Horn is a traitor to his faith, though nothing is as it seems.  While action and drama is the primary focus, the audience is given a crash course in the realities of terrorism, and the bigotries and hypocrisies that come with it.  The film is still entertaining despite its intense unraveling of post 9/11 moral ambiguity.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Ably written and directed, this kind of movie could be terrible in lesser hands. But it's pretty darn good, in large part due to the very strong performance by Don Cheadle as a terrorist/double-agent, and also Said Taghmaoui as his fellow terrorist/friend. Shockingly, this was written by Steve Martin (yes, the comedian!)</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>This is an action packed show that crisscrosses the globe from Africa to Europe to the United States.<br /><br />It features Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, an American Muslim who was born in Sudan.

He was a Special Forces soldier who is now being hunted by the FBI as a terrorist.<br /><br />FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) is relentlessly pursuing him from one continent to another.

For anyone who loves an intense movie, this is a great one to get.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Excellent script, direction, acting and storyline. Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, the "bomb-maker" of a secret terrorist organization is convincing as the "deep cover operative" and Guy Pearce as the relentless FBI agent Roy Clayton on his trail. The last few tension-filled minutes are worth it; and amply demonstrates that superior direction and editing can result in an excellent movie. Great support from Said Taghmaoui as Omar, Samir's "brother-in-arms."<br /><br />The last couple of minutes got me really tense as I thought Don Cheadle (Samir) was going to get blown away by the "other guards" on the boat (what happened to them when the good guys boarded the ship?).<br />Anyway, I figured Samir had somehow sabotaged the simultaneous bombings by wiring the explosives incorrectly on all the bombers. Then I saw that they all seemed to have boarded only one type of bus line. Sure, it could've been a nationwide bus service, so I figured he'd set them all to blow up together. Didn't realize that one was enough to take out the entire "crew." Too bad that hapless bus driver had to be sacrificed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>You have to wonder if Cheadle is making more and more movies that he has a passion for the message?  Thinking Hotel Rwanda and Traitor.<br /><br />In this movie, you are left to question where he is coming from.  To whom is he a traitor to?  Is he a traitor at all?<br /><br />What you get is a sense of the good side of Islam. Cheadle quotes the Quran through the movie, even quoting the opposite views that extremists quote.  My favorite:  "Mohammed said, 'if you kill one man, you kill all of humanity.""  Wow, how powerful.<br /><br />What I like about this movie juxtaposed against movies like 'Body of Lies' or 'Syriana' is that you see Cheadle and the men who are trying to catch him.  Not a lot of back and forth and three story threads at one time.  This movie is one straighforward, intense story.<br /><br />Cheadle is one great actor, he is believable.  You like him, even when he is playing the 'enemy.'  It is a movie that reflects courage and in this confusing world we live in, gives us a sense of balance that must be sought out as we relate to our fellow man.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>This is a typical American action flick in the sense that it features a really smart and tough hero character, in this case Don Cheadle, who is able to outsmart and outfight just about anybody, good guys and bad guys alike. Maybe one reason this film didn't do so well at the box office is because it doesn't have quite as much action as most action movies, for which I give it credit. Also unlike most action movies it doesn't have any super evil villains. There are terrorists, of course, but you see them as people and not just as cardboard bad guys. Then again, a movie portraying Muslims only as evil terrorists and Americans only as good guys would stir things up, wouldn't it?<br /><br />At the end of the movie there is some preachiness about Muslims being used, misguided, and misled, and there is no serious effort to explore the roots of terrorism. One could just as well examine the motivations of homegrown terrorists like Timothy McVeigh. The end of the movie also sets up the obvious sequel, but perhaps there will be no sequel after all.<br /><br />Even with its redeeming qualities, Traitor suffers the same flaw as other action films: implausibility. But that doesn't bother fans of action films. The only reason it bothers me is because I'm not a fan of action films. True action fans may want more action and special effects than this film dishes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A37PV5GMP2ILJC.html">A37PV5GMP2ILJC</a><br/><p>Samir Horn: The truth is complicated<br /><br />This movie is the brainchild of Steve Martin, who switches comedy for more serious fare as executive producer of this gripping spy thriller that goes behind the scenes of a terrorist organization known as the Islamic Brotherhood.<br /><br />As intense as he was in Hotel Rwanda, Don Cheadle gives a first-rate performance as Samir Horn, an explosives expert trained by the US Army Special Forces, who becomes deeply involved with the group.

Instead, it focuses on religion and fanaticism and the negative stereotypes of Islam, and it does a hell of a job, too. It kept me interested from start to finish. But what I like most about this movie is Don Cheadle's performance. He's believable in every shot he's in, especially when he interacts with the FBI and the Agent Clayton (Peaarce) and Omar (Taghmaoui). His acting as a whole is what makes this film a whole lot better. Jeff Daniels was a bit underused in my opinion, but he does a decent job playing his part. And finally, the minimal Middle Eastern music creates the perfect atmosphere for this film. Kudos to Mark Kilian for the score. In fact, kudos to the entire cast and crew for making this movie.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Traitor tries to be both character study and action so it will probably disappoint both audiences.

But if you're looking for something that feels like it could happen and what it might be like to get caught up in it, I think you'll like Traitor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I didn't know that much at all when I picked up this film, but after watching it, I'm glad I made the choice. You can't really discuss this film without giving anything away-and there are some confusing aspects about it in general but overall it was a pretty cool suspence/action film.  Don Cheadle gives a decent performance as a devoutly religious man who it seems has taken up with terrorists in the Middle East. The film actually takes you across the world to different countries where events take place that all lead up to the interesting climax. I can't really say it was that predictable but it wasn't completely inventive either. I think it's better if you don't know too much going into it-I'm glad I didn't since it all seemed that more mysterious.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>Oddly enough, "Traitor" combined action with thoughtfulness.  What does one do when they can't tell who the good guys are?  Don Cheadle gives an excellent performance as Samir Horn.  Cheadle is becoming one of the most interesting actors because his film selections have power such as the Oscar-winning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> & his Oscar-nominated performance in "Hotel Rwanda."  Australia's Guy Pearce who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000C2IQR">The Hard Word</a> plays Ron Clayton, an agent who tracks Cheadle across continents.  Said Taghmaoui who was in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMOW">Hidalgo (Widescreen Edition)</a> was nominated for "Best Breakout Performance" by Black Reel Awards for this film.  As Omar, the friend who is skeptical about Samir and then becomes his greatest champion, his performance is stirring.  Neal McDonough from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C5LLLY">88 Minutes</a> & TV's "Desperate Housewives" plays agent Max Archer like a thug.  Jeff Daniels plays an operative helping Samir.  Alyy Khan does a good job as the playboy Fareed Mansour.  Jeffrey Nachmanoff wrote the screen play for "Day After Tomorrow" and also directs this film.  There are enough twists in "Traitor" that one must pay close attention.

Throughout the movie we learn about the life of a devout Muslim Sudanese/American man that seems to have a conflicted past. We know his father was killed by a terrorist and he had some military training. We think he may have worked for the CIA. The question is what is he up to now and who is he really working for presently? He seems to be helping a terrorist group plan a major offensive against the United States.

Yes, it's an "international spy thriller/espionage/war on terror story that spans the globe." Some locations are exotic--Sudan, Yemen, Marseille, also London and Washington. But the movie is more, much more. Afterwards, you may think about the unanswerable question--does the end justify the means? And if you conclude it does, what's the personal price you pay? Cheadle's anguish is plain to see as he wrestles with the question. Guy Pearce is also marvelous as an FBI agent who believes he knows the answer, but never stops thinking. Highly recommended!<br /><br />This film has a PG-13 rating but I'd be cautious.

The question in this film, for at least half of the movie, is: "Is Samir (Don Cheadle) a good guy or a bad guy?"<br /><br />I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film. Suffice to say that this will keep your interest for the full running time and is a thinking person's movie more than most.<br /><br />Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Neal McDonough, Said Taghmaoui and Alyy Kahn are all fantastic in the lead roles. The direction and photography also is top-notch.  Those who pick apart this movie nit-picking because it's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters.  One thing that's odd about this film: it has very strong statements which will please both liberals and conservatives, both devoutly religious folks and atheists.  It pretty much covers the field.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>110 minutes of tense, sobering (borderline ridiculous in places) action drama with a top notch cast, that gets bogged down in it's own multi threaded storyline. This is an entertaining cat and mouse bad guy / good guy? on the run from the government, hiding a bigger more sinister plot type yarn - it's of a  similar style to movies like Fugitive, and the more recent Body of Lies, but goes it's own (muddled at times) direction and is originally dramatic. All that said it tries to cover every angle of post 9/11 Terrorism fears and misinterpretations, and ends up a bit of a mess in places. You have the stereotypical CIA agent who's bigoted and roughs up suspects, and another with a PhD in Arabic Studies preaching tolerance. There are fanatical Islamics and Terrorists and also thinking Muslims. Being an American production, US foreign policy is only ever alluded too, or hinted at, Oil, Iraq and War don't get a mention for instance. Holding all this together is Don Cheadle, excellent and believable as ever as the main character Samir Horn. With an American Mom, Sudanese Father, highly trained skills learned in the Special Forces and strange allegiances that are ambiguous at best, you know you're in for a treat, as he is chased by (among others) the aforementioned PhD CIA Agent, played by Guy Pearce. I gave it four stars for a solid storyline, good action scenes, and top notch acting all round. I would have given it five, it it hadn't had tried so hard to represent EVERY possible angle and ideology on a very tangled subject.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>There are some excellent reviews here for film content and story so once again I will stick with the BD type review.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent film from start to finish with plenty of technical tests for an HD display. There are a multitude of night shots and action scenes in dark places, with a spattering of desert, city and urban sequences. I watched this on several LCD and plasma displays and the film easily shows the shortcomings of the displays that are less than a 120 refresh rate.<br /><br />In watching the 2 short docus accompanying the BD (which are the same as the DVD features) there are different styles of cameras used which shows through on some of the night shots; Some grain and artifact appear infrequently but it does not detract in any significant way. The sound and music are mixed adequately to test the high ranges and mids. But for a BD presentation, it cannot compete with 5 star BDs, especially with the special features being overlooked almost entirely. There is some nice locale footage in the 2nd docu, but both total less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />This is one of those titles that stands alone on the film content/production.

In actuality, this rather tired and de riquer terrorist retread of DONNIE BRASCO is an excuse..a trojan horse to lure the viewer in thinking he/she is going to see a movie about the War on Terror but really so he/she can be subjected to quite literally.......as in one can practically hear the pencil checking the boxes on the list.........every single liberal/CAIR propaganda point about said conflict. Ergo lies and nonsense. Everything from how Muslims are really all warm and cuddly to how the terrorists are incapable of mounting any effective assault on the US.......unless the US actually helps them first. The terrorist group is, of course, a fictional one allowing the film to portray these terrorists as being the type who feel REALLY bad ala PARADISE NOW blowing up innocent people and hate themselves in the morning but what can you do? The United States is really a racist Empire who like to drop bombs on brown people and the Terrorists are just like the Founding Fathers during the American Revolution. The FBI is shown being especially helpless is fighting the terrorists and it is something only another Muslim can do so we should just give up the fight and let the Barbarians clean their own house. They have done so well thus far after all. We are given, at least, two supposed quotes from the Koran about how Muslims should not kill anyone which not only do I---who suffered through the damn thing..have no recollection of reading---but seem to be at odds with the multiple admonitions in the Koran about how you must kill the Infidels and Jews. All the Muslims in the film are shown being oh so respectful of women.........especially the terrorists. The terrorists are falsely compared to the Ku Klux Klan---which is falsely called a Christian terrorist group. And so on and so on. The only thing the film misses is the Bush is Hitler trope. Perhaps in the extended version??<br /><br /> What the film never touches upon even obiguely is just why is the US is at War with these Muslim terrorists and their state sponsors and why do these barbarians keep going around killing people? There is no mention of Wahabism. No mention of the rampant anti-semitism. There is no mention of the world wide caliphate or Sharia law. There is nothing at all.<br /><br /> A film concerning this subject would artistically, aesthetically, morally be obligated to address this matter to explain WHY WE FIGHT but again and again this is simply something that Hollywood is either unable or, more likely, unwilling to deal with.<br /><br /> Meanwhile the killing goes on.<br /><br /> Traitor indeed.<br /><br /> As such, this is not a film about the terrorist enemy but about the Liberal desire to return to the Clinton era policy of ignoring them and maybe they will go away. Muslims are our friends. The terrorists are vaguely heroic and we need to understand why they hate us. Give peace a chance.<br /><br /> The film is a fraud and a fake.......much to its detriment. No liberal would be caught dead seeing a movie about Islamic terrorists no matter how sympathetic and justified since that would acknowledge they actually exist and, in any case, they can probably recite the film's PARTY LINE by heart. No normal person would see it once it got out what the film is up to. Which is why it sank like a stone and no one cares.<br /><br /> Not a badly made film........but there is absolutely no reason for anyone on either side of the issue to see it.<br /><br /> Even Muslim Barbarians would be bored by it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Traitor" is a thriller against the background of the present political climate in the world. Jeffrey Nachmanoff's political thriller is slick, well-acted and mostly riveting, but the film's convoluted (some may say incredible) story requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />At the center of its globe-trotting story is two characters: the chased and the chaser. They are Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) and Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Samir is a former soldier selling explosive devices to radicals. Roy is a tough, straight-shooting FBI agent hunting down the culprits involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Europe.<br /><br />Samir and Roy had once met in Yemen. When arrested, a devout Muslim Samir is offered a deal from Roy, but he refuses. Later Samir escapes from a Yemeni Prison with another inmate Omar (Sa?d Taghmaoui). By the end of the 114 minute film, Roy and his no-nonsense partner Max (Neal McDonough) will know what Samir is heading for.<br /><br />"Traitor" keeps the viewer guessing right up to a certain moment, when the fifth major character steps in. From then on, things start to look a bit familiar, if not predictable, and its resolution is too unbelievable. Some may be reminded of "Body of Lies," released only two months after "Traitor." Like Ridley Scott thriller "Traitor" describes high-tech aspects of modern-day warfare, explores inner conflict of characters, and wraps up the complex storyline with a too-neat conclusion. "Traitor" is an effective thriller, but a second viewing will make you notice some major plot holes in it.</p></br></body></html>

Score by John Williams.<br /><br /> Starring Mel Gibson, Jason Isaacs, Heath Ledger, Chris Cooper, Rene Auberjonois, Peter Woodward and Tom Wilkinson as General Lord Charles Cornwallis.<br /><br /> This..the story of the American Revolution in South Carolina told through various fictional amalgams of real personages along with real persons and events was a masterpiece when it was first released and time........and the extended cut available on DVD has only confirmed its status.<br /><br /> Rather like GETTYSBURG inspired its own cast and behind the camera creative teams, so did this film...since except for Isaac, Woodward, Auberjonois and Gibson, no one before or since this film have impressed me tremendously............and the film IS endlessly brilliant and inspired. From Gibson's sublime performance as Benjamin Martin...a man tortured by his bloody past in the French and Indian War and, except when fighting, is incredibly unsure of himself to the beautiful cinematography(the film is simply beautiful to look at at times), there is not a single false moment nor a concession to modern degraded sensibilities. The film goes effortlessly from tremendous battle sequences to a tearjerking moment of a father having to leave his daughter to go off to war. Jason Isaacs as the fictionalized version of Banestre Tarleton knocked my socks off in 2000 with his Classic Hollywood style Basil Rathbone/George Sanders villainy and that impression has not diminished. Isaacs well deserved his later roles in everything from BLACK HAWK DOWN to his definitive Captain Hook in PETER PAN.<br /><br /> The history---though condensed in sections(the battles of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse are combined) is generally excellent with casual references to everything from Kips Bay to Horatio Gates. John Williams....for a change..produced a fine score that can be listened on its own merits without visuals. The dialogue is actual dialogue, rather than mindless catch phrases, with true meaning and emotional import. Historical issues and military tactics are actually discussed. Characters actualy live and breath rather than just exist to provide body count money shots. When someone dies here, the viewer feels it.  The viewer understands what is at stake in this war and feels sadness at the defeats and pride for his/her country as she rises to greatest and victory.<br /><br /> Simply put. I love this film to death. Somehow it snuck out of Hollywood when no one was looking and is one of the greatest films of the 21 st century as well as being that incredibly rare bird....a film about the American Revolution......a rarer good film about the American Revolution and of the handfull of truly great films about the American Revolution.<br /><br /> One of the very few films made after 1980 that is as good as something made before 1965. One of the very few films made after 1980 that I do not automatically have to treat like a special child since it is, after all, a modern film and it can't help itself.<br /><br /> A masterpiece of epic filmmaking. A practical throwback to the 50s/60s era of the genre.<br /><br /> Sit down and show this to the kids.......now.<br /><br /> Enlightening. Ennobling. Entertaining. The reason film is called an Art form.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Ben Martin ("Mel Gibson") is a scarred vet of the French and Indian War who resists and then enters the revolutionary war in this movie that seems at times an update of  the superior "Braveheart".<br /><br />A happily settled widower in Carolina, Martin stays aloof of the revolutionary cause, mostly because of his distaste for any government (serving a tyrant 3000 miles away beats serving one ruling from down the block) but also because he's still haunted by the brutalities of the older war. The war comes to him, hot on the heels of his fiery son-turned Continental soldier. Although the British forces in the Carolinas are led by sage and otherwise humane general Cornwallis, the Tories' brutal side is embodied by one charachter - the sadistic Colonel Tavington. In his first confrontation with the colonel, Martin's eldest son is captured, while the youngest is cruelly shot. Martin joins the revolutionary effort, amassing a scraggly horde of swamp fighters who pick the redcoats off from behind trees while the Continentals' army struggles vainly out in the open against the superior might of the redcoats. The revolution's only hope is to keep the enemy forces in Carolina - which has numbers, weapons and Cornwallis on its side - from linking up to the British Army in NY and choking Washington into defeat. The French have promised a blockade and their own military support, but nothing materializes quickly. Martin doesn't play by British rules, refusing to line up his meager and swampy forces as cannon fodder for the British. Martin's early successes galvanize the Colonial's hopes, but also rouse the British, and soon invite more personal tragedy for Martin and his family. Col. Tavington doesn't play by the rules either. Realizing his military tactics (which include annihilating whole towns suspected of abetting the Continentals' guerrilas) will prevent him from returning to England, he sets on a path that will give him his own fiefdom in America ("let's talk about....Ohio"). With the Continental's position improving and becoming more desperate at the same time, the stage is set for a climactic battle where Martin will face Tavington and the might of the British Empire without a swamp to hide behind.<br /><br />Historically, the flick is suspect.  There are no rich slave owners (Martin's slaves were released and remain as his tenants), and white soldiers erase their prejudice against black patriots as soon as the two have shared a battle.  As for the flick's nominal villain, it's hard to take the evil Tavingotn at face value: were there as evil a character as Tavington fighting in the colonies, would the script have had to invent a fictional composite?<br /><br />"The Patriot" follows "Braveheart" very closely, but the story does go its own direction at times, and there's more of a story to the bit players - tough guerrila soldiers who find themselves quite emotionally vulnerable when their families are victimized, or other white soldiers who learn that black soldiers can be just as valiant as themselves and should be free. The British aren't the uniformly snearing and evil crew that faced the scots in that older film. While patriotism is upfront, the film doesn't come off jingoistic.  Unlike "Braveheart", Gibson's character here tends to embody a cause more often than a person who just happens to be critical to the cause.  All-in-all, good for a night when you're in the mood for an epic, but nothing great is on.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>It seemed for a time that Mel Gibson thought that the one thing that makes a new picture better than his last picture is a higher body count. Rack up an astonishing 182 dead bodies in 'The Patriot'. This includes death by all manner of devices 'civilised' and otherwise, including a beheading by cannonfire. Did such things happen? Indeed. Do such things continue to happen around the world? Well, there are fewer tomahawk axings (save at the occasional baseball game) but, yes, alas, we still live in a violent world. Does a movie like 'The Patriot' gorify, er, I mean, glorify it too much?<br /><br />I thought this was a reasonably good movie. I could have done without the more than 1-dead-body-per-minute body count, but I thought this was an interesting tale.<br /><br />--Double standards in movies--<br /><br />One thing that irritates me, if you will permit me a brief digression, is that this epic film competed in epic terms, with the earlier summer release Gladiator. One criticism of Gladiator I heard over and over was that it was not true to the history of the time. I did not hear that criticism levelled at The Patriot, which is just as fictional while being based in a real-world scenario.<br /><br />Of course, another parallel with Gladiator that I couldn't help but notice is that of a major villain (the emperor Commodus in G, and the despicable Tavington (played admirably by Jason Isaacs) here) taunting our hero to try to make him lose his cool, only to be rebuffed and get his come-uppance later.<br /><br />Ah, formulas aren't just for the chemistry lab...<br /><br />--Basic Plot--<br /><br />Mel Gibson turns in his usual good performance as Benjamin Martin (how colonial a name is that?), a widowed single father of a large brood of children, who had had enough of war in the French and Indian War (perhaps America's most forgotten war), reluctantly goes along with his idealistic son as he determines the best way to preserve his family (his personal definition of and attachment to liberty) is to drive the British out.<br /><br />There is a dark secret in Martin's past (which I won't reveal here). Alas, I didn't think it was THAT dark, but then, in colonial times, well...<br /><br />Of course, the British (in this film, and in real life) had no reason to think that they could ever lose this war (the loss of the colonies is perhaps best likened to America's failure in Vietnam -- how can a superpower, and Britain the strongest superpower of the time, lose a war against underequipped, ill-trained, poorly disciplined... well, you get the drift).<br /><br />The battlefield drama, the struggle to decide what is right and wrong, the fight with the inner demons and the past, make this an interesting psychological drama despite the pile of dead bodies in the background.<br /><br />--Production notes--<br /><br />The costs were staggering, but this held all the elements for a summer blockbuster -- star power, compelling theme (ID 4 also grabbed the July holiday slot, and did well, and shares many of the same people in production with The Patriot). Many have described this as the American Braveheart -- I wonder, if Gibson were not in, if that would be true? Gibson claims not to have given much advice to the filmmakers of 'The Patriot', whereas he was in charge of Braveheart. If the battlefield scenes look similar, that is because battlefield scenes do look similar, over time (and across films).<br /><br />--Historical notes--<br /><br />This movie shows in stark terms some of the conditions and costs of the American Revolution/War with the Colonies. It is perhaps one of the more regrettable wars in human history, much more akin to the American Civil War a century later, as it pitted relatives and friends against each other. Could there have been a better way?<br /><br />Alas, we'll never know.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I remember when I first saw this film, about two days after my wedding.  My wife and I were lounging around the house for a week before we left for our honeymoon and so we spent a lot of time watching movies.  Well, we never really say through a movie in it's entirety and so, a few years later, I found that I didn't really remember anything about this movie (outside of that gory hatchet murder scene).<br /><br />So I watched it again.<br /><br />The thing for me is that `The Patriot' is just not that great.  There are a lot of films that circulate this genre, and you really have to stand up tall to be taken seriously.  For me (and I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion), this movie hardly stands tall enough.<br /><br />This is sad, because the performances here are all very, very good, at times broaching on fantastic.  I am not a big Mel Gibson fan (in fact, I've only really ever lauded him in `Ransom') but I felt that he was outstanding here, truly balancing the political, emotional and parental aspects of this man.  He found the grit within the script and used it to bring this character to life before our eyes.  Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is also wonderfully used here.  He had just started building his career in 2000 and this is one of those performances that makes you stand back and take notice.  Tom Wilkinson is always great (I love that man) and even though he doesn't have a huge role, his scenes are brilliantly executed.  Even the token villain role is given an extra push through the eyes of Jason Isaacs, who chews scenery like you wouldn't believe, yet not in that regrettably clich&eacute;d way.<br /><br />But, the films plot, which is little more than a revenge drama, takes this film down a few notches for me.  Unlike `Gladiator', which came out this very same year and used a similar plot structure (to drastically superior effect), `The Patriot' doesn't seem to be able to use that element to its benefit.  Instead, it comes off rather elementary and hollow.<br /><br />The films direction is effective, and the battle scenes (while nothing overly impressive) are very well crafted.  The savagery of certain scenes (like the aforementioned hacking) is also used in an effective and memorable fashion, and the cinematography adds layers of beauty to the films gritty core.  It is entertaining (although I did find that it tended to drag in parts) but it falls short of being anything truly remarkable, despite all that it has going for it.<br /><br />BTW, I'm not a history buff, and I don't pretend to be, so the historical inaccuracies that many have called this film out for don't really bother me (in fact, I didn't even really notice them).  For me, this film wasn't claiming to be a history lesson (which was part of the problem, since the clich&eacute;d `revenge' formula should have been ditched for a more astute look at the war) so I didn't pick it apart for not being one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DRKVXO300RUE.html">A1DRKVXO300RUE</a><br/><p>Being a huge fan of the revolutionary era, I love this movie (and not for its historical (in)accuracies).  Had to upgrade to Blu Ray of course, but was unimpressed.  Its mildly better than the SD version, so I'd recommend buying only if you can get a good deal or if you don't already own the SD version.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This movie was pretty cool. I'm not sure if it is a true story, but I like to think it is. I am very much into true story movies. It is very sad how so many have died in this movie over that evil man.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Okay, I'm going to nail my colors to the mast here: not only do I like Roland Emmerich's The Patriot, but I also think it's also a damn good film, and not just because so many films about the Revolutionary War are so pitifully bad (Revolution, cough cough). While it is driven by the simplistic revenge motif that all American epics seem to need to stand a chance at the box-office, it does give a good sense of the slow progress of the war as it deteriorated from a `civilized' confrontation waged according to the rules of battle to an increasing vicious guerrilla war for survival. The battles are convincingly brutal and for perhaps the first time in a movie it shows how cannonballs were really used - not as explosives but to smash their way through the flesh and bone of the opposing ranks of soldiers.<br /><br />Yes, it glosses over the real Swamp Fox's racism in favor of an idealized vision of racial harmony and it invents a church-burning incident redolent of old anti-Nazi propaganda films (revenge on Herr Director's part, perhaps?), but it's not quite as simplistic as that. For much of the first half Mel Gibson's character takes no prisoners himself, taking genuine pleasure in killing surrendering British troops until he persuaded to stop more for propaganda reasons than moral ones. Similarly, it points out that this was initially very much a civil war, with colonial settlers divided among themselves over where their loyalties lay (people tend to forget that rather than Americans vs. British, it was British vs. British at that time). Certainly history gets a better deal here than it did in Gibson's own Braveheart. And give it credit for at least not having Gibson stab the bad guy with Old Glory.<br /><br />Don't use it as a history lesson by any means, though it's not quite the travesty outraged tabloids have implied, but as a lavish, old-fashioned epic, complete with a cast of thousands (even if many of them are digital), glorious widescreen photography and a fine score by John Williams. The theatrical cut boasts a good array of extras, with some featurettes and trailers that were not carried over to the extended cut that is also available.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>One can easily discuss the negative aspects of "The Patriot."  The film is not historically accurate; its main character (played by Mel Gibson) is an utterly perfect and flat character that has no visible faults and is somehow able to articulate the ideas of freedom better than the framers of the Constitution; the film is slanted towards the American side, portraying the British in an overtly negative light; the blacks and French are underplayed and stereotyped; etc.  But to conclude that the film has no worth based upon these points is ridiculous.  One must step back from the film and ask, "Was I entertained?  Did the movie hit upon some things that made me think?  Feel?"<p>"The Patriot" is certainly an enjoyable film visually.  The battle scenes are terrific and provide a plenty of visual and emotional interest-an aspect that is surprising with its long pans and relatively slow camera angles.  The scene in which Gibson first "re-enters" his warrior mode and almost single-handedly takes on a British regiment of twenty soldiers has some spectacular hatchet fighting and hand combat choreography.  This scene alone makes the film worth watching for any lover of guerilla tactics or knife fighting/close combat.  On top of the action, the screenplay is quite clever in parts, despite its tendency towards the sentimental.  Mel Gibson's performance seems very much like a continuation of his role in "Braveheart"-one can hardly notice a difference in the characters.  But he plays this part well, the part of a man who alone can save a country from the oppressive enemy.  In the scenes where he deals with the loss of his family his acting is moving and quite believable. <p>There is much to dislike in this picture.  If one is upset by the historical inaccuracies, I ask why they are looking to Hollywood to fill them in on American history.  Writing a film that satisfied all of the points mentioned above would not only be an impossibility-it would be boring and lack any appeal.  This movie tells the story of a man who fights for his family and, in doing this, for a new country and an ideal.  While the love stories seem contrived and thrown in, the love of family, the love of brotherhood and camaraderie, and the incredible action all make this an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Few films are made about the Revolution since WW II, the financiers on Wall Street must not be comfortable with the concept. The film begins by showing a meeting to discuss Independence, and the need for war. One man talks of &quot;taxation without representation&quot;, but the Declaration of Independence lists all the grievances. (Do you remember them?) There is no mention of the 1765 Stamp Act and the ruinous taxation that followed. There is little said of the business of this planter. Isn't tobacco the equivalent of coca leafs or opium poppies? The film gives an example of the fighting of that time. The Carolinas suffered the most in the Revolution, even more than New Jersey, where many of the battles were fought (the land bridge connecting Philadelphia to New York). The after battle scene shows pistols and muskets used to kill wounded prisoners; they would have used gun butts, bayonets, or swords as in other massacres. The film is accurate in showing boys experienced with firearms, and the use of knives and tomahawks in close combat.<p>Colonel Mel leads his militia into guerrilla attacks on British supply wagons. The militia was usually used to attack foraging troops. These losses tied down the British regulars and prevented their advance. No mention of the Loyalist militia here. The film shows the British setting a trap to ambush the ambushers! (How could this failure of intelligence occur? Just for dramatic effect?) The &quot;Ghost&quot; plays a trick on the General to get 18 prisoners released. Another failure of intelligence? Historians will object to some of the events created for dramatic effects. But popular entertainment isn't academic history. The celebration at the seashore seems designed for an intermission.<p>The scene where the townspeople are locked in a church and then burned alive has been criticized as an invention. But it symbolizes the cruelty and horrors of war in the Carolinas. Afterwards Mel's men catch up to some of the troops. Could that experienced Colonel be surprised by not posting guards? The evil Colonel escapes by a ruse; would an experienced soldier be fooled?<p>The final battle seems to be based on the battle of Cowpens, when the retreating militia led the charging British into the prepared trap and won the battle. There is a final confrontation between Mel and the evil Colonel. Cornwallis is forced to retreat to Yorktown, where the French fleet traps them and forces a surrender. The War of Independence was won! But you owe it to yourself to read a history book to learn more. Mike Wright's &quot;What They Didn't Teach You About the American Revolution&quot; is a good place to start.</p></br><a href="../users/A17N23WXA7EAF.html">A17N23WXA7EAF</a><br/><p>"The Patriot" is an immensely entertaining, action packed film with some of the best battlefield and hand-to-hand combat scenes in modern cinema. Mel Gibson plays a retired British soldier and master of a tobacco plantation, named Captain Martin, in South Carolina at the start of the Revolutionary War. As the colonists get fired up and prepare for the eight-year struggle that will ultimately make them Americans the Captain is reluctant to join in the action. Having earned a bloodthirsty reputation in a controversial incident during the preceding French and Indian War, Martin wants no part of the horrors to come. But Martin is unable to prevent his son, Gabriel from enlisting with the rebels and when the tide of the war turns against them, a wounded Gabriel finds himself back on the plantation pursued by British dragoons. When the evil leader of the dragoons captures Gabriel and leads him off to be executed, Martin is suddenly forced to dust off his old war trunk, retrieve his tomahawks and pistols from it, and to fulfill our cinematic hopes by blasting back from his retirement. What follows are some amazing, rifle ambushes, swash buckling, realistically choreographed tomahawk fighting and a whole lot of absurd historical propaganda.<p>Historical propaganda? Yes, I'm afraid so. While the battle scenes in this film are immensely realistic, the historical picture it portrays is specious to the point of idiocy. I don't mind that a whole lot of rhetoric floats around about "the cause" and "the country" and any other allusions to the magnificent nation to come when in fact the primary cause of the Revolution was the desire to eliminate excessive British taxation. It doesn't even bother me that the film makers go overboard in vilifying the British by having them massacre civilians in a scene more reminiscent of Nazi occupied Europe or a Central American village that had fallen into the hands of CIA trained death squads. <p>What really irritates me is how in a scene that screams of revisionism, a black slave joins the colonists in their final battle and says he's doing it "for the cause". Doesn't he realize, as the audience surely must, that when this war is over his people still have one hundred years of official slavery ahead of them, and another hundred years of brutal oppression to follow? Or do the filmmakers hope to persuade us that the Revolutionary War was a beautiful, egalitarian, multi-cultural event? Somehow I doubt audience members will go home and pick up Charles A. Beard's "An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States" which clearly spells out that the sacred parchment that ultimately resulted from the Revolutionary War represented a very narrow class of white property owners and excluded the poor, blacks, and women. Having enjoyed Mel Gibson's visceral tomahawk handling, our kids will go home and think that slavery played no part in the building of this country because the black guy in the movie got to fight alongside the white guys "for the cause". It's funny how we have to rate our films for healthy things such as nudity and sexuality but not for something as destructive as a flagrant historical lie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This epic tale of the Revolutionary War and it's effect on one man's family stars Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin with Heath Ledger as his son, Gabriel. The story opens in 1776, and South Carolinian Martin is arguing against going to war. He feels his priority is the safety of his family. However, when his fifteen-year old son, Thomas, is brutally murdered by the odious Red Coat, Col. Tavington, (deliciously played by Jason Isaacs), he and Gabriel join the militia.<br /><br />The grand battle scenes are intertwined with intimate vignettes about the individuals in the militia: Gabriel falls in love and marries, Martin has romantic feelings for his sister-in-law, and his traumatised daughter speaks for the first time.<br /><br />Mel Gibson is wonderful as the honorable and loving father and soldier. Heath Ledger is the stuff teen-idols are made of.  You'll love to hate Jason Isaacs, who almost steals the show as the arrogant and sadistic Col. Tavington.  The Patriot is a rousing tale of our early history, with excellent actors, script, and soundtrack.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>THE PATRIOT (2000, not to be confused with Steve Seagal's excellent 1998 film of the same name - even the DVD covers are identical with face-on portraits of the respective stars) is the story of Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a South Carolina State Legislature member and former hero of the French-Indian War.<br /><br />Harrison Ford turned down this role, angered that the film portrayed the Revolution as a one-man crusade of revenge, which I think is silly. I'd have loved this film with Ford rather than Gibson, yet I can understand why Ford got angry about this fairy tale in lieu of some more solid, reliable history.<br /><br />The year is 1776, and on the Martin farm it looks like all peace and tranquility. News of the Revolution is anxiously awaited by Benjamin's sons Gabriel (Heath Ledger, how sad to see him looking so young and beautiful) and Thomas (equally lovely Gregory Smith). They want to sign up and fight. Martin is opposed to the war, though he concedes America ought to be free.<br /><br />Gabriel enlists and Benjamin can't stop him. Later, Benjamin is quartering both British and American wounded at his home. The Darth Vader of England, Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) shows up, gets irked and burns the Martin house to the ground after murdering the American wounded. Benjamin still resists any involvement, but hits the ceiling when finally, young Thomas is murdered by Tavington.<br /><br />This is when The Ghost is born. Martin tears off after the officers who have Gabriel and dispatches them with heavenly force. I have to say, when we first saw this film, we thought it had great stuff in it that has influenced lots of subsequent films. Director Roland Emmerich (of several favorites of mine including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OQCV2E">2012</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Q732O">10,000 B.C.</a> - vid. my review - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMXX">The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005V9IK">Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>) took his time with this.<br /><br />With extensive help and consultation courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution, Emmerich delivered a picture-perfect, detailed rendering of that era not to be matched until HBO gave us <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8">John Adams</a>. Though a fictional story, most of the characters are based on real folks. General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) is all too real. The Smithsonian even allowed the producers to examine genuine uniforms from the period, and one of the producers remarked how moved he was when he saw sweat stains in a uniform's collar. He remarked, "It was the sweat of the endeavor to free this country!"<br /><br />There are too many stellar performers to list them all - but now here comes the ugly of it: this movie LOVES the slow-mo, and it gets irritating in a film that is 165 minutes long. There is a lot of sub-par operatic music by John Williams, but an equally generous number of brilliant themes that show up in the HARRY POTTER films too. The dialogue is too modern, and is sometimes just as irritating as the shots of a screaming Mel Gibson smearing themselves at a snail's pace across the screen.<br /><br />It is this along with the fact that this story is a work of fiction that makes it too much of a fairy tale for my taste - but then, I am not complaining and I never did complain about that. Hopefully this will silence the unworthy criticism of anyone who states the fact that this is a fictional story. It is barely - just barely - based on a true character and events.<br /><br />Furthermore, though I thought I detected a few added scenes in this special-edition DVD, the special features are pretty rotten. Only an hour-long documentary or a piecemeal documentary with good information can make such a DVD release truly "special" - and this thing is missing all that in spades.<br /><br />All in all, if it is understood this is a fantasy (or "fairy tale") film with painstaking detail, it is not only worthy of viewing; it's darned good. You may not feel so patriotic about it, but you'll feel it's a good film. Many reviewers here seem to despise it for some reason, but I loved it overall. One doesn't need to be a historian - or claim to be a historian - to love a film like this.<br /><br />However, I think they'd have gotten a lot more mileage out of it if they had entitled it "The Ghost", made it closer to an actual historic event, and had not stinted on some of the matters of good taste.<br /><br />One final note: while I made what I saw as good edits to this review, I did not do it for the happiness or edification of any other reviewer here. Or any commenter, or any random screwy person. I frequently edit my reviews to improve them. So I will not be adding any names to the review's authorship or thanking anyone in particular. I do all this hard work on my own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson plays the role of an early American colonist, Benjamin Martin. He is a reluctant hero, a man who does not take sides in the Revolutionary War until forced to do so. When one of his young sons is killed during a gratuitous display of brutality by a British officer, and another is taken away to be hanged, Martin is at a crossroad in his life. This galvanizes Martin, our reluctant hero, into action, and he rescues his otherwise doomed son with a ferocity of purpose that is gripping.<br /><br />Once committed, Martin becomes a leader of the local militia and the scourge of the British. There is a droll scene in which he and Cornwallis, the leader of the British campaign, meet, and Martin manages to get the better of him. It is here, however, that the British officer who killed Martin's son locks horns with Martin, and the lines are drawn. This sets the tenor for what is to come.<br /><br />There are scenes of great barbarity and pathos, which tell one that war is not just about heroism and great battles, but about personal pain and loss. It is about a desire for freedom and the privilege of living in peace without the yoke of tyranny around one's neck. Despite the odds, Martin cuts a wide swath of destruction among the British, and his prowess and leadership on the battlefield ultimately lead to a turning point in the American Revolution.<br /><br />This movie shows the effect that the war had on civilians and how their lives were affected by it. The film is about love, family, honor, dishonor, tragedy, and redemption. Deftly directed by Roland Emmerich, this is a well-acted film with stirring action scenes. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast as a colonist  whose life is turned upside down by the vagaries of war. The supporting cast is, likewise, excellent. This is simply a film that should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Now I know there have been a lot of people on here who won't agree with me on this, but I wan't to be perfectly clear when I say: This film is the best movie I've ever seen! A great story of country, family, and vengeance set against the backdrop of the American Revolution. I think this is DEFINITELY Mel Gibson's best performance. Who else could pull off a performance as a man with a dark secret who must leave his peaceful life behind and join the American Revolution in order to protect his family? Tom Cruise? Never! Tom Hanks? Maybe! Mel Gibson? Perfect Fit! The film's got great storytelling, fine visual effects, and superb acting from all involved! And the DVD is AWESOME!

Never mind the bad press he has gotten over the years, he has still produced a credible body of work and The Patriot is certainly up there with his best.  This movie has been around for quite some time so no 'spoiler alerts' need be necessary.  The quality of audio is excellent and the use of surrounds gets a well deserved workout which I always appreciate.  Using uncompressed PCM I audio,  the shifts between the surrounds when appropriate were well blended and very distinct.  Really well done on that score.  The audio also was nicely balanced between the center channel dialogue and foley fx going to the sides or rears. Once you set your audio volume levels, you could just leave them alone.<br />The video quality was also excellent shifting between cool color grading in evening and early morning scenes and either deeply saturated or, in a couple of cases, desaturated for daytime and battle sequences.  The extended portions included were seamlessly done, that is all except one short time lapse scene at the end of Gibson's attack on the troops leading his son, Heath Ledger, away to be hanged.  I suppose this one small scene would lend itself to the 'ghost' name that was applied to his character but it was the one scene I felt could have been left out.<br />Deep blacks and strong details in the shadows support my contention for this high quality video rating as well as the lack of any grain or video noise or artificating.<br />Bottom line,  glad I have it.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

Whoever thought that lining up in a big mass in front of a group of musket-wielding automatons was a good idea, is a military leader without a hint of imagination.  Through the ardent desire to form a country free from oppression, a country is born, and its first heroes<br /><br />STORY:  Col. Benjamin Martin (Gibson) wishes to stay out of war and seek peace.  With a recently deceased wife he counters the growing surge to fight the Brits with this brilliantly prophetic line about having one's own government, "Why should I trade one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away? An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can."<br /><br />PATRIOTISM:  When his son Gabrielle (Ledger) enlists without his permission, Benjamin is heart-fallen and worried.  With just about everyone, however, enlisting is looked upon as brave, just, and patriotic.  As the wars rage in his own crops and on his land, his young family is unwillingly embroiled in a country's birth.  When his despotic middle child foolishly rushes into a gun-fight without a gun, Benjamin decides it's about time to unleash the fury within (the defense of one's country is closely tied to the security of a man's family).<br /><br />FAVORITE BATTLE(S): In the most memorable scene of the movie, Benjamin takes his two youngest sons - one may have still been carrying a pacifier - into the woods to hunt some Brits who had previously imprisoned Gabrielle and displayed their poor dental hygiene.  After setting up a rudimentary ambush and supplying the kids with a few words of wisdom, Benjamin almost single-handedly destroys a platoon of red-coats with a couple of muskets, a knife, an Indian axe, and the rage of a father who just saw his son get the business end of a musket.  Benjamin Martin really was some sort of combination of a ghost, a ninja, and great Indian MME warrior in this one.<br /><br />FAVORITE LINE:  Aim small, miss small.<br /><br />THE MESSAGE:  Taxes suck, without representation they suck worse, and there was no way England could control the willpower of America's people.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>The cinematography is the high point in this emotional movie, with lots of pretty shots outside and inside. It's just stunning at times, and on this Blu-Ray release "incredible" is probably the best description of the transfer.  It's just amazing.  Kudos to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel for a job well done. It's also a terrific audio movie with a lot of surround sound that's impressive, especially when the cannons are shot.<br /><br />As for the story, this is All-American flag-waving which nauseates some but makes most the U.S. citizens happy. This is "Braveheart" all over again, except instead of Middle Ages Scotland and England, it's the United States and the American Revolution. Mel Gibson plays a similarly-heroic person he played in Braveheart but he's still fighting the British, time time as an American patriot "Benjamin Martin.".<br /><br />Even though it's considered an "epic," At 174 minutes it is a tad long, but I don't remember ever being bored.  Women beware: this gets a little bloody in parts. It's not as gory as Braveheart, but there is still a good deal of violence.<br />In all, a powerful story magnificently filmed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson plays the role of an early American colonist, Benjamin Martin. He is a reluctant hero, a man who does not take sides in the Revolutionary War until forced to do so. When one of his young sons is killed during a gratuitous display of brutality by a British officer, and another is taken away to be hanged, Martin is at a crossroad in his life. This galvanizes Martin, our reluctant hero, into action, and he rescues his otherwise doomed son with a ferocity of purpose that is gripping.<br /><br />Once committed, Martin becomes a leader of the local militia and the scourge of the British. There is a droll scene in which he and Cornwallis, the leader of the British campaign, meet, and Martin manages to get the better of him. It is here, however, that the British officer who killed Martin's son locks horns with Martin, and the lines are drawn. This sets the tenor for what is to come.<br /><br />There are scenes of great barbarity and pathos, which tell one that war is not just about heroism and great battles, but about personal pain and loss. It is about a desire for freedom and the privilege of living in peace without the yoke of tyranny around one's neck. Despite the odds, Martin cuts a wide swath of destruction among the British, and his prowess and leadership on the battlefield ultimately lead to a turning point in the American Revolution.<br /><br />This movie shows the effect that the war had on civilians and how their lives were affected by it. The film is about love, family, honor, dishonor, tragedy, and redemption. Deftly directed by Roland Emmerich, this is a well-acted film with stirring action scenes. Mel Gibson is perfectly cast as a colonist whose life is turned upside down by the vagaries of war. The supporting cast is, likewise, excellent. This is simply a film that should not be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>Though I sat and enjoyed this film, I can't rate it as high as a 4 or 5 because it is a good film, but not great.  I own a ton of good films, this one included, and I recognize that while I may enjoy them, they are not always great films.  A all star cast headlines this film of the American Revolution.  Disreguarding the fact that the hero of the film is an Australian, Mel Gibson give a decent performance.  Not quite as passionate as Braveheart, but he is solid throughout.  The role of Colonel Tavington is fantastic.  A real bad, bad guy, played very well.  The movie is filled with beautiful shots that make you feel as if you are in 1776 South Carolina.  The story starts off a little slow, but once one of his sons get murdered, Mel gets things going nicely.  While it follows the basic history of the revolution, it takes a number of liberties with various facts.  But this is not a documentary, it is just a good popcorn movie you can enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>'The Patriot' is fantastic, a truly great film. Heart-wreching and moving, but still packed with action, this movie is sure to keep all audiences entertained! Great acting by Mel Gibson and the young Heath Ledger. Mel is really an amazing actor. He can go from being a war hero in 'The Patriot' to be an egotistical jerk in the comedy 'What Women Want'! Heath Ledger was great, he fit his role perfectly. The sets, costumes, and historical information is excellent. The dialogue and script is smart, emotional, and suspenseful. One of the best movies of the year, excellent...</p></br><a href="../users/A34XPZS5DXA6HA.html">A34XPZS5DXA6HA</a><br/><p>In this film Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin who is a colonist who re-discovers his love for his country through his love for his children. This is a wonderful story of a parent's love, a man's strength, as well as what he feels is his loyalty and duty.<p>The costumes are perfect and guide the veiwer to another time and place. The cast is masterful at what they do, and the writers have truly made a movie that has brought the story full circle as well as developed a plot making the audience think about the true value of family, and patriotism, and how the two work together. Let us not forget the villans who are vital to any good movie.  This movie comes complete and hasn't left them out.  They are believable and you truly will hate them as much as you love the good guys. A warning for all of you soft of heart like myself, be prepared to cry. There are a few scenes that will break your heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson of course is at his best in this film.  His love of children is very evident.  While by no means an accurate depiction of historical events, this film does give you the feel and look of the war.  One of the most impressive scenes in the movie for me was very early in the movie, when Mel Gibson walks out on the porch and the war is right there, live and in action in your back yard.  Despite what the critics might say, the film does an excellent job in showing that the Revolutionary War was in everybody's back yard.  All of the actors did an excellent job to include Jason Isaac's, playing Colonel Tavington.  He rather seemed to be enjoying himself in the role.  Overall, an excellent movie and well worth the money for the DVD and time spent to watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Haven't I seen this somewhere before?<br />Oh I remember it was called Braveheart!!!<p>Some very good action sequences and good computer graphics make up for a lot.  <p>It gets bogged down in a sense of modern day morality that I feel is just not nessicary.  <p>Slavery was a terrible thing however there are certain things that just didn't cut it.  <p>A.  Out of all the planters on the Santee Mel is the only owner that has freed slaves <p>B.  By the end of the film Ben's kids are their own cousins <p>C.  The battle of Cowpens was a minor affair and nowhere near as grand as it was protrayed if they were going to try to reinact a battle it should have been the Battle of Kings Moutain.  <p>Now let me say that it isn't a wast of time if you just want to have fun, but it isn't history.  I beg you to remember that this movie is not history when you are watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>This movie is a must-see for anyone who enjoys war flicks, or who has an interest in the American Revolution.  It is not a perfect movie, but its strong points overwhelm the relatively few week ones.  Mel Gibson does his customary stellar job, and the acting overall is pretty good, and the story is very good indeed.  An unabashedly pro-American movie, but then again what's wrong with that?  It is still legal to make the odd movie that happens to celebrate American patriotism.<br />The thing I liked best about the movie is that it really did convey a sense of what it might have been like to live in American revolutionary times.  It was a long war and a hard war, and ideals had to have been what kept the outgunned and outmanned patriots going.  The Brits are portrayed as the bad guys, but not, except for one villain, as bad guys.  I get a kick out of recommending this movie to my British friends.<br />The story keeps going, there is a beginning, a middle, and an exciting ending.  That's more than can be said of most movies nowadays.  A keeper and a must for any DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I have been trying to find out where the 11 minutes of extra footage comes in.  It could be just one additional scene, or a few seconds added here or there.  Either way, this really didn't seem like the movie that was crying out for a extended addition.  We have already had the original release, then the superbit, and now this one.  I guess next it may be the superbit extended version, then the HD/Blue Ray version.  I hate when the studios double and triple dip.  I would rent this one first to see if the extra 11 minutes are worth another purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>The patriot basically is a knock-off of &quot;Braveheart&quot; in buckskin vests and powdered wigs, but that doesn't seem to bother Mel Gibson, who won an Oscar for directing that film and stars in this one as another tread-upon colonial who takes up arms against England for his nation's freedom. <p>A hero of the French and Indian War who has since pledged to raise his children as a pacifist plantation farmer in South Carolina.  He takes up arms against the British after one of his sons is killed in cold blood.<p>Much like Braveheart, Gibson becomes a one-man army, leading a band of colonialist against the Red Coats.<p>Still, for all its adherence to formula, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is certainly handsome and effectively rousing in small ways, like the scenes in which Martin smelts his dead son's toy soldiers into musket balls, or when he rallies farmers and villagers to arms, resulting in a motley militia of &quot;colorful&quot; roughnecks from central casting. <p>Not a bad movie, but as with Braveheart, not high in historical accuracy and he Gibson isn't surrounded by nearly the stellar cast of that movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>The Extended Cut of this war picture starring Mel "Martin Riggs" Gibson and a pre-Joker Heath Ledger has 10 minutes of scenes previously deleted from the film re-inserted into the movie. I can't remember any of the differences between the theatrical edition (available as the Special Edition DVD) and this cut of the film, save for one shot that clears up a continuity error. The performances from everyone are top-notch, especially Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Lisa Brenner, Jason Isaacs and Tom Wilkinson. Great movie. Unrated, but contains graphic violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QJ649N8PRV.html">A16QJ649N8PRV</a><br/><p>'The Patriot' is a superb war story about the American Revolutionary War.<br /><br />It features superb acting by Mel Gibson (as Col. Benjamin Martin), Heath Ledger (Gabriel Martin) and Jason Isaacs as British Col. William Tavington.  The supporting cast does a great job as well.<br /><br />This one is set in South Carolina in 1776-1781.  Martin is a widowed farmer who is just trying to raise his children while the patriots of the area are preparing for war.  He wants no part of it but is forced into it by by the brutal killing of his young son and other atrocities by Tavington.  The Tavington character seems to be based on General Banastre Tarleton well known for his atrocities.  Lest readers worry that the film is falsely portraying the Brits, that is not the case.  Most of them are portrayed as noble warriors, but Tavington (Tarleton) deserves his place in infamy.<br /><br />Also, this is not as documentary.  It is a work of fiction that is very well done.<br /><br />This is highly recommended for anyone who loves a great war movie, particularly one about the Revolutionary War which is seldom depicted in the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>This film coming a few years later after "Braveheart" was one of the first films in which I saw the late Heath Ledger--and he was impressive to say the least. Mel Gibson plays a farmer who is an ex-guerilla fighter who is reluctant to take up arms against the British until a tragedy occurs in his family that forces him to take a stand.  Critics of this film have liken this to a Mad Max film but his re-transformation back into the warrior mode is plausible. Of course, there are some dramatic licenses taken here since Gibson's character is a composite of many of the types of American heroes like Francis Marion aka "The Swamp Fox" and also depicted in Disney film years ago by I believe, Leslie Nielsen before he descended or risen into his famous comedy mode (The Naked Gun). The Blu-ray transfer of this extended version is excellent and a special mention should be made of the excellent acting of Jason Issacs as the villainous British officier who forces Gibson's hand in a pivotal moment. Also Tom Wilkinson as Cornwallis, Chris Cooper as a Federalist and Tcheky Karyo as a French compatriot are excellent too.

So be it. At any rate, while not exactly an historically accurate film, not much more than OK as a movie experience, still The Patriot is a reminder of just what we had to do to create a nation for ourselves. When all is said and done, it was not Washington's way with words, oratory, that won the war, it was men being killed and shockingly wounded, for seven years, that did it.<br />The film is best in its action scenes, OK on delineating the home front. Gibson does a satisfactory job and the rest of the cast does what they are allowed to do.<br />And, yes, the accepted military technique in an era when rifles needed some time to reload, was to achieve greatest impact from massed weapons and cannon facing the enemy on the field. Real tough on a man who had to stand up  as a beautiful target to do his job. The film would have been improved by prudent reduction in length,  but, I suppose, it was intended to be EPIC.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Horrible film on the American Revolution starring Mel Gibson.

In addition to the formulaic cameo shots pointlessly and continuously revolving around Mel; the film is further debased by a pathetic script and horribly gross historical inaccuracies. The story line is generic and can be found in an introductory film class textbook. Mel Gibson's rigid performance kills the film beyond redemption. Shun this film like the plague!

It is not that he is afraid but that he has seen his fill of war and killing in the French and Indian War.  His son Gabriel Joins the Continental army and becomes a message courier.<br /><br />As the war progresses it finally comes to South Carolina and near to the home of Benjamin and his seven children.  As the family tends to injured soldiers from both sides a British Colonel has the wounded Americans shot and arrests the wounded Gabriel as a spy.  One of Gabriel's younger brothers tries to help his brother and he is shot and killed by the Colonel.<br /><br />Enraged with anger and the desire for revenge, Benjamin takes two of his sons and muskets to try to surprise attack the British and free Gabriel.  Trained in fighting the Indians, Benjamin viciously kills the British soldiers with guns, a tomahawk and a knife as he was trained to do.  He is a master in armed combat and they free his son.  The battle is very graphic.  Benjamin's sons are astonished how their mild mannered father becomes a terror on the battlefield. Twenty British soldiers are dead.<br /><br />One British soldier escapes and he tells the British Colonel that they were attacked by a single man who in the words of the Colonel moves like a ghost.  Faced with no choice now, Benjamin must join the army as he is a marked man for his actions.....<br /><br />This is a very good movie and every time I watch it I enjoy it.

Overall, great attention has been paid to historical detail, such as Heath Ledger's character being sewn up in a 'coccoon' - this was done back then when a young man stayed at someone else's house to make sure he didn't do hanky-panky with the young women in the house - I laughed at this and thought it was great, it showed that research had been done. The story itself is riveting with quite a few emotional scenes and some sadness, so be ready to have your heartstrings tugged at. The camerawork and action scenes are also nicely executed, so two thumbs up!</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>First off I will have to admit, I liked this movie.  But it was a mixed bag of good and bad.  It did come out as a lot of people pointed out, like braveheart, but not nearly as good.<p>here are some of the good.<p>The action sequences and cinematography are amazing.  This director really knew how to set up the battle sequences so that they are both picturesque, and frightening at the same time.  This was rated as one of the middle period Napoleonic wars, and the fighting style is much different than what we are used to.  You dressed in bright uniforms and marched to your death.  Cavalry charges were still used to a great degree of effectiveness, and they used them with deadly efficiency.  The cannons were primarily large bullets that they would angle specifically so that they would bounce or skip and hit as many soldiers as they could, similar to a bowling ball.<p>There were some funny moments with Mel Gibson and his children.<p>A few twists and turns were in the plot, where it was following a cliche movie device up until the very end, where they turn it around at the conclusion.<p>Some of the dialogue is interesting and the character motivations were not all standard.  Mel Gibsons characters initial refusal to enter the war, his speech to the continental congress, etc....<p>Like Braveheart it had many historical ideas that were true in a sense, but didn't happen in the same way.  There was a military leader in the british army that practiced a slash and burn operation similar to sherman in the civil war.  As well as other decisions by the British that angered many colonials causing them to join the war when the originally stayed neutral.  Cornwallis was a noted field commander and a favorite of the king.<p>Now for the bad.<p>Some of the cliches were almost laughably bad.  <p>The antagonists, though well acted and interesting, were over the top in some key areas.  Cornwallis was not flawless in his exploits, and he was a patriot but actually opposed harsh treatment of Americans before the war, including the infamous &quot;stamp tax&quot;.  Though some leaders in the millitary did a slash and burn campaign, I don't recall any mention of people being burned alive.<p>The method they had for victory in the end was a bit simplistic.  The main selling point was it was the defeat of a giant in the war for independence.  Though the British army in question was a giant in that time, it seemed like too cliche and easy of a ruse, relying on the arrogance of a oppsing general.<p>The ambush sequence where Mel Gibson and his sons killed a large number of soldiers was a bit far fetched.  Though troops at that time were terrible at defending against ambush, they weren't necessarily stupid, and could have mounted a better defense.<p>The murder of his son in the earlier part of the movie was over the top in its attempt to show how wicked the leader of the Dragoons was.  When he ordered the wounded killed, that would have been sufficient, him shooting a boy even out of necessity was a step short of him wearing a black top hat and twisting his mustache.<p>All in all I give this 3 stars as a standalone movie.  It will entertain most and just about everybody will find something they like in it.  But the lack of consistency, overuse of cliches, and mixed quality writing will bother most people.<p>As an action film alone, it gets four stars, but for an overall film, 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>As a history buff, I appreciate the attention to detail employed by the filmmaker---but by the same token, that is what's frustrating about this high gloss, Hollywood melodrama would-be epic.  You might enjoy it more, oddly enough, if you watch the Commentary track FIRST...perhaps then you will be swept up in the filmmakers' enthusiasm for their project.<br /><br />Why did the screenwriter feel he needed to fictionalize everyone but Cornwallis!?  Like TITANIC, there are plenty of fasconating REAL characters of import.  This is like RAMBO VISITS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.  Any second I thought Nellie Oleson would ride into the scene.  Mel Gibson acts all over the place, seeming to be looking for that Oscar.  Jason Isaacs does everything but twirls a handlebar moustache as the villain.  Only Chris Cooper and Tom Wilkinson manage to turn in performance that strike realistic chords, rising above cliche.  John Williams seems to have scored this one in between appointments...very generic, unremarkable melodies.  The cinematography and special effects, however, are top notch....although every time the action drfited into Slow Motion, I kept thinking how LONG it already was at 2:40:00.  In fact, the story itself doesn't pick up until close to the second hour.<br /><br />More about vengeance and less about patriotism.  Still, if the genre appeals to you it will bring you viewing pleasure.  Personally, I'd prefer a good documentary on the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />Pet peeve: the subtitles do not accurately match the dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>This film has so much sap in it I could pour it over my hotcakes. Mel Gibson was ridiculous in this.</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>This picture has more in common with DIE HARD than genuine American history.  To be sure, there are moments when something approaching genuine history shines through, despite the writer's best efforts to the contrary.  But by and large THE PATRIOT leaves us unmolested by fact.  It's almost an outrage that the writer should've chosen to create as his hero an amalgamation of several real figures, instead of just choosing one.  Apart from being more interesting than the lackluster Mr. Martin, someone like Francis Marion would have grounded the writer in fact.  <p>As it is, THE PATRIOT wallows in its own excess.  You know the drill: improbable escapes from point-blank shooting, clever repartee with bloodthirsty enemies, a man of peace called back for one last mission of revenge.  It's so hackneyed, the script could've been phoned in.<p>Unfortunately, this film looks great.  The producers try, and largely succeed, to imbue the picture with an authentic historic look.  The costumer, cinematographer and special effects guys, in particular, deserve Oscars ? for their efforts.  The problem is they've created a piece of total fabrication that some kids are no doubt going to grow up thinking is true.  And it's not.  It just LOOKS fabulously real.  <p>To be fair, THE PATRIOT gives a general sense of truth.  It did happen that the South Carolina militia was vital to the success of the Continentals in the Revolutionary War.  Cornwallis was indeed the fashion plate and gentleman of society that is portrayed here.  And there was reluctance on the part of a lot of the American aristocracy to enter the war.  <p>But where other historical fiction manages to successfully create fictional heroes and put them in historically accurate settings, THE PATRIOT simply misses the mark.  Apart from being bad history, it's just bad drama.  Both villain and hero are more caricature than character.  Worse, the resolution of the personal conflict between them is hopelessly contrived. <p>Having said all this, it's not that you won't have a good time with this movie.  It's a watchable film.  You might even come out with a visual understanding of why the French were strategically important to the final battle of the war, or what it felt like to be in Revolutionary combat.  You'll definitely exit with a sense of the importance of the Carolinian part of the war.  But I guarantee you that when the credits run,  you'll immediately say that the film could've been much, much better.  <p>[DVD NOTES:  Frankly, you learn more about the history of the times watching the extra features than watching the movie itself.  The "True Patriots" vignette is particularly rewarding, as it gives a sense of the efforts taken by everyone but the writer to imbue the movie with a sense of authenticity.  The director/producer commentary is worth hearing, but I found it hard to listen to at times.  I found Director Roland Emmerich's accent very off-putting, as he peppers his speech with an unbelievable number of "you know"s and "kind of"s and "like"s.  Seriously, for every five words he says, only one conveys actual meaning.  It's like listening to Hans and Franz, from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE . . . for two hours.  Plus most of what he talks about, curiously, is history, not filmmaking.  It's producer Dean Devlin who gives the most insight into the actual filmmaking process.  It's still worth listening to, of course, but it doesn't rank among the best commentaries ever included on a DVD.]</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Once again, people crave for authenticity...the way it really happened....and once again, I say, &quot;It's a movie.  It's entertaining and moving....I didn't take my history book along to make sure it was totally accurate.  I like escapism, and movies that move me.&quot;  This movie did that.  It's beautifully filmed by the respected Caleb Deschanel; the music by John Williams is moving, and the cast on a whole is exceptional.  Mel Gibson has been labeled an okay actor, but if you look deep inside his performances, the man does his best in filling whatever shoes his role dictates.  As the family-oriented and somewhat stubborn father, he evokes the pain he feels from his actions in an earlier battle with the French; he seems devastated by his youngest daughter's silence to him; and he loves his family.  Joely Richardson is effectively cast as Mel's sister in law, who helps take care of his family during this crisis.  Heath Ledger is all gungho and spirited as Gabriel, and plays well with the rest of his cast.  Tom Wilkinson is superb as Cornwallis, a man steeped in tradition and British fanfare.  His scene with Gibson in which the patriot negotiates for the release of his 18 prisoners is exceptional.  Jason Isaacs is pure evil in his role as the heartless Haverton (or whatever), and shows that war to him is merely licensed murder.  The rest of the supporting cast:  Chris Cooper, Rene Auberjonois, Adam Baldwin, Gregory Smith, Mira Boorkem, and Donal Logue, in particular, are great additions.<br />The movie is a manipulative film, of course...how else would it work, but it's to director Roland Emmerich's credit, that when the credits were over, I felt moved and touched.  That's what films are meant to be in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've had The Patriot (not the Steven Segal movie) for absolutely ages. I admit, it was cheap, and I do have phases where I have a bit of a thing of Mel Gibson. But I have to be in the right mood for him.<br /><br />I don't know much about American History. I don't know much about my own Scottish history actually, never mind anything else. But I liked Braveheart, so I figured this was cheap, sounded kinda similar, why the hell not? I'd bought it a few months before Heath Ledger died, and only managed to get round to watching this a couple of months later.<br /><br />Basically, this is one of those movies where everyone who knows their American history will quibble the slightest inaccuracy - and this kinda film is normally riddled with them. But I'm going to skip over all that. I left school for a reason.<br /><br />The Patriot, is about a man with seven children and no wife/mother. No, you're not getting another Von Trapp family. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) The script originally called for six children, but since Mel has seven in real life, it was changed. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) He has particpated previously in battles, and is now a proud family man, trying to keep his children out of danger. But his eldest son, played by a blonde Heath, is determined to serve his country, and goes out fighting.<br /><br />Meanwhile things get hectic back home, with an evil Colonel (Jason Isaacs) hellbent on wrecking quiet family life, until he encounters the Ghost. Can you guess who it is?<br /><br />There's not much else to report on The Patriot, without repeating 800+ reviewers have already said. It's there to be watched, but at 2hrs 48mins long, you need to find a long night free, with no interruptions. (Easter Sunday strangely enough did it for me.) Mel doesn't really get stretched playing the role of Benjamin Martin, and there are a couple of similarities, particularly in scenes, to Braveheart. (Did you see the scene where he was riding in front of the army? Did you not want to shout at the TV "FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"? Or was that just me?)<br /><br />It was one of those films that yes was good, but could have been edited slightly better towards the end. The rest of the running time passed by like a breeze, but you do tend to find the last 30-45 minutes do start to drag. Otherwise, not really an appropriate movie to watch on Easter Sunday, but hey, I had to watch it sometime!</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>I think this movie was the victim of great expectations, coming on the heels of Braveheart, which audiences and critics alike hailed as a masterpiece. This Revolutionary War saga is amazingly similar to Braveheart, in that a peace loving but fiercely able Gibson is forced from a pastoral life by malevolent political forces. The movie is not without highlights, notably Gibson and his two young sons taking on a handful of British soldiers, but the payoffs are ho-hum. It's not that the movie is bad, just that it's predictably exactly what a solidly-done Hollywood period piece about the Revolutionary War would look like.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>Patriot proves to be a highly entertaining film but its not history, real or pretend. It sheer fantasy per Hollywood, especially when you got 20th century military warfare values inserted into 18th Century. Its sad that British soldiers are treated like Nazis in this movie and there seem to be no sense of time or period to this movie. Its make it up as you go on. I found it quite entertaining listening to the director talk on my DVD as he mentioned so often how "historically accurate" he tried to be in all aspects. In this case, he probably got some of the names right and at least knew that the British infantry wore red and American infantry mostly wore blue. Who ever were the historical consultants on this movie must either come from Iran or were bribed to put their stamp of approval on it.<p>On the other hand, Mel Gibson movies are rarely boring and he was pretty good in this movie. He sure sugarcoated everything about the slavery issue but overall, there were enough blood, guts, humor and action to satisfied most viewers. I got the Superbit DVD version which was also excellent in all aspect but don't have the extra of the regular DVD which I also end up owning. As long as you don't learned your history form watching this movie, its strictly cartoon movie for fun and joy. Of course, some scenes were bit graphic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z7TU96G2WB9B.html">A2Z7TU96G2WB9B</a><br/><p>If a major star hits box office gold, studios usually try to find a formula to guarantee themselves another hit.  That being said, this Mel Gibson film of the American Revolution feels a lot like "Braveheart."  Here, as there, the reluctant hero joins the war to fight back a brutal military and oppressive government.  Leading a band of fighters thought to be of no consequence, the hero accomplishes the improbable.<p>This movie has quite a bit of gore.  Since this does concern a war, it is to be accepted, and the movie does not romanticize the violence.  Be prepared to see wounds caused by guns and cannon.<p>Unlike some formula films, this is an engaging movie.  I don't think you would be wasting your  time watching this.  There are bits of romance and humor to keep the film from being too dark.  I would recommend watching this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>&quot;The Patriot&quot; has stunning battle sequences that show war in its full horrific reality, but displays a stunning lack of historical accuracy and moral courage. This is a film that shows people giving their lives by the thousands for freedom, but at its end, cozies up to the idea that some Americans (read: slaves) weren't all that unhappy not to be free.<p>It's this hypocritical glossing over of historical fact that ultimately sinks &quot;The Patriot&quot;, and that's a shame, because the film has many strengths, including its depiction of the brutality of combat, marvelous period feel and set design, and a very strong performance by Mel Gibson.<p>If you've forgotten why war is a nightmare that must be avoided at all costs - all to easy to do in today's world, where war looks like Nintendo - consider &quot;The Patriot&quot; your wake up call. <p>The Revolutionary War wasn't fought with smart bombs, Stealth fighters and TV footage...it was fought with vast armies of men that showed up together on a battlefield and proceeded to brutally kill each other with cannons, rifles, bayonets, knives, rocks, or anything else. More than any other film in history, &quot;The Patriot&quot; shows this old-style warfare in its utter brutality and scale. It's remarkable.<p>Unfortunately for &quot;The Patriot&quot;, the accuracy of its battle scenes doesn't make up for its utter ignorance of history or glossing over the greatest human rights issue in our nation's history.  <p>Gibson stars as Benjamin Martin, a widower and veteran of the French and Indian Wars. As revolutionary talk spreads, Martin would rather stay home and tend his plantation (yep, it comes complete with all-too-helpful and all-too-happy slaves). But Martin is drawn into the conflict when British officer Tavington decides to go on a Nazi-style mission of destruction against Martin, killing one of his kids, imprisoning another for the heck of it, and burning his house down. And wouldn't you just know it...Martin ends up being a one-man army of destruction against the Brits.<p>Anyone who has even opened up a history book about the revolution knows that even in their worst moments, the Brits NEVER even approached the consistent level of indiscriminate, Nazi-style brutality portrayed in &quot;The Patriot&quot;. Unfortunately, that's the impression that this movie gives, and in an age where kids can't remember when the Civil War was fought, such blatant historical inaccuracy is downright irresponsible.<p>Then there's the depiction of slavery, which is utterly ridiculous and borderline insulting. First off, I have very little sympathy for someone who fights for freedom but owns slaves, and Martin is a slaveowner. For this viewer, that fact drained the Martin character of every bit of nobility, despite Gibson's excellent performance.<p>One of Martin's slaves joins the revolution because George Washington has promised freedom for any slave who fights. So what's the first thing this newly-freed slave wants to do after the war's over? He wants to rebuild Martin's house. <p>Huh? This guy is free and the first thing he wants to do is hang out with 'Massuh' and rebuild his house? Man, how much did they have to pay a black actor to buy into this racist apologist drivel?<p>That's what I found most disturbing about this film: after showing us brutal battle after brutal battle, all fought in the name of freedom, &quot;The Patriot&quot; glosses over the fact that after the battles were done, millions of Americans weren't free at all.<p>Talk about an opportunity lost...wouldn't it have been better to confront Martin with his hypocrisy after sacrificing so much in the name of freedom? Why couldn't he realize that when some Americans weren't free, NO Americans were really free? Now that would have been a ending with teeth...as it is, we get feel-good namby pamby.<p>So there you have it, folks: &quot;The Patriot&quot; is a historical drama that honors history in its depiction of violence but ignores it in its depiction of the British, and glosses over the reality that freedom wasn't really freedom for many Americans.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>As you must know Ronald Emmerich is the same director of Independence Day, and in this film he insisted again in a pretended patriot approach, when looking the dramatis personae through clean glasses and provided of serene objectivity, the movie is just a personal vengeance between a colon, and beloved father of seven sons and his hated, implacable and merciless British Officer played superbly by Jason Isaac, under the orders of Tom Wilkinson. Mel Gibson, appeals to his emotive memories enriching his character with proportional doses of Mad Max, Lethal weapon and Braveheart.  The photography is extremely mesmerizing and its better merit, but even the brutal sequences of the wounds of the mortal cannons and a touching performance of Chris Cooper may dignify in its most legitimate splendor what it could have been a revitalization of the courage and honor and not becoming an overlong melodrama with unjustified and almost imperceptible mistakes as that sequence when the Troops arrive to town briefly after the sinister church's massacre. Have you ever been near a multitude of burn corpses and its and perceptible smell miles away?. The Troops come and no there 's no one capable to perceive it.  Very strange don't you? Perhaps, were they strongly affected for a flue, and unable to distinguish it?  That 's what it could be and all of us, the viewers ignored it.<br /><br />Maybe with another script and another director the results would have been more eloquent!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>This is a movie to watch especially around the 4th of July.  Gibson does an admirable job of being a father beset by the loss of his son and having to decide between loyalty to a country he fought for and the land he lives in.<p>There is some gore in the movie.  However, like braveheart, you may get a sense of reality and being in a battle that is around you.<p>This is a movie where a father cares for his family, alone, yet he has an extended family and his fellow countrymen and women who he can rely on.  <p>You get feeling in the movie that it is okay to fight oppression and greed and there is a time to make a stand for what is a good and proper cause.  <p>One interesting thing about this movie, not many movies have been made about the Revolutionary war and never have I seen one from the perspective of the South.  Most of our history has been oriented toward Washington, the Delaware and Philadelphia.  <p>This movie give a view that the war was much larger in scope and had a myriad of events and situations, battles, outcomes and even murder.  This is a movie of the triumph of the human will to be free.</p></br><a href="../users/A4CHIXX0HOB3G.html">A4CHIXX0HOB3G</a><br/><p>THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Mel Gibson has always been a very powerful actor when he plays a father or a hero. In these types of movies, his characters always have just cause for revenge and extensive displays of either muted or expressed emotion. &quot;Braveheart&quot; allowed him to indulge in his leadership qualities, while playing a very emotional role. &quot;Ransom&quot; allows him to play the part of a caring and loving husband and father, which he does extremely well. &quot;The Patriot,&quot; his latest movie, is yet another chance for him to show these character traits in fine form, matching his performance in &quot;Braveheart.&quot; Gibson gives us an emotionally charged performance as the main character, proving his worth in Hollywood. <p>And the movie itself isn't that bad, either. I have found that many historians and buffs have criticized the movie for its lack of authenticity, but if you don't have a clear knowledge of the events of the time period, or you can set aside your need for the true facts, then the movie works on the basis of its emotional and surprising plot. It's one of those feel-good movies where you know what is going to happen, and then the ending is completely different. It can be a bit trying at times, due to its length, and will test the patience of many viewers, but the material is solid and ends up pleasing us. <p>Taking place during the Revolutionary War, the story begins in a day in the life of Benjamin Martin, who lives peacefully in his South Carolina home with his five sons and two daughters. As the battle between the statesman and the British becomes heated, Martin's son, Gabriel, takes up arms, despite his father's opposition to the war. Gibson, along with Heath Ledger, have a unique father/son chemistry onscreen that is believable and emotional, hitting home for those interested in this aspect of the plot. Their bond strengthens once Gabriel returns, soon followed by a brigade of British soldiers. Their home is burned, Gabriel is taken away, but not before his brother is killed in trying to save him. <p>The movie takes on a bit of the &quot;Braveheart&quot; incentive for Gibson's character here, as Martin's son's death sparks him into action, leading him to victory over the soldiers holding Gabriel hostage. He and Gabriel soon begin forming a group of rebels in a Militia against the British soldiers, as the cunning and ruthless Colonel William Tavington closes in on &quot;The Ghost&quot; responsible for the dent in the King's Army. Martin and his men ride to many victories, keeping their honor and their dignity, but soon, Martin realizes that he will have to face the armies of the British head on in order to protect his family, now under the care of their Aunt Charlotte. <p>The movie has the overall look and feel of a big, booming epic, and while it's not up to scale such as past films like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Titanic,&quot; it still is good, rousing entertainment for mass audiences. It has many elements which will appeal to many different demographics, one of which is two separate romances that build within the movie's plot. One involves Gabriel, who falls in love with and marries a girl from a small town. Their relationship also provides some comical relief, mostly in the parents, who react just like today's parents would if their daughter were in love (though I don't think too many people sew their daughter's boyfriends into straight-jackets). The other romance involves Benjamin and Charlotte, his deceased wife's sister. The relationship between these two characters may be taken as controversial to some; I mean, come on, what are the kids supposed to think? She's their aunt, but the movie never dives too heavily into this relationship, so we're never given enough time to really think about it. <p>Another contributor to the movie's epic feel is the grand photography and cinematography, headed by photographer Caleb Deschanel, who brings lots of beauty and slow motion to the movie to bring us into the action as well as surrounding us with the unseen beauty of nature. By unseen, I mean that those involved in the battle never lament over nature's beauty, and it seems to close in on them at times, surrounding them with noises of crickets in the night, or green leaves of brush and trees. Lighting plays a key factor in certain scenes, most notably during the raid on Charlotte's house, adding a sense of heightened suspense to the moment. Slow motion strengthens the display of the horrors of war, which are vastly displayed in graphic shots, giving us all the brutality of the Revolutionary War. <p>The story, while relying on some formulaic elements, also keeps the movie's epic appearance up, following the trials and tribulations of a man whose life is in danger every minute of the movie's most intense moments. Martin's story, while being fictional, is quite moving, powerful and emotional. Benjamin has his values, which makes him an admirable character, and his children are embodied with those values, which makes the bond between father and family very strengthened and moving. <p>The historical aspect of the movie is going to be a factor of controversy among everyone who sees this movie that knows what really went on during the Revolutionary War. People will say that the historical aspect is authentic and makes sense to the movie, while others will say it is a cheap attempt to bring the war to life with a fictional story for its premise. I, myself, do not know off the top my head anything about the Revolutionary War, and that is why I enjoyed this movie as I did because I don't have to worry about criticizing it for its accuracy or inaccuracy. For me, everything else in this movie works, so I was able to find it satisfying. <p>Just as Gibson gives his powerhouse performance, the rest of the cast also gives us stellar performances that add heart and feel to the movie. Heath Ledger, who starred in &quot;10 Things I Hate About You,&quot; takes on a very adult role in this movie, and does so with ease. He never flinches, and his performance never falls short. Jason Isaacs plays Colonel William Tavington, who is pompous, arrogant and ruthless in his war tactics. He brings all of this and more to the role. Joely Richardson is Charlotte, strong and gentle, who cares for Benjamin's children and with whom she shares a strong chemistry, even if briefly. Other actors include Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Rene Auberjonois and Tom Wilkinson. <p>While not the best epic ever made, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is by no means a failure, and its integrity, emotion, strength and intelligence all make it worthwhile in watching. The overall effect one feels after watching this movie is one of satisfaction, and that is more than most movies can account for. It dazzles the senses while keeping us intrigued by the story of one man's struggle to free his family from oppression.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>The Patriot<p>Score: 49/100<p>What exactly we're we expecting from The Patriot? It's from the director of Godzilla and stars Mel Gibson. A little bit of a mix, there. It actually turns out that this is a far below average movie, that fails with every turn, and The Patriot's basic moral is that Hollywood is completely finished with making good war-hero films.<p>Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a South Carolina planter who is still haunted by his notoriously brutal past as a soldier in the French and Indian War. When the American Revolution comes, he chooses not to fight for the Continental Army because he wants to protect his family. But when the British Colonel Tavington (Jason Isaacs) threatens their welfare and kills one of his sons, he chooses to enlist. Martin becomes the leader of a makeshift militia, which consists of peasants, slaves, a minister, and assorted other irregulars. During the war Martin and his men discover that they will pay a steep personal price for their rebellion. But thanks to their courage and bravery, they are also destined to pay a pivotal role in turning the tide against the Redcoats.<p>The Patriot is an over-long, boring and pointless picture that delivers only in a couple of scenes. The cinematography is quite stunning, but some some un-purposely over-blown performances (especially from Jason Isaacs), messy direction and a premise that could've been written better by monkies don't help The Patriot be the Oscar-worthy film it might've been if the script and direction had been taken into different hands. <p>Disappointing and rarely interesting, The Patriot is a film that makes me proud not to be an American war hero like the characters in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Having read other reviews here, I am curious as to why people think this is unreal?, it is one of the most realistic & authentic movies about the Revolution, our history books only tell so much about this particular time, just because you didn't read certain aspects of this movie in history class, doesn't mean that some of it didn't happen, Set in 1776 in South Carolina during a time in which the British attempted to take over the eastern seaboard with their war against the settlers & I guess you could say decendents or deserters, the film clearly depicts a time in which the freedoms of this country was founded upon, Mel Gibson is Benjamin, a man who has seen war up close & personal in the french & indian war, & knows first hand its horrors, here he has settled for a normal quiet life with his seven children after his wife has died, in town, a meeting is being held in which British occupying forces will soon be upon them, Benjamin totally opposes the inpending war, that is until British forces invade his home & attack his family led by Captain Tavigton, played by Jason Isaacs(Armageddon) who is ruthless & brutal in his pursuit for victory,& a villian you just love to hate & can't wait for him to get his, Benjamin finally takes matters into his own hands & avengingly kills as many British troops as he can, he finally decides to take up arms against the British & leads a militia against the British, like Kevin Costner's "Dances with Wolves" this film really shows the beauty of as many landscapes as it can, & the strengh of men & the quest for the meaning of life & all we hold dear, Gibson gives one of the best performances of his career as a man with personal loss & patriotism, the viewer feels his anguish & his unrelenting behavoir to preserve the freedoms we have today, & that we take for granted, without those like him in this time, we might have all been British today, it was the ordinary men who fought alongside the Colonials that won our Democracy that we have today, & this film really makes that point clear, even if the history books don't, watching it, you realize that human behavoir hasn't changed much in 200 years, but is a winner & depicts the Revolutionary War in a positive light with a lot of accuracy, even if history don't, & one of Gibson's best movies!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>This movie is a great one, and you will like it even more if you are interested in the historic time period in which it takes place.<br /><br />Mel Gibson plays a pacifist who, after doing his best to avoid violence, has it thrust upon him by a heartless officer.

GIBSON is clearly working for his paychech here. The screenplay is so  terrible I almost left the theater at once. Everything is pure cliche: the  villain that seems like the Devil himself, so bad he is; the ridiculous  love plot between Gibson's character son and a lady; from scene one, you  know who will live and who will die. THis is the worst kind of thing  American Movi Industry can offer us.

He won't tell his kids and he refuses to accept any honor or mention from other citizens with regard to that time.<br /><br />He is essentially a pacifist now. Then one of his boys is murdered by British troops and he goes into a berserker rage. Well, heck yes! And the way he goes after his revenge is sweet! It is deserving and justified.<br /><br />Then he sort of wimps out. Oh sure, he had the fire and fury to murder all the troops who were taking orders to do the unjustified actions, but when he finally gets a chance to go after the commanding officer who actually and quite literally murdered his son (and subsequently murdered another son and many many others at his order), well ol' Mel's character seems to have wimped out.<br /><br />Why is this? Is it Mel's fault? Yeah, in part it is. He's more than a bankable star. He can greenlight films and he certainly has creative control over just about any picture he's involved with. So why didn't Gibson's character get sweet revenge against this British officer? Who the heck knows?<br /><br />I do know that the battle in which he kills that officer is less than fulfilling and certainly nothing less than a standard battle scene.<br /><br />I can assure you that if my sons were murdered and the wives and children of my friends were burned alive, I'd be living large with a murderous rage - and since this is the Revolutionary War, Gibson's character would have too.<br /><br />The film is well developed and over all, effective, but the climactic final scene is anything but climactic or satisfying. It's almost as if the film starts out with conviction and then by the end of the film, we are being fed some sort of PC crap that "we should take the higher ground and be humane". Well screw that! After almost two hours of this evil Brit torturing and murdering, he deserves far more justice than Gibson's character delivers with a quick sword blow.<br /><br />This calls for a Shakespearian ending and instead we get an ending just the other side of "touchy feely'.<br /><br />Annoying to say the least.</p></br></body></html>

He delivers a strong performance as Major &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaeffer, the leader of a crack U.S. commando squad sent to Central America to rescue some downed airmen that have purportedly been kidnapped by terrorists.  When the mission goes awry, Dutch and crew are forced to traverse a dangerous jungle in order to reach the pre-arranged rendezvous with their OWN rescuers.  And that jungle turns out to be even more dangerous than first imagined, as the squad members soon find themselves in the midst of a safari being conducted by an intelligent extraterrestrial--and THEY are the objects of the hunt!<p>Schwarzenegger is backed by a group of outstanding supporting actors that includes Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura (yes, that's Governor Ventura), and Sonny Landham.  Considering the film's production date, the breathtaking special FX are very original and innovative, and Stan Winston's design and FX for the alien are so totally cool that the creature remains a popular SF icon today.<p>The DVD from Fox is short on extras, offering the trailer only, but the widescreen digital transfer is beautifully stunning and the Dolby Digital sound is fantastic.<p>In short, this is one of Arnie's best, especially from his earlier body of work, and the quality DVD is offered at a price that is reasonable enough that any SF or action-flick fan can add it to their collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>Love the movie. I don't know if it gets better then predator. Ever hear of the game Aliens vs. Predator? Well, predator rules. I mean aliens rocks, but the predator is crazy. Basically Arnold is the man. He is the guy to take down the Predator. There isn't that much talking later in the movie, mostly because there is a vicious killer running around, but there is defintely a sence of... fever. Jungle fever to be exact.<p>Arnold is great in this role. He plays the bad boy gunner perfectly well. He doesn't try to act toooo bad, but he does a great job of taking down the baddies. Anyways, the predator is basically a stealth, nuclear bomb, killer, hunting type creature. It looks like an alien got squashed and swollen or something. Actually it isn't as scary as the aliens, but it is creepy.<p>Compared to Predator 2? Its not even a comparison, this movie rocks compared to Predator 2. DTS really adds to it. The Predator could wipe out a city block, and its really cool to see Arnold take him on. 5 o 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LSRBVD2MK3PL.html">A2LSRBVD2MK3PL</a><br/><p>I recently rented &quot;Predator&quot; on DVD and I forgot what a darn good movie it was. This is one of Schwarzenegger's best films. This film has suspense, action, laughs. Though the DVD does not have any extras it is  still worth buying just because it is a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Now few may know this, but before Arnold Swarzenegger became `The Govenator' of California, he actually starred in a score of action films.  It's true!  Predator (1987), directed by John McTiernan, whose next film would be the hugely successful Die Hard (1988), solidifying his status as the director with the most machismo in Hollywood, stars the great lumpy one (Ahnold), although not quite as lumpy as he was in his first major action film, Conan the Barbarian (1982), along with Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from the Rocky films), Jesse `The Body soon to be governor of Minnesota' Ventura, Bill Duke (he also appeared with Arnold in the mindless 1985 action flick Commando), and Sonny Landham (Billy Bear in the popular 1982 Eddie Murphy film 48 Hrs.).  There are a few others, but these are main players...along with the Predator, played by the colossal 7'2'' Kevin Peter Hall, who passed away in 1991.<br /><br />As the film begins, we learn some gooberment officials have been captured as their chopper (that's the cool way of saying helicopter, in case you didn't know) has been shot down in some unfriendly country, which, I believe, is somewhere in South America, but they never really specify.  Maj. George Dillon (Weathers) calls in a group that specializes in rescuing captures officials, dignitaries, and so on, lead by Maj. 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Swarzenegger).  Among his team are Sgt. 'Mac' Eliot (Duke), Blain (Ventura), who carries one of the biggest guns I've ever seen, and Billy (Landham), along with a couple others.  The mission?  Go in and rescue the missing men...or so it seems, as later we find out that Dillon knows more than he's letting on, but whatever...the group, with Dillon tagging along supposedly in command, enter the jungle, find the downed chopper, and make some horrific discoveries in that another team had been sent in prior to this one, a highly trained military unit, and only their `skinned' corpses remain.  Now, it's never made clear whether Dutch's group is actually in the military, or an ex-military group for hire, or mercenaries.  Dutch claims they only do rescue missions, which would seem to indicate they are no longer in the military, as you don't really get to pick and choose your missions, but his men still refer to him as `Major' so I don't know...I guess it doesn't matter...as they travel deeper into the nasty, hot jungle, we get the impression they are being tracked.  They find and neutralize the enemy camp, and Dillon's true motives are revealed.  This soon becomes a moot point, as they team begins to lose members one by one as a unseen hostile force starts picking them off.  As they race back to a safe point for extraction (the choppers won't venture in too far as the area is now `hot', which I took to mean the group's presence is known, and unfriendly soldiers are now swarming, looking for this small band), they begin to understand what they're up against is more than they ever could have bargained for, as the elite team of fighters becomes fodder for something not of this Earth.<br /><br />If you are looking for sweaty muscle men with big guns, then you've found your Nirvana here.  The characters never really reach much more than a two-dimensional level, but that's of little consequence, as the name of the game is guns shooting, things blowing up, and pretty much non-stop action.  I swear, I think this film has the most gunfire of just about any movie I've seen, and I've seen lots of them.  Ventura's character actually walks around with a Gatling gun, which looks uber-cool, but hardly the type of ordinance I'd take on a covert rescue mission.  If you don't know what a Gatling gun is,  it usually consists of about six barrels or ten barrels mounted in a revolving frame and fires about 320 rounds a minute.  Overkill?  Maybe, but when it comes to the Predator, they don't hit much.  The battle scenes are exciting, as they're filmed in such a way that puts the viewer into the action, rather than just watching it from the safety of your funky couch.  The dialog may evoke a fair deal of wincing, as it's chock full of macho witticisms, a few examples being, "If it bleeds, we can kill it", or, when a character gets his arm grazed with a bullet, another character says, "You're bleeding!", to which the injured character replies, "I ain't got time to bleed".  If it had been me, I probably would have been on the ground, crying, but then I'm neither cool or battle-harden like the characters in the film.  The Predator costume looks very good, despite the age of the film and the technological advances since, so much credit goes to special effects artist extraordinaire Stan Winston.  All in all, Predator is fairly pure actioneer, with a dose of science fiction and a dollop of horror (the skinned bodies...).  The film and it's makers know what it is, and there's very little pretense to make it anything more than that.<br /><br />The wide screen picture looks about as good as it's going to get, and does show some minor flaws, but the audio seems to have been remastered for a DTS soundtrack as well as a Dolby Digital 5.1.  There's scads of extras, including a commentary track by the director, text commentary, a making of documentary titled "If it bleeds, we can kill it", a section titled `Inside the Predator' which is broken up into seven featurettes proving a great amount of detail, a Predator special effects section with five featurettes, a few deleted scenes and outtakes, a Predator profile, a photo gallery, and even a few Easter Eggs (hidden features) scattered about.  Is this two disc set the definitive Predator edition?  I suppose so, that is until another one comes out, like they did with Terminator 2.  (It's definitive for me as it's more than I ever wanted or needed)<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Before Arnold Schwarzenegger created a secret family out of wedlock, before director John McTiernan was smothered by legal woes and before Jesse Ventura donned a tinfoil hat, there was "Predator." A tough-as-nails action epic, this little flick from 1987 added to Schwarzenegger's repertoire as the go-to guy for action flicks at the time and kicked open the door for McTiernan who would go on to direct other classics such as Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and Last Action Hero (?).<br /><br />A group of mercenaries led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) are dumped in the Central American jungle on what they believe to be a rescue mission. Almost immediately upon their arrival, it appears something is wrong. Dead bodies -- apparently skinned alive -- are dangling from the trees and all the while, Jesse Ventura won't shut up. It seems there is a much more dangerous enemy lurking in the foliage, one which can mimic its enemies and blend into the scenery much like a chameleon. This enemy is not of this planet, means serious business and is absolutely famished. This, of course, means it's "Game on!" for Arnold and the Predator.<br /><br />"Predator" is essentially the perfect action flick. While latter day efforts like "Rollerball" may indicate otherwise, McTiernan is (or was) a genuine master of his craft. The film is perfectly paced, the effects are solid (if admittedly bit dated by now) and not overpowering and the characters are brought to life by larger than life personalities. Schwarzenegger and Ventura are joined by the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham and Shane Black. Black, who wrote the script (as well as another action classic from the same year, "Lethal Weapon") brings the characters to life with so much testosterone it oozes out of the screen. Not in a gross way, but in the sort of way that makes you feel like you are hanging out with a group of good ol' boys, shooting the breeze and laughing at one inane joke after the other ("See, 'cause of the echo..."). That is, until carnage ensues and the gang drops off one by one. You'll be laughing one minute and be perched on the edge of your seat the next. Brilliant.<br /><br />While not quite in the same league as, say, Ridley Scott's "Alien," "Predator" delivers the goods in spades. It has a fresh and original concept, a great cast and enough thrills to make it worth watching again and again. McTiernan's Hollywood debut boasts a significant amount of replay value, something which the dreadful "Alien Vs. Predator" flicks lacked and which most modern films of its ilk lack as well. So grab the DVD/Blu-Ray/VHS/Laserdisc/Hologram/Brain-implant, get to da choppah! and get ready for a good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>I really don't have much to say about Predator other than this: I like it. It's a good movie. Good action and suspense. I recommend it. That is all. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/A86R2KZIFHKLB.html">A86R2KZIFHKLB</a><br/><p>How do I give this movie more than 5 stars? Excellent movie, great cast, and a fantastic alien. Basically this is a strong, vs the stronger, who will win? This movie never fails to entertain.

This one and The Terminator were the ones that made Arnold famous. Can't tell you how many times I've watched it. If you haven't seen it, buy it NOW!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator</a> is a true sci-fi classic. Like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>, a powerful alien creature slaughters humans like cattle.<br /><br />What makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244EMO">Predator</a> so great - and what more recent copycats lack - is a great cast of characters and dramatic scenes. Far from just being cannon fodder, you actually start to like Dillon and Blane and the rest. I'll never forget the scene when Dillon becomes so nervous he breaks his razor while shaving - what a great way to add tension to the scene. Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job of being both tough and in control.<br /><br />Remarkably, for a film over 23 years old, the special effects don't seem dated at all. That's another great thing about the way the movie was made - rather than stuffing it with computer-generated graphics, the filmmakers used the technology they had in creative ways to accomplish what they needed. The result is more subtle and interesting, including not knowing what the Predator looks like until the end rather than shooting dozens of closeup shots of CG Predators..<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a high quality blu-ray version out yet, but the regular DVD is just fine.<br /><br />Interesting sidenote: two of the actors in this film, Schwarzenegger and Jesse Venture, later become governors. That could only happen with a quality movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Dutch and a team of commandos have been sent into a Central American jungle to track down some missing airmen that were kidnapped by terrorists. By the time they get to the camp, the airmen have been butchered in a very violent fashion and the commandos retaliate on the terrorists' camp. After that's over, they wait for a helicopter to pick them up, but something strange begins to happen in the woods. It isn't long before the commandos start getting killed off and Dutch and a girl from the camp, Anna, are the only people left and fighting for their lives. But what they discover is too shocking for them to imagine. What's been killing them is the Predator, an alien that hunts rare species and make his trophies out of their skulls. And human beings are the new species he has discovered. When I first saw this movie in 1987, I said to myself, what in the world is that. Predator is the classic action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AHL35XZ3OND2Z.html">AHL35XZ3OND2Z</a><br/><p>Twenty years on, and several sequels later, Predator without a doubt, is not only the best in the series, but still a great, inventive and incredibly suspenseful movie.<br /><br />Much of the commando team proves memorable, notably Jesse Ventura as Blaine and fantastic Carl Weathers as Dillon. In the lead, Schwarzenegger as "Dutch" is classic Arnold. Here he seems completely at ease in his character with good dashes of humor, "What's the matter Dillon? CIA got you pushing too many pencils?" This is probably my favorite role for Arnie.<br /><br />The story here is simple but effective, the filmmakers settling on a "less is more" strategy in almost every category. A special forces team on a central American jungle mission are tracked and killed by an alien hunter. While some of the scenes are lacking not due to dating, or technological constraints - surprisingly the elementary special effects still do the job - but more obviously budget constraints. The guerilla camp raid action scene feels a bit limited in this respect and I think budget had a lot to do with it. The sequence is also probably in line with other slam bang type 80s action movies also.<br /><br />Other flaws and smudges? I think there are some idiotic death scenes in the movie belying the intelligence portrayed by members of Dutch's group. Sonny Landhams last stand with his big knife is stupid, even though you just hear it. Authenticity is also a question with so many recent movies going mega realistic on military tactics. I just hate seeing so many people shooting automatic rifles from the hip. Put that gun to your shoulder soldier.<br /><br />The music score is fantastic, and memorable. The predator is judiciously revealed, a tactic that definitely adds to the suspense factor of the movie. McTiernan's pre Die Hard direction is awfully good. He keeps everything at a simmer and when its time, the movie goes to full boil.<br /><br />The script's subtlety comes to the fore with a great final showdown with the wonderfully menacing Predator. Dutch uses the cunning of a hunter, and largely, his own two hands and not guns to win the battle. This is a rare thing in modern action movies where we are commonly assaulted with endless pornography of automatic weapons.<br /><br />On the subject of sequels, I am a fan of Predator 2, but anything that followed, including the new AvP Requiem was trash. The only stand out criticism, in Predator 2 and AvP R being a clear escalation on the part of the filmmakers in the gore department, and the others, the overwrought special effects. I'm not squeamish or against good computer effects, but I think the real strength of the first movie has nothing to do with blood or bombs, it is that there were strong characters and in the gore and effects department, less was indeed more. Its not hard to find why all the sequels of Predator were such failures. That and most of them were just crappy movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.<br /><br />Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, it's disappointing that the Blu-Ray transfer is so poor...at least according to most of the reviewers here, whom I believe. I would have gladly upgraded but now I'm a little leery of doing that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Watching the 2 disc collector's edition of Predator I was amazed how well this film has held up! I think I liked it more now than when I saw it in a theater. This edition boast a nice DVD transfer and enough extras to keep me happy. Commentary, 'making of' with all the stars (old and new footage), deleted scenes, Predator profile, etc...etc. This is a tense good old fashioned Sci-Fi monster movie and there is a lot of restraint used as we don't get to see much of the 'Predator', until the memorable finale. The FX still look great and this has got to be one of the best creature designs in the last 20 or 30 years! I forgot how good a movie can look without any CGI in it!<br /><br />If the movie has any flaws, it's that there isn't any "real" depth to the characters, but it's an action Sci-Fi movie, so who cares. It's a lot of fun with a great monster and excellent pacing! Grab some popcorn and buy this 2 disc set!  It's out of this world........how cheesy can ya get! :-)</p></br><a href="../users/A1S3C5OFU508P3.html">A1S3C5OFU508P3</a><br/><p>This movie is one of the most engaging and intense science fiction movies ever made. An alien lands in the jungles of Central America and is on a hunt with humans serving as the prey. Armed with high-tech weapons and an invisibility screen, it can move through the jungles at will, but can be injured by firearms.<br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger is the leader of a team of mercenaries sent into the jungles of Central America by the American CIA. Their mission is supposedly to rescue some hostages and they easily defeat the human troops they encounter. However, the situation is reversed when they encounter the predator and it becomes a life-and-death battle. Most of the team is killed and it comes down to a one-on-one between Schwarzenegger and the alien. The climactic battle pits the alien and the high technology against Schwarzenegger and his guile and ability to fashion simple and effective weapons out of jungle materials.<br /> This movie also has some of the best dialog of all science fiction movies and Jessie Ventura was particularly impressive as a member of the mercenary team. My favorite science fiction movie of all time is Aliens and this one is not far behind.</p></br><a href="../users/AFMUUJT7J32LN.html">AFMUUJT7J32LN</a><br/><p>Fantastic movie, The plot is simple and  so good that anyone could of played the lead role. The alien is fantastic and Arnie and co make it work so well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L.html">A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L</a><br/><p>2 discs, the first with the movie (one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever with a great sound track), the second with tons of extras, including outtakes, featurettes on character design, stunts, special effects, interviews, makeup, location, camouflage tests of the predator and a photo gallery.  Only flaw is the director commentary for the first disc - seems to be nothing but stuff he said during interviews spliced together.  Kind of boring but not boring enough to take away a star.<br /><br />Buy it new or used.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely superb! I liked Alien, but this one is even better! The fight scenes were awesome, and Arnold did a great job. Also, Predator himself was stellar and everything an big, evil  space monster should be. I thought his weapons were outstanding and  that his final fight with Arnold was the best part of the movie. And the ways he killed his victims were as juicy as roast lamb! His costume was cool, too. I especially liked the quotes "Bleed? I ain't got time to bleed!" and "You're one ugly motherf***er!" You like space monsters or science fiction? You should see this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>Forget politics for now. Even now, "Predator" is arguably one of my favorite action-science fiction classics that I still watch today.<br /><br /> Set somewhere in the treacherous jungles of South America, a team of U.S. commandos are sent down there to rescue a band of government officials who've been kidnapped by a squad of heavily armed insurgents in South America and a war ensues between. However, after the skirmish, both the U.S. commandoes and their South American foes start being killed, one by one by an unseen enemy that is not even of this world.<br /><br /> Now with both his comrades and enemies alike being killed off one by one, Dutch now is facing off against a deadly foe that is not a sniper but actually an alien that landed on earth and hunts for the sake of it.<br /><br /> Arnold is excellent once again as the macho protagonist main character in an action movie. In case you didn't know, the guy who played blain is Jesse Ventura! Both of them would go on to become governors. Arnold is governor of California and Jesse was governor of Minnesota for a period of time. While I've had mixed opinions of their views, I still love watching them in their roles in "Predator".<br /><br /> Although the age does show in some spots, the special effects are absolutely impressive especially taking into account that this was 1987! The way they did the extra-terrestrial being's face and scary looking mouth was awesome and gave me nightmares for a long time after first seeing the movie.<br /><br /> Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Very sweet movie, one of my favorite Arnold action classics.  Everyone of the main 8 characters does a good job of acting (even Sonny Landham who I recently learned was a porn star).  The special effects will still stand up today against modern action pictures.  The movie quality is pretty good, but I don't really have any good sound systems to test it with.  The documentary on disc 2 is a little sub-par of what I would expect.  I'd rather see something more in depth like on the quadrilogy discs, those are documentaries.  The deleted scene + outtakes are pretty interesting along with the test footage and other featurettes.  What I find most puzzeling is that there isn't a single trailer for this movie, just a quadrilogy trailer.  Everyone should see this movie, and if you like it, than this DVD is great for you.  If you don't like the movie I have pitty on you.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Well, this movie doesn't deserve 5 stars, it probably deserves only 4 but the humor in the movie caused by Arnold, probably accidentally makes it worthy of 5 stars. After throwing a knife at a man which sticks him to the wall, he says: "stick around.."!!!!!!!! Hilarious!!!! His moaning when he is hurt and "he can't see me..." and "GO TO DA CHOPPERRRRRRRR!!" makes it hilarious. But without Ahnold's stupid humor, there's actually a good classic movie here. The story centers around a group of soldiers that have dissapeared. Arnold and his group of elite soldiers must then go to the jungle to find out what happen. But soon, they realize that their enemy isn't human. Of course, you already know what's going to happen, that everyone's going to die besides Arnold. So that's not giving away anything... But, some great action scenes, the creation of a new, original, classic, and awesome vilain, and some cheesy one liners by the governator make this one a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R.html">A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R</a><br/><p>Is it me, or has Arnold's acting skills gone down hill over the years? He did a fine acting job in predator, but his movies since then, you almost wonder if he ever had any experience acting at all. I know that we all say, hey it's arnold, he doesn't need to be an oscar winning actor to be popular and likeable. All his movies, and corny calling card lines like I'LL BE BACK, doesn't change the fact that his movies are mainly "action". Blowing things up, shooting bad guys, chopping arms off, and yes he has done some extremly odd movies, such as "junior" (Oh my i'm almost ashamed to mention that I've seen it. It was horrible.) He should have just stuck to what he is good at. And that is sci-fi/action-thrillers such as PREDATOR. You still can enjoy predator to this day. The most unforgettable scene is when the alien takes his mask off for arnold. The face looked so real. It was all like moist, and freckled, and his teeth were shiny and yellow, and his gums were pink with saliva and he had that disgusting triple opening type jaw. And teeth both inside and outside of his mouth. How did they pull off such genius make up effects, or even the face itself. That is one hell of an imagination. If you saw this film for the first time, without knowing the date of when it was made, you'd never believe the date was 1987. I don't even believe it. I also think that the action music added to the intensity. I miss these type of movies. How can anyone say the 80's sucked. Like 90 percent of all my favorite movies were made in the 80's, and they were so creative that writers copy the ideas to this day. Of course we can't forget the occasional corny 80's flicks, but you can't say no good movies were made in the 80's. This is by far the best alien movie ever. The writer obviously knew about predatorial behavior. IE. when the alien is eating his dinner, and he rips out the flesh of that guy, and screams into the darkness like a hungry wolf. The fact that his main advantage is he can camoflauge himself like many animals can do in the jungle (changing color when they feel thereatened to blend in with the jungle.) It's as if the alien was made for the jungle. Next, tracking the soldiers by their body heat. Like snakes do. Rapid movement and body heat. But then you know he is from outer space because of his heavily equipped body, weapons, aimers, controllers, lasers, knives. You almost stop believing that they can even kill it. And at the end when arnold discovers he too can be invisible with mudd, was GENIUS. Too bad he falls in the pond and it all washes off. The guy who played the alein was this big and tall black guy. I forget his name but he also had a small part in the movie i think, as himself. He must of been hella hot in that space outfit. This will always be one of my favorite movies. I saw it when i was a kid, and still love it. It's entertaining, funny, scary, intelligent, intense, and a classic. It is great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>One of Arnold's best films outside of Conan and Terminator. Also a great action star line-up with Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers.<br /><br /> The characters seem like GI-Joe action figure stereotypes but the script and action sequences make them believable and entertaining. Even with the mystery of the predator being gone, I still get thrills every time I see this movie: not to mention laughs at the humorous dialogue; &quot;I'm gonna have me some fun! I'm gonna have me some fun!&quot;<br /><br /> The special effects are still great after all of this time and the music really carries on the suspense. Altogether one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made!

Anyways I like this movie because it contains a really good looking and scary villain and the only actor to take him on is Arnold which I did not mind this time. He does not talk much in this film (which is a good thing) as he tries to create a good strategy in destroying the man-hunting beast. I like how the creature can only see in infrared making it very hard for any human being to hide from the big bug looking creature. I like this film because it deals with the same matter as in 'Alien', in which you the viewer watch a man who has weaknesses try to defeat a 'Perfect Killing Machine' and tries to escape it's powerful fate of death.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>Like &quot;Alien&quot; before it this film has a seven crew team that is hunted &amp; eliminated, Arnold is great here as a leader of highly trained special forces unit, that get caught up in all kinds of mishaps (CIA double-crossings,unseen stalker) They are constantly watched by this unseen enemy, Jesse Ventura gives a memorable performance, Sonny Landham (48HRS.) gives a good performance as a tracker who senses the Predator &amp; Carl Weathers gives a good performance as Arnold's advesary, but the best part in this film has to be the showdown between Arnold &amp; the Predator, that starts off like a wresting match, the only movie that has Arnold getting his a** kicked, this was also directed by John McTiernan, a year before &quot;Die Hard&quot; , definately a man's movie, &amp; probably one of Arnold's better movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>There is NO WAY, that this film gets a cumulative 4/5. The ratings have been pulled over from the SD. Amazon, please consider adding a separate database field for PQ and AQ for the hi-def products.<br /><br />This movie itself for me is a 5. I love it! The transfer- a nightmare. Tons of noise, color flutuation and light changes/artifacting. The picture is soft, too.<br /><br />Fox/MGM were just (10/2008) given some of the worst ratings, for their Blu-Ray releases and I understand why. I am a huge fan of this franchise, and was incredibly excited to see this in hi-def. If 0 stars was an option, I'd give it a 0. This Blu-Ray transfer is among some of the worst that I have seen.<br /><br />For the premium price paid for Blu-Ray I expect a pristine picture and sound. Fox/MGM I hope you're listening. This truly is shameful!<br /><br />I am thoroughly disappointed and all of the future MGM/Fox titles will be considered "rentals" until I see an review.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>That was the tagline I believe for this very smart, very fun movie.  At the time that was a very true statement.  I still remember the first time I saw this film.  I was chilled to the bone unlike I had ever been before (granted I was only 13).  The film follows a group of US Army Commandos led by non other than the manly man himself Arnold Schwarzenegger (of whom I am NOT a fan but he works here) as they are picked off one by one by a mysterious creature.  This creature has come down to hunt men and that he does.  The action is top notch, and the final showdown between man and beast is brilliant.  Even now, almost 20 years after the film's release, it's still top-notch entertainment.  From the moment we see the skinned bodies hanging from the trees to the moment we hear that horrid creature laughing as he knows his life is over we are glued to our seats and ingrossed in one of the best action films ever to be released.  And to think, this stars Arnold?!?!?!</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Few action films get the blood pumping and your heart pounding like this action packed Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle from the director of "Die Hard", John McTiernan. Though not the greatest sci fi action flick ever made ("Aliens" will always hold that title), it si still one of thebest pure action adventure movies ever made.<br /><br />Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and a covert rescue team are sent into the Central American jungle to infiltrate a hostage situation. By the time they arrive, the hostages have been killed and the terrorists are ready for attack. Fortunately, Dutch and his men are tough and ready, and blow them out of the water. However, there is something else out there. A creature that blends into the forest, unseen. A beast that is killing off the team one by one. A hunter.<br /><br />A predator.<br /><br />As the team members are continually killed by the creature, Dutch and a Central American named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) are the only ones left. And when Anna is rescued, Dutch is determined to face the beast alone, and hope that he'll make it out alive.<br /><br />This special edition is loaded with bonus features, but it's the film that you will want to watch again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>And that is for NOT remastering the damn print. It still has the same transfer as the previous edition which suffered - oh, what could have been! Aside from that, this classic has at last been given its due with a chock-full of supplements. It would have been off the f_____g charts if they'd managed to have Arnold and Jesse in for a commentary, but John McTiernan is good enough with a solid track full of details that I really enjoyed listening to. As far as the film itself, I swoon every time Ol'Painless has screen time, and the dialogue between all the cast is tight and fun chew over again and again. Tension throughout is amped and executed perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Predator&quot; can easily be counted among the top action movies of the eighties and can unquestionably be counted among the top Arnold Schwarzenegger movies!  This movie is quite simply, a pure action packed thriller that sets a level of intensity that few movies in the genre can match.  The action coupled with the superior score will definitely leave a first time viewer astonished at what they're watching.  For fans of this film, it is one of those that can be watched over and over and enjoyed every time, making the nominal price for this DVD inconsequential.<p>One of the elements of this film that makes it such the powerhouse that it is was the performance given by the testosterone laden cast.  Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance is brilliant in the leading role.  For him, it was the perfect role; little dialogue, lots of action, what else did he need.  The supporting cast is almost legendary for the industry; from the &quot;other&quot; governor, Jesse Ventura to Carl Weathers, all of the exceptional actors performed brilliantly.<p>Director John McTiernan did an absolutely perfect job with this movie.  Considering the phenomenal movies he's made in his career, it's easy to see why he was picked to direct them as his approach to making a movie is clearly quite appealing to moviegoers!  The job that Alan Silvestri did with the music for this movie should've won him an Oscar if it didn't.  I'd almost venture to say that despite the script and the stars, this movie might not have been as big as it was had the music for every second of the movie not been the perfect match that it was.<p>The Premise:<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch who appears to be a Major in the US Army and the commanding officer of an HRT (Hostage Rescue Team) that is called in to a Central American country under false pretenses to rescue some dignitaries.  Along for the ride is Carl Weathers in the role of Dillon, a former soldier that had served with Dutch but he now works for the &quot;agency.&quot;  It doesn't take long for the action to kick in as Dutch and his team soon find another team that &quot;bought it&quot; in a very odd way and not long thereafter, Dutch and his team soon find themselves dealing with something no one has ever had to deal with before...<p>I highly recommend this DVD version of &quot;Predator&quot; to any and all who are fans of the action genre, whether you've seen this film or not, this DVD is extremely well worth the nominal cost.  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>This DVD is all about the movie and the only special feature available is the Original Theatrical Trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Here's m thoughts on this movie: it's "The Most Dangerous Game"... but with a masked alien instead of a creepy guy with a satanic goatee. And that basically sums up this gory, suspenseful sci-fi thriller. which starts off as your usual macho BOOMBOOMfest but quickly mutates into something far creepier once the soldiers realize that there's an alien stalking them.<br /><br />Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team have been assigned to rescue a cabinet minister kidnapped by guerillas in Guatemala, which seems like a straightforward mission at first. And the guerillas seem to be an unusually brutal bunch -- while some of the pursuing soldiers have been captured, others have been brutally skilled and left to hang in the trees.<br /><br />Dutch's team basically blows up the entire guerilla compound and everyone in it, except for one woman (Elpidia Carrillo) that they take prisoner. But on the way back, their numbers start dwindling -- one soldier is dragged away and gutted, and another is shot through the chest with an energy blast. Something far worse than the guerillas is stalking the team through the jungle, and the unknown Predator is determined to kill everyone worth hunting.<br /><br />The first half of "Predator" is about a military operation with lots of gunfire and explosions, and the second half is a harrowing, blood-spattered chase with the men getting picked off one by one. Yeah, the plot isn't very complex, but it's handled in a very intense manner -- lots of sweat, dirt, grease, jungle foliage and sudden eruptions of blood and firepower.<br /><br />There are some plot holes, though -- Jim and John Thomas brings up some suspenseful conspiracy stuff about evil CIA agents in league with the guerillas and Russian agents. Then it... just sort of gets forgotten.<br /><br />Fortunately John McTiernan adds huge bucketfuls of suspense and gory horror along the way. Since the alien is invisible, there's the constant feeling that something horrendous and brutal is lurking in the underbrush, and there are some powerful moment like Billy's final defiant stand or Mac saying farewell to his friend.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is... well, "Ahnuld" -- kind of wooden, very muscular, and fairly capable of the whole tough soldier thing. The other characters are sparingly but well-sketched out, such as Dutch's old buddy Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham, Carillo and Richard Chaves. Jesse Ventura is completely two-dimensional, though -- and I wished Landham's character had shown a bit more dimension beyond "stoic Indian tracker."<br /><br />"Predator" has some holes and a rather simple plot, but the superb direction and cinematography are pretty darn brilliant.

The special effects are fairly good and hold up well enough.<br /><br />Again, not very deep but a lot of fun when you are just looking for an action sci-fi to watch.<br /><br />Recommended!

Here we are introduced to the "Predator," an alien hunter who has crash-landed in the jungles of Central America. Little is known about this strange species; only that it'll kick your @** if you get in his way. Add in Arnold Schwarzenegger and his team of soldiers and you've got a bitter conflict between human and alien. I got to say that this is one of the few movies in which Arnold gives a very good performance. You get to see him in some well-done action sequences. The supporting cast is good as well: who would have thought that Jesse Ventura could act? The action is solid; the blood and gore aren't very excessive, but they're still tons to see. And of course, the "Predator" is the real star in this film; that, and the special effects (which still looks realistic today).</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is shooter, a stalker and a top piece of all out action cinema. It's very entertaining, tense and full of destruction.

So good it was that unavoidable sequel ensued. When I first saw this film at the theater I was fascinated. Such a good sci-fi movie is just a treat for buffs like me. Usually the genre provides lots of second rate stuff or in the other hand when they try to be "serious" they end just "pretentious".<br />In my own ranking "Predator" stands side by side with "The Terminator", "Blade Runner", "Alien", "Brazil" and "The Matrix".<br /><br />The story is as follows: a commando unofficial party penetrates a Centro-American jungle in a rescue mission. Things go mysteriously awry and the patrol finds itself deep in the jungle, followed by an invisible enemy and decimated one by one disregarding their overwhelming fire-power.<br />The film follows this wild chase with unfaltering skill giving place to high voltage anthological scenes as the final confrontation between a mudded Dutch, almost single-handed & the wounded, yet lethal, Predator.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his second best interpretation; of his early actor's career (IMHO the best was as The Terminator). His unflinching personification of the ex-Green Beret is paramount; he won't smile even in the final credits. It's amazing how an actor almost expressionless, as Arnold, will convey such stamina charged performance & captivate the audience.<br />The performance of the rest of the Team is far over standard characterizations, not one or two, all of them: Carl Weathers (best know as Rocky eternal rival Apollo Creed) fleshes a granite Special Agent, Bill Duke as powerful Mac, Jesse Ventura (now into politics as Arnold) performs as Blain, Sonny Landham is the monosyllabic Billy, Richard Chaves a suffering Poncho, Elpidia Carrillo is Anna the captured guerrilla and last but not least Kevin Hall is the Predator in person!<br /><br />Director John McTiernan shows his great ability & sense of rhythm  for full fledged action movies, as he will show more than once directing "Die Hard" (1988), "The Hunt of Red October" (1990) and "The 13th Warrior" (1999).<br />Cinematography in charge of Donald McAlpine is very good & special effects are outstanding!<br /><br />This is a recommended film for sci-fi and action film's fan.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>It's one thing that you've got a film with a kick [...] cool as hell alien that hunts humans for sport, and there is nearly no stopping him.  But its the cast of this movie that really pushes the testosteroine into overdrive - with Arnold, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and a list of guys in their athletic prime, all sporting the commando look, armed to the teeth with what seems like unlimited firepower in the jungles of South America.  Even within the first 5 minutes of the film, you've got Arnold and Carl Weathers bulging their biceps while engaging in a very manly handshake - from there on you know this is gonna be one tough manly-muscled film.  And it is, until the Predator hunts them down one by one.<br /><br />In South America, the team is sent to infiltrate a small base and rescue hostages.  Finding their old buddies hanging upside down from a tree and completely skinned leaves the team ready to blow the living daylights off the enemy base, and they do in a spectacular barage of gunfire that can compete with most war movie scenes.  But they eventually learn that it was not men who slautered their old friends, but something else in the jungle, something that's not quite human.<br /><br />One by one, in scenes of suspense, chases, and more gunfire, the units die one by one, until it is just Arnold vs the Predator.  This is where the most excitment of the film lies, as Arnold must use smarts instead of muscle to outwit the Predator.  Yes, even Arnold can't beat him with muscle, as a one on one brawl vs the Predator proves wrong very quickly.<br /><br />In the end, Predator is a very entertaining 90 minutes spent.  You may not even realize there wasn't even a plot to this film, but it's one of those films that doesn't need one.  This is pure adrenaline action and suspense.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 3<br />Overall - 4.5</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Absolutely the best Arnold film made... great cast of characters with a great action story and non stop mayhem.. oh on a side note...

Sure, he's not the most talented member of Hollywood's elite, but he definitely knows how to entertain an audience. In the latter part of the 1980s, Schwarzenegger's ingredients for success were a combination of big muscles, big guns and big explosions. With its often-exhilarating mixture of Alien and Rambo, Predator does not disappoint in the macho department. However, a lacklustre supporting cast and a predictable plot drag down the overall appeal of this film.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the leader of an elite group of commandos. They're called in by the CIA to rescue a group of high profile hostages held captive by guerrilla rebels deep in a Central American jungle. Tagging along for apparently no real reason is CIA agent Dillon ( Carl Weathers), an old buddy of Dutch.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to all, the Predator, a deadly alien, is prowling about the jungle with a bigger arsenal, complete with Freddy Krueger-style blades and scorching lasers. To top it off, the Predator can become nearly invisible if he so chooses, thus making life for Dutch and his troops a deadly game of survival that very few are going to live to talk about. One-by-one, the troops fall in gruesome fashion, until the climactic showdown in which primal instincts become the most powerful weapon.<br /><br />When it wants to be, Predator is a thrilling mix of big bangs, treacherous landscapes and impressive special effects. The Predator is a one of the best in a long line of killer aliens to come out of Hollywood. There are, however, several points where clich&eacute;s take over and suck nearly all the suspense out of the plot. Luckily, the pace picks up for an unforgettable final 20 minutes.<br /><br />The film's greatest weakness comes from the brutally-weak supporting cast, led by the eccentric Minnesota governor and former professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura. He plays a big-mouthed tobacco-chewing generator of hokey lines. While he "ain't got time to bleed," I certainly didn't shed any tears when the Predator made easy work of him. Weathers, most famous for playing Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, also delivers a laughable performance.<br /><br />At the heart of Predator is a dissection of the senses. The Predator cannot see as we do, but through infrared. Looking closely at the characters he takes out, it becomes easy to notice that the Predator is, in essence, stripping Dutch's senses away. One trooper wears abnormally large glasses. Thus when he dies, Dutch loses part of his sight. Another has an uncanny knack to sniff out trouble by sensing it with his nose. When it comes time for the final showdown, Dutch and the Predator make an equal match as they are both in their most primal form.<br /><br />There is much going on in Predator. Unfortunately, not all of it is good.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>People first seeing "Predator" may confuse it with a action movie, due to its star and the fact that it has a couple of action sequences in it (e.g., the attack on the terrorist base camp midway through the film).  However, when compared against any number of teenage slasher movies, this film follows the horror formula nearly to a T: a group of people go to X place, cut off from civilization.  One by one a dark, malignant force picks them off until the climactic duel between good and evil at the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy Ahhnold movies, then you won't be disappointed, but if you also enjoy classic teenage horror movies, you won't be disappointed either.  One thing's for sure: Camp Crystal Lake never had this much firepower.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I don't like to reiterate the story (the editorial review and others will do that).  Instead I like to make points on specific details to help the buyer make an informed choice.  Here's what I think are important things to look for and think about when concidering the Predator DVD;<p>THE FILM (for those who have not viewed it)<br />-I have a hard time deciding if this is a horror movie or a Sci-fi film.  It's so violent, I put it with my horror collection.<br />-Did I mention violent?  This film is not for the squeemish.  INTESTINE ALERT!!!<br />-Always compared to "Alien" and deservedly so.  Alien was a more ambitious film.  I rate them as entertainment equals.<br />-Characters are well defined and (despite not talking much) you actually care about them.<br />-Probably Arnolds most appropriate casting.  It is still uncommfortable to hear him cuss.  All the actors are asked to do very little but run and shoot alot... ...with great success!<br />-Special fx have yet to show there age.  Very well done.<p>-There is nary a slow point in the film.  If it gets quiet, it is to build tension.  First time viewing is very intense.<p>THE DVD<br />-If you want to know more about "Pradator" you won't find it here.  This is an "Extras Free" DVD.<br />-Picture quality is very good.  Not a problem,<br />-Sound quality also very good.  Definitly gives a theater feel.<br />-Packaging is simple.  Nothing of special note.<br />-This thing is a cheap date.  You get what you pay for.  I recommend shopping around.<p>So why the title?  Well, I personally feel this is a Sci-fi Horror classic that deserves the same reverence that "Alien" has received.  The film presentation is quality enough, but I certainly would have paid more for "the Making Of.." or concept art or something to educate me on the details of the films production.  I'm glad I'm able to get this wonderful film for the price of dirt, but I don't agree with it being treated like dirt as a DVD package.  Is this film really so poorly reguarded by Fox that it gets the "Shlub" treatment?  Perhaps they plan future releases giving the "Predator" its proper "Special Edition" DVD.  Unfortunately, I've already spent my money on this, highly viewable, poor-mans version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICCTSCBT7GS9.html">A3ICCTSCBT7GS9</a><br/><p>In this splendid movie which is still again predominated by ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER we are dazzled from extravagance of an E-T<br />who's take many pleasure to make trophy for any species which is a challenge for him, he polish up the differents humans skulls, humans craniums !

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star as US commandos on a rescue mission in South America, but when they find a group of skinned corpses hanging upside down, plans change.  Eventually, one by one each soldier is picked off by an unseen force, until only Arnold is left, and he comes face to face with the sleek alien hunter called the predator which takes his prey's skulls as his trophy.  The design of the Predator itself is in a word, awesome.  FX and makeup legend Stan Winston (responsible for Pumpkinhead and the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park for starters) outdid himself with the design of the beast, as Arnold puts it in the final fight, "One ugly mother......".  While the movie is great, some more special features would have been nice.  There is a rumor of a battle filmed between the Predator and Billy which would have been nice to see.  All in all though, if you've never had a chance to see the original Predator, now has never been a better time, its one of the best sci-fi/action movies of all time.  On a side note, future governor and former WWF wrestler Jessie "The Body" Ventura played one of the commandos, and Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally supposed to be the man in the Predator outfit, but he bowed out at the last minute to film Bloodsport.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Before Die Hard, John McTiernan helmed this action plus gore fest starring Ah-Nold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, on a mission with a bunch of hulky army guys to kill an invisible alien. One of the big man's best films, with great action, a creepy musical score and Stan Winston's excellent alien. However it still succumbs to the formulaic "kill everyone but the main guy" ending. And plausibility as well as subtlety are nowhere to be seen. But who cares? The action ante is great, and McTiernan's talent for over-the top action can be seen very clearly here. This is great brainless entertainment. The DVD is a real letdown though, with only a trailer. Boo!</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>After starring as one of the most iconic and unstoppable villains ever in Terminator, it was high time that Arnie had a worthy foe to fight against. And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.<br /><br />Before his crowning achievement of Die Hard, John McTiernan assembled a group of seven muscle-bound commandos in the South American jungle and let them unleash hell on Latinos, Russians and Aliens alike with an awesome arsenal of macho weaponry. This is definitely a man's movie. Both Alien and Aliens - hell, even Friday The 13th - had a thing about two females going head to head at the end. How are us guys supposed to get a kick out of endings like that? Arnie plays Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, the leader of an elite Spec Ops force. His team is called to duty by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and the very suspicious Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue a bunch of government officials, who have been shot down in enemy territory in Latin America.<br /><br />As soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees. And they get the feeling that things just ain't right. The first rescue team is found disemboweled and skinned. Same goes for their chopper.<br /><br />None of them trust Dillon. He's up to no good. There are no cabinet ministers being held hostage, just a bunch of his CIA pals being tortured by the Russians. In no less than five minutes, all seven of them completely obliterate a rebel guerrilla camp. The CIA hostages are dead.<br /><br />Dutch is angry and feels mighty betrayed. Dillon lied to him and their mission is over as soon as it started. All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home. Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies. This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.<br /><br />In the same way that he created nervous claustrophobia around the Nakatomi Plaza in Die Hard, McTiernan floods the movie with an oppressive and twitchy atmosphere. Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere. He could strike from any corner at any moment. And he does.<br /><br />Nothing Dutch and his men seem to do can thwart this enemy and in no time at all Dutch is the last one standing. He runs for his life with the Predator in hot pursuit.<br /><br />The final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether. McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape. There is a subtext of primitive brutality winning over highly advanced super-weapons. And there is enough testosterone between Dutch and the Predator to fill 100 tanker trucks. Women, totally, need not apply.<br /><br />Definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie. No doubt. Outdone only by the sequel.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is a mixed bag. But I need to remind you that Predator was INTENTIONALLY shot very grainy, gritty and dirty. It think it's a brilliant look for the film. So don't go expecting Pixar-like image quality on this 1080p transfer. In fact so many people were dismayed at Predator looking this way that Fox reissued it with all the grain smeared out. Could the film benefit from a fresh master from the original negative using the VC-1 codec? No doubt. But we won't be getting that "anytime" soon. The DTS HD-MA sound design is amazing though, and will surely convince your neighbors that a war has broken out next door.<br /><br />Zero extras, which is stupid since they were ready and willing by the time this Blu Ray went into production.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>I wanted to comment on the Widescreen Review of the picture and sound quality. I think the highest rating should be reserved for quality that is perfect in every way. There were a few short minor scenes where the picture  looked grainy and I found very easy to pick up. I also had a weird sound  change where background noise disappears (ie sound of burning wood) in the  middle of some dialogue that had me rewinding wondering if I has hearing or  not hearing things, as the case may be. None-the-less, the picture quality  and sound is excellent where it counts and all this DVD could use is maybe  some more extras. A decent DVD to have in any collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Predator has achieved though all these years a cult status, due this intriguing, absorbing, bloody but extremely effective sci fi. To fight against an elusive who invisibly displaces from wrench to wrench and is capable to detect (as the snakes do) the human being through a formidable thermal sensor, will convey the viewer to a very engaging portrait of devastation in the middle of the jungle.<br /><br />The final confrontation may be regarded as one of the most extraordinary ones in the history of cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UA046AA3DXFD.html">A3UA046AA3DXFD</a><br/><p>We, Sid the Elf, wanted a real nice B to kick the weekend off perfectly, so we picked up Predator. Well, Sid was stunned. Predator was a perfectly done action flick. Don't take us wrong, anytime Arnold is teamed with Jesse the body Ventura, Apollo Creed, and the immortal Chink Webber from Lockup the B will be flowing like wine. There was an ample ammount of explosions, totally awsome guns, and the toughest lines around.(We're not even going to mention anymore that anytime Arnold talks the possibility for hillarity is there) With that said, Predator was the perfect guy movie, the only thing that was missing was smokin hot chicks. But, we found ourselves saying no less than 10 times during the screening, "This movie is killer!" or something comperable.<br /><br />Arnold plays Dutch, a CIA operative who has the rep of being the baddest of the bad. Dutch and his team, all of whom are extremely close to one another, are sent into the jungles of Central America to find a missing group of soldiers. The guy responsible for bringing them in? That's right, Appolo Creed. Or, Dillon! Him and Arnold go way back, and appear to be tight as we see in the famous "Whasa matta? FBI's made you gone soft?" scene. When they get to the jungle, things are definately strange. Dillon and Arnold's team are not gelling, and there is a strange presence in the air. That would be Predator, who is responsible for the missing soldiers. Sid is going to go out on a limb and say Predator might be the coolest villan in action movie history. He is a man-eating robot alien with an almost inperceptable cloaking device. Almost. Arnold and the team, with the help of the sweetest gun in action movie history, figure out how to track Predator. But, before they can do any damage to him, the Predator picks off everyone but Arnold, including the legendary Chink Webber. It got dusty in the North Pole when Predator finally got Chink. You knew the whole time that it was going to come down to Arnold vs. Predator. Arnold figures out a way to protect himself from Predator's tracking capabilities, levels the playing field, and takes him on. Sid won't spoil the ending, but it's awesome.<br /><br />So, Sid would have to say, if you're looking for a B action to laugh at stay away from Predator. However, if you want to get totally pumped and watch an all-time killer action flick, Predator is your Vehicle baby. And if you haven't seen Predator yet, Sid doesn't know what to tell you. Actually, yeah he does. Get a copy ASAP.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Oh man, I love this movie. I just bought the DVD and it is awesome. There is so much that was cut out on the TV censored version that is still left in the uncensored rated R version.<br /><br />Alien successfully mixed the horror genre with the sci-fi genre, and Predator has accomplished an amazing thing as well, Predator successfully mixed the action genre with the sci-fi genre. And what better way to do that than to get one of the greatest action heroes of all time, good old Ahnold. And what better person to do the special affects for a movie than the legend himself Stan Winston, and they got both. And mix it with a great story and add John McTiernan (the dude who directed Die Hard) as director, you have one awesome flick. That's what this movie is.<br /><br />The special effects are top notch in this film; Stan really out did himself with this film. Outstanding work on the dead bodies and all of the mutilation that the Predator, aka the Yatja, did.<br /><br />The musical score for the movie was fantastic as well. Every time I think of this movie, I think about the song.<br /><br />Last but not least, a lot of the credit has to go to Kevin Peter Hall who portrayed the Predator in this film. He made the character come to life, and his battles with Arnold were terrific. He really does make you forget that this is all fake and begin to think that this is real. He was a very talented actor who will be missed.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is my favorite sci-fi movie. It has it all with some to spare. I actually understood what was going on when I watched the DVD. On the censored TV version, they cut so much out you just don't know what's really happening. I recommend the DVD big time, very much worth getting. I guess there was 20 minutes that were cut in the censored version after watch this uncensored version. Get it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M3FG82ZE1J8I.html">A3M3FG82ZE1J8I</a><br/><p>Okay, Predator is a great flick for guys of all ages. You've got action and adventure and science fiction and violence and guns and soldiers and military gizmo. Plus, you have a little bit of espionage and alien bad guy and, heck, even an easy-on-the-eyes heroine (ok, it's a minor role, but that's fine by me!). The plot is pretty easy to follow - a bunch of soldiers are sent on a rescue mission in the jungle, but they end up being hunted by some unknown and pretty powerful force. Hey, it's an alien vs. human movie! That's all the plot you need! And it's great fun, especially for Arnold fans. I would like to mention, though, that I bought the DTS version of this DVD. You CANNOT go wrong with this version! The sound is totally outrageously good, so superior to the Dolby Digital surround 5.1 track (also included on the DVD) it's laughable. This is not to say the DD5.1 track is bad, but rather that the DTS track is really THAT good! And given the number of gunfire sequences and explosions in this movie, your speakers will get a lovely workout. So if you want to buy this movie, by all means, get the DTS version and you will not be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Predator is a 1987 american science fiction action film that tells the story of an special forces team, led by 'Dutch' (Arnold Schwarzenegger), on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory in Central America. During their mission, though, they are hunted by an extraterrestrial lifeform known as the Predator.<br /><br />Originally titled Hunter, Predator was met with mixed reactions from movie reviewers and fans of Schwarzenegger. As time wore on, though, people warmed up to the film and is actually considered one of Schwarzenegger's best films in his career. A little known fact that has circulated around the net is that Jean Claude Van-Damme was cast as the Predator in the beginning but, was replaced by Kevin Peter Hall, because of his reservations with the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3J5V2GMXMOGCI.html">A3J5V2GMXMOGCI</a><br/><p>For those that like the film-like quality of their prints re-calibrated and compromised to look "cleaner" for smaller high-definition TVs (under 50 inches), then this new, extras-added, version of PREDATOR will be satisfactory.<br />The original Blu-Ray, without the extras, looks much more like the theatrical release prints, so purists should hang on to that version.<br />This new version has the rather lackluster extras, and questionable internet options, that adolescents who watch movies in cars and on computers probably crave, but if you project PREDATOR on a large (65 inches and over) home-theater screen, then there's no need to spend any more money on a newer version.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>A special army forces team head to the jungle at a rescue mission and defeat one opponent army unit magnificently.

I was actually fairly impressed with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040YFR1Y">Predators ( + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] as well, which I would have to say would be my 2nd favorite Predator movie next to this one.  I wasn't as big a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VFM0YW">Predator 2 [Blu-ray</a>] or necessarily the Alien vs Predator movies, but they were decent I suppose.

Dutch has a sense of honor that Arnold plays well in all his action films.  His men will follow him anywhere.  He is resourceful and demands a high military standard.  His unit is called in on a "rescue" mission which he's not too happy about.  And his pal whom he thought he could trust, will go in charge of his unit!  Hell!<br /><br />The battle scenes when they ambush a bunch of South American militants is right out of a Rambo movie, except smartly played.  Schwarzenegger shows off his weightlifting roots in one scene as he blows up, chops up, and stabs his way through the compound.  I love these cheesy lines:  "Stick around!" as he stabs a guy through to the wall!  Vicious!<br /><br />As vicious as these guys are, they find they themselves are the hunted.  Hunted by a being from space who has a code of honor as strong and as vicious as Dutch's.  As his pals get skinned alive and their skulls become part of the Predator's collection, the rest of the film is pitting wits against wits -- blood and sweat against advanced alien tech.  Who will win?<br /><br />The Predator is a cool creature -- "ugly as hell" and yet recognizes when his prey is worthy of a true knock-down, drag-out fight!  The other army punks and such are cardboard in their acting and characterization, frankly.  It's really Arnold's film.<br /><br />Now that I've seen this film I really understand a lot of the innuendo in the last film, Predators, that was released this summer.  Exciting action/adventure film, some gore and very little sympathy.

This first film was directed by John McTiernan and written by Jim and John Thomas and originally was released in 1987 and is getting the Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-Ray treatment in 2010. The story is of a team of commandos with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on a mission in Central America that are hunted by a highly advanced alpha alien.<br /><br />Some of the other rough, tough muscle men of the time in this commando unit are Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Richard Chaves. The Predator himself was played by 7 foot tall Kevin Peter Hall. Over the course of the film, the men are hunted down one by one while they try to deal with a woman along for the ride named Anna played by Elpidia Carrillo. Eventually Arnold goes man to man with the Predator in an epic scene full of explosions, water, and mud.<br /><br />This film really set the scene for a genre that mixed sci-fi, action, and horror in a new way. No doubt the Predator itself was freaky and scary, but there's the manly man element of fighting back with big battle sequences and the fact that the Predator is extraterrestrial to make it more interesting. It is a memorable film that still gets fans to buy memorabilia and t-shirts to this day and I bet they can't wait for the newest film, "Predators" to open.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is just crammed FULL of features. Here's a bit of a run down.<br /><br />First off, you can listen to commentary from director John McTiernan who provides quite a bit of insight into difficulties they had in production with too much jungle, not enough jungle, red suit dilemmas, and designing the predator. Also there is a text commentary which appears along the bottom of the screen like subtitles from Film Historican Eric Lichtenfield. It reads like the man would speak, not a pop-up video format. You can set it up to actually listen to the director and read the historian at the same time if you wanted to, but it's very confusing.<br /><br />There are multiple detailed making-of features and featurettes starting with the "Predator: Evolution of a Species - Hunters of Extreme Perfection" feature that goes through the first two movies and the creation of a script written with a part for Arnold taking Predator back to the jungle on another planet that got sidelined when it was decided to go into an Aliens versus Predators format instead. The understanding is that the new movie coming out, "Predators" is a manifestation of that script without the Governator. Another feature is "If it bleeds, we can kill it: The Making of Predator" which was clearly put together from interviews taken at the time of the filming and not current day reflection like the other. It tells of fun anecdotes competitive gym time and Jesse Ventura and Arnold measuring the circumference of their biseps. The "Inside the Predator" featurettes break down specific elements even more as well as certain "Special Effects" like "Red Suit Staring Down" and other scenes.<br /><br />There are several deleted scenes & outtakes, Short Takes with the Filmmakers, and an entire photo gallery and Predator Profile. Finally, there is also a sneak peek of the new film, "Predators" seeing some background footage and explanation of the premise.<br /><br />Basically, if you love "Predator", everything you ever needed to know about the movie or the making of it is in this Blu-Ray and it looks fantastic when you watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I must admit that even for a girl, I think this is one of the best nail-biting, or fist smashing if you prefer, action movies that has hit the screen in the past years. This movie came out when I was six years old and along with the Conan movies, which were one of the first movies I have ever seen, made Schwarzenegger my favorite action hero. Since my father had the terminator hair cut and even resembled him, I was sucked into a world of fantastic movies, which never gave me nightmares and pretty much defined my style in books and movies for years to come.<br /><br />Predator is one of those movies that have never received a bad word from anyone I know and that is rare these days. This movie is a smoothie of Aliens, Commando and Rambo producing a fusion of sci-fi and horror special effects that are a guarantee show stopper. The monster itself is not shy, it starts killing right away and it does make plenty of appearance so that the audience doesn't have to wonder if there is a creature at all like in some movies I've seen (where there's a lot of waiting for nothing).<br /><br />The action unfolds as an alien space ship disposes of a small aircraft and drops it on out dear planet Earth. Aboard the one person vessel is a hunter who hunts for the pleasure, it's like a fishing trip during the weekend, and the people are the fish. As it drops on the jungles of Central America little does he know that he will meet his match there as Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his CIA fellow officers are assigned to help rescue a hostage from the guerrilla fighters who occupy the jungle. Some of the bad guys will become snacks for the biomechanoid, but he will bump heads in the jungle with some tough guys who are not going down without a battle. The action and fight sequences were very impressive and the hunt and traps that were set up to catch the hunter were really fun to watch. Unfortunatelly, against the lush, green backdrop the Predator is deadly, fast, shoots lasers and even turns invisible and proves that he's the master of camouflage; he's a real hunter. Apparently Arnold took quite a beating during filming as he fell from tall waterfalls, swam in ice cold water for days and was engorged in mud for weeks running on steep hills.<br /><br />Dutch takes the role of the dog catcher and takes us though the wild jungles on the hunt, and I can safely say that this movie never bores. The ending was spine tingling and intense and provided a satiating finale to this robust movie. Great action flick whether you like terrestrial boogey men or not.<br /><br />-Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>It sits perched in the trees, invisible to the naked eye. It watches them trek through the rainforest. It stalks them slowly, lunging forward when given the chance but never revealing itself. It follows their patterns and mimics their voices. The leader turns, sporting a serious expression of fear. It is Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger). &quot;If it bleeds, we can kill it,&quot; he says, glancing down at the green liquid.<p>Terror comes in many forms, but so does action, and &quot;Predator&quot; successfully combines both. We already know the fate of our hero, but that does not matter, simply because we enjoy the ride. This is a smart action/horror/thriller that doesn't fall back on cliches, but pushes forward, aware that it may be following such films as &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) but yet only improving upon the presented material. The Predator is a work of genius--originally fitted for Jean-Claude Van Damme and shaped like a giant bug, it was later reworked by creature effects artist Stan Winston (with the help of James Cameron) after Van Damme was fired due to complaining too much about how hot and stuffy his suit was. The villain helps make this movie, and if there were ever a terrifying creature it is the Predator, which is not only visually haunting but an emphasis of how advanced life forms could hunt us like we hunt animal prey.<p>Kevin Peter Hall hadn't gotten much work then; a few stage performances but nothing serious. He was picked up by John McTiernan because he was taller than Arnold Schwarzenegger and, when placed in the alien suit, he not only looked fierce but he also looked like he could be the one and only true opponent to Arnold, a man who looks like he eats babies for breakfasts. (And perhaps grown humans for lunch.)<p>Not only is he the perfect opponent, he helps make the movie. A lot of the film's positive elements come from the lush Cambodian jungles, the haunting direction by McTiernan, the ultimate macho combat role by Arnold, the paranoia and startlingly effective idea of the remote settings. Much of it also comes from the fact that the alien, when finally revealed, looks real. It looks real, all right, and also pretty darn horrifying. (Who can forget when it drops its face mask and reveals its true self?)<p>Major Dutch Schaefer and his elite team of US Commandos are sent deep into the swampy depths of a Columbian jungle, trying to locate a downed chopper carrying a Cabinet Member. &quot;Do your Cabinet Members always fly on the wrong side of the border?&quot; Dutch quips before he and his men are loaded into their means of transportation. <p>They arrive in the jungle and soon find that a camouflaged creature is ritualistically stalking and murdering them. But this isn't just random slasher style--it picks off its prey on a whimsy, and only attacks fair game (e.g. those with weapons). Soon Dutch and his team realize that getting out of the jungle isn't going to be as easy as they thought.<p>For me, &quot;Predator&quot; is one of the best action films of all time. It has everything. It isn't messy and over-paced; it takes its time getting where it's going, building up the tension for the audience, and then unleashes a bombardment of action set pieces and visual effects. Another great thing is that it is sort of Hitchcockian in a way; it doesn't show us the killer, at least not at first. It again takes its time, building up the tension, getting us primed. When it finally does show us the creature, we're shocked.<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger fits the role like a glove; criticize him all you want, Dutch was made for him. Can you imagine Sly or Willis playing Dutch? Not me, either. This is his time to shine. Shine he does. <p>The series is getting a jumpstarted revival next year with &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; (2004). There are doubts as to whether or not it will live up to long-growing expectations, especially with Paul W.S. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; Anderson at the helm, but I remain the optimist as far as I can. The idea of the two species joining together for a feature film was hinted at in &quot;Predator 2&quot; (1990), then hinted at even further with a line of comic books, fan fiction, and great videogames. I, personally, cannot wait.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>Possibly one of the most successful and most entertaining science fiction movies ever made was "The Predator", filmed in the wilds of equatorial Mexico and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as an iron-jawed commando team commander brought in to extract diplomats out of the dense and exotic jungle in some small and un-named unfriendly Central American country. Dropped by stealthy helicopters behind the border, the team proceeds carefully in toward the target destination. Suddenly, the team, composed of action movie stalwarts like Carl Weathers and Jessie "The Body" Ventura (later to become the popular and unpredictable Governor of Minnesota) and a terrific supporting cast, discovers a wrecked attack helicopter and a platoon of US Army Rangers skinned alive and hung up in the trees. <p>From this moment on everyone knows something bizarre is going down. Once the switch is turned, the movie continually surprises the viewer by never settling for clich&eacute;, but choosing instead to mine old material in fresh and novel ways, building incredible suspense as everyone on the team begins to discover the deepening trouble they are in. Schwarzenegger does a wonderful job here, and his performance shows why he was so appealing in his prime. He is tough, cautious, and very thorough, and yet portrays the character as very human, vulnerable, and at times confused by the events so rapidly transpiring around him and this is not so easy to do for a six foot two, 230 pounds behemoth with a tough as nails image.<p>Yet this image is played with artfully here with clever one-liners and great gallows humor throughout the film, without ever becoming campy or predictable. Early on he recognizes something supernatural is afoot, and shows his willingness to suspend his ordinary judgements in favor of conceding to new possibilities, and it is this willingness to be open and eclectic that makes him such a formidable foe to the alien stalking them. The special effects for the alien are key here, and a lot of rework was done to make him as frightening and believable a character as possible. At first we just get glimpses of shadows and fading images, but eventually he begins to emerge and we se him in all his horrific heavy-metal glory. As Schwarzenegger remarks; this alien is one ugly _______-_______! <p>The resulting clash is a titanic dual that leaves us on the edges of our seats as the plot twists and turns as often as the bewildering tropical topography. The eventual mano-a-mano showdown between the alien and Schwarzenegger is an unbelievably well choreographed set of action sequences, and takes place over several encounters with a wild and unexpected plot twist or two. This is one everyone will love to have on their "A-List' for action flicks to take down on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Here is a movie sure to keep you laughing and still on the edge of your seat for hours. This one comes with both thumbs WAY UP! Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 10/03, 8/04, 7/07, 10/10<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />7/07: As often I've seen Predator, the picture just throws me in a nostalgic mood for old taste of the way action movies used to be. Predator is a hell of a ride, and this is about muscles, guns, blowing up things, intelligent scripting, principles, values, honor, teamwork, an awesome villain, and big muscles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is certainly an irreplaceable actor because everything he does in films like Predator and The Terminator makes him a fluid-like action star. There are huge amounts of muscles throughout the film, starting with Arnold, and then onto Carl Weathers, Jesse "The Body" Ventura, and Sonny Landham. Ironically, the last two stars and Arnold himself made runs for state governorships, and two of them have won. How often a film goes by where there could have been three governors in a film that has the idea of a B-movie when in fact is a five-star picture? How often a film like Predator comes out seamlessly perfect? Thousands of films out there have tried to do what Predator achieved and failed miserably. Why is that? Because it is a work of a director with an artistry vision. John McTiernan succeeds in Predator and then takes what he can and applies it to Die Hard. This Predator is an awesome villain, not so much different from the Terminator, and is a unique one as well. Ever since I saw this movie first, I've always considered Predator one of the best action-adventure pictures made, and this still stands strong today. Considering how badly movies have been made today, nothing holds up to the level the same as Predator. One example, a great one, is the difference in facial expressions between Predator and innumerable of so-called action-adventure pictures. Usually, in the latter, characters would have this serious look throughout the time and be stuck with it. I've always found it stupidly unrealistic while I appreciate the honesty and human nature of the looks on the characters. I could actually tell by their looks if something serious was happening, or they just ease down. It is really of a very monumental importance because they aren't machines but humans just like us. So, those men, while packing an awesome amount of firepower and muscles, try to do their jobs as given, and the leader made a conscious task to find the suspicious creature before it gets unleashed into the world of civilizations. While the movie actually starts at the 45th minute, the action is just perfect in Predator, and it's undoubtedly one of the most suspenseful thrillers made. I loved the twenty minute mano a mano ending where I felt bad that Arnold's character got shot and pretty much was worried that he might get spotted before getting killed for sure. Yet the Predator couldn't see him. That's quite astounding. While at that, I loved how the characters were able to convey on what they've learned about their adversary. As I said, the script is excellent, and a few of the lines are very memorable. If it bleeds, we can kill it...I ain't got time to bleed...You're one ugly m**********r. Lastly, not to forget to mention, the special effects featured in the movie is breathtakingly well-crafted. Just brilliant stuff. I've said that The Seven Samurai was way too long and that The Magnificent Seven was a magnificent bore, but Predator is the best of all. I will always return to Predator time after time and just simply enjoy it for hell of a time. Starts out with a simple plot, Predator turns into something else more complex because of one and only one simple twist in the story. That's why it's a real winner. When Dutch gets off the chopper, the hum-vee jeeps driving over the water...that's a nostalgia moment. Even better, how about that moment when Dillon throws his arm to Arnold's and I get to see the huge pumps out of that one? It's a classic. Even so is the huge massacre of the jungle trees. That was, on a scale of one to ten, an eleven.<br /><br />10/10: Predator is the one of the best sci-fic horror pictures made of any time. The And Then There Were None is sublime, and Predator makes for a far more entertaining flick than The Seven Samurai. I also think it is an underrated flick and is gaining steam as of lately as a respected classic. There is a lot of memorable moments and also liners in Predator that are well-known among fans of the film. That makes Predator a more exciting movie to watch again and again. What I love about it is the subtle diversion of the plot. At first, it was a simple rescue effort but quickly turns to be a much more complicated matter than that. Then, another subtle thing about the film is the usage of brains over brawn. Yeah, nearly all of the characters were loaded with muscles and testosterone, but they got killed too easily regardless. Once they put the clues together and understood what kind of an enemy they were facing against, they came to realize it was a grave situation. That's why they stayed and try to save the world from this alien visitor akin to the situation of John Carpenter's film The Thing. The conclusion becomes inevitable, but intelligence saved the day for the humans. Lastly that I lover about the movie is the blending in of the infrared perspective of the alien visitor. Most films trying that technique would fail badly, but John McTiernan made it to work and allowed the film to be more interesting this way. All in all, Predator is an outstanding picture and is already a classic. I am raising the rating from `9' to `10'.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star in this 1987<br />sci-fi film.

It must be around the top of ground breaking films when it comes to the sci-fi library and industry. By the late 80's to early 90's more science fiction movies were being made as technology became more advanced. My favorite sci-fi move to date is T-2, which is a much more well rounded movie than this in my opinion.  Overall if you are a fan of these types of films or one of Schwarzenegger, then think you could enjoy it but for the more casual sci-fi fan look towards some more recent releases for a more well rounded experience.<br /><br />Peter J.

The tension is completely covincing, in fact, this is one of the rare films that had my heart pumping big time. It seems that after seeing enough creature-action thriller films, you become desensatized to the thrill, that's why this film shocked me so much. Everything from the heavy action, to that onimous drumbeat that means, "predator is near" screamed complete surrender.<br /><br />If you are a Schwarzenegger fan, or just like really good movies, see this.<br /><br />PS<br /><br />Don't see this if you're the least bit squeemish, as some of the violence tops Saving Private Ryan.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>Maybe they should have sent assassins.<br /><br />In 1987's Predator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, a major in charge of a rescue team who handles the missions no one else can handle.  When he is called on by his good friend Apollo Creed aka the General to find a missing cabinet minister who is lost in the jungle, he thinks it's because he's the best.  He has no idea it's because this is really a suicide mission wherein they will be hunted by a sci-fi creature in the jungle who can blend in with the woods, has heat seeking guns on his shoulders, and hops from tree to tree like a monkey.<br /><br />For some reason, this is the first time I've seen this movie and now that I've seen it, I'm a bit angry it took me so long.  Predator is Schwarzenegger in his heyday--all brawn, accent, and arrogance.  His team is just as impressive with a tracker who can sense the danger in the jungle, a tobacco-chewing redneck who "ain't got time to bleed," and, of course, Apollo Creed as the guy who got them all into this mess.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Predator, this collector's edition is definitely the way to go.  Not only does it have a sneak peek at Alien v. Predator, but it has an entire disc of extras with behind the scenes featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes, etc.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys sction/adventure and sci-fi movies; it's the best of both worlds.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Even after 17 years, I still enjoy this hybrid film which combines the best features of action adventure with special effects which create what is generally referred to as &quot;science fiction.&quot; Here's the basic situation: Major Alan (&quot;Dutch&quot;) Schaefer (Schwarzenegger) and his personal team of highly trained and highly skilled special operatives are enlisted by the CIA to go into an unnamed Latin American country to rescue others who had previously been assigned there on a special mission to....<br /><br /> Once the local guerillas have been summarily terminated, the assignment's original objective becomes irrelevant when all of Dutch's team are then systematically eliminated by a Super Creature (Kevin Peter Hall) whom they are powerless to resist. When the highly improbable climax occurs, only Dutch survives. The plot really makes no sense. It is merely a contrivance to support truly outstanding special effects. Somehow, Schwarzenegger and others in the cast (Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, and Jesse Ventura) sustain appropriate gravitas.

In &quot;Predator&quot; Arnie found one of his most difficult foes ever, perhaps his single most difficult until facing Satan in &quot;End of Days,&quot; but that is another story altogether.<p>Arnold is leading an elite group of commandos through a South American jungle in a search for kidnapped officials.  It turns out that finding the terrorists that supposedly kidnapped the officials was the easy part.  Getting back out of the jungle turns out to be a nightmare.  The commandos soon discover that the jungle covers a hunter with nearly supernatural abilities, courtesy of a cool high tech suit that renders the hunter nearly invisible.  This very same hunter has agility and strength that even Arnold would envy, and who is physically more than a match for Arnold.  But this movie is not just about Arnold's strength; this time Arnold shows that he is an intelligent hunter, and uses the alien's few weaknesses against him to ultimately get the best of him.<p>This movie does have a few plausibility weaknesses, but you are so busy with the nearly non-stop action and the coolest alien since &quot;Alien&quot; that you have little time to consider the implausibilities until after the movie is over, and by then who cares?  While this movie may not be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies, it still plays well as an action movie, and provides Arnold with one of his most challenging foes ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K5IMGDCDBCNF.html">A3K5IMGDCDBCNF</a><br/><p>Predator is an awesome action movie in it's purest form. Consider this: 1) A bunch of big, bad [...], military guys with even bigger guns will go into the jungle on a mission. 2) The leader of this group will be Arnold Schwarzenegger 3) In this said jungle will be an alien opponent of mythic scale just waiting for some new sport. 4) It will have an unknown director who will use optical effects never before created. Now consider the genious who green lit this project, producer Joel Silver. Silver may just be the greatest thing to happen to the action movie since James Bond leapt from Ian Fleming's page onto the screen in Sean Connery's body. The very idea of this film is preposterous, yet Silver saw something, as he must have with such films as Lethal Weapon, Die Hard (also directed by McTiernan), and The Matrix. He must have seen the potential for greatness. <p>Why is Predator so brilliant? I don't know, it just is. From the word "go" this movie is nonstop. McTiernan, just put the pieces together right. Surrounding Schwarzenegger with guys like Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, and Sonny Landham, was inspired. Also inspired: giving Ventura the gattling-gun and the line, "I ain't got time to bleed, or Landham's line, "There's something out there waiting, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die." Alan Silvestri's heart pounding score, the amazing special effects from the predator's camouflage and it's POV, and Arnold, how great is Arnold? Pretty great (he certainly has some of his best one-liners).<p>Man, this movie just rocks. It transcends it's genre, everything about it is tip-top. It is definitely one of Arnold's best roles. So what do I think? Is Predator one of the best action/sci-fi movies ever made? I think yes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Major Duke ( Arnold Schwartzenger)and his recruits ( Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black and Richard Chaves) go into the South American jungles to rescue innocient hostages.

Well, the search proved not to be in vain as director John McTiernan provided the perfect solution with his 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger action/monster film "Predator".<br /><br />"Predator" tells the story of a squad of commandos led by a man named Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who are sent into a Central American jungle to rescue South American officials who have been kidnapped by guerillas.  As their search goes on, the commandos discover that the guerillas may not be their greatest concern in this jungle, as they find themselves being hunted by an apparently invisible being.  As the team of commandos gets picked off one by one, Dutch eventually finds himself face-to-face with the very being responsible, a grotesque alien hunter, heavily armed with advanced war-fighting technology that is beyond anything this world has ever seen before.<br /><br />With the great success of "Predator", director John McTiernan proved himself the right man to bring Fox's newest monster franchise to life.  It is somewhat surprising that 20th Century Fox entrusted their hopes of a new franchise with McTiernan, since he had yet to truly prove himself in Hollywood (it was 1 year later when McTiernan was propelled into superstardom with his Bruce Willis actioner "Die Hard"), but even without having much experience under his belt he succeeded with flying colors.<br /><br />The story for the film is essentially summed up by the film's title "Predator", with that one word, and the fact that Arnold was the main star, most people knew that there's bound to be plenty of action to go around.  Even with all of the action in this movie, there is still plenty of story, some critics felt the plot was rather thin and that all the action covered that problem; personally I didn't feel the plot of the story was weak in any way.  I thought that the story, though not difficult to follow or extremely complicated by any means, was still entertaining and provided enough character development and substance to keep the movie from feeling like it was simply one fight after another with no real purpose.  Obviously the film's story must have had enough substance to form a groundwork mythology for these alien creatures that was spawned off into a sequel, and also into numerous books and comic books that have further expanded upon these Predators.<br /><br />The acting was good for an action film, not Oscar worthy, but these types of movies never are.  Arnold's mastery of the English language had improved from his performance in 1984's "The Terminator", at least you can understand him better, but it's by no means perfect.  The cast does well with their respective characters, some of the performances were a little over the top in places, most were clich&eacute;d, but so were their characters, and what else would you expect in an action film.<br /><br />One of the biggest praises that can be given to this movie is for the special effects work; which still hold up well to this day.  The use of infrared for the Predator's vision was a neat touch and somewhat surprising for the audience to actually be given the monster's view of the world.  Even the invisibility effect, though primitive by today's standards, was very well done when you consider that it was an effect that hadn't really been done in that way before in cinema.  The costume department did what was possibly the best job in special effects for the movie with their work on the Predator costume.  The costume was so realistic, it was clear that the creative team on this movie had payed close attention to "Alien" and "Aliens" in terms of bringing monsters to life.  Had the creative teams behind this movie not rose to the challenge set by the aforementioned movies, I don't believe the film would have been as successful with audiences.<br /><br />With all that being said, "Predator" is definitely a classic among action movies and monster movies for that matter (though this film is more action oriented), and is a film that fans of the `Alien' franchise should definitely watch.<br /><br />"Predator" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Sent on a rescue mission into the jungles of South America, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his group of commandos encounter another visitor among the trees -- and it's not human. The vicious hunter from space slaughters the group one by one, eventually having Arnie as the last living human in the vast jungle of death. But to the creature's surprise, this particular man is going to be much more difficult to destroy!<br /><br />Predator is as much of an action film as it is a sci-fi film. Before the extraterrstrial is fully introduced, there are a few military shoot-em-up scenes to satify any action-film fan. Then, without warning, one of history's greatest movie-monsters rips it's way into the plot. The story is very well paced, and the superb acting, editing, cinematography, and score push it even further. Regardless, the greatest aspect of the film is undeniably the predator itself. Neat gadgets (including numerous weapons and a cloaking device) show the surprising intelligence of the creature. The pure savagery and barbaric appeal it has really puts fear in the viewer! It's facial features are indeed terrifying, the body-suit and costume used are extremely realistic, and in the simplest of terms, the predator is the coolest monster ever to appear on screen. This is a masterpiece in every way. Predator is a must-see for any action fan, monster fan, and even horror fan. An untouchable classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>PREDATOR is definitely a testosterone driven film, from its opening helicopter sequences to its brutal showdown at the end.  When I first saw this movie back in 1987, I was overwhelmed by its originality and felt it was very suspenseful.  I guess since we've come such a long way since then, my latest viewing awakened me to some of the film's major flaws:  it takes too long to have the Predator do his thing.  While I agree that not showing him builds suspense, too much time was spent on the guerilla battle.  It served to slow things down for me.  The addition of the female hostage was also bothersome in that she really didn't add anything to the film, and there was no reason to spare her when all the other guerillas bit the dust.  The soldiers are the stereotype of any kind of jungle/rescue mission movie, and Arnold's cigar chomping is getting old and redundant.  However, once the predator starts taking center stage, the movie regains its momentum and plays out well.  How did Arnold survive the nuclear blast at the end?  Where did the alien come from and why was he here?  These are the things that keep me from giving it a 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Even more "beefed" than usual here, Arnie leads a bunch of elite Mercenaries on a rescue mission, into deep Jungle terrain, somewhere in South America. Trouble is, this is actually a ruse by former teammate Carl Weathers, to do some shameless weeding of gun runners south of the border, and the "honorable mercenary" Arnie is justifiably miffed for getting duped. More trouble is that the preceeding team of Soldiers were inexplicably wiped out and skinned by what we soon to discover is a very formidable (and not human) opponent. The action turns here into an escape movie, as Arnie and his team try to make there way to safety, and are hunted by the alien "Predator" of the title. The action is thick & fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful. This is a macho romp sure, but a good one - regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on. Best of all is that this was a "scary" movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot. Perhaps it is a sign of the times, that even with the advances in CGI, if this were made today, it would be a watered down version carrying a PG tag, attempting to make more money by reaching a wider audience(like this years Alien vs Predator). Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a horror film folks, should anybody under 17 be watching anyway??. The DVD itself is a let down, and looks like it should be in a cardboard sleeve in a dollar store - that's a real shame. If you want to see Arnie at his bone crunching and predictable best - this is it - Great Movie. Enjoy</p></br><a href="../users/A2PXHFGJZBNLXB.html">A2PXHFGJZBNLXB</a><br/><p>Now this is what a well-made, stylish action film should be. It's not quite a classic---it has a RAMBO-like opening action sequence that I personally could have done without---but this 1987 film is undoubtedly one of the better films of the action genre, one tinged with a sci-fi angle that provides slight novelty to what is pretty much a gruesome version of "Ten Little Indians" in a Central American jungle.<br /><br />PREDATOR was directed by John McTiernan, who would expand his popularity as an action director in the following year with the release of the wildly successful DIE HARD. McTiernan could show some of the younger hotshot action directors today how to really craft great action. With both PREDATOR and DIE HARD, he proves that great Hollywood entertainment doesn't have to be simply brainless or crude. In both those films, McTiernan brings energy, wit, and even an eye for beautifully composed images to considerably liven up a potentially routine action thriller. PREDATOR definitely benefits from some terrific jungle scenery and cinematography (by Donald McAlpine); despite its high body count and gruesome gore, the film almost always looks beautiful (which is more than one can say about the action thrillers of younger directors like Michael Bay or Renny Harlin). In a way, McTiernan is a more refined action director than most, emphasizing slick craftsmanship over sheer heart-stopping excitement; but, in the case of this film and DIE HARD, his refinement never dilutes the excitement of the action scenes (which flow beautifully from one scene to another here).<br /><br />The special visual and aural effects of this film still look and sound top-notch today. Stan Winston's conception of the alien creature is still dazzling (and grotesque) to look at, and the sound effects are always convincingly atmospheric. PREDATOR also benefits from a terrific orchestral score by Alan Silvestri, sounding especially muscular on the film soundtrack on this special edition DVD. (Trevor Jones must have been somewhat influenced by it when he scored Renny Harlin's CLIFFHANGER in 1993.)<br /><br />As for Arnold Schwarzenegger (oops, sorry; GOVERNOR Arnold Schwarzenegger), well...once again he proves himself to be a pretty good action hero, with certainly the physique to be one as well as a decent way with a cheesy one-liner (although he only has about three of them in this movie, certainly a lot less than he did in COMMANDO or RAW DEAL). The former Mr. Universe had not, by this film, shown the charisma and likable self-mockery he was to display in later action films and comedies; despite that, PREDATOR remains one of his better films (and a vast improvement over the laughable RAW DEAL).<br /><br />In sum, if you're looking for action fireworks, PREDATOR will fit the bill quite nicely. Director John McTiernan brings a welcome amount of class to the picture, bringing wit and style and even an acute sense of beautiful imagery to what would be merely a crude gorefest in lesser hands. Overall, the picture is a fast-paced (apart from a slow beginning), suspenseful, exciting action ride with a final showdown between good and evil that rivals with the best final showdowns of the action genre. Recommended.</p></br></body></html>

Rambo who upon arriving back home is greeted with the disgust and disrespect of his own people in the classic motion picture First Blood.<br /><br />It's not until Rambo passes through a small town in the heart of America and gets harrassed by the town's sherrif Teasle, played by Brian Dennehy, that he finally snaps. Rambo escapes the clutches of the town's law enforcement officers into the nearby forested mountains where he feels right at home considering that he was a green beret. The officers are in for a surprising all out war as Rambo takes them down one at a time and singlehandedly brings havoc to their tiny city that they call home. The only man who can possibly bring him in is his former trainer, Colonel Trautman, played brilliantly by the late Richard Crenna (the role was originally offered to Kirk Douglas but he eventually turned it down).<br /><br />First Blood is an extraordinary film that reveals how mistreated the veterans of the Vietnam war were. The film also reveals Stallone's action movie star abilities, something he would later be typecast with, and in addition to the Rocky role, the film gave Stallone his second most popular onscreen character as Rambo.<br /><br />First Blood also began a series of Rambo movies: 1985's Rambo: First Blood Part 2, and 1987's Rambo 3, but neither sequel came close to the brilliance of the original.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A-</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Starring the one and only Sylvester Stallone, "First Blood" introduces the world to the legendary action hero John Rambo, in the first of four confusingly titled films. Directed by Ted Kotcheff ("Weekend at Bernie's") and co-starring Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and a young David Caruso, the film is as notorious for its extensive action scenes as it is for the intense and iconic performance put forth by Stallone, who is also credited for writing the screenplay.<br /><br /> Ex-Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is passing through a small town after learning of the death of a member of his unit, and all he wants is something to eat. The local sheriff (Dennehy) doesn't take too kindly to him, however, and after he breaks out of jail, a strong disagreement turns into a full-scale war, with Rambo at odds against the town's police force. Not only does he make a fool of the sheriff, but in his wake, leaves a trail of destruction all on his own that only serves to match the amount of rage and alienation built up inside of him.<br /><br />Despite laying the violence on a bit thick, the film never cheapens or lowers itself to average action-filler. At the heart of it, it's a story about a man's mental disintegration following a failed attempt at re-entering society. Stallone's speech during his breakdown towards the end of the film not only shows significant range for the actor, but also marks a rare occurrence where an action film attempts to address a painful but all too true reality. "Rambo" is not only a great action film, but a gritty and raw one that feels real and human at the same time. Action films just don't get better than this, although the three sequels that followed sure did try.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) runs afoul of the local constabulary while passing through a small town in Washington state.  Abused by a sadistic police officer (Jack Starrett), he becomes a fugitive, ultimately going on the offensive when Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) simply refuses to "let it go."<br /><br />The film starts out great but becomes a bit too routine toward the end, which features explosions galore.  Stallone's physical presence lends great authority to his role, and an impassioned monologue in the film's final moments ends the movie on a powerful note.  The gorgeous landscape of the Pacific Northwest provided an excellent setting for the action and was a major reason for my appreciation of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>The original is always the best! No one could have done it better than Stallone. Rambo comes to a small quiet town looking for his friend. After he finds out his friend has died, he goes looking for a place to eat, but the sheriff for some reason, doesn't like him. After Rambo escapes custody, he starts his one-man war against the town's police. It has the classic look of the 1980's. If you love action, you'll love FIRST BLOOD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good. The action sequences in the film are intense but below all that is a film with heart that makes you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone Stars as a Vietnam Vet trying to live in the real world again.<br />This in my mind is a solute to the Vietnam Vet that went to do a job and were never recognized for the job they were asked to do, especially by there own country!!<br />He's trying to get to a friends house he hasn't seen since the war, as he's leaving cause he found out his friend was dead a policemen sticks his nose where is doesn't belong.<br />Since Rambo didn't follow the policemens direction and leave town after the policemen dropped him off at the edge of town the policmen puts him in jail.<br />While in jail they try shaving him, he has a flash back to the war like someone is trying to cut him he fights back with the policemen, he kills a couple then gets away from the police station.<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I notoriously hate re-reviewing films. I've reviewed them once, I forget about the reviews. I also notoriously hate re-watching movies that I don't particularly want to watch again. Yes, everyone gets it into their heads once in a while that they simply have to re-watch a movie, but for me, I have to be really in the mood. And sometimes it can be MORE than five years, before I feel the need/urge/whatever to watch a movie again.<br /><br />I have a confession to make - the first film I ever saw Mr Stallone in was Demolition Man (I'll have a DVD with the cut full frontal scene please). Hated him in it. I only watched it for Sandra Bullock, and that's because she is one of my favourite actresses. Back then, when I first saw it (taped off the TV don't you know), I didn't like Sly at all. I also didn't like this when I first saw it.<br /><br />But recently, I've been watching more Sly movies (Rocky's etc), and I have another confession to make - I think I've got a little crush on him. He's old enough to be my dad, but I think it's something to do with the eyes.<br /><br />First Blood is about a Vietnam veteran called John Rambo. He's what is called a 'drifter' - not a word I particularly like. He's still severely mentally affected after the war, and has numerous flashbacks (I had a blonde moment, and said the flashbacks were to the 'first' movie - duh!) During his wandering, after finding one of his friends in the war was killed by cancer, he comes across a small town, and met by the very unfriendly sheriff, who takes an instant dislike to Rambo. (Good looking, tall, dark eyes, looking very trim in some scenes - yeah, I can see how you would take an instant dislike to him.) The sheriff drops him off outside the town, but Rambo defiantly walks back into the town, kicking off a chain reaction of events.<br /><br />There's one scene that stands out in First Blood for me - the scene in the police station where Rambo is getting finger printed. I find it absolutely hilarious! He tries to wipe the ink off his fingers with a paper towel, but it gets snatched off him! It's the look on his face, a simple expression but enough to make me giggle anyway! And he still picks up another!<br /><br />First Blood is actually based on a book, which I didn't expect, and there are quite a few differences between it and the film. The film has a reputation for being really violent, but I found the Rocky movies to be more violent in that sense. However, the total body count of the movie is four; the cop who falls out of the helicopter and the three officers in the cop car who crash into a parked car. Overly violent? Not as much as some movies.<br /><br />I'd say to anyone who hated First Blood/Mr Stallone on first viewing, watch it again. Give him a chance. I wouldn't say that for anybody *cough*. It's a good action movie, and Sly acts his sad eyes out. Definitely better (in my opinion) on second viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A175GIISFGGO31.html">A175GIISFGGO31</a><br/><p>When Sylvester Stallone is involved....you know youre going to get terrific action.  But the movies story and Stallones character of John Rambo are very interesting as well.  The thing that appealed to me most of all in this movie is Rambo barely says 2 words througout the whole movie and at the end he just blows up.  He explodes about the war,  his buddies getting killed,  etc.  Its an explosive and dramatic moment....the topper of the whole movie.<p>  Again,  terrific movie,  if youre into action/drama,  take a look at this one, its great!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>MOST PEOPLE REMEMBER ''RAMBO; FIRST BLOOD, PART II'' SO MUCH, THAT THEY ACTUALLY FORGOT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS THE FIRST RAMBO MOVIE. A VIETNAM VETERAN [SYLVESTER STALLONE] IS WRONGFULLY ARRESTED BY A REDNECK COP [BRIAN DENNEHY]. WHEN HE ESCAPES FROM THE POLICE STATION, THE POLICE IMMEDIATELY GO AFTER HIM IN THE NORTHWESTERN JUNGLE. THERE'S A LOT OF SUSPENSE AND THE ACTION NEVER LETS UP. SYLVESTER STALLONE IS IN TOP FORM AS THE TOUGH JOHN RAMBO. ANY ACTION FAN SHOULD HAVE THIS. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This 1982 film introduced the character &quot;John Rambo&quot;, and was followed by other films that portrayed a powerful but misunderstood superhero. Rambo is arrested for walking through a small town, but makes his escape against great odds. He flees into the wilderness, Sheriff Teasel's men in hot pursuit. [Does this remind you of some early Hitchcock films?] The many forces combined against one man prove unequal. [&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; or &quot;Yojimbo&quot;?] Like some Hitchcock films, the visuals are used more than dialog for the story.<p>Most of the film is devoted to the hunt for Rambo in the cold, rainy forest. Rambo eludes his pursuers, the hunted becomes the hunter. The dead and wounded are brought out of the wilderness. The forces against Rambo are escalated, yet success eludes them. Colonel Trautmann, who trained Rambo to be the best killing machine, shows up to confront the Sheriff, and attempts to end the conflict by a political solution (&quot;let him go, get him later&quot;). <p>The burning gas station echoes that scene in &quot;The Birds&quot;, a film about Nature taking revenge. Shooting into electrical transformers creates a blackout that is all too familiar. The explosions and fires are another disaster. Does the ending with the Colonel remind you of Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;? While Rambo walks away, the rest of the story is left to your imagination.<p>The military trains its guard dogs to be vicious, and to obey only their handler. When the handler leaves the service, his dog is destroyed; it has outlived its usefulness. This film is important as an example of propaganda in the movies. A psychotic drifter who kills police and National Guardsmen is portrayed as a hero! Could this happen in real life? Does the failure of the hunt for Rambo echo the Vietnam war? Does the attack on the town portend future terrorism?</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>Before it became one of the most cliche'-ridden action franchises in history, the saga of John Rambo was actually a very compelling and moving one.  Much like actor Sylvester Stallone's other famed movie franchise 'Rocky', this series debuted with a story that was built upon elements of the human condition and focused on the interactions of the main characters.  Where as the sequels in both series resorted to pandering story lines and overblown plot devices, the originals were well crafted.<br /><br />The first episode in the Rambo saga, 'First Blood' (it was not called 'Rambo', despite what many moviegoers think.) tells the tragic tale of a Vietnam veteran's inability to return to a normal life in his own mind and the inability of many people to let him because of their own feelings about that misbegotten war.  John Rambo (Stallone) was a highly trained Army killing who machined who commanded well-trained men and operated high-priced military machinery.  He was Congressional Medal of Honor winner for whom there was no honor to be found when he returned home. All Rambo wanted to do was find an old Army buddy and grab a bite to eat in a small town as he made through and onto to wherever his next destination would be.  Unfortunately, the prejudices and hatreds of a small-town sheriff's department and its vile, redneck sheriff, Will Teasle (played with slimy intensity by Brian Dennehy) just can't leave Rambo in peace.  Teasle harasses and taunts Rambo before arresting him on a nebulous charge of 'vagrancy'.  While in lockdown, the mistreatment his receives at the hand of other members of the sheriff's department triggers horrifying memories of his time in a P.O.W. camp and he snaps.  Rambo attacks the abusive officers and then escapes to the mountains overlooking this sleepy town.  Not content to let well-enough alone, Teasle and his men follow him into the mountains where Rambo's Green Beret training makes the odds of 8 to 1 (and later 200 to 1) turn in favor of the 1.  Teasle was warned: 'Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe.'<br /><br />'First Blood' deconstructs the world as Rambo has come to know it.  It's an unforgiving one for Vietnam veterans and the mercilessness of some people's perceptions of the men who fought that war made the United States as inhospitable a place for them as the thickest jungles in 'Nam.  Rambo wants to forget and move on, but most of all, he just wants to be left alone.  His battle with the sheriff and his deputies isn't about attrition or killing, it's about survival.  He doesn't kill the men after him; he just incapacitates them.  Rambo is the quintessential anti-hero whose plight we can empathize with, if not sympathize.  You understand the world he is facing and what made him flip the way he did.  While certainly not as well known or publicized as its glitzier sequels, 'First Blood' is an underrated gem worth investing 90 minutes in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>This is the original, written by David Morell, only slightly altered. It's a wonderful story. Yes, when you think of Rambo you think of the [stuff] they piled on after; but there's a reason they made them... and that's because this movie is powerful and excellent. I was skeptical, but after watching this movie I have to admit that Sylvester Stalone is a much better actor than I ever gave him credit for. I always dismissed him as a beefcake not-much-dialog tough guy; this movie... well, it doesn't break that mold, but it shows you a bit more depth than you might imagine. <p>I read the book years ago and was deeply moved; David Morell is a terrific author.

First Blood is a definite one-man war film. In it, there is a good deal of a character battle with the elements of nature. A three-sided perspective to the story makes this plot grow. The yarn of how the stubbornness of an authority can cost more than it should. At times, First Blood is tedious, but Stallone engenders back the energy with his presence, even when unexpectedly. Of course, there is an occasional bad acting by the characters of the police force. First Blood is easily watchable and very entertaining, although slow at times.<br /><br />10/07: First Blood is the kind of a film that it is possible to enjoy the story while presenting a pretty bad message. No doubt, First Blood is a great action flick, but I feel it could have been much more. There aren't enough of explosions, action scenes, and mano a mano battles. I could say that the film felt hasty rather than deliberately paced to let the story unfold and evolve, similar to Where Eagles Dare. Sylvester Stallone proves why he is a great action star despite the fact that his acting became poor in the end. Although cleaver and innovative, First Blood is probably a classic in its own genre. Brian Dennehy is a much underrated actor, and he shows the usual performance in First Blood that makes him a great supporting actor. If it isn't for him, I don't think First Blood would've worked out. Also, I wish David Caruso's character is tortured more to the extremes before suffering his fate during First Blood, but I am disappointed. Richard Crenna is well known for his associations with Rambo movies, but he isn't much of an actor. First Blood isn't an exception. Interestingly, (although I read that it was four) only one character died in the movie in spite of the fact that First Blood is known for violence. There is a lot of great scenes during First Blood especially when Rambo gets out of the basement of a police station. Then there is the jump from the cliffs onto the trees. Moreover there is a great scene, considering that Stallone actually did a partial stunt and ended up breaking several ribs. I am not sure if I do totally like the ending, but it is an ending...all right. One phenomenon, which is very fascinating, of Rambo movies is that John Rambo is well-known just because of the second and third parts, but this film First Blood is so little recognized that it might have not existed at all. So, people may have been fooled into thinking that the second part is actually the original because First Blood, as the first part of the series, is wildly out of the context when we think of Rambo being in some Vietnam jungle. A fantastic line came in the middle of the film is when John Rambo says to Sheriff Teasle, "I'll give you a war you won't believe." Yeah, that's a classic. I'll have to comment on the ill-conceived message that First Blood brings forth. There are thousands of Vietnam survivors, but the problem is, what does it make Rambo any different from them? The subtlety here is that when you are frustrated and being pushed around, you nuke a town. Yeah, it might work in a while, but is it logical? Is there anything valid behind the point? Not really; that's why I just didn't buy the message in whole for First Blood. Two separate entities involved in First Blood: great action flick but awry message.<br /><br />7/11: Raising my rating of First Blood from `7' to `8', it is difficultly impossible to compare the original with the next two sequels because they are so vastly different in its makeup. I still must give a lot of credit to Sylvester Stallone for his creativity and genius in making watchable, well-acted action flicks, and First Blood is no exception. It is a thrilling film to watch and a very interesting one at that. As surprising as it seems to be, there is only one death in First Blood, and Rambo had nothing to do with it. Also, it is an interesting movie for giving much attention to Vietnam Vets for their difficulty in reintegrating back into society. The ending is dramatic as well. All in all, First Blood is a unique film to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I have been wanting to to review this movie for awhile First Blood starring Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran John Rambo Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman & Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Tessle. Ok we start off with Rambo is looking for 1 of his old Vietnam war buddies unfortunately he finds out he died of cancer from complications of Agent Orange well then Rambo goes into the small town of Hope Washington Rambo is going to get something to eat & but is harrassed by Sheriff Tessle. So when he is dropped off Rambo well he turns around Sheriff Tessle abuses his power & arrests Rambo at the police station he gets treated like s**t which bring back NAM flashbacks eventually he escapes & that's where the fun begins. I have this on Blu Ray it's actually a ok Blu Ray whit the different ending commentary was entertaining interviews were good. Stallone is great with the action & good acting wise & Richard Crenna I think had the strongest character as well as being the support in the 2 & 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>This is one of my all time favorite movies. For several years now, my dad and I get together and watch movies like Rambo, Predator, Terminator etc. Anyways, this has been a classic for all of those years, and still holds true. One of things that I found interesting about this film is it's creepy undertone. The way those cops obsessively chase and threaten John Rambo is a mysterious journey into the heart of violent obsession. The action is also top notch, with enough explosions and gun fights to make any adreanline junkie happy. Another strong point is the acting by Stallone which is superb, and the score by Goldsmith that helps make the film classic.<br /><br />Definately a milestone.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>When your only skill is to kill and you have had enough of that, you tend to wander. This is the circumstance in which we find John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) Vietnam vet.  Wandering around in his old field jacket he had the misfortune to bump into, of all people the local macho Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy.) It is the sheriff's duty to protect the community from people wondering around in his/her field jacket.<br /><br />Well push comes to shove when the sheriff verdantly or invariantly draws "First Blood".  Now nether one can back down and the whole town and surrounding hills becomes a shooting gallery.<br /><br />There is only one man who may be able to save the situation if anyone is willing to listen, but will they? Yep its is Rambo's old commander Col.

Most people know what the Rambo character is all about, but for those of you who don't......In this entry Stallone's character Rambo is an ex army Green Beret who is wandering across the country in search of an old army buddy. He is not welcomed in the small town he comes to and is treated in the worst way by the town's police. Rambo strikes back and rages a one man war on the town and I'm sure before it is all over, they wish they had just let the guy get a little something to eat! Stallone really knows how to make you hate these moronic cops!  Really well done and he has some good supporting characters in Brian Dennehy,Richard Crenna and a young David Carusso! This is Hollywood action and it is not completely believable, but not so unbelievable either. Compared to the sequels it is a masterpiece! The DVD transfer is excellent and it has some very interesting extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>When Sylvester Stallone's name comes up it's usually with derision.  He's generally dismissed as an actor and the over-inflated killing machine of "Rambo" is brought up.  People tend to forget that at the time "First Blood" came out Stallone had carved himself a nice little career as an actor.  He had the success of the first "Rocky" film under his belt, and "F.I.S.T." and "Nighthawks" were pretty good films.  "First Blood", despite the body count does have a cogent message.  John Rambo is a returning Vietnam vet who is being harrassed by the local police force in a Pacific Northwest town.  They subject him to all sorts of degradation before he finally snaps.  What the constabulary do not realize is that Rambo is no mere vagrant, that he was trained by the Marine Special Forces and that the rules of engagement are ingrained in him whether it be the bush in Vietnam or back on the homefront.  Stallone, aside from his skills as an action star, gives a sympathetic portrayal here.  The acting is generally good.  Brian Dennehy gives dimension as the sheriff that could have been one-note.  A young David Caruso appears as a deputy.  Richard Crenna's role as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's commanding officer, is a little one-dimensional.  He basically appears as kind of a Greek chorus as to the havoc that Rambo can do.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>Seeing this movie, and expecting something innovative, I was disappointed with what I got.  And while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't something I saw as worth multiple re-releases and being hailed as a classic.<br /><br />And for these comments, I get bashed and flamed and mocked and insulted for things beyond my control.  As of now and the viewing of this film, I was/am only 20 years old, but apparently I'm not old enough to "get" this film, because according to the people who commented on my review, I'm "still a child" and given a mantra of "You just don't get it".<br /><br />And this time it was completely different from the "You just don't get it typical American needing your car chases and gunfights to be entertained" mantra given for pretentious crappy art films, it was a "You just don't get it because you're a snobbish little twit for being 20 years old".  Wow!<br /><br />And kind of ironically, I end up re-releasing my review, changed a bit by circumstances unrelated to these flamers.<br /><br />Spending some time thinking about the film and watching "Rambo" again and "First Blood II", I saw that the film was not a 2/5 but more a 3/5 in my view.  I do that because the character of John Rambo himself is a far more well-rounded character than I gave credit for, and he is a far more amiable and pitiable person than I had originally thought.<br /><br />The plot in my opinion does not spend enough time on the true "story" of the film.  The subtle, ulterior plot that I had not even noticed until some time after the movie, ultimately culminated in "Rambo" in 2008; that John Rambo died in Vietnam, and what emerged from the jungle was a broken, lonely man, unable to overcome the fact that, as he so put it in "Rambo", war is in his blood.<br /><br />The movie does spend plenty of time on this, culminating in a climactic monologue by Rambo which is itself worth a viewing of the film, but the more pressing factors of "Generic Action Flick One-Man-Army-Bad-Ass-Mutha vs Faceless Baddies" overwhelmed me upon a first viewing.<br /><br />In "First Blood", there wasn't enough affirmation that this story is about John Rambo, either in the form of more flashbacks, or more exposition, and instead muddle it under a frenzy of cold, detached action that may fare well to draw in a larger, entertainment-oriented crowd, but ultimately costs the main theme of the film sufficient build-up for the big final climax which solidifies the movie.<br /><br />So in short, the movie could have been a classic.  But too much energy was built towards short-term action rather than long-term drama.  Quite frankly, I'm pointing more towards Rambo flashbacks by the campfire, and less Doofballed Douchebags blowing up a cave entrance then getting rowdy as fratboys for nearly effing up the mission ("Bullseye!" says one particularly stupid-looking idiot with glasses after firing a bazooka into the cave entrance, in a closeup shot and one-liner that really could have been done away with without any harm whatsoever).</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Like the title blurb says, "First Blood" is an action/adventure masterpiece of the first order. It's easy to forget this in light of the two cartooney sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988).<br /><br />Most people reading this know the plot: Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town!<br /><br />The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure.<br /><br />Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western "Silverado" (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.<br /><br />Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny in "First Blood." His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing "First Blood" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).<br /><br />Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams: "Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!"<br /><br />I'm not normally into dvd commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition dvd (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how many times you've seen "First Blood." The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If your a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures "First Blood" is a must.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>This is a Stallone classi, and that's why I can't give it 5-stars.

You kill me." - Rambo goes off the deep-end in the original ending to "First Blood"<br /><br />I will always give four stars to "First Blood" (hence, the 4 star rating above), but with this third DVD release of the film from "Lions Gate Home Video", die-hard fans should only pick this up for the so called legendary & "lost" original ending (it didn't show up on the "Special Edition" because the footage couldn't be located in time)& thats after if you can't find the footage to download from the internet or some other source.<br /><br />I got an advanced copy of "First Blood" Ultimate Edition this week (the streetdate is 11/23/04), & was psyched to see what was in store on this DVD. But, after watching all the special features I couldn't help but feel like I had opened a huge Christmas Gift & finding only a flaming paper bag of dog crap to put out.<br /><br />The film itself is identical to the "S.E." version with "First Blood" in the widescreen format with 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 surround. The audio commentary by Sylvester Stallone is new & informative (where the hell was he for the "Special Edition" ?!?).<br /><br />The deleted scenes are what fans have always been clamoring for & the original ending hasn't been shown to audiences since the film's preview screenings in mid '82. The original ending was a bit weird to watch & a bit off with the film itself. Here is a marine who went through 2 tours of Vietnam, a P.O.W., and just beat the crap out of "Jerkwater, USA" only to commit suicide at the unwilling hands of his Colonel. Huh?! Decades ago I read the David Morrell novel of the same name and I always thought, & I could be mistaken, that Rambo gave Trautman an ultimatum - kill or be killed. If Trautman didn't kill Rambo first, than Rambo would attack Trautman, leaving the Colonel with the only alternative but to kill Rambo.<br /><br />The other deleted scene has to do with a flashback sequence Rambo has while eating his boar meat in the cave. the scene is simple enough, in Saigon, Rambo picks up an Asian hooker & makes love to her (Suzee Pai, who was Miao Yin, the girl with the green eyes, in the Kurt Russell film "Big Trouble In Little China", plays the hooker). The scene was cut becuase it slowed the movie down to a crawl and killed the pacing of the film (at the end of this scene Stallone is shown crying and I couldn't help but wonder if his character is having a breakdown or if Stallone is crying because he just watched one of the most embarassing moments of his career).<br /><br />The last deleted scene is a blooper take of the original ending, with Rambo telling Trautman to shoot him & after a long pause, with the take botched, Rambo says, "Thanks a million.", with Trautman shrugging his shoulders & replying, "O.K." (its worth the chuckle).<br /><br />As for the rest of the DVD, I wasn't impressed at all. Its a barebones affair with no trailers, or documentaries at all ("Special Edition", anyone?). The "Survival Mode" feature sucks & was, actually, quite annoying. The briefing & tracking location features were lame and the other survival features could have been used as a trivia track that could run at the bottom of the screen while watching the film. The menus aren't interactive and look as if they were put together rather quickly. Pre-schoolers could have done a better job.<br /><br />Ultimately the decision on whether to own this is up to you, the viewer.<br /><br />Is this the final DVD release of "First Blood"?<br /><br />Just remember what Rambo said near the end of the film.<br /><br />"Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off!"<br /><br />You tell'em John J.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>In an age of cinema largely ruled by computer generated wizardry, FIRST BLOOD is a welcome throwback to an area where technologically created villains didn't yet exist.<p>In the simplest version of a story ever told, boy (John Rambo) meets boy (Wilford Teasle), boy (Teasle) hates boy (Rambo), and testosterone breaks out all over the place.  After refusing to be run out of town, John Rambo is roughed up by several redneck police officers in the Pacific Northwest (what are they doing with rednecks?).  Before you can say "pass the ammo," this former Special Forces Green Beret is enduring a flashback to his glory days in Vietnam, and the town will never be the same ... literally.<p>On board are Sylvester Stallone (back in the days when he was a 'serious' actor), the incomparable Brian Dennehy (who's starting to appear as regularly as Michael Caine in films), and Richard Crenna.  Also, as a guilty pleasure, look for the youthful redheaded cop who's none other than David Caruso in his pre-NYPD BLUE days.<p>What works best about FIRST BLOOD is the tension-filled story of unrelenting action; once this film reaches a fever pitch, it truly never lets up.  As the producers discuss in the documentary accompanying the film, FIRST BLOOD really set the standard for all other action films to follow.  Upon this most recent viewing, the influence of this franchise on other similar outings is readily apparent.<p>A dynamic presentation, the Dolby 5.1 sound leaves a bit to be desired (as does the DTS).  However, the commentary track (featuring best-selling FIRST BLOOD author David Morrell) is a fabulous exploration of the book-to-screen cycle so prevalent in Hollywood, sprinkled with tidbits about the movie-making process, actors originally attacked to the roles of Rambo and his mentor (Colonel Samuel Trautman), and (believe it or not) the use of iconographic and mythological symbols in the telling of the first (and best) of the Rambo tales.<p>The extras here (a new documentary, production notes, etc.) are fairly standard fare, but the preservation of the film is worth the price of at least the first installment of this popular feature film franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>I was fortunate to see this on the big screen and have to say it is not only one of my fav.Stallone films but one of my fav.films for all time.  We all know the story of Rambo so I just want to point out why this film is so classic.  The script and music are superb and even the supporting actors have great lines(BUT WILL!!  I HAVE TO BE AT THE DRUG STORE TOMORROW MORNING) Stallone has oh I'd say 30 lines of dialog in the whole movie<br />and yet it is one of his best.  Action stars like Stallone don't need dialog<br />they just need to kick butt and that is what this movie does.<br /><br />RAMBO:Is there someplace to eat around here?<br />WILL:There is a diner 15 miles down the road.<br />RAMBO:Is there something wrong with me eating here?<br />WILL:Yeah me.<br />RAMBO:Why you pushing me?<br />WILL:--"WHAT?!"<br />RAMBO:Why you pushing me I did nothing to you.<br /><br />DEPUTY:Rambo...John J.

He's just a wanderer who entered a small town where they don't like Drifters much.  <p>In many movies Brian  Dennehy would be the typical badguy.  He would be sort of like the fascist  Donald Sutherland &quot;warden&quot; character in that Stallone prison film  &quot;Lock down&quot;.  But he's not.  In fact many people would probably  tell him that he's doing a good job, keeping the vagrants out in a  professional manner.<p>However, John Rambo is not the usual bum.  He has  flashbacks and can't tell the difference between Vietnamese Captains and  Chris Mulkey.  Sylvester Stallone has a great physical presense in this  movie.  You believe that he is a hardened Green Beret who can go through 10  cops without breaking a sweat.  And his &quot;escape&quot; is well handled  as well, with the magnificient West coast forests providing great  scenery.<p>The movie gets the message across that there are no good guys  and no bad guys, just victims.  John Rambo is a victim of the US Government  who trained him to be a killing machine then abandons him, leaving him with  nightmares and a body full of scars and signs of Agent Orange.  That and  the fact he can't get a job and his fellow American hates the &quot;Child  murderers&quot; of Vietnam.<p>And the police are victims as well, having to  capture/kill this unstable killing machine.  <p>The DVD is a clean copy and  it has a difficult job.  It has to high light the mistiness of the Oregon  forrest, as well as provide good contrast between the background and  foreground.  While other discs do a better job (ie. Last of the Mohicans),  this is a acceptable transfer.  The sound is good as well.  However it is  unfortunate that they left the last song to go to Sly's brother Frank.  He  stinks as a singer and actor...<p>Rating: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense.<br /><br />The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds brilliant. I highly recommend that you buy this and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>The most important thing to keep in mind when watching "First Blood" is not that this 1982 film was Slyvester Stallone's second most successful series after the Rocky films, but that at that point in pop culture history the Vietnam vet had essentially replaced the Nazi as the default villain in a lot of movies and television shows.  The idea was that you took somebody with military training and set them off because (a) they did drugs in Nam, (b) were exposed to Agent Orange, (c) went crazy under the pressure, (d) were rejected by their government and the American people when they got home, or (e) any combination of the above.  In that light, "First Blood" was one of the few films to present a Vietnam vet as a hero.  John Rambo was moody and mentally unstable, in a trained killing machine sort of way, but he had a sense of honor and only struck back when pushed too far.<p>The rule of thumb is that a movie succeeds more on the villain than the hero, and that holds true in this case, with Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, who does not take a liking to a the moody, shaggy haired, Rambo when he wanders through town.  Teasle take Rambo into custody and tries to show him who is boss, but has a deputy sergeant (Jack Starrett) who takes things to far.  Rambo snaps, easily escapes from the police station, and the massive manhunt hunt is on.  The only problem is that Teasle and all of his men are no match for an unarmed Rambo, who quickly finds a way to arm himself.  Teasle has some understanding of how his men are culpable in what is going on, but stubbornly insists that the rule of law should still apply, even when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives right behind the National Guard to explain how big of a mistake the locals have made.<p>The main problem with this film is that there were sequels, which buried the strengths of the original under big budget gloss (a charge that can be leveled against the Rocky series as well).  Beyond that the main complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action.  As such, the politics become an excuse for the violence, which is one of those things that would be ironic on so many levels.  Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT).  The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions.  Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo.<p>The message of "First Blood" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood.  Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  Special mention should be made of the audio commentary on the DVD version by David Morell, who wrote the novel on which the film was based.  Morell is an interesting choice simply because he was not really involved in the production of the film, but this has some interesting payoffs, such as the argument that "First Blood" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film.  There are some tidbits about the film (Kirk Douglas was originally cast as Colonel Trautman) and how the ending was changed when audiences were upset that Rambo was killed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"Nothing is over!

In the field we had a code of honor. you watch my back, I watch yours. Back here there's nothin'." - John Rambo speaks volumes about some of the lost, misuderstood, burnt-out, underappreciated American Soldiers of the Vietnam War in "First Blood"<br /><br />After the success of "Rocky III", in the Summer of 1982, Sylvester Stallone's next film, titled "First Blood", would introduce the movie going audience with his second trademark character, a Vietnam Veteran turned drifter who pushes back after being pushed too far.<br /><br />"First Blood" opens with, Vietnam Vet., John Rambo searching for Delmar Barry, a friend of his that served with Rambo in the Special Forces. Rambo finds where Barry was staying and is shocked to find out that his friend died from cancer, contracted from Agent Orange.<br /><br />Shocked at the loss of his friend, alone, & alienated, Rambo walks the cold highway into the local town of "Hope" to get food & rest. But, not if the local Sheriff, Will Teasle, has his say. Spotting Rambo on the entrance road into town, Teasle stops his cruiser and insists on giving Rambo a ride... to the otherside of town, with the next town being Portland, 30 miles away. Teasle informs Rambo that "his kind" isn't welcome in town & Teasle's job is to keep it that way.<br /><br />Rambo, tired of this King S*it Cop, decides to walk back into town & promptly arrested for vagrancy & resisting arrest. After more brutality by Teasle's second in command & fellow officers, Rambo has had enough. Taking matters into his own hands, Rambo breaks out of the Sheriff's Station & proceeds to lead a one man war against the local law enforcement & anything that stands in his way.<br /><br />A nice surprise comes over the teletype as Teasle and his men are informed that Rambo served in the Special Forces, Green Beret & has been decorated more times than Teasle's artificial Christmas Tree.<br />"Green Berets, their real bada*ses."<br /><br />Teasle leads his men into the mountains to hunt & capture Rambo. But, to Teasle's horror, Rambo takes out each officer, including Teasle.<br /><br />It seems that no man, no law, & no war can stop Rambo, but the tide may turn with the arrival of Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's former CO in the war, to talk him down & bring him in.<br />"GOD didn't make Rambo. I did."<br /><br />Filmed on location in British Columbia, & Vancouver through November 1981 to January 1982, the production of "First Blood" was taxing to say the least, especially for star Sylvester Stallone.<br /><br />Stallone wore a tank top throughout much of the film, with the weather being ten to fifteen below zero. The water for the brief shot of Rambo hiding from the National Guard was 39 degrees farenheit (thats coldass water to hide in).<br /><br />The most valuable prop from the film wasn't the Rambo knife used in the film, but, the dirty piece of tarp that Rambo finds in the junkyard and turns into a makeshift poncho. The scene was filmed in one take with Stallone improvising, taking the tarp slashing a hole through the middle of it with his survival knife, putting it ove rhis head, and tying it off with a piece of rope. Direstor, Ted Kotcheff liked the scene so much he kept the scene, but, when the production found out that was the only tarp in the yard, it was up to the propwrangler to keep an eye on the poncho night and day. After the film wrapped Stallone had the tarp framed & resides in his personal collection to this day.<br /><br />Kirk Douglas was originaly going to star in "First Blood" as Colonel Trautman (there is even conceptual poster art produced, with Stallone & Douglas featured promenantly). But, with a sudden change to the ending of the film, Douglas renigged on the role even after the writers considered his demands. Three days before the film's startdate Richard Crenna signed on & I can't imagine anyone else in the role.<br /><br />This special edition to "First Blood" is, so far, the definitive version to own (the new "Ultimate" edition doesn't come close). Features include a widescreen transfer, Dolby Digital & DTS 5.1 Surround, and outstanding audio commentary by creator & author David Morrell. Also, featured is a behind the scenes look back at the making of the film & trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>"First Blood" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time.  I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama.  Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars).  Stallone actually does some acting in this film.  His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic.  There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable.  Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy.  He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop.  <p>My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels.  Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion.  If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love "First Blood."</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>But which guy? He must be caught and punished. But seriously, the director knows how to keep a story moving and Stallone's sympathetic (if over-acted) performance helps but when his character says &quot;let it go, or I'll give you a war you won't believe&quot;, THE END should have come up on the screen. A nice little 45 minute movie ending satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the film goes on and a man in a grey overcoat and silly beret shows up with a pair of water skis and a rubber shark. This toe curlingly cheesy performance ends with one of the most embarrassing moments in film history. &quot;Don't do it, Rambo!&quot; Yells the afore-mentioned Colonel. Indeed, John, don't waste your bullets on Brian Dennehey, whose rather a good actor. Aim it where it counts.

Rambo isn't the self-righteous hero as he is a lost soul, providing strong parallels to Frankenstein's Monster.  Those who have read Mary Shelley's novel may recall that the monster was given life but could not die.  This also seems to be Rambo's dilemma.  All of his friends have died, but even though he throughs himself off a cliff into some trees, he manages to escape with only a few injuries.  Rambo is a man looking for comfort who is misunderstood because of a monstrous appearance.  Col. Trautman fills the role of Dr. Frankenstein -- The first words out of his mouth are &quot;God didn't invent Rambo.  I did.&quot;  But unlike Dr. Frankenstein who abandoned his monster, Col. Trautman came to take responsibilty for his creation, to try to calm him down.<p>Now let me sing the praises of the commentary on this disk, given by author David Morrell. He never stops providing constant insight into comparing his book to the film, how the Rambo phenomena has influenced his life, an analysis of the character of Rambo as he is supposed to be representative of the Liberals (surprising as the sequels seemed to be more Republican in theme) and how the Rambo character ties into the Heroic cycle, praise of the music cues as well as certain action sequences.  He also talks about the movie cycle on the whole and how with each movie Rambo became more &amp; more invincible, and his knife got larger &amp; larger.  David Morrell's commentary is the best that I have encountered on any DVD anywhere.  Even those who hate the Rambo movies may find enjoyment in David Morrell's commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I remember seeing bits and pieces of the Rambo movies on TV as a kid, and after seeing the amazing new Rambo trailer, I had to go back and watch the original to get me in the mood for the new Rambo movie.<br /><br />John Rambo is singled out by a prejudice cop when he is passing through a small town.  Brian Dennehy escorts him out of town and then brings him to jail because Rambo doesn't want to leave.  Rambo escapes and decides to go to war with the local police force.  The police have no idea what they are getting in to.  After 5 or so officers are quickly disposed of, the police retreat.  Rambo's former superior comes to tell him he needs to give himself up, but Rambo still won't budge.<br /><br />This is a strong portrayal of a man who has not fully recovered from his experiences in the Vietnam war, and when bad memories are brought back, a screw goes loose in Rambo's head.  Now he has pretty much no choice but to fight the police, because he knows he didn't do anything wrong.  Now that an army is after him, he kinda feels more comfortable than he did in every day life.<br /><br />The action scenes are awesome.  Very brutal and very well choreographed.  Stallone's athletic skills look great and he gives the action a lot of life.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />The DVD from Lions Gate has good picture quality.

Both movies are great and although Rocky is better, Rambo is almost as good. Stallone is of course not a Shakespearian actor, but here he is really in his element - John Rambo is after all a devastated, battlescarred veteran, who clearly was not great in social contacts (or great verbal communication) even before the Vietnam War, but who now is really close to a human wreck, with autistic tendancies.<br /><br />In fact, this movie is about a lonely, impoverished, homeless and deeply depressed man who at one moment turns back and bites the bullies in police uniforms who (really sadistically) abuse him, just because he wanted to buy something to eat in the wrong little town. When it finally appears how dangerous he is, he becomes the target of a manhunt, which ultimately gets totally out of proportion.<br /><br />There will be no more details - if you didn't see it yet, you desserve to be surprised. The only thing I am ready to reveal is that the National Guard is providing one of the (few) humorous moments in the movie... Stallone gives a very good performance, and Brian Dennehy (the "redneck" sheriff) and Richard Crenna (colonel of Green Berets) are even better. I always liked this movie and always felt a great pity for the main character.<br /><br />Oh, and also you will be surprised by the bodycount - although maybe not in the way you would expect...</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>Sylvester Stallone achieved amazing heights during the 80's, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially as a movie character synonymous with the muscled guy who is a pure fighting machine...<br /><br />In Ted Kotcheff's "First Blood," John Rambo (Stallone) is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who was trained specifically as a killing machine... He has come to a quite little town in Oregon, only to visit one of his platoon buddies...

Rambo, by that point, fights his way out and wages a one-man war against the police force that escalates out of control... Rambo is seen as a one man army overpowering all the sheriff's deputies and escaping into the surrounding woods...<br /><br />"First Blood" communicates the rage, the depression, the frustration and the psychological wounds of one Vietnam soldier that fought for his country and was then hassled by it upon his return...<br /><br />But what makes Rambo such a dangerous hero is Brian Dennehy being incredibly efficient as the cruel officer who doesn't like the looks of Stallone... Sure he's the abusive sheriff who is the victim of his environment, but he's also arrogant and incessantly underestimating a man who was 'the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands...'<br /><br />Dennehy got a presence of his own pushing an 'expert in guerrilla warfare' at the breaking point...</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>Rambo is a classic action flick, flawlessly simple yet swarming with underlying themes that push it to the edge. The story of a wandering Vietnam vet who walks into a small, quiet town in Washington in search of his last remaining friend never reaches a happy ending. Upon discovering that his last buddy has died of cancer, John Rambo heads into town trying to find a place to eat and collect his thoughts but instead he gets picked up by the sheriff and thrown into jail for vagrancy. When Rambo starts seeing flashbacks from his days as a prisoner of war  that mimic  the abuse caused by deputy Teasle and his buddies all hell breaks loose as he fights his way out of the prison, grabbing his 14 split sawteeth blade, the only trusty friend in his world and dashes out in the wilderness.<br /><br />From his dog tags the sheriff knows that Rambo is a war hero and a green beret, but still is unable to leave him alone. He drives after him and begins a hunt, one that will change his life in allsorts of ways. Attacked for no reason, Rambo tries to talk his way out but when they draw first blood he fights back the only way he knows how, and that only means one thing - lots of surprise attacks and lots of bodies that starts to vanish, as if sucked into the mountainous terrain by a mysterious force. The more Teasle pushes to find Rambo the worse their personal war gets and in the end the town in hanging by its last legs as John unleashes all the demons in his head unto the smug sheriff and his unfriendly town.<br /><br />This is such a great movie, I finally got to see it again after many years and it's still amazing. I was in the mood to make it a Rambo day yesterday and see the other three parts but life got in the way. But man, this is so enjoyable and satisfying, it reminds me of the sweet days I spend with my dad watching these movies as a kid and while he lives far away they make me feel close to him. The misty, smoky mountains turned into a trap that Rambo maneuvered skillfully with bare hands except for his trusty knife. I still have a memory of my father making a replica of the Rambo knife, without the compass, so seeing it in the movie made me chuckle, the shape burned into my memory. For those who have never seen it give it a try, it's good even all those years later and has truly stood the test of time.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/AAKGTWGAFT1LQ.html">AAKGTWGAFT1LQ</a><br/><p>No one is likely to give Mr Stallone a Best Actor Oscar .<br />However, one has to give him credit as a writer and as a person who knows what his audience wants from him in playing certain character types - after all, he's acting to be successful .<br /><br />The film does make other valid points about returning war veterans, but its main focus is the action angle .<br /><br />Sly plays off Brian Dennehy (the town policeman) very well and the tension begins to build up early in the piece as a result .<br /><br />If you are looking for an action film that is not for the kids , then you could do worse than this .<br />Don't look any deeper into it than you should and you may find you enjoy it .<br />A film for the guys mainly - with more drama than bloodshed.<br /><br />Update as of Jan 2010: I have bought the American Blu Ray edition and would like to advise that it is region free. If you are elsewhere in the world, this disc is worth picking up due to the picture quality and the worthwhile supplements on it - it is very good value. The version sold in Australia offers only the film and a different interview with Mr Stallone.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This film seen under the serene gaze of more than twenty years is the expected reaction of so many frustrations, disillusions born under the bad sign of Vietnam. In those ages  the state of abandon and apathy in all the country had almost a quarter of century. From the Kennedy affair till the last eighties a chain of successive scandals,  politic corruption and internal affairs of any issue literally invaded every inch of ink of the principal headlines of the written press and other mediums.<br /><br />In this state of things, the depressed spirit was analyzed by the merchandisers and Rocky was the first punch to raise the self stem of the mass media. Songs as Born in the USA, for instance, made the same role. Then Rambo was born as a mythological figure. A hero born precisely from the ashes who lived the hell and become  a machine human war. And the rest is story. The film obviously sympathizes with John Rambo as the peaceful man who simply wants to forget his job and remake a new life, but the ancestral codes and the old fashioned mind of the law bureaucracy will raise the hidden demons.<br /><br />Despite the picture has aged, it's a fundamental piece in those turbulent ages and it worked out perfectly as cathartic device. Excellent action sequences.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>FIRST BLOOD(1982) Directed by Ted Kotcheff. Script contributions by Sylvester Stallone. Based on the novel by David Morrell. Makeup by Michael Westmore. Score by Jerry Goldsmith.<br /><br /> Starring Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy, David Caruso and Richard Crenna.<br /><br /> A former Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran named John Rambo traumatized by both the War and his treatment when he returned home, alone and alienated, finally snaps when a Sheriff of a small Northwestern town, thinking him just another hippie vagrant up to no good, inadvertantly pushes him over the edge.<br /><br /> Taking to the woods, Rambo begins a guerilla war against the town and the local national guard while the sheriff, realizing that this is all his fault, tries to somehow make it right. At the same time, Rambo's former commander arrives to end this before things get too serious.<br /><br /> While not at all a fan of this film's immediate sequel, one must concede that the original is a particularly fine film with a surprising courage and insight. Dennehy's sheriff could easily have been a one note villain ala SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT but he instead gives him an unexpected depth and some sympathy. While the initial mistake is his, things become as bad as they do because of incompetent or vicious subordinants who do not follow his orders. The sheriff is to be faulted for not allowing Rambo's commander to peacefully resolve things by "letting it go" but his response does have some validity as well. Is Dennehy intended to represent Lyndon Johnson?? Stallone give a very good performance as Rambo---not at all the caricature that his critics like to portray him as being. Stallone runs the gamut from a walking wound to a crazed super soldier before finally descending--in a moving scene---to emotional collapse and is excellent throughout.<br /><br /> The film is loathed by the usual suspects for its sympathetic portrayal of an American soldier and for utterly shattering the drug addled, drunken homosexual racist Nazi rapist babykiller smear(though reviewers like to portray the Rambo films as being made for repressed homosexuals, that is not present in the films) and returning him to his proper place as hero and a victim of the Left's virulent Commie propaganda. However this loathing is not justified by the film---which face it... is simply asking for some sympathy and understanding-- but rather by the seething Hate that underlies the Left.<br /><br /> The film, as supposedly "right wing propaganda," is a pretty soft soap bubble and is generally balanced and decent. It is fairly well directed, very nicely photographed and the score is quite good.<br /><br /> I liked it.<br /><br /> So have me liguidated.<br /><br /> God bless our troops.</p></br><a href="../users/AZQ7O73EAS3VI.html">AZQ7O73EAS3VI</a><br/><p>It looks excellent considering how old this movie is. I say it is worth it considering how cheap it is as well.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>The script for "First Blood" was floating around Hollywood for some time before director Ted Kotcheff signed on to direct the film and Stallone signed on to star in and do the screenplay. Part of what makes "First Blood" so great is the political realness of it. The way that Rambo was treated is the way a lot of other Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.<br /><br />"First Blood" is about Vietnam vet John Rambo. The film starts out were we see Rambo walking down a road, to find Delmare Berry. He is the last living member of the team that he served together on in Vietnam. Rambo learns that Delmare was killed by agent orange cancer. Having no where else to go, Rambo wonders into a small town called Hope. The Sheriff named Teasle stops him and offers him a ride to the edge of town. Teasle tells Rambo he does not want drifters in his town. Teasle drops Rambo off at the South end of Town and while he drives away, he sees Rambo walking back into Town. This causes Rambo to get arrested. While in the police station, Rambo has flashbacks to his torture in Vietnam which causes him to escape. With the help of Rambo's Colonel from Vietnam, Teasle is on the hunt for Rambo.<br /><br />The acting in "First Blood" is Oscar worthy. Sylvester Stallone playing John Rambo, does a wonderful job. There is not a whole lot of dialogue for Stallone in this film, but he makes it work. Also, with his breakdown at the end, which is incredible goes a long way and is personally relatable to Vietnam veterans.<br />Also, Brian Dennehy who plays Sheriff Teasle, does a great job. His character is an overweight, but tough cop. He never gives up on the search for Rambo, even when the higher authorities come in.<br />The character  Colonel Sam Trautman played by Richard Crenna is a noteworthy performance. Trautman is not directly involved in the search for Rambo, however since Rambo has no family or friends, Trautman is the only person he can trust.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for his "Rambo" and "Rocky" films. However, "First Blood" is Stallone's best individual film.<br />Finally, "First Blood" is not solely an action film, it is a mix between action and drama.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>This movie makes you think, besides the Violence, It makes you think how many Veterans felt when they came back from Vietnam, when All these Hippies and Beatniks and radicals would taunt them and make them feel like murderers, When they were Heroes. Of course Condoning Violence is wrong. But this Movie with the Cops treating The Drifter John Rambo like he was nothing, It is sad, and makes you angry. "He Drew First Blood"- Rambo.<br />Great Action Packed Movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>Although the next two Rambo movies get progressively sillier, this is a good movie that has a surprisingly moving finale.<br />Apart from the bull headed attitudes of the local cops, we see a veteran who is a genuine guy. And we see him hurting. The final scenes, after tremendous destruction and skills with violence, are thought provoking and emotional.<br />A surprisingly thoughtful movie.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>In 1982 Sylvester Stallone releases yet another fantastic movie with "First Blood",the first in the Rambo series."First Blood" was inspired by David Morrell's epic novel of the same name.While it doesn't take entirely what is in the book and that many parts if not nearly each of them were written by Stallone himself.It is to notice that Stallone gave Rambo a more human perspective of the character than Morrell did.There have been three sequels that followed but whom all failed to reach the level of the first : "First Blood Part 2"(1985),"Rambo III"(1988) and the more recent "Rambo" in 2008.Decades latter and First Blood is still an amazing movie providing you both action and thrills.Stallone managed to bring two memorable franchises,Rocky And Rambo wich became some of America's most beloved movies.<br /><br />In First Blood Stallone plays the role of John Rambo a Green Beret vet who went to Vietnam and was trained to kill.Rambo searches for the last of his comrades from the Green Berets days,and finds out he died from cancer a few years ago.He walks to a nearby town and is trown out of the town by Sheriff William Teasle.Rambo comes back and is "roughed up" by the cops who without knowing they had made a new powerfull ennnemy.John escapes and the police chases him.He then shows us how much of a killing machine he is by setting up traps and killing.That's when Colonel Samuel Trautman(who was initialy going to be played by Kirk Douglas and at the last minute it all changed)comes in.He claims to be the only one who can stop Rambo as he trained him and obeyed him.It turns out to be a terrific action movie full of suspense and at the same time full of drama and intense moments.Let me tell you if you enjoy movies with any of the mentionned above you are likely to love this movie.<br /><br />The special features.It is known already that the movie itself is incredible as well as a must see classic.The features from previous releases are gone for the most part,and the commentaries by the "First Blood" novel creator David Morrell are not included anymore wich is a shame considering he talked about many things and gave lots of helpfull information.The alternate endings are still there including the ending when Rambo killed himself which was the original ending of the movie before it was changed because of bad reactions to the ending.There are many possibilities for audio and visual with the metascopes and others that let you wtahc the film in different ways.I wonder why they cutted the extras,they did the same for the Rocky remasters.My advice : if you have the older versions don't get these you won't get anything new.its not worth it.If you cans score one of these "Special Editions" then you might consider yourself to have gotten a great deal.Those "Ultimate Editions" aren't so ultimate after all.<br /><br />"First Blood" stands as a classic and a must have.It does not suit everyone be advised so have to know a minimum on the movie before you actually rent and/or buy it.As mentionned above those editions aren't the best and the older editions are much better.Yet this one is easier to find and ainvailable nearly everywhere DVDs are sold which is pretty much the only advantage with these Ultimate editions.You can also save a lot by buying the "Ultimate Edition" boxed set of the first three Rambo.Overral,one of Stallone's crowning achievements and best work AND one of my favourite movies of all time.The best Rambo movie out of the four.You can't go wrong by picking this up if you are a fan of action movies and/or Sylvester Stalone,I liked both so this definatly worked for me.<br /><br />NOTE: A few weeks prior to writting this review the fourth Rambo was released,"Rambo",in theatres January 25th 2008(I will get to that in another review).</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is by far and away the best of the Rambo films, but funnily enough frequently forgotten, because the second movie was so much more successful. With elements of 'Deliverance' and 'Southern Comfort' this creates an atmospheric movie which is thrilling, entertaining and pretty violent as well.<br /><br />Stallone doesn't have to do much acting wise, but his action stuff is well done and generally he looks the part and is very believeable as a disgruntled Vietnam Vet. However its the always excellent Brian Dennehy as the local Town Sheriff, who has bitten off more than he can chew, that holds the film together, with another classy performance.<br /><br />IMO this is the only one of the first three Rambo films worth owning (I haven't seen the latest yet) and it should be in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Hollywood films have brought us some of the most memorable heroes over the years that have found themselves a place within our collective hearts and minds. Whether these heroes be adapted from books, comic books, video games, or real life, they each have several traits in common in which we all relate; from their capacity for good, to trying their best to do what's right, and of course, no matter the obstacles set before them, always fight for those that cannot fight for themselves. Each of our cinematic heroes always seems to embody the very best in all of us. Among the ranks of cinema's greatest heroes is a character that was born from a novel by writer David Morrell, and at first glance didn't seem destined to be the great action hero he later became over the course of three sequels. The character I am referring to is the other most popular character that Sylvester Stallone embodied outside of boxer Rocky Balboa, none other than John Rambo, the Vietnam veteran and former Green Beret, who wanted nothing more than to find acceptance from the very country that he had fought and bled for when it needed him most. Of course, Rambo never would have become the hero we love if not for the excellent film that started it all, "First Blood" from director Ted Kotcheff ("Uncommon Valor") that introduced audiences to the tortured soul of a man simply looking for a place to belong.<br /><br />"First Blood" is the story of Vietnam veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who is traveling the country trying to find former brothers-in-arms; instead, all he finds is heartache as each and every one of his friends from the war have died, leaving him all alone in a world that seems it would rather forget he and his kind ever existed. As he walks into a small town looking for a bite to eat, the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) deems him to be a disturbance and proceeds to usher him quickly out of town. However, Rambo refuses and is subsequently arrested for vagrancy, but after the local police make the terrible mistake of mistreating their newest prisoner, Rambo feels that his only course of action is to free himself of their custody, and flee to the surrounding woods. As the local police are hunting him, Rambo's splintered mind is taking him back to his time as a Green Beret, and all of his lethal training begins to take over. Realizing the high cost of their mistake, the police turn to a man who knows John Rambo all too well, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who desperately wants to ensure Rambo's safe apprehension, while at the same time averting anymore bloodshed before it's too late. Now, in a strange town, surrounded by people who appear to hate and fear him, Rambo believes he is fighting a new kind of war and he will stop at nothing to survive, and ultimately win.<br /><br />"First Blood" is an engaging look at the trauma many veterans face upon returning home and finding that the reception isn't quite what they expect it to be. The film examines not only the ramifications of war on those who proudly serve their country in times of need, but also what could happen when a man is pushed too far and what he may be willing to do to protect himself. It is surprising that the serious topic of how we as a country have treated our veterans, namely those of the Vietnam War, is front and center in this action-packed film. It is this higher quality storytelling that elevates "First Blood" into becoming much more than your average action movie.<br /><br />The superior quality of the story for the film came from author David Morrell, who wrote the original novel the film was based upon, it was then adapted into a screenplay by writers Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone. Though I've read that the film differs in numerous places from the book, if not for that initial novel this film may not have had the same level of depth, social commentary, and realism that made "First Blood" so much better than other action movies of its time. Assisting in the quality of the film, was the solid, no frills direction from director Ted Kotcheff, who by choosing to film on location imbued the film with a gritty, natural feeling in tone that could not have been captured as easily on a back lot of some studio in Hollywood.<br /><br />The acting from Sylvester Stallone was some of the best he has ever done in any of his films. We all knew from his 'Rocky' series of films that he could handle the action scenes and even the dramatic ones, but it was the pure emotion he brought to the character that was so surprising, especially in that riveting final scene in the police station. Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy were superb in their supporting roles as Colonel Trautman and Sheriff Teasle. Crenna created a pseudo-father figure for Rambo with Trautman, and provided audiences, along with the characters in the movie, the interesting insights into the possible mindset of Rambo, and also just what exactly he is capable of. As a credit to his talent, Crenna's character of Trautman not only became one of his most popular characters throughout his entire career, but his character's brief moments of exposition may have been the key point in the film in which Rambo went from being just a misunderstood war veteran, to one of Hollywood's iconic heroes. Brian Dennehy was perfect as the seemingly good natured Sheriff when we first meet him, to becoming the slimy villain, who along with the rest of his police force, embodied the viewpoint of the numerous protestors to the Vietnam War and its veterans, and all others who have judged rather than respect our veterans throughout the history of our country.<br /><br />"First Blood" is an extremely well made survival-themed adventure film that is full of intensity, drama, and exhilarating action sequences that will have you riveted until the film's final moments. A must-see for all action movie fans and is an exciting opening chapter to one of Hollywood's most action-packed franchises. As a tribute to just how enduring the character of Rambo is within Hollywood, 2008 saw the return of the hero in the appropriately titled "Rambo", the fourth film in the franchise, and the first 'Rambo' film in 20 years.<br /><br />"First Blood" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>You ever happen to catch an 80's action flick on TV and think "Man I used to Love these movies" only to be chuckling to yourself a few minutes later as you realize just how bad the movie really is. I've done that on a few occasions with flicks like "Hard to Kill", "Silent Rage", "Tango and Cash" etc. So when I sat down to watch "First Blood" again after not seeing the film in about a decade I was expecting the worst. I was actually pleasantly surprised. "First Blood" still holds up as a great action flick. Stallone gives a solid performance with his first go as John Rambo, none of the action-flick cliches or hammy acting that ruined  his later movies like "Cobra" are present. One thing I got out of my most recent viewing that I never noticed before was the sympathy you begin to feel for Sheriff Will Teasle. Instead of just a run-of-the-mill bad guy, Sheriff Teasle finds himself in a situation where he is in over his head, and at a complete loss as to how to handle it. Initially he is just trying to protect his small town from what he considers a bad element, things get out of his control quickly, and he is stuck trying to mop things up. Rediscover this movie, like "Rocky", "First Blood" is one of Stallone's movies that you can enjoy as much today as you did during the Reagan administration.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Yes, the story line is ridiculous if one stops to think about it but, heck, this is HOLLYWOOD. Here we have the very best of Stallone and a fine supporting cast. This is one of those films that will simply suck you right in to the very end -- a "page-turner" of a film. And if you're into SPECTACULAR cinematography, they pulled off a double-coup on this one! Action! Action! Action! No dragging! I have to restrain myself from watching this DVD more than once a month -- I don't want to get Stallone Burn-out. In summary, what more can I say? A troubled Vietnam Special Forces guy gets plenty even with small-town American idiots for not appreciating his service to his country, (and that of his now-dead peers!). If you liked "Walking Tall" and/or "Deliverance", it's the same sort of idea: justified revenge for atrocities on the "little guy." I guess my enthusiasm for this film shows what a regular Redneck I am way down under. Anyway, this one is a collectors' item, not a doubt of it!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>When your only skill is to kill and you have had enough of that, you tend to wander. This is the circumstance in which we find John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) Vietnam vet.  Wandering around in his old field jacket he had the misfortune to bump into, of all people the local macho Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy.) It is the sheriff's duty to protect the community from people wondering around in his/her field jacket.<br /><br />Well push comes to shove when the sheriff verdantly or invariantly draws "First Blood".  Now nether one can back down and the whole town and surrounding hills becomes a shooting gallery.<br /><br />There is only one man who may be able to save the situation if anyone is willing to listen, but will they? Yep its is Rambo's old commander Col.

But I have this to say about the &quot;Vietnam Speech&quot; Rambo delivered at the end of the movie..... Maybe I've softened in the last 30 years, maybe I have a greater appreciation for the sacrifice of 50,000 young Americans lost in Vietnam - it doesnt matter, but I rank a 4 minute clip that I used to fastforward past now the singular highlight of the film. As great as Stallone was in those few short minutes, Richard Crenna deserved a Supporting Actor Oscar for his reaction to Rambo's heart rending speech.<p>This DVD collection is maybe the best on the market, particularly at the price. The restored video is sharp and crisp, and you have the choice between Widescreen and Standard. You can also select from DTS or 5.1 audio and either will completely blow you away.

He plays an undercover FBI agent who's cover<br /><br />is blown and pays the ultimate price.  In the comic it was his wife and children who were destroyed by the mob.  This film shows his whole family; aunts, uncles, cousins being shot by assassins.  This film even has Roy Schider of Jaws and French Connection fame playing a bit part. I didn't expect to see poor Roy as a casualty in this movie.  It's too bad he didn't get a better role.  The movie might have been better with him as the black hat role instead of Travolta.<br /><br />Travolta I have to say didn't get this role too well.  He didn't play it like Roy Schider might have because he's a bit more seasoned.  I'd have to say the movie was good; had good action scenes, however Travolta was miscast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>The Punisher became one of the most popular Marvel Comics characters during the 80's and is still very popular today; which makes the fact that the movies have been so lackluster even more confusing. This movie could have been 100 times better if:<br /><br />A. - The producer left John Travolta on his jet and picked somebody interesting to play the villain.<br /><br />B. - Explain Castle/Punisher's origin QUICKLY OR THROUGH FLASHBACKS. The whole "family killing" scene (What was Roy Schieder doing in this??) was not only off-putting but too long and unnecessary.<br /><br />C. - Kept Rebecca Stamos' on-screen whining down to a minimum.<br /><br />Things the Producer/Director got 100% right:<br /><br />1. Punny's costume and weapons (The compound bow was an excellent choice.)<br /><br />2. The ancillary villains: Honkey-Tonk guy and the Russian - interesting bad guys are always good.<br /><br />3. The actor who played Punny and most of his dialog - good choice.<br /><br />Some critics disliked the characters in the apartment but I have to admire the producers for taking one of the more interesting and recent comic storylines, that introduced these characters, and using it in this movie.<br /><br />The next Punisher film will hopefully be alot better paced than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>It's hard to know what to make of THE PUNISHER, Marvel's counterpoint to DC Comics' THE BATMAN.  Both characters are vigilantes; both characters have been turned into who they are due to the criminal deaths of their families; and both are mere mortals.  However, whereas THE BATMAN was given a big screen reception with star power and a modestly entertaining script, THE PUNISHER -- in its second attempt at the silver screen -- seems to languish in mediocrity.<br /><br />Tom Jane does an admirable job at trying to bring sense to the life of Frank Castle, a former government agent who retires from the job in order to, finally, spend more time with his family.  However, his last job -- playing a drug lord in a sting operation -- goes horribly awry and ends up causing the shooting death of a thug belonging to the Saint family ... and Howard Saint (played in almost understated parody by the usually reliable John Travolta) wants Castle and his family dead as a consequence.  True enough, a squadron of professional killers are dispatched to due in the reliable screen talent of the lovely Samantha Mathis (appearing briefly as Mrs. Castle) and JAWS and BLUE THUNDER action star Roy Scheider (appearing even more briefly as Frank Castle, Sr.); however, logic fails the bad guys as the appear almost singly in the future endeavors, always a fatal mistake when going mano-a-mano with a comic book character.<br /><br />This isn't to say that THE PUNISHER doesn't have its strengths.  To the contrary, this telling is a slight departure from the original Punisher mythos, where Castle basically declares war on the mob/mafia as retribution for the killing of his family; this time out, Castle is given a new 'family' of sorts that takes the shapes of the unlikely group of tenants in the building where he lives: the comely Rebecca Romijm-Stamos (Joan), John Pinette (Bumpo), and Ben Foster (Dave).  In fact, PUNISHER tries but fails to reach some of the heights hinted at when Dave, after being inadvertantly protected by Castle, mumbles, "No one ever stood up for me before."  Unfortunately, the touching moments are quickly dispatched with sorely predictable gunplay and explosions, and sentimentality is sacrificed for near lunacy of a plot.<br /><br />Sadly, the film is short far more like a television movie than it is a true theatrical outing befitting some of Marvel's other recent properties (SPIDER-MAN and THE HULK as example), and a significant portion of film is bathed in blackness, making the murky picture only fall hand-in-hand with the murkier script.  Some moments are sacrificed by the lovely eye candy of Laura Harring as the modestly grief-stricken Livia Saint, but, as Travolta says, "She took a train."<br /><br />All this and thrown in a woefully out-of-place baddie named only "The Russian" seemingly plucked from a really bad "Popeye" script keeps this Punisher dishing out more punishment on the audience than the bad guys who deserved it.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>A new version of The Punisher, rather than a remake, doesn't really pull off much new and the old version can still hold its own against this one, which does not say much for the new version really. Here the superhero is made more real (an ex fed who had his family shot up and is looking for revenge) rather than some supernatural forces at work. With that it is just a joe soap revenge thriller that fails to pack the punch for what it could have been.<br /><br />One reason for the average rating is that we where promised a violent film the kind of which Hollywood has not churned out in quite awhile. Scene stills of The Punisher with a blow-torch in hand looked like it was going to be the real deal. Just turns out he fakes the whole scene and 'pretends' to torture people. Truth be told it is just a heavy PG-13 movie, but nothing pushing the rating the producers said it would have. Also the action is extremely limited considering. You will be surprised by how little of it there is.<br /><br />The only gem that saves the film is Thomas Jane. He is a good actor and can stand up there with the likes of new generation action heros (Diesel and Damon) and for that we have no quarrels. Shame that they just didn't push this film to make it harder. It just ends up being a little soft and not exactly the kind of superhero that the comic books delivered on... not that we do not like a little deviation... it just doesn't work that well here.<br /><br />Saturday Night pop-corn fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I don't understand what is so compelling about the Punisher comic book character to warrant not one, but two movies.  The first adaptation starred Dolph Lungren and was an awful movie.  Is Hollywood so desperate for material that they are now resorting to remaking crappy movies as well as classics?  Fortunately this version is a bit better done than the other, but it is still a marginal movie at best.  When the lead character played by Tom Jane is not getting the crap beat out of him, he is delivering uninspired dialog in a wooden fashion.  John Travolta plays the villian in his usual manner and has basically become a charicature of himself.  If you're in the mood for an over-the-top revenge flick, then give it a rent-there isn't much else out there at the moment.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>I just checked out "The Punisher" at the theater a couple of days ago, and let me just say that the film was action-packed from pulse-pounding start to heart-stopping finish! The direction of Jonathan Hensleigh (screenwriter for "Armageddon") was nothing short of excellent or intense! This new version of "The Punisher" was, without a doubt, way, way better than the old 1989 Dolph Lundgren version, especially since this popular Marvel comic-book adaption explains more of the Frank Castle character in-depth, etc. The performance of Thomas Jane ("Dreamcatcher") as Frank Castle/The Punisher was extraordinary! The finest performance of Jane's career! The performance of John Travolta ("Get Shorty"), back in bad-guy form as Castle's villainous counterpart, Howard Saint, was electrifying and powerful! Travolta's best villainous performance since "Swordfish" and "Face/Off"! Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Romijn-Stamos ("X2: X-Men United"), Will Patton ("Entrapment"), Roy Scheider ("Jaws"), Laura Harring ("Mulholland Dr."), Ben Foster ("Liberty Heights"), and Samantha Mathis (Travolta's "Broken Arrow" co-star), in which they, too, gave unforgettable performances alongside the two leads!<p>"The Punisher" puts the focus on Frank Castle (Jane), a man who has seen too much death in his life, first as a former Delta Force operative and later as an undercover FBI special agent. He has managed to beat considerable odds, and is finally moving out of the field and into a normal life with his wife, Maria (Mathis), and young son, Will. On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), is inadvertently killed in the process. The end result places the FBI on the wrong side of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (Travolta) and his glamorous wife, Livia (Harring). Notwithstanding their glossy social profile, the Saints are no genteel Florida couple; behind their copious wealth are violent beginnings, underworld ties -- and a chilling capacity for brutality. Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance. Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion, with Maria and Will killed in the process.<p>But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalize the people who murdered his family. Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. He takes up residence in a dilapidated tenement building in Tampa's industrial district, where his fellow tenants include Joan (Stamos), a waitress at a nearby diner who is trying to put her life back on track; Dave (Foster), a gangly twenty-something with a face full of piercings; and Bumpo (John Pinette), a rotund gourmand who rarely leaves his home.<p>In preparing his revenge, Castle thoroughly familiarizes himself with the habits and routines of the Saint family. He traces the movements not only of Howard and Livia, but also their surviving son, John (also played by Carpinello), and Howard's second-in-command, lawyer Quentin Glass (Patton). Armed with this essential knowledge, Castle launches his first salvo against Saint's business interests. Stunned that Castle is not only alive but causing him harm, Saint marshals his forces in an attempt to shut Castle down permanently. He soon turns to the underworld's network of hired assassins, recruiting the laconic Memphis legend Harry Heck (Mark Collie) as well as the blonde behemoth known only as the Russian (WWE superstar Kevin Nash).<p>Castle's plan is proceeding apace, but his mission has the unintended effect of placing his fellow tenement dwellers in danger. Yet Joan, Dave, and Bumpo rally for their neighbor, even at great personal risk. This makeshift family -- forgotten men and women with no one to protect them -- brings Castle the one thing he least expects: redemption. His personal goal achieved, Castle realizes that his life's work has just begun. As The Punisher, he will provide justice for ordinary people and exact retribution from society's villains.<p>In conclusion, "The Punisher", to me, is a whole lot better than recent Marvel comic-book duds as "Daredevil" and "The Hulk"! Also, "The Punisher" has it all: lots and lots of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat, powerful storyline, some laugh-out-loud humor, and a pulsating soundtrack! "The Punisher" is an absolute DVD must-have to any collection when it's released!</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I have been getting burned out doing the 20 Years Ago & 2002 in film series I will start back with that series in November. But for right now I will be doing reviews here on my older account. Next week I'll probably do some horror related reviews. Now I reviewed this back in 2010 when I reviewed The Punisher movies & some of the games. I just didn't do this movie or The 2004 movie justice. To be honest The 89 Punisher is my favorite cause it has a comic book feel tons of action & a great portrayal of Frank Castle. I like The 2004 movie a lot Thomas Jane is my favorite Punisher actor. Cause you see that character go from a normal family man to a man that is dying on the inside. A lot of people don't like this Punisher Movie all because he doesn't have the skull. Me I think the biker clothes are cool & The X Men movies didn't have the costumes right & I like those movies well 3 of them anyway. Or they don't like how the origin isn't true to the comics guess what none of The Batman movies were completly true to the source material. I've heard how The Dark Knight Rises doesn't even follow Knight Fall & that is a shame cause that is very good storyline. Anyway Punisher 89 was made on a budget of $9 million & they just made this look theactrical it was suppose to be released 1989 in the summer & it looks better than a lot of movies from today with these $100 $150 $200 $ 250 million dollar runaway budgets. Directed by Mark Goldblatt he is a big time editor which I don't give enough credit to these editors cause editing can make or break a movie. Stars Dolph Lundgren as Frank Castle The Punisher, Louis Gossett Jr as Jake Berkowitz, Jerone Krabbe as Gianni Franco, Kim Miyori as Lady Tanaka, Brian Rooney as Tommy Franco & Nancy Everhard as Samantha Leary. Story is you have a Crime Boss Dino Moretti who has been found not guilty in being involved in the murder of Frank Castle & his family. The opening is great it pretty much describes crime in The 1980's & the score by Dennis Dreith is excellent. You have The Punisher follow Moretti to his Mansion where he kills his henchies in assortment of ways. I like where he takes a rope while he's in a balcony lowers to the guy below him & strangles him. He stabs Moretti in the back with a knife that has a skull on it so that has to count for something. He blows up his mansion. You have Police going through the rubble & you're introduced to Detective Jake Berkowitz who believes that Frank Castle & The Punisher are the same person. You have another Detective Smantha Leary who wants to help Berkowitz she believes that Frank Castle is The Punisher. If you own this movie then you'll notice that there's a scene that's not in the movie it was cut out cause when Samantha is talking to Berkowitz she tells him that she was The H  o  o  k  er that night cause originally there was a 10 or 15 minute opening with Frank Castle & Berkowitz on a sting operation. It showed stuff like Frank Castle as a Husband & Father. It had Frank Castle giving a notice to appear in Court to Gianni Franco. He had Dino Moretti put a bomb on Castle's car that was meant for him but his wife & daughters were in the car & died in the  explosion. I don't know if LGF has the rights but I would love a special edition that has deleted scenes. I mean Dolph Lundergren did Expendables 1&2 they were hits well the 1st movie anyway. Anyway Gianni Franco has returned to the city to get all The Mob Families organized. Cause The Punisher has really destroyed them. He tries to get all The Crime Families to work together. You have this bum that is an informant for The Punisher tell him that there is a shipment coming into the pier. The Punisher checks it out you have another crime group come into the picture The Yakuza they start knocking off mobsters The Punisher shoots a harpoon through this 1 of the mobsters chest uses it as a zipline. The Punisher takes down mobsters fights some of The Yakuza. 1 of The Yakuza takes off in a van with The Mob's drug shipment The Punisher gets on top of the van takes his knife sticks it right into that Yakuza guys throat. The van goes into the water 1 of The Yakuza throws a knife at The Punisher & he falls into the water & makes them think that he is dead. Meanwhile your introduced to Lady Tanaka she wants to take over The Criminal activities in the city Gianni Franco refuses to let her take over. Lady Tanaka decides to have her men kidnap the children of The Mob Families & put them in Human Traffic rings to bring them to there knees. This was a plot that had a set bigger than The 04 movie or Warzone. The Punisher decides he will let them tear each other apart. Until that informant tells him they have took their kids. You have him go to this run down old theme park he has a shoot out with The Yakuza you have some good fight scenes good coreagraphy Dolph Lundgren being a legit martial artist helps. The Punisher is ganged up & captured he's put on this tourture device that can pull you apart. Lady Tanaka wants to know who sent him & he says Batman. Cause Batman came out the same  year when this was suppose to come. They also have that informant on 1 of those devices. Lady Tanaka has this tourture expert finish the job. The Punisher frees himself he tells this henchy that he has something that he wants to tell them he takes there guns kills them. They put that tourture expert on the machine ask where those kids are at when he is told he leavs the mach9ine on. See that is something The Punisher would do kill a pos with his own machine of tourture. The Punisher steals a bus & there is still a guy on the bus & The Punisher drops  him off at his stop which was kind of funny. He goes to the corordinates finds the kids but this 1 boy Tommy has been taken off & he happens to Gianni Franco's Son. Goo chase scene where he is chased by The Yakuza he rams 1 of the trucks that The Yakuza are in where they hit a pest control truck. Nice old school practical effect. The Punisher runs into a barracde the rest of The Yakuza turn around. The Punisher is arrested. This next scene is really good The Punisher has been doing this for 5 years he is emotionless Detective Berkowitz comes in asks him what do call 127 murders in 5 years. The Punisher: "A work in progress." It is totally something Frank Castle would say. The Punisher is being taken off in a armored truck it's attacked by Franco's men & he needs The Punisher's help to get his Son back. Franco's men also have Detective Berkowitz so he has to help him. They go go to The Yakuza's headquarter's meanwhile Berkowitz wants to go to the bathroom you have this hench man take off the handcuffs Berkowitz asks "Is there an IQ test for this job?" He knocks that guy out then this 1 guy comes he says hey I got the pizza Berkowitz snapps that dude's  neck & walks off with a slice of pizza. I mean it has humor to it but it doesn't become campy like Wazone does. You have The Punisher & Franco go in there mow a bunch of Yakuza down. Fights a couple of ninja's he sticks a spear through 1 guys chest knocks another ninja on a bed of spikes. I mean when people get shot oit's blood squibbs not CGI BS like in PWZ. Punisher has this fight with Lady Tanaka's Daughter he kills her. Then Franco confronts Lady Tanaka & she has his son at knife point She makes Franco put his gun in his mouth. Marvel take notes Lady Tanaka is a perfect blue print for an easily hateable villain. As that is going on Punisher comes in throws a knife into her head. Franco turns on The Punisher he tells him that he has eliminated his compition & now he will be the most powerful crime boss on Earth & that his son will inhert it. They have a scuffle Punisher gets ahold of the gun & kills him. Tommy is mad cause of that Tommy takes the gun & he swears to kill him. Punisher just kneels down says go ahead do it. This is perfect cause it's The Punisher saying I don't care my life was over a long time ago. Tommy breaks down he tells him it's ok. Then he tells him "You're a good boy Tommy grow up to be a good man cause if you don't I'll come looking for you." The shot with Louis Gossett Jr on top of the building yelling Frank is great the ending monolouge by Lundgren is excellent. If I didn't explain the plot very well in my retrospective then I'm sorry. Punisher 89 is a movie with a plot that has a set. Definitly R rated lines that are definitly Frank Castle. Lots & lots of action fast paced only 92 or 93 minutes not very many slow spots. I haven't seen Mark Goldblatt's other work but he did a great job directing. This is my favorite Dolph Lundgren movie. He did  a great job but I still like Thomas Jane more cause of his performance. Louis Gossett Jr is great. Jeron Krabbe played an interesting villain he did a really good job. Kim Miyori out of the villains in the 3 movies she is definitly the best to me. Nancy Everhard did  fine. Brain Rooney did a good job. I mean if you want to see a Punisher movie with The Punisher kicking a  s  s  then I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>I found The Punisher to be a fairly entertaining action movie.  If I can recall correctly John Travolta is only in it at the end of it.  Maybe a little in the front as well, but mainly towards the back end of the film.  There is a lot of action and suspense that keeps you watching it.  I don't know that the script is very original since it seems too many movies are being made with the exact same story, hunting down people for revenge.  Guess that type of topic is good for movie making since it can bring a lot of interest to the viewer.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.<br /><br />The video quality was not the greatest, not the worst.  It was better than First Blood and Total Recall, but not really good for a Blu-Ray.  I give it 6 or 7 out of a 10.0 scale.  The audio was not Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD Master Audio.  You can select "6.1 DTS-ES Discrete Audio" (which is what I selected), or "5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX".  Audio was pretty good (surround sound with sub-woofer bass).</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Given how average lots of comic book movies have been nowadays, I didn't expect to like this one as much as I did. I am not familiar with the Punisher comic books, so I can't compare it to the movie. However, on its own, the movie is actually a pretty good one of revenge and repayment after a man's family is gunned down. Some of the twists are quite entertaining, so I feel confident giving this movie four out of five stars for a worthy effort and decent writing and action.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>First, I'll admit that I have never read a Punisher comic; thus, I had no expectations going in when I saw the movie upon its release.  That is probably why I saw it with an open mind, not have any comic reference to build on.<br /><br />The film stands on its own as a testament to the pitfalls of revenge, on both the "good" guy and the "bad" guy's part.  Thomas Jane plays the federal agent who runs afoul of a villainous John Travolta and both actors jump headfirst into their respective roles.<br /><br />Jane garners sympathy as a man who avenges the death of his entire family, including his wife and son.  He masters an ingenious plot to not only destroy his mortal enemy, John Travolta (the man behind the massacre) but drives a wedge between Travolta and his wife as well as Travolta's "aide-de-camp."<br /><br />The good performances of Jane and Travolta are matched by James Carpinello as Travolta's twin sons, Samantha Mathis as Travolta's wife, and Will Patton as Travolta's number one henchman.  Rebecca Romijn, Ben Foster, and John Pinette are wonderful as three apartment dwellers that form a bond with Jane's "Frank Castle" character.<br /><br />The body count is great as are the graphic measures that Castle takes to "rub out" Travolta's minions.<br /><br />The DVD offers viewers a chance to see an animated beginning, detailing some story elements that were not produced for the original film but gives some necessary plot information.<br /><br />I would probably give the DVD five stars if it had a "how-to" workout regimen that Jane took in order to get as buff as he is in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Punisher 2004 I have to say is a solid movie with Thomas Jane as Frank Castle also John Travolta plays villain. So it starts off with Frank Castle's last day with the FBI agent & a guy guy is accidentally shot & killed it turns out to be John Travolta's character's son so he want the man dealt with but Travolta's characters wife puts a hit on all of them. While on Family reunion Frank & his wife & kid are there EVERYONE is a target & the men think they killed Frank Castle but he's still alive he returns to Tampa for Revenge & basically to end The Mob lead by John Travolta's character. There are a few flaws I though the Thomas Jane's fight with Kevin Nash was cheesy. I wish it could've been set in New York but I can understand why. I have the Blu Ray version & the longer version the longer version adds 17 minutes that do help a little with the plot. It does Tease a sequel but thanks to LGF,  Lexi Alexader & Ray Stevenson they had to go & f**k it up!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>A simple story of an undercover federal agent who kills the son of a drug and casino lord in Florida and is found out by the aforesaid gang-lord. This gangster starts his vengeance and kills dozens of people, including the wife and son of the federal agent, and the federal agent himself. But there is a god for such victims and the federal agent survives. Then he starts his own vengeance and that will mean a complete deserted and uninhabited waste land after his passage. Simple and effective. One of the first executions will be the rotten cop who had delivered his identity to the gang-lord. There is no morality in that, no hope or future, no tomorrow even if the film saves the main character from suicide thanks to some kind of love desire that will probably not be satisfied and if it is who cares. It is well done but definitely superficial as for the psyche of these people, both on the side of federal agents and on the side of gangsters: mechanical killing robots.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Before I begin, let me state that this Blu-Ray is of decent quality; not sharp the entire picture but most the time and good overall.....and a steal at the current price here at $9.99.<br /><br />When I saw this at the theater three or four years ago, I was surprised how good this movie was, not stupid as I figured. Apparently a number of people agreed as a sequel was spawned. In other words, this turned out to be a popular film and subsequent DVD.<br /><br /> It's another one of those based-on-a-comic book hero films that seem to be sprouting up all over the past few years. Some of these guys are pretty dark heroes. This is an example. It was more of a pretty brutal revenge-crime movie. It's a rough movie, pure and simple......not the sweetness of Superman and Lois Lane.<br /><br />Some of the action is ludicrous but the most ridiculous of all - the fight against the huge Russian, is actually the most fun of the action scenes. The rest is just plain mean as the hero's entire family gets wiped out by gunman and "The Punisher" (Thomas Jane) goes after them after almost being killed himself.<br /><br />A smart aspect of this film was inserting a bit of humor in it, such as the two nerds down the hallway who befriend "The Punisher."<br /><br />The sometimes-juvenile but interesting action scenes, the diverse characters in here and the humor all combine to make this much better than anticipated.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>I like this movie because it reminds me a lot of one of my favorite games; Max Payne. Frank Castle is on his last mission, and kills the son of Howard Saint. Howard's wife tells him to kill Frank's family. I love the plot about Frank Castle punishing those who killed his family. It sucked that everyone in Frank's family died. EVERYONE! I love that skull shirt! Frank eventually becomes friends with Dave, Bumpo and Joan and moves in with them. While he's there, he plans his punishment against Howard Saint. There are a lot of awesome action sequences! If you love action, Max Payne, and Marvel comic movies, you'll love THE PUNISHER!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>In this version, Thomas Jane is the punisher. After his family is murdered by a crime boss he goes after the crime bosses family. It wasn't as true to the comic book as I would have liked. Frank Castle seemed to be playing a lot of games with the criminals instead of just killing them when he had the chance. Also, they made the punisher seem kind of weak in spots and not the unstoppable monster that he usually is.<br />I will say that Thomas Jane is a better actor than Dolph Lungren and there was more of a story in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>If you ever thought graphic novel adaptations should have a comic element, think again - the emphasis is definitely on the graphic here.  A compelling group of actors deliver a movie which is ultimately so hardboiled in its revenge story that there are no redeeming moments to make you feel at all uplifted.<br /><br />Frank Castle is an undercover agent who in the course of his duties is indirectly responsible for the killing of the son of the city's ruthless criminal businessman - Howard Saint (John Travolta).  Saint (or more accurately his wife) gets revenge, slaughtering Castle's whole family.  It is at this point you realise two things.  One, that everyone in the movie gets killed several times - Castle for example is left for dead after being beaten up, shot, doused in gasoline, blown up, and presumed drowned.  And two, that things are not going to get any more cheerful from here on in.  Castle survives and becomes `The Punisher', enacting bloody and graphic revenge on everyone connected to Howard Saint.<br /><br />While the plot is not incredibly original, the execution starts out quite satisfying.  Tom Jane fits the role well, and John Travolta does his best to make the villain more than one dimensional.  The always reliable Will Patton puts in a good turn as Travolta's sadistic best friend, hit man and general helper.  Castle's new neighbours are an eclectic bunch whose roles are slightly more than the mere fillers they could have been, headed by Rebecca Romin (best known as Mystique, from X-Men).  The style retains a little of its comic book origins and has more than a few moments of spaghetti-western-style shootouts.  However, as the brutality goes on and on, the weak stomached may grow tired and wish for some redemption along the way.<br /><br />In short, as far from a feel good movie as you can get - if you can stomach bloody action then there is merit hidden in here.  For anyone else, the gore outweighs the style.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>The Punish stars Thomas Jane (61, Deep Blue Sea, Dreamcatcher) as a former agent who's out for revenge. His wife and son were killed by the thug's of a power man (John Travolta) and he was left for dead. Jane makes this movie 100% and is why it's watchable. He can try too hard to look tough and sound tough at times. Still though he pulls off the part well when a lot of comic fans doubted that he could. The movie is dark and violent and basically can be compared to other revenge movies like Mad Max and DarkMan. Hell even how his wife and son die is a rip-off from how Max's wife and son die in Mad Max.<br /><br />  I'd like to see a sequel though because Jane does the part well. Although this wasn't a great movie a sequel has more potential because it can be more than just a revenge movie. With a better a script and Jane in the role a sequel could be great. John Travolta is a good actor but as Saint, it's jut basically a walk on role. Anyone could've played the part. Plus he has been better, he's not terrible but he's just dry in the role and does nothing for it. I think a lesser known actor would've been better for the part. Will Patton (Gone in 60 Seconds) is in better  villain form though as his head henchman. I actually think Rebecca Romijn-Stamos shines as well as a waitress who falls for Jane. She gets called a bad actress a lot but I've seen worse.  Roy Scheider is also good in a small role as the Punisher's father in the opening scenes.<br /><br />  Some of the action in this movie is fun too. I like Jane's big fight with a huge hired hitman named the Russian (WWE's Kevin Nash). Also is a clever scene where  a killer with a guitar sings to him and says I'll sing this song to you at your funeral. Those 2 scenes are what work the most. You've seen better comic book movies with a lighter tone and more humor but fans of the comic should still like what Jane brings to the role.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>"Willing suspension of disbelief" is what you must tell yourself, before and especially during the first 20 mins or so of this movie. This is the dark side of Marvel comics characters, a sort of nasty Doberman they keep out of sight when friends are visiting, but want to have around for less welcome characters. Thomas Jane (probably best remembered as the brooding shark wrangler in Deep Blue Sea) does a pretty good job portraying what is probably one of the most difficult and grounded Marvel hero's (I use the term loosely). He is first and foremost a victim, turned vigilante, bringing restitution to those who have escaped the law. The twisted morality card is played LARGE here, as Travolta heads up a pretty vicious organized crime mob, who murder the entire family of our hero, during a family reunion. A few more sadistic scenes reinforce in the viewer the need for these baddies to die summarily, and horribly where possible, as they have worn out any votes of sympathy with the audience. Overall, it's a very dark, at times extremely violent, but enjoyable drama. Yes, I said drama, and that point is probably the paradoxical weakness of the movie. He's a man, he bleeds, he can die, he has no cape, and he certainly can't fly. However, he can survive severe beatings, bullet wounds, stabbing, fire and explosions, and still bounce back with a grimace, and his own small arms factory (remember what I said about suspension of disbelief). If I had to make a criticism, it would be that paradox - the very shaky walking between two genres, that almost, but not quite comes off. On the one hand, this is an adult themed violent revenge movie with attitude, on the other it's a Marvel character romp complete with unlikely characters, and some very misplaced dialogue. Jane looks the part at least, and spends most of the movie sulking inside a whisky bottle, when he's not killing villians which actually makes you feel for his character more than you would expect. Not too many surprises, but good CGI, good support cast, great stuntwork, and tight script make this 3.5, but not quite 4 stars. DVD has 4 featurettes that are well worth a look, as well as usual deleted scenes, commentary and trailers etc. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Federal agent Frank Castle's (Jane) last mission before retirement goes wrong, and the son of local mob boss Howard Saint (Travolta) is killed.  Saint is not above revenge, and on the advice of his wife, targets Castle's entire family.  The massacre at a family reunion leaves everyone dead, or at least presumed dead.  The sole survivor, of course, is Castle, who embarks on a quest to deliver punishment to Saint and his lackeys.  Yet another movie that is based on a comic book, The Punisher manages to be depressing and horrifying in parts, and humorous in others.  The lighter moments make the heavier ones easier to take and provide some relief.  Thomas Jane, a relatively new face in movies, does an excellent job as a man bent on revenge...make that punishment.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Much better than the 1989 direct to video adaptation which starred Dolph Lundgren in the title role, the Punisher, the latest film adapted from a Marvel comic, succeeds where Hulk and Daredevil failed.  Capturing the feel of the comic (for the most part anyway), this ultra violent actioner finds undercover agent Frank Castle's (Thomas Jane, perfectly cast) retirement and bliss destoryed when his entire family is murdered by money laundering mobster Howard Saint (John Travolta in oily villian mode).  Castle survives, and vows revenge against the people who ruined his life.  Director/co-screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh knows the source material for the most part, with scenes and characters taken directly from classic issues of the comic.  Hardcore fanboys may not be too happy with some differences between the film and the comic (such as the change of scenery from New York to Tampa for one), but the overall film is more than satisfying.  Plus, the epic fight between Frank and the Russian (wrestling star Kevin Nash) is one of the best filmed fights in recent memory.  The great casting is also a highlight, with Will Patton as a sadistic gangster, Mulholland Drive's Laura Harring as Saint's wife, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Frank's neighbor Joan, Samantha Mathis as Frank's wife, and Ben Foster (excellently cast) as Frank's heavily pierced neighbor Spacker Dave.</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>This is suppose to be a comic book movie. It's very far from it.<p>The Punisher has a pretty simple story. Frank Castle(Thomas Jane) is a retired FBI agent. In his last case a ganglords son is gunned down. Howard Saint(John Trovolta) gets revenge by murdering all of saints family members at a family reunion. They kill him or so they think so, and now Castle is back and looking for his revenge.<p>I read The Punisher comic books when I was younger and I must say I was disappointed with the movie. This is suppose to be a comic book movie where the target audience should be between 10 and 20 in ages. They didn't even attempt to make this a PG-13 movie and it bugs me. I know Frank Castle is a very dark character. He's a very mad character and he's a very violent character.<p>The Violence in the movie is incredible. I couldn't believe how far they took things. I was expecting violence and the comic books were violent, but never to this extent. You never saw people get shot up like this. You never saw anybody get tourted like they do in this. When they rip the guys piercing out of his face I cringed. I never cringe in movies, but this was like watching Scarface. Everybody is sadistic. There's boiling water flying on people and it's a very violent film and in the top five that I've ever scene. The movie didn't need to be that violent though.<p>In the comics Frank Castle never did the things he did in this movie. He didn't do the sadistic planning like he does in the movie. In this film he's planning his revenge like Dumas has Dantes do in The Count of Monte Cristo. Castle was never that sadistic in the comic.<p>The language was also pretty bad and there is some brief nudity. They made no attempt to make it a PG-13 movie. This is the biggest problem I had with the film, because like I said this is a film geared towards teenagers.<p>Thomas Jane was good as Frank Castle. It was a grea piece of casting and he played the part perfect. He looked exactly like the man from the comic and he played it to perfection. The script could have been better but I liked him a lot.<p>This is a very violent film that didn't hold true to its roots. At times it was a very comic book movie. Most of the movie was like watching Scarface though. This is a very violent film and it's definetly not for kids. It's really a four star movie, but because of all the violence I have to give it 2. A lot of it wasn't neccesary and I'm really quite disappointed in Marvel and Lions Gate. At least we have Spiderman 2 to look forward to.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>I found myself riveted by this movie.  It felt more like the comics I read as a kid than any of the other Marvel outings of late, and had an array of villains who deserved the Punisher treatment.  The cast of characters in the movie range from bland to downright fun, the best of whom are three people who share the Punisher's tenement--to lovable losers and a gorgeous waitress with sensitive eyes.  John Travolta is decent as the lead villain, but sadly underperforms.<p>I must warn you that Punisher has some disturbingly violent events, including a man who has various piercings ripped from his face with a pair of pliers.  No, they don't show it!  But it's unsettling, obviously, as these are sadistic villains that go way beyond anything in the movies based on Spiderman, the X-Men, Batman, or Superman.  In addition, the Punisher himself becomes almost indistiguishable from the bad guys in his violence and sadism.<p>In the end, The Punisher is more of a ride than a movie.  I enjoyed it, but that's probably because I've become completely deadened to brutality and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I also have this movie both standard and now the blu-ray version I'm sure most people know about the storyline of this movie if not read the Amazon info about it an that is the jist of what the movie is about.  I just want to say to people that if you already have the standard dvd version thats all you're going to need.  The video and sound quality are not much better than what you got with the standard dvd since this is one of the earlier blu-rays to come out and they haven't fully mastered the video and audio yet you won't see any clearer or sharper details or better sound quality with this blu-ray version.  So again if you have the standard dvd Punisher just keep that one and wait until they come out with a remastered blu-ray version or just pass this one up..</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>In the world of super-heroes and evil villains, the Punisher rests squarely in that gray area between the two.  He does exhibit a sense of justice akin to that of a hero, but he bears no remorse with regards to killing, as his wraith is only suffered by those who truly deserve, those who the law cannot, or will not touch.  Revenge, justice, and retribution are his motivations, and he is judge, jury, and executioner.  The Punisher (2004), directed and co-written by Jonathan Hensleigh, who also wrote Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and Jumanji (1995), stars Thomas Jane, who bears a remarkable resemblance to actor Christopher (Highlander) Lambert, and who I've seen before, but couldn't place until I remembered him from the film Deep Blue Sea (1999), and John Travolta.  Also appearing are Laura Herring, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (does she still carry the Stamos since their divorce?) and Roy Scheider.<br /><br />The film, based on a Marvel comic book of the same name, tells the story of FBI agent Frank Castle (Jane), an FBI agent, who, during a sting operation that results in the death of a suspect, finds himself at odds with a powerful crime family, lead by Howard Saint (Travolta), as, it turns out, the dead suspect was his son.  In retaliation for his son's death, Saint orders a hit on Castle and his entire family, but Castle manages to survive, and, seeing that nothing has been done to apprehend those responsible for the deaths of his family, he decides to take the law into his own hands (something Doug Llewelyn from The People's Court always advised against) and bring his own form of justice to those who sought revenge against him.  Do two wrongs make a right?  No, but they sure make for a fun movie...<br /><br />This actually wasn't the first screen adaptation of this comic character.  There was a film, of the same name, released way back in 1989, which starred Dolph Lundgren, which was panned by both critics and fans.  It wasn't that great, but I did enjoy it somewhat, and didn't think it was as bad as everyone thought.  This latest incarnation is certainly better, benefiting from a larger budget, better writing, and a bit more star power, but still has minor flaws.  I'd read many a comic book back in my youth, and The Punisher was one of them.  At that time, he probably had three of four different titles, being a very popular character, and Marvel Comics had a real penchant for milking any bit of popularity for all they could, often exhausting the potential way too soon in their search for the almighty dollar.  I haven't read comics in a long time, and given the nature of comic characters and their constant evolution, I was unsure how the story would be played out.  I was unfamiliar with Thomas Jane, but I thought he did a wonderful job, really embodying the essence of the character I knew well way back when.  The look, the feel, the attitudes, marked a vast improvement over the last film incarnation of the character.  I was a bit apprehensive about John Travolta being cast as the lead bad guy, as of late, when playing similar antagonistic roles, he often ventured into the realm of hamminess, but his performance was really grounded here and lacked the over the top element inherent in some of his past roles, thankfully.  The action elements in the film were done very well, bordering between the realistic and unbelievable nicely, and I really enjoyed the use of all different kinds of weaponry from hand guns, machine guns, anti-personnel mines, knives, to the bow and arrow.  Jane's character showed adeptness and a proficiency one would expect.  Some elements and scenes seemed a bit off...the plot point where Castle basically lets everyone know he didn't die in the massacre seemed illogical, as I would think the advantage of your enemies thinking you were dead would far outweigh whatever could be gained by them knowing you're alive, especially if you were planning to go after them.  Also, the complete lack of any police involvement, even after Castle began his war on Howard Saint and his organization seemed unrealistic.  And I would have expected Castle to find a secluded place to hole up, one where he could come and go as he pleased, and not a run-down apartment building with a few neighbors, including the character played by Romjin-Stamos.  The purpose was to sort of create a surrogate family for Castle, but it just seemed strange that he would choose the location he did from which to wage his war.  Finally, I have to mention the scene with the Russian assassin played by pro-wrestler Kevin Nash.  I thought the fight scene was very exciting and fun to watch, but why did the Russian show up in a red and white striped shirt, looking like a huge, lumpy candy cane?  It really disrupted the dark and gritty feel built up in the movie, as he reminded me of a lacky henchman from the 60's Batman television series.  All in all, I thought most of the movie worked well, with a few plot areas that didn't, but the positive points out-weighed the negatives, in my opinion, and I enjoyed the movie as a whole, right up until it's satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The widescreen print here looks beautiful, and there's a good helping of useful and informative special features including featurettes on the stunts within the film, origins of the The Punisher character from his first appearance in a Spider-Man comic back in the 70's, a behind the scenes look at the making of the film, an interview influential cover artist for The Punisher comic book, a music video for a song within the film by the group Drowning Pool, a trailer for The Punisher video game (but not a trailer for the film itself?!), a commentary track by the director, two deleted scenes and a mini-comic.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>This cinematic version of "The  Punisher" is based on Marvel Comics' most recent incarnation of the vigilante anti-hero, as written by Garth Ennis in the "Welcome Back Frank" series. Although his ability to survive the most violent circumstances is extraordinary, the character has largely been removed from the world of superheroes. He's human and imperfect. The Punisher's backstory has been changed for the film to better integrate it with the narrative. A backstory that is not directly related to the present could never be successful in a film. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an undercover FBI agent looking forward to the time with his family that his imminent retirement will allow. Those plans come to a horrific end when organized crime boss Howard Saint (John Travolta), whose son was killed in a gun running bust, takes revenge on Castle's family. Devastated, angry, and with nothing left to lose, Castle sets out to return the favor by destroying Saint and his criminal empire.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is filmed in a dark, gritty style that seems to have been inspired by the work of cover artist Tim Bradstreet and the cin&eacute;ma verit&eacute; of the 1970s. The lead-in that describes how Frank Castle becomes The Punisher is lengthy, but that's to be expected in the first film of a potential franchise. The violence is pretty graphic in places and probably not for the weak of stomach. For an "action film", "The Punisher" isn't especially active. The action is intermittent, builds as the film progresses, and tends to avoid grand gestures. Perhaps that's appropriate, as the violence is of a personal nature. The cast is consistently interesting. Thomas Jane does a solid job as The Punisher, a shattered man who never claims any moral high ground. John Travolta is particularly entertaining as the ruthless, petulant crime boss Howard Saint. Travolta gives a palpably restrained performance, playing Saint just slightly over-the-top and imbalanced to great effect. Will Patton is also notable as Howard Saint's sociopathic right-hand man, Quentin Glass. And Rebecca Romijn-Stamos has a supporting role as one of Frank Castle's dysfunctional neighbors, who provide a little comic relief. An interesting piece of cast trivia: Howard Saint's sons, Bobby and John, are played by the same actor, James Carpinello, and originally were intended to be twin brothers. When Carpinello was in make-up and costume, he looked so dissimilar as the brothers that director Jonathan Hensleigh decided that they shouldn't be twins.<br /><br />The most striking aspect of this film isn't at all evident: It was made for a paltry $30 million -unheard of for an action film. That it looks like it cost twice that much is a credit to the director, cinematographer, and art director. Also notable is that none of the film's stunts are CGI. They look real, and they are. "The Punisher" is entertaining and visually interesting. My only complaint about the film is its pace, which is brooding and too even for an action film. That makes the film seem longer than it is.<br /><br />The DVD: This is a nicely loaded disc. Bonus features include 4 featurettes, 2 deleted scenes with director's commentary, a music video for "Step Up" by Drowning Pool, a trailer for "The Punisher" video game, and an audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh. The first featurette, "Keepin' it Real" (25 minutes) is about the film's stunts. This documentary discusses the processes of designing and filming the stunts, through interviews with stunt coordinator Gary Hymes and director Jonathan Hensleigh, among others. It might have been better organized and more informative if the documentary had taken us through a few stunts in detail instead of giving an overview. The second featurette, "War Journal" (30 minutes) is a broad making-of documentary that takes us through pre-production, production, editing and scoring in post-production, and winds up at the film's premiere. This is a well-organized, comprehensive documentary that includes interviews with line producer John Stark and director Jonathan Hensleigh, in which he talks about the challenges of making an action film on a $30 million budget and shooting in only 50 days. The third featurette, "Army of One" (12 minutes) is about "The Punisher"'s comic book origins. The genesis and evolution of the character in Marvel Comics are discussed in interviews with Gerry Conway, who created "The Punisher" as a Spider-Man villain in 1972, Stephen Grant, who wrote the character from 1986-1994, current writer Garth Ennis, Marvel art director John Romita, and cover artist Tim Bradstreet, as well as Marvel CEO Avi Arad and Vice President Ari Avad. This documentary is very helpful to those of us who don't read comic books in explaining the character's origins. The last featurette, "Drawing Blood Bradstreet Style" (5 minutes) focuses on cover artist Tim Bradstreet, who also designed the film's theatrical posters and heavily influenced the movie's visual style. The film's audio commentary by director Jonathan Hensleigh is very good. He speaks clearly and doesn't meander when explaining the decisions he made concerning story, style, characters and cinematography. His comments are particularly interesting, because "The Punisher" is an admirable example of efficient, economical filmmaking. Subtitles are available for the film in Spanish and English.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R3O02O0PON4.html">A29R3O02O0PON4</a><br/><p>Well, as you may have read elsewhere here in these reviews, this Extended Cut adds back in a subplot that was totally absent from the Theatrical Cut.  Starting with the newly filmed (yes, newly filmed) animated intro that has Frank and his buddy Weeks back in Kuwait City in '91 being ambushed by Iraqi Nationalist terrorists.  The animated sequence was actually, well I guess "shot" against greenscreen.  The actors acted their parts (in full costume dress) while a still photographer took shots of them, and then uploaded the pics into a computer to convert them to  black and white images using software.  Like a previous reviewer said, it's ashame that this sequence wasn't shot for real.  However I can see why it wasn't as it'd would've taken quite a bit of budget to build the set for just 4 or 5 minutes worth of footage.  Of course, going on location could have cheapened it, but who knows...<br /><br />Anyway, on to the real film.  Well, as it turns out that his buddy Weeks apparently falls into some major gambling debt from Saint's Cuban buddy's Casino.  And to prevent Saint and his gang from killing Weeks, Weeks gives up Frank's identity from the arms deal gone bad that killed one of Saint's sons.<br /><br />So then, the restored footage deals with this subplot of Weeks and Frank and how Frank discovers that Weeks was the mole and how he deals with him in the end.  Does this extra footage make the movie any better?  Well, that's subjective.  I thought it did, because it helps explain some of the turmoil behind Frank's rebirth as the Punisher.  It's not on the level of the Daredevil Director's Cut as someone else mentioned, but it does add a bit of drama to the over-all story.<br /><br />For those wishing for more Punisher-style take-downs, you're not gonna get it here with this Extended Cut.  But if you're a completist and a Punisher fan, pick this up for this relatively low price.  Amazon doesn't have the lowest price, so shop around.<br /><br />All I can say is that I hope that Punisher 2 fulfills some of what was lacking with this original film.  I hear that the setting is gonna move to New York City from Miami for the sequel, so that should sit a little better with some fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Not being reader of comic books and not having noticed that this film was base on a Marvel Comic hero, I watched this movie as though it were another Action/Special Effects/Fire and Explosions escape film. It was only about a half hour into this rather violent picture that it became apparent that the characters were just too off the wall NOT to be comic book creations. Now Tom (aka Thomas) Jane is a worthy actor to portray such heroes: he certainly is buff and the camera concentrates more on his rather magnificent shirtless torso than on the story (a good choice in this case). John Travolta continues his survey of just plain evil guys, and the good guys equal the bad guys as far as character portrayal. The concept of Revenge (read Punishment) is developed a bit slowly because of Jane's character diversion of becoming an alcohol and hiding in a rooming house with some pretty absurd characters. But given the genre of comic book stories, this one stands up pretty well. It is so obvious that there will be more sequels (if this film makes any money on the world market) unless this singular effort becomes 'toast' like about every character in this LaLa Land movie. Yet, cheers for Jane and Travolta!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Punisher" is a little bit better than "Daredevil" because it looks better than some people think it is. It has a smaller production budget than "Daredevil", $33 Million compared to Daredevil's $78 Million production budget. This movie is great from beginning to end. Thomas Jane's performance as Frank Castle / The Punisher was better than Dolph Lundgren and proves you don't need a big guy to be The Punisher, he did a great job. John Travolta's performance as the villain, Howard Saint, was great, too, and made a great villain against Thomas Jane's The Punisher. Putting both Thomas Jane and John Travolta together in this movie was a great idea. Their characters are great and they both are an essential part of the movie. Will Patton's performance as Quentin Glass was great, too, it wasn't over the top. The rest of the cast did a great job. Jonathan Hensleigh, who also wrote "Armageddon", "The Saint", "Jumanji", "Die Hard With A Venegance", & "A Far Off Place", co-wrote the screenplay & story with Michael France and makes his directorial debut in this well made action film, He did a great job. The screenplay & story was great. The music by Carlo Siliotto was excellent. The cinematography by Conrad W. Hall was excellent. The film editing by Steven Kemper was great. The production design by Michael Z. Hanan and costume design by Lisa Tomczeszyn was great. The casting by Pam Dixon was great. The art direction by John Dexter, John Hansen, Steve Saklad was great. The set decoration by Casey Hallenbeck was great. Go see this movie if you want to, before or after "Kill Bill Volume 2". They both have the same theme: Revenge. The soundtrack, not the score, is excellent. Get the soundtrack if you want to. This movie is a good competitor to "Kill Bill Volume 2".</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>A strange take on the Marvel comic of the same name.  Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) in the comics is at a picnic when his family overhears some gangland stuff going on and promptly get murdered.  Perhaps a wife, a few kids.<br /><br />The film thinks bigger.  We have Castle retiring.  Just before he does, he gets involved in a sting where the son of a gangster (John Travolta) gets himself killed.  Travolta's character does some research and finds that Castle was the disguised sting operator.  The wife insists that Castle's entire family gets wasted.  That's the entire two clans of the family reunion in Puerto Rico.<br /><br />About 30 people are killed.  A bit overkill, huh?<br /><br />Thomas Jane plays the role in a bit of a subdued tone rather than an angry vengeful tone.  And in some scenes this works.  The Punisher, just like in Elektra, does not do well in hand to hand combat.  He gets punched, beat, and is wiped along the floor and smashed into concrete floors and walls.  He beats The Russian by throwing hot soup in his face.<br /><br />OK, now I'm scared.<br /><br />The film tries to be lighthearted with the family he lives nearby as neighbors.  They look at Frank as family.  The slapstick became a bit much.  And if some guy is pulling your lip rings out with a pair of pliers, you really are not going to say anything about the whereabouts of Castle?  And the little fat friend who sits with a smarmy grin on his face does not make a move or say a word as the kid gets his rings pulled out.  Geesh....<br /><br />Some slapstick as well, comes off fake.<br /><br />Strange -- why does it take so long for the gang to know where Frank lives?  His face was on every TV set in the city and people would point and say, "Hey, I know you!"  Yet half the film is over before they decide to go to his apartment.<br /><br />The Punisher does punish --especially towards the end of the film where we see he's pretty good setting up booby traps and creating false evidence, tricking Travolta's character into killing his own associates and wife.  Clever.<br /><br />Blowing up every single car in a parking lot was, again, overkill.  I mean, really.  Travolta does not do "bad guy" so well.  Similar to his portrayal in "Broken Arrow", I just don't see him as evil.  Saturday Night Fever was not happening here!<br /><br />I don't want to list every fallacy in this film.  I will say some parts were fairly gruesome and sad, the pyrotechnics were loud and unnecessary and the acting was hampered by a script that didn't know where it wanted to go.<br /><br />And, no Stan Lee walk-on!<br /><br />Recommended for die-hard fans who want to see a movie loosely based on the Punisher comics series.  On par with Catwoman.  No, really!</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ.html">A15Q7ABIU9O9YZ</a><br/><p>This is kind of a novelty, the adaption from a comic. I believe everyone is startled to see how X-Men, Hulk and Spidey took off. And I imagine that Hollywood will eventually keep up this new genre. If you call it that.<br /><br />Punisher, Frank Castle, is more brooding and certainly darker than most Marvel creations. He sets out to right the wrongs against his family, and of course he is not seeking justice. Rather revenge. And darn well, too.<br /><br />I did not mind the sociopathic John Travolta as Howard Saint, the syndicate boss. Barbarino brings a game oh these many years later, and his bad guys, as in Broken Arrow and Face Off come to mind, are pretty bad. And pretty believable.<br /><br />The 'revenge before justice' concept can work well . . . and it can implode. The 'Brotherhood of the Bell,' for example, years earlier, was a bomb. Vin Diesel's 'A Man Apart' got bombed, but it really shouldn't have. Conceptually it was pretty good.<br /><br />What I liked about the Vin Diesel role was less quips. What I disliked about the Tom Jane role was the presence of more humor than a man who has had his entire bloodline erradicated is entitled to have. It seems pandering, a directorial attempt to appeal to all possible emotional demographic groups. Unnecessary.<br /><br />Jane does look a little like Christopher Lambert but I think that's in the eyes. The man is well buffed.<br /><br />All in all, good acting; good photography. I hope we see more of Frank Castle and Tom Jane. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>In spite of the fact that 'The Punisher' is based on Marvel Comic character, it is nothing like 'Spider-man.'  The hero of 'The Punisher' is no superhero; he has no superpower to rely on during the fighting, and it is his dark background that distingushed him from others.<br /><br />The hero is Frank Castle. an FBI man who wants to retire.  Because of one botched job, however, a son of shady Florida businessman got killed, and his father (John Travolta) and his wife (Laura Harring) vow revenge.  Actually, it is the wife who orders that Frank and his family should be all murdered (and convieniently, they are having a home party.  Don't complain, for the director Jonathan Hensleigh is the writer of 'Die Hard 3'and 'Armageddon').<br /><br />So, Frank, the sole survivor of the carnage, starts to his own vendetta while he gradually comes to know the timid neighbors in his apartment (as is shown in the original comics).  While secretly making his own plans for revenge (and very unusual ones), Frank is attacked by many curious killers; one guy from Memphis plays guitar before his job, and the unique fight with 'The Russian' is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />'The Punisher' often suggests violence, but refuses to show it on the screen, so the results might not be satisfactory to some viewers, being too tame, or too nasty.  But the action sequences, which include more bone-crunching sort of fihting than other Marvel comic films, are effectively shot, and Thomas Jane (credited as Tom Jane) has the convincing presence as the anti-hero, partly thanks to his pumped-up torso.<br /><br />As to Travola, he is not as irritating as in 'Swordfish' -- he is not that bad, but still I think he lacks the charisma he had shown in 'Vincent' of 'Pulp Fiction.'  And though Will Patton steals the scene as the assistant of Travolta, the guests are not particularly great, including Roy Scheider, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.  And it is painful to see Samantha Mathis doing a very thankless job clearly for paycheck -- she was so good in the early 90s, and what is she doing here?<br /><br />'The Punisher' is just another standard Hollywood action film with no new thing to add to the genre.  Good for killing time, like watching 'Con Air' or the like.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>'The Punisher' tells the gritty tale of an FBI officer that loses everything he cared for just as he was leaving the FBI behind.  Frank Castle, played by Thomas Jane, finishes off one last undercover job that inadvertently leads to the death of the son of Howard Saint, played by John Travolta, a crime boss.  Seeking retribution, Saint, and his wife, order the killing of Castle and his family.  Saint's henchmen only complete half the job, and leave Castle for dead.  However, Castle insists he died that day, and the Punisher was born to avenge Castle.<br /><br />This movie has some incredibly good elements, and some elements that are not so good.  It recreates elements of the comic fairly well and it stays within the spirit of the comic admirably.  Some things are changed for the sake of story telling.  In the end, the movie is pretty good, but it could have been a lot better.<br /><br />The best part of the movie in my opinion was Jane's portrayal of Castle/the Punisher.  I was skeptical when I heard he had been chosen.  However, his portrayal of a man that has nothing to lose and little to live for was quite good.  His size and build were appropriate for the role.  His age and physique are not exactly the same as that portrayed by the character in the comic, and die hards may have a gripe there.  Still, as the character was laid out in the movie, Jane was a great choice.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of the movie was how the director chose to use Travolta in the role of Howard Saint.  Not all of this was the director's fault, as Saint wasn't given that many great lines.  Travolta  has the ability to give characters an edge or to deliver a great line.  That simply didn't exist in this movie.  The character of Saint really had one good scene in which he confronts a henchmen over a possible affair with his wife while telling the story of David Bowie and the Bowie knife.  After that, this villain was just flat.<br /><br />My other gripe with the movie was the action.  Much of it was uninspired.  For instance, in one scene, Saint sends a Russian after Castle.  This Russian is huge and built like a tank.  The fight that ensues in Castle's apartment has a few comedic moments, but otherwise, it just lumbers along.  There is nothing impressive about it from the way it was filmed to the coreography of the fight itself.  This also speaks to much of the direction of the film itself.  Many of the shots were unimaginative.  A veteran director could have done much more with the locations that were chosen for this film.<br /><br />A few of the things I did enjoy included Castle's overall scheme for revenge.  He sets out to turn all the villains against each other.  When he finally confronts Saint in the end, the Punisher fully emerges and lays out what he has done in a dead pan that is perfect for the character.  I also liked the way the Punisher was kept simple.  He didn't have too many gimicks.<br /><br />I liked the movie.  It was much better than the Dulph Lundgren version that preceded it.  Fans of the comic book are likely to be split on how they felt about the movie.  Those that aren't familiar with the comic are likely to not enjoy this movie.  I'd recommend this as a rental.  I hope they do film a sequel and turn it over to a director and producer that can spice it up just a little so that the sequel won't lumber as much as the original did.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>Watched this movie Saturday. I really really liked it. Of course the first 30 minutes or so was a little slow and all, but they had to show you why he becomes the punisher. I love how they made the Punisher the sorta Punisher he is in his newer comics (newer as in the last 2 years or so). Him living in his apartment building was very cool to me and seeing the guy with all the piercings was also very cool since both are in the comics. And the Russian is too. So when they said, "Send in The Russian.", I started saying HECK YEAH!!! Cause he is INSANE in the comics. Just about everything the Punisher does to him, he just takes it like a toddler was hitting him. He talks a little though in the comics and it's funny as hell and I sorta wish they made him talk a little in the movie... but I think Keving Nash probably wouldn't have a good russian accent. He also wore the red and white striped shirt too. So I think they did us comic book fans justice with that stuff. Another thing that did us fans justice were the ways people died. Some of them were just crazy. My friend was saying things like..that was kinda cool, but there is no way that would happen. I then would say, yeah, but thats the kinda ways he kills people in the comics. The writers/drawers think of some INSANE ways to kill people and make you laugh with it.<br /><br />As for a regular movie not revolved around a comic, I would give this movie a 3/5. It was sorta slow in the beginning trying to get you to feel for his family and feel the love he has for his family. Some of the action scenes were a little over the top. Travolta is a GENIOUS at playing a bad guy. He's got that cold killer look when he wants it. Tom Jane I think did a great Punisher. He has the build and what seems like, the right voice.<br /><br />As for a movie based on a comic, I'm gonna have to give this a 4.5/5. It had a lot of good cameos from people we've seen in the comics. It had some really messed up/funny deaths. It shows that the Punisher is actually human cause he gets his butt BEAT. I really liked it and thought it did the Punisher justice.<br /><br />If there is going to be a part 2, I bet it will be much better than part 1, since we dont have to go through and figure out why he becomes the Punisher.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I am not sure how ambivalent I am about this 2004 version of "The Punisher," but I found myself repeatedly thinking that the movie was taking two steps backwards for every step forward, so that by the end we were not ahead of the game. The original origin of the Punisher was that Frank Castle was out on a picnic with his family when they stumbled upon a mob hit and were gunned down. Frank survived, became the Punisher, and dedicated his life to making sure that those who avoid justice through the imperfections of the American legal system were made to pay for their crimes. This is a tradition that goes back to Batman and the Shadow, with the key difference that the Punisher has a lot of heavy weaponry. There are lots of comic book superheroes who have to deal with the onerous of being considered a vigilante, but the Punisher embraced the idea without ever worrying about being considered a hero.<br /><br />This time around Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) has much more of a hand in his tragic fate. He is an F.B.I. agent and the Fates conspire than on his last undercover job he kills one of the sons of gangster Howard Saint (John Travolta). Frank heads off to retirement and a family reunion in Puerto Rico while Saint orders his thugs to kill him. But then his wife (Laura Harring) ups the antes and tells them to kill his entire family. So that is what happens, as everyone of his relatives is gunned down in a prolonged massacre before his wife and son are dispatched in a poor imitation of the harrowing scene where the same thing happens to Mel Gibson in "Mad Max." Frank is shot point blank in the chest and just about set on fire, but none of this matters because he is going to come back from the "dead" and kill all of these people. That is what this movie is about.<br /><br />But the idea that you have this one guy who everybody thinks is dead come back and wipe out an entire criminal organization starts losing momentum when Frank blows the surprise element of being dead pretty quick. Meanwhile, not once but twice a single person just about takes him out and ends the movie before the final act. I always thought the Punisher's weak spot was that he was psychotic, not that he was relatively easy to surprise or beat up. He does come up with a nice little plan to stick it to Saint, but it is the sort of thing where you the realization of what has happened to sink into the guy before you put a couple of bullet holes in him and not afterwards. I also think that if you spend all your spare time turning a car into an armored tank that it should be good for more than one scene.<br /><br />The character who actually impressed me the most, surprisingly enough, was Spacker Dave (Ben Foster). He has one of the apartments in the dilapidated building Castle moves into to plan his punishment. Dave sticks his nose into the business of an abusive boyfriend pounding on the door of the lovely Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and is rescued by Castle, something nobody has ever done. So when Saint's right-hand man Quentin Glass (Will Patton) shows up looking for Castle and tortures Dave, using his various piercings against him, the guy does not break down and rat out Frank. It was an unexpected moment and has to do with the idea of Castle's new family (everybody in the building knows who Frank is and what he is doing), but still it had more gravity than anything else in the film.<br /><br />Jane worked himself in an appropriate state of buffness for this role, but is constrained by the script to mostly giving intense stares and making laconic comments in the Clint Eastwood tradition, while Travolta actually shows some restraint in mouthing his character's over the top lines. I missed the Dolph Lundgren in the 1989 film version adapted from the Marvel comics character, but my life has been full none the less and I suppose I should go check it out and see which of these two versions comes closest to capturing the essence of the comic book I remember, because based on what I saw in this film the title is still up for grabs.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>I am one of those who has never read the comics, but I do enjoy the comic book movies.  The Punisher is not as flawless as Spiderman, Batman Begins and the XMen films, but it does hold up much more than Fantastic Four, Daredevil and Hulk.  The film could have been darker to fully capture the essence of punishment, but this is still a fun and emotion-filled ride.<br /><br />The most shocking thing about the Punisher is the way that Frank Castle's family is murdered.  It's not just his wife and son, but everyone from both sides of the family, in broad daylight, at a reunion near the beach of beautiful Puerto Rico.  Something about that scene was so dark, because it was filmed in such broad light.  As an undercover officer, Castle got a young man murdered, and that young man was the son of Howard Saint, a big name you apparently don't mess with in Tampa.  It was the wife however - Mrs. Saint - that ordered the execution of Castle and his family.  Revenge had been served.  However, it was punishment that Castle had yet to release.<br /><br />I thought the characters in this film were wonderful.  John Travolta does a great job as the villain Howard Saint.  He does nothing more than order his henchmen around to do the dirty work, but his acting and emotions involved with the part are nearly flawless.  His other son, acts like a sort of henchman for his father.  Probably not even in his 20's, this young man is still tall and built, and carries the look of intimidation.  Probably nothing more than just a kid inside, he still comes off as a cool henchman.  Then there is the Russian.  He is called to deal with Castle in one scene, and its both a great fight of action and amusement.  A famous opera tune (I forget the name of) is playing in Castle's neighbor's room during the fight, adding a little humor to the mix.  But the Russian's extreme size dwarfs Castle, and keeps the action scene hard.<br /><br />Though it could have been darker, there is a bit of strong violence throughout the film, along with some hard hitting fights and blood.  It doesn't go as far as gore, but you do get to see several scenes of knives being shoved into bodies, and perhaps one of the most outrageous in the film, a torture scene of piercings being ripped off of one's face (though the camera does pull away).  Castle finally unleashes his revenge, ahem, punishment, in the end, though I thought it could been done with a much bigger bang.  It is nice though, to see how his intelligence allows Saint to do most of the damage to himself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid movie.  True fans will surely find something missing or different than what the comic book verison may contain.  My philosophy is if you haven't started reading them, don't, that way you can enjoy the movie for what it is.  And seriously, this entertains very well.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I went into this movie with very low expectations. I'm not a fan of the Punisher comics like I am with Batman, X-Men or Spiderman. The Punisher just didn't interest me as a "hero." So I didn't know anything about his background until I watched this movie. It was actually a really good action movie! The acting was often cheesy and the plot was unbelievable but that's usually the formula of an action movie. Take it for what it is. And I had a great time with this film. It's made me more interested in The Punisher and I'll probably pick up an issue of the comic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>Revenge is the order of business as Thomas Jane emerges as the Punisher.<br /><br />Gangland businessman John Travolta orders a hit on retired FBI agent Pane and a large number of his family; payback for an FBI shooting incident that took the life of Travolta's son.

The plot as outlined many times before is that special forces guy Frank Castle kills a gangsters son in his last mission and the Gangster (John Travolta) attempts to kill all of Castles family as well as him in revenge. Castle survives and seeks his own revenge.<br /><br />Its reasonable well done, and certainly entertaining. I was particularly fond of Castles relationship with his oddball neighbours and the loyalty that they both show to each other in the end. However in my view it was let down by a slightly wooden performance from Thomas Jane in the leading role. I never really believed in him... I could imagine this role being done very well by Hugh Jackman. Naturally John Travolta is good in his role.<br /><br />Look out for Kevin Nash, an ex professional wrestler as "The Russian" who is almost a foot taller then The Punisher!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Unfairly maligned by critics, The Punisher offers a appealingly retro vigilante movie that slides nicely up against the Mad Max movies, (which it strongly resembles) albeit without the flair of Miller's trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>One of the most violent characters seen in comics came to life in 1989 and was blown off of the screen. The reasons were obvious. It was a film made for comic fans that completely left out everything that had made the character so popular with those same comic fans. The film quickly became the movie comic fans referred to when they discussed movies that didn't come close to doing their source justice.<br /><br />All that is forgiven with the release of the new version. Bypassing just a tad of the source material this time, we are given the story of Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), ex Special Forces soldier and undercover FBI agent who has just retired. His last assignment led to the death of a criminal purchasing illegal guns. The problem is that this same criminal's father, Howard Saint (John Travolta), is a powerful money launderer for a Cuban cartel. And he wants revenge for the death of his youngest son.<br /><br />At a family reunion in Puerto Rico, Castle's entire family is murdered by Saint's men. Everyone from his father and mother to his wife and child. Castle is also left for dead, shot three times. But with the help of a friend, he survives with one thing on his mind. Revenge.<br /><br />Moving to Tampa where Saint is centered, Castle begins disturbing Saint's operations. Everything from stealing the money he was to launder to having Saint's men dump it from the high rise where they are counting it. Each act angers Saint more until he finally sends out for assistance from professionals. Each of these is greeted with Castle's ultra violent and passion filled hatred. All that is until Frank finds his way to Saint himself.<br /><br />Along the way Castle makes a few friends of the neighbors in his low level apartment: a cooking expert (John Pinnette), a computer geek (Ben Foster) and a lovely waitress with boyfriend problems (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). These become his surrogate family.<br /><br />The movie sets up what could become a series not only by giving us the background story of Frank Castle, The Punisher, but by showing a human side to him as well. In the comic's early days, the character was little less than an assassin (thinking back to his original appearance in Spider Man). But the grief that led to his decision to take on organized crime, the pain he endured at the loss of his family, all are given as much attention here as the non-stop action and violence.<br /><br />While at first many were concerned with the selection of Jane to portray this sacred comic character, he turns in a great performance and the appearance as well. The comics offered a dark haired, dark complected, tall, foreboding, stern faced killer. Bigger and darker actors were thought to be better for the part, since Jane had been seen as blonde in most everything previous. But they not only make him look the part, he absorbs it as well.<br /><br />Travolta is here but it feels like he has far too little screen time. What he does when on screen is fantastic, offering us a maniacal money mover with power to spare and anger as huge.<br /><br />The movie may not be one that younger viewers can handle, but fans of the comic and those not yet exposed will love it. Forget the comic and you still have a great movie that delivers everything that trailer led us to believe we would see. Watching THE PUNISHER is no punishment. It just leaves you waiting to see the next installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The punisher is by far one of the most potent, powerful and hard to die thrillers in years.<br /><br />Because far beyond of its well known plot about a personal revenge, the movie is really a visual tour de force, and represented for Travolta one of his major achievements.<br /><br />Absolutely a must-see</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>FBI agent Frank Castle is the lead agent in breaking up a sale of guns.

I wasn't expecting much from The Punisher but thoroughly enjoyed it. Thomas Jane does a nice job in the lead role as does John Travolta as the mob boss. When Castle comes back he takes an apartment in a run down building on the outskirts of town where his neighbors are two oddballs and a beautiful, but damaged woman. I was glad to see Castle did not get involved with the woman only because it would have been too much of a Hollywood cliche, and I liked the moments of humor the two oddballs added. In a movie, this dark and violent it helped to have some light moments every now and then.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>As far as superhero movies go, `The Punisher' serves up a very exciting and entertaining ride.  I've never read The Punisher comic books but I remember when the film was released I was excited to see it, it looked gritty and dark and violent and that's what I wanted to see.  Well, that's what I got.  The acting is very comic book dramatic, especially on the parts of John Travolta and Thomas Jane, but there are a few actors here that transcend that and pull off fine performances, those including Rebecca Romijn (I know it floored me too), Ben Foster and Will Patton who is just freaking awesome.  Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle, an ex-undercover cop who's last job when sour and some people were killed, one of those being the son of Howard Saint (Travolta), banker/money launderer and Saint declares revenge by mercilessly killing EVERYONE in Castle's family.  Castle then becomes The Punisher and goes on a spree taking out everyone close to Saint.  The action, while not non-stop, is a definite highlight to the film, but the movie has dramatic undertones to make this more than just your average superhero, beat-em-up type film but a film about a man trying to move on from a horrible event that changed his life.  It's a decent film that, while not pleasing everyone, is sure to please the action monger and or anyone who is fans of the comic or superhero adaptations in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Former FBI agent Frank Castle ( Thomas Jane) has just retired from the FBI as he celebrates his retirement with his entire family.

He then in turn becomes vengeful, he becomes a Skull T-shirt wearing vigalantee named "The Punisher" as he must take a bite out of crime and get even with Saint.<br /><br />This is a highly underrated but well done adaptation of Marvel Comic's character, it is a slight improvement over Dolph Lundgren's 1989 version but this time with the skull logo shirt and faithful to the Punisher's origin.

They hated it.  They also hated Daredevil.  Now, I will admit the transition of Punisher and Daredevil to the screen was not to be an earth shattering experience.  I mean c'mon, they were both released during weak times of the movie going season.  They were both second tier heroes of Marvel.  C'mon, they only spend a lot of money on the high profile characters like the XMEN, Spiderman, Hulk and the upcoming Fantastic Four.  I went to see this movie to support the Marvel Comic industry, I didn't think it looked that bad and I wasn't expecting much.  I was entertained to say the least.  Yes it was weak in some places but otherwise good.  Thomas Jane did a tremendous job playing the part.  He showed a finite difference between his initial character and the one that emerges from the horrible tragedy that he endures.  His family is brutally murdered in a vicious scene of gangland style shootings.  He survives, but comes out not quite himself, understandably.  The problem with the movie is that everything around him is not quite up to par with Thomas Jane's performance.  The tone of the movie is at times a little campy, and that just doesn't fly with this character.  He's dark, violent, gritty, obsessed and a little nuts.  Think of Batman with just guns, no gadgets and no desire to keep his identity secret.  Unfortunately, the whole `make friends with the off center neighbors' thing doesn't work with someone who is supposed to be a loner and makes things a little awkward.  And even though Travolta plays his character seriously, he's still a bit over the top.  What does work with Jane's performance is the intelligent manner in which he 'Punishes' the bad guys.  Die Hard fans of the comic might say this is in contrast with the character who goes in guns blazing and kills everyone.  But the alteration is a sign of the times and how this character actually changed in comics.  Hopefully with Jane's performance, this franchise won't die.  As of now, a lot can be done, and it could be done well if given to the right creators.  If anyone thinks this version is worse then the Dolph Lungren version, they need to rethink their perspective.<br /><br />Update 10/13/2005:  I watched the making of documentary on this movie and I found it amazing that the director/writer was given a 30 million dollar budget and a 60 day shooting schedule.  That's an abomination.  Considering the other movies Marvel has made, they didn't put much into this one, and it most likely contributed to it's less than stellar end product.  Kudos to the director for doing what he did though.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EGDRTJYF3AZK.html">A1EGDRTJYF3AZK</a><br/><p>That's no lie, in this movie you see alot of gore that you wouldn't normaly see in a mainstream movie, which was suprising given the fact it was a comic book movie.<br /><br /> The story was pretty good also, the violence served a purpose and helped move the story along. I love the fact that this "super hero" had no super powers, the only thing that motivated and helped him was blind rage, he was like the Hulk that held his human form.<br /><br /> Top notch action movie, probably not one to watch with the wife or girl friend, so all the more reason to enjoy it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>remember buying the Amazing Spider-man issue that first features the Punisher.

The movie was almost laughable! I have not seen the director's cut yet,but I really don't think they can fix this one with some added scenes.

Sadly, most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special, never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to "Sin City" than "Spider-Man" or "Daredevil". Now that the film is available on DVD, I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is! The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action, and to understand the caring, loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint, and his equally ruthless wife, Livia (played by a remarkably low-key John Travolta and Laura Harring), takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived, with total conviction, by Thomas Jane, Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion, and becomes a human weapon, devoid of pity, living only to see justice done, in equal measure to the crime.<br /><br />This is not someone you can easily 'warm up' to, and as the movie evolves into a series of executions, you may actually start to feel more sympathy toward the Saints and their henchman, Quentin Glass (the ever-watchable Will Patton) than in Castle. But screenwriter Michael France, and co-writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh, both well-versed in the Marvel comic character, add three quirky 'innocents' (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster, and John Pinette), who Castle warms up to, somewhat, and must ultimately protect. He will never recover the compassion that he lost, but he realizes that for many being brutalized, he is the only hope they have, giving him a purpose to live for.<br /><br />Unlike the earlier, Dolph Lundgren "Punisher", hampered by a minuscule budget and two-dimensional acting, this version makes the most of its small budget, with first-class acting (including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider), incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work, and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.<br /><br />I sincerely hope a sequel is made, as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>although actings was horrible and the story was predictable, it was one of the best action movies i've ever seen, it grabbed me till the end. wow! nothing more to say!</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>This is a great comic-book-to-film creation.  I really enjoyed the plot, the action, and the acting.  The shoot-outs are filmed in such a way that you can actually tell who is shooting at who, the good guys actually get hurt, and the bad guys are evil enough that you want to see them "get-their's".<br /><br />  The Punisher is a film that has that "IT" factor that a movie needs to be successful: predictable enough to expect certain things, but not so predictable that the movie is a wash.<br /><br />  What I really enjoyed about the film was the combination of good fight scenes with good "thinking revenge" scenes - the way The Punisher uses his brain to create situations that have the "bad guys" fighting amongst themselves adds flavor to the film.<br /><br />  I think The Punisher is one of the coolest comic book heroes because he is one of the most believable super heroes - no special powers, but he is on a real mission to get real "bad guys."  It makes him a very interesting character indeed.  After his entire family is ordered to be murdered by a money-laundering kingpin, FBI agent Frank Castle begins his crusade of revenge against the entire group of gangsters.  What follows is an entertaining film that is worth purchasing.<br /><br />  I waited way too long to finally watch this film.  It holds its own against any other comic book film that has been produced.  So don't wait any longer; buy it, rent it, or borrow it today.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>There's a scene about five minutes into the camp action flick The Punisher, where Special Forces veteran Frank Castle (hunky Tom Jane) rises from the dead, strips off his bloody shirt, and reveals his tight, muscled and pumped-up body. It's a feast for the eyes, and pretty much a sign of things to come. For The Punisher - although, fast, furious and fun  - is really just a vehicle for showing off Tom's amazing, sculptured physique. Even though Tom doesn't really get to exercise his acting chops, there's no doubt that he looks just fantastic. And he certainly has more than enough charisma and magnetism to pull off the difficult task of being a bonafide and authentic action hero.<br /><br />The movie begins as Castle is retiring from the F.B.I. His last undercover operation resulted in the accidental death of a suspect who just happened to be the son of the ruthless and cruel Howard Saint (an over-the-top John Travolta). Saint is a hardnosed nightclub owner, money launderer, and corporate tycoon. Devastated by the death of his son and urged on by his wife (Laura Harring), Saint takes revenge by ordering the murder of Castle's entire family. During a beachside reunion in Puerto Rico, Saint's henchmen surround the cottage and methodically shoot them all, including his wife (Samantha Mathis), father (Roy Schneider), and young son (Marcus Johns).<br /><br />Escaping the massacre, but severely wounded, Castle is nursed back to health by a local fisherman. Sporting a beard and drowning his sorrows in booze, he's frustrated at the lack of action by the police in bringing Saint to justice. So decked out in his son's form-fitting t-shirt, Castle launches a grim, brutal crusade against the assorted wrongdoers. He becomes a type of vigilante killer who lives on the edge of society, obsessed with revenge, and uses his guns, explosive devices, and military training, to carry out his pent-up and righteous fury.<br /><br />The Punisher is loaded with grim, sadistic violence but it also has a camp, slapstick quality that is quite appealing. Viewers will be hard pressed to take any of it seriously and most will enjoy getting caught up in the obnoxious, explosive, and often messy fun in the name of cheap thrills. Castle becomes a stripped-down, efficient, lean and mean fighting machine. Secluded in an industrial-looking warehouse in a rough part of Tampa, the rough, ready action man is haunted by the memories of his wife and son. In one of the few quiet moments, his neighbors, three idiosyncratic, harmless bohemian misfits played by Ben Foster, Jon Pinette, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, befriend and take care of him.<br /><br />In one over-the-top scene, Castle raises Frankenstein-like from the bowels of the warehouse. Broken and bloody, he rips off his tattered shirt, exposing his massive physique with thunder and lightening pounding around him. It's a laughable scene but also one of great musculature effect. Much of the movie is like this; it sports a flat-footed, hard-punching style, and maintains a blunt ferocity that makes the film impossible not to like. John Travolta has lots of fun playing the ruthless, slimy villain and it's obvious that he's not taking anything too seriously. As a gristly, heated urban revenge movie, The Punisher is probably one of the best to come along in quite a while, but pity poor Laura Harring. She had such a promising start in MullHolland Drive and it's so unfortunate to see that she's absolutely wasted here.

What more could one ask for?<br /><br />Thomas Jane plays the title role, who is out to get the stereotypical sneering bad guy (John Travolta seems to be making a career of playing this type) who murdered his wife and son. Along the way people get shot, stabbed, blown to bits, burned... well I think you've got the idea.<br /><br />Since this film is more or less a fantasy (Marvel Comic based), the makers can get away with all kinds of trangressions: no cops are seen anywhere in the movie, in spite of all kinds of mayhem.  Bad guys are simply erased from existence, with a witty one liner to send them off (ala Schwarzenegger).<br /><br />The film is fun to watch overall.  There is a bit of slow period in the middle of the film, but this is forgotten in the extremes of the big finale ending.  Rebecca Romijn makes a more or less token appearance for eyecandy purposes.  Travolta is almost corny as the evil money launderer who gets it in the end.  All in all not a bad way to spend two hours.<br /><br />Note: Not for small children!  Extreme violence and bloodletting.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PIX2K56IZZYX.html">A2PIX2K56IZZYX</a><br/><p>Just watched this for the 2nd time, I surprisingly enjoyed it even more then I did the first time. This movie, although violent and some might think silly at times, is pure revenge fun. This is another one of those if you don't take it to seriously and enjoy it for what it is movies. How can anyone go into this expecting some deep, moving drama with 5-star perfomances? no-no, not this one. It's pure action from beginning to end with a few breaks for some character development, which was another surprise as it was done very well.<br /><br />Anyone remember Deep Blue Sea? The shark movie that 90 percent of the world thought was terrible? (3 stars from me, silly fun) Well Tom Jane played the hero in that one, and he plays the hero in this one as well, and you know what? The man needs a little work. Don't get me wrong, it's not as if he is horrible, but he really needs to work on his emotion and expressions, as in GET SOME!!!! But it's not like he needs to talk in this, just take his shirt off and kill alot, and I do mean alot, of bad guys, which he does fine. I also believe he was Cameron Diaz's love interest in The Sweetest Thing, but I need to see that again before I can comment on his performance.<br /><br />Is it me, or does John Travolta not rule as a bad guy? Everytime he plays the villian he absolutely engulfs the role, adding just the right expressions and mannerisms to really make the character a complete heartless ass. Even in the very poor Battlefield Earth, he was awesome as the main willian, but alas, nothing could have saved that disaster.<br /><br />The supporting actors are all pretty decent, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is the weakest of the bunch, but her roomates are priceless and added alot of touching humor to there roles. Also Kevein Nash is terrific in a small role as "the russian" He is hired to kill Jane's character, Frank Castle, he doesn't say a word, but the fight scene those two have is one of the best I can remember recently.<br /><br />Plot? please, like you all haven't heard this one before, bad dudes kill his family, (twist here, his WHOLE family) and he goes on a major revenge spree. But who cares about the plot, the violence and Travolta are the big attractions here, and both shine quite well.<br /><br />So, don't be too hard on it, I know alot of the comic book fans were not pleased with final product, but the movies rarely do the comic or book justice, but the action and some decent acting with a touch of funny here and there should more then hold you for the 123 minutes this is on, enjoy.<br /><br />acting...........3 stars, Travolta rocks, Jane and Stamos not so much<br /><br />directing.......3.5 stars, Not too bad for a comic book movie<br /><br />special effects....4 stars, Lots of explosions, seriously, lots.<br /><br />action rating.....4 stars, see above. Also strong fight sequences<br /><br />quality.......3.5 stars, Bit dark at times, but still fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was pretty good. Travolta was good in the villianous role of Saint. Thomas Jane was good as The Punisher. It had a lot of good action and a lot of the scenes were right out of the comic. I wish they would have kept it dark and seedy and in New York or wherever and it irks me that they felt the need to change little things like that and putting it in Florida for no reason was stupid. Rebecca Romijin was and is always pretty hot but she is not a very good actress. They had a bit too much good feeling stuff with the other people who lived in the building who were trying to make Frank feel good and be part of their family. But I am the kind of person that likes Frank Castle to be a bitter, burt out killing machine. But hey at least they didn't have a happy ending where he runs into the super model next door neighbors arms ( come on! I mean they live in a slum and why the hell is Rebecca Romijin living there and still looking like a super model?). I thought this movie got kind of a bad rap. It wasn't that bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>I love the Punisher. It has always been the most realistic out of all of the popular comic books. A man getting revenge for the death of his family, it is a very possible thing that could happen in real life. This movie brings it with action and drama. As you watch Castle's family die, you feel the rage that Frank is feeling at the time, only waiting until the bad guys meet their certain end.<br /><br />John Travolta, as usual, is fantastic in this film as the main villain. Everyone on here is great in their role. You cheer for the hero, and you can't wait to see the bad guys die. It takes great acting to pull emotion like that out of an audience and it does that perfectly.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of and own the original movie The Punisher and I have to say that the 2004 movie, while I love the other, is my favorite between the two. It has more of a background of who Frank is and why he wears the skull T-shirt, which he didn't do in the original movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>Ever seen a movie that just left you with a bad taste, that just thoroughly depressed you?  That's how I feel having just watched "The Punisher".  G-R-I-M is the word to describe this movie.  This would be OK if the revenge part of it was compelling, but unfortunately "The Punisher" fails in this area too.<br /><br />The movie never recovers from its first act, and specifically the scene where the title charatcer's family is murdered.  Not only is it an ugly scene to sit through, but it also mercilessly lingers on, as a truck chases and mowes over people pathetically trying to flee.  After watching this, you want The Punisher to just destroy everyone that was involved.  Unfortunately, this is where the movie fails big time.<br /><br />Most of the villains do get their inevitable comeuppances, but it's not really satisfying.  At least two of the villains' ends are so pathetic that I just wanted to scream at the filmakers.  The big mistake is having The Punisher exact is vengeance in a round-about way, by sowing seeds of suspicion between the villains and having them kill each other.  This is somewhat interesting, but also very sloppily done, and unfortunately denies the audience what could have been some great action scenes.  There is some action here, but not nearly enough, and at two hours the film seems to drag on forever.<br /><br />John Travolta is simply not captivating as the villain.  I suppose his performance is adequate, but his character's not nearly despicable enough.  His worst action in the movie- killing The Punisher's family- is not even directly ordered by him.  To make it worse, he lets The Punisher manipulate him like a puppet, making him more pathetic than menacing.<br /><br />My final complaint is the movie's tone.  It's all so grimy, dark, and depressing.  Since the movie's main plot fails to be captivating, this makes it a chore to sit through (in this way, the best comparison to a modern comic book movie is "Daredevil").  The first two "Batman" films and the unfairly bashed "Hulk" movie may have been downbeat, but they were vibrant, colorful films with terrific action sequences.  "The Punisher" takes place almost exclusively at night, and very few action sequences manage to raise the pulse, making the whole affair just downright depressing.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is not a bad movie- the acting is overall good, and there was definite potential- but it simply is not one I can recommend.  If you're looking for a good comic book movie, there are many better ones out there- the "Spider-Man" and "X-Men" films, "Hulk", and "Hellboy" all come to mind.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>... but not by much. Man I REALLY wanted to like this too, but it's a dud.<br /><br />I want to start on a positive note, because it's (at least) watchable. There is SOME good in here, it's not ALL BAD. Thomas Jane, I felt, did a really good job portraying the main character. Come to think of it, I'll just throw out a blanket statement that all the acting (overall) was adequate. The special effects, especially the car that was used as Frank Castle's ride, was really creatively done and well executed. As I said before, this is watchable.<br /><br />Man there are a TON of issues though. Frustrating part is that EVERY PROBLEM I found with the movie was EXTREMELY FIXABLE. Let's begin ...<br /><br />I had reservations about the movie's South Florida location since it began filming. The way I always pictured the Punisher, I always thought of a very dark, gritty, urban setting. Bright, tropical, colorful Florida just never seemed to fit quite right to me. Unfortunately, I was right. To have Jane running around in the middle of the afternoon just looked odd. The Punisher just isn't the kind of character that would attack something in broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon, on a crowded city street.  Rumor has it that Travolta, a Florida resident, wouldn't sign on to the movie unless it filmed close to his home.<br /><br />There's an issue in the beginning of the movie, after Castle's family is slaughtered, where the time-line gets a little skewed. Once Frank returned to the mainland where he was staying, we have absolutely NO IDEA how much time had passed. Which reminds me, how exactly did that witch-doctor nurse Frank back to health? Why even point that character out at all? By all rights, Frank should have been on life-support after he was left for dead. Wouldn't it serve the movie more to just have him wash up on the beach and then taken to a hospital as a 'John Doe' (a la 'Hard to Kill')? Seems to me it would have served the same purpose and helped explain his recovery a little better. I'm not even going to mention asking where all of Castle's scars went when he takes his shirt off. He should be littered with pock-marks and scars that just aren't there. That witch-doctor must really know his stuff ...<br /><br />There was CLEARLY a mole in the department that Frank Castle was working for. Why was this point never pursued? Castle was CLEARLY sold-out by someone, and yet (even after his ridiculous "I'm still alive" declaration) nobody ever readdresses the issue? Speaking of which, why even make that speech in front of police headquarters? Wouldn't that completely blow you're element of surprise? That moment raised about a dozen questions that the film never bothered to answer.<br /><br />I normally never notice this kind of thing, but THE SCORE WAS HORRIBLE. Every time Howard Saint's character was on the screen, I swear they played the theme of Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies. For that matter, all the villains were nothing more then mobster card-board cut-outs.<br /><br />As far as the villains go, aside from Saint, they were all cartoons. The hit-man from Memphis and his musical interlude? What was with that? It did nothing to forward the plot at all. You could have completely cut him from the movie, maybe saved it for the DVD and lower the movie's running time by about 15 minutes. The Russian also looked like a character out of a Street Fighter video game.<br /><br />As far as the action, Lion's Gate was obviously pulling its punches. The Punisher is a BRUTAL CHARACTER; it was almost comedic watching him meticulously setting up these elaborate traps for Saints goons to fall into or trying to torture an enemy with a popsicle. Does anyone really think they wouldn't know the difference between a freeze-pop and a blowtorch?  I wanted so badly for this film to be a throwback to the mid-eighties action movies, the Punisher's supposed to be 'Rambo' not 'The Count of Monte Cristo.'<br /><br />It just seems to me that the idea of who this character is and what drives him was totally lost by the end of the movie. It's a little better then the Dolph Lungren movie; but they still haven't gotten it right either. Oh well, we still have Spiderman to look forward to ...</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5.html">A1G5LJ8T1IGYC5</a><br/><p>FRANK CASTLE [TOM JANE] RETIRES FROM THE FBI WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING SOME TIME WITH HIS FAMILY.

The Punisher develops from an all to common theme of revenge. Frank Castle seeks revenge for the life of his wife and son taken brutally by Howard Saint's (John Travolta) henchmen.  Frank then becomes the Punisher.<br /><br />  I have never read the comic book or even heard of the Punisher before this movie was made. I seen John Travolta's name on the one-sheet, so I rented the DVD. The movie is based on a Marvel Comic superhero. Does the Punisher have any super powers? I could not tell from this movie.<br /><br />  The Punisher is action packed with graphic violence. (Reason I wanted to see!) I think some of the action scenes were just too unbelievable. Note: The pickup truck with the thugs riding in the back while jumping the sand dunes Baja style. How can you stay inside the pickup without flying in the air like you were on a trampoline?  Even if you were strapped in, the injuries would be substantial from being tossed around like a rag doll. Maybe I'm looking to closely at this comic strip superhero movie. Is the superhero character the reason why we should see this movie?<br /><br />  And last but not least, who could resist the advances of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos's character? That is the most unbelievable thing in this movie. Hot, sexy and burned by former lovers. The Punisher must be a superhero or a comic strip character to resist. Maybe that's his super power!  Resistance of all emotion and caring for anyone; The Punisher!<br /><br />I would recommend seeing the X-men and X2 X-men United movies on how to translate comic superheroes to the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>This movie made me feel as if I were watching a PG-13 kids movie.

Why doesn't he just blow them all away in one clean swoop ? That would have been quicker.<br /><br />I wonder if the people who gave this movie a good rating, ever saw the 1989 version.</p></br><a href="../users/A34IBXM7E8CPWE.html">A34IBXM7E8CPWE</a><br/><p>Have you ever seen a Steven Segal movie? Then you've seen "The Punisher" already. Have you ever seen almost any 80's movie put out by the Canon Group? Then you've seen "The Punisher". I am not one to give away spoilers to movies, but this movie is just so full of action-genre cliches it's impossible not to see what's coming miles off. The good-cop-ready-to-retire who crosses the wrong bad guy on his last assignment, cue bad guys offing cop's family, cop's partner, cop's friend, cop's boss or anyone else that would turn the good cop into a vengeance-minded lone wolf seeking vigilante justice. Yes, this formula has been used from "Mad Max" to "Lethal Weapon" to "Death Wish" to "Bloodsport" to "No Holds Barred" (I mean really, anything that resembles a Hulk Hogan movie to any degree deserves 2 stars or less). There is nothing here that you won't find done as well in any Chuck-Norris-Jean-Claude-Charles-Bronson movie. The movie is very long too, and Travolta hamming it up for two hours is tough to take. I guess if you are a fan of the comic you might like it, or if you have happened to live in a cave for the past decade or two and have never seen this type of film before you might like it, but for those of us who grew up Stallone's "Cobra" or Eastwood's "Dirty Harry", this is just a retread of the same old story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>Whether it be "Payback", "Monte Cristo"(Book,Anime or Movies),"Old Boy" or "War" (when it comes out on Blue Ray).

It has plenty of great action for the action buffs, the story is excellent, even though many claim that it veers wide of the original story, and the acting is great, excepting John Travolta, whose performance was less than expected.<br /><br />I loved comics as a kid, and I read a few as I entered college, but I've never read any "Punisher" comics unless he happened to pop up in someone else's story.  This movie, however, makes this character much more interesting than I thought before.  Many comic fans whine about how this movie altered their beloved Frank Castle, but I think this film does a pretty good job of developing the character, regardless of any liberties taken.  Keep in mind that the producers are hoping to reach beyond the typical "Punisher" fanbase, and alterations were necessary.  Basically, Castle is portrayed as a vengeful soul, who seeks vigilante justice when his whole family is murdered due to the fact that he kills off a mobster's baby boy.  He lives in a rundown apartment complex, becomes an alcoholic, and has neighbors that would freak out folks in the suburbs.  Simply put, his world is in shambles and he wants retribution.  I'm not sure how far off this character development is, but it fits the film just fine.<br /><br />Thomas(or Tom) Jane plays Frank Castle/Punisher is this movie.  I think he does a fantastic job.  I don't see this character as a victim.  To me, he is portrayed as a man who has lost everything and seeks to make his pain go away.  A victim would just hide in the corner, not go after his enemies, guns ablazing.  Others haved said that Castle sulks too much in this movie.  Give the guy a break, his whole family has been wiped out!  John Travolta plays Howard Saint.  He's the main baddie that Castle is hoping to make life a living hell for.  Travolta's performance seems forced at times, but once he gets into his "kill" mode, he does a good job.  The rest of the cast does a superb job setting up the story.  Rebecca Romijn provides eye-candy and a good friend to Castle.  Ben Foster does a great job as a pierced-to-the-nines geek who stands up for the Punisher.  Pro-wrestler Kevin Nash has a speechless role as "the Russian" who pounds our hero into a pulp.  I almost didn't recognize him.<br /><br />The action is brilliant and, once underway, doesn't stop.  Many of the deaths in this film are rather original.  Others are just brutal to watch(especially when a certain person catches a train).  The R-rating is well deserved.  Keep the little comic fans far away from this one.<br /><br />I've seen pretty much all of the comic adaptations that have been cranked out since the goofy Adam West versions of "Batman."  Compared to these other films, I'd rank this particular one just above "Hellboy" and "Blade" due to the acting and story quality.  It has plenty of fight sequences, guns, and explosives to quench even the most sadistic thirst.  The story is plotted out very well and the acting is better than most of the other comic-to-screen adaptations.  Also, in case you're wondering, Dolph Lundgren's "Punisher" doesn't hold a candle to this one.<br /><br />Comic purists aside, anyone who loves action flicks with a really good plot should love this film.  It isn't brainless, though some of that is thrown in thanks to "the Russian."  It's a very smart film that is much better than similar flicks such as "Daredevil," which I enjoyed, and ten times as good as the snoozer known as "Hulk."  Liberties might have been taken with the characters, but they make for an interesting story.<br /><br />This film is highly underrated.  Don't turn this one down just because it doesn't follow the comic page-by-page.  I highly recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>... but not by much.

Let's begin ...<p>I had reservations about the movie's South Florida location since it began filming.  The way I always pictured the Punisher, I always thought of a very dark, gritty, urban setting.  Bright, tropical, colorful Florida just never seemed to fit quite right to me.  Unfortunately, I was right.  To have Jane running around in the middle of the afternoon just looked odd.  The Punisher just isn't the kind of character that would attack something in broad daylight, in the middle of the afternoon, on a crowded city street.<p>There's an issue in the beginning of the movie, after Castle's family is slaughtered, where the timeline gets a little skewed.  Once Frank returned to the mainland where he was staying, we have absolutely NO IDEA how much time had passed.  Which reminds me, how exactly did that witch-doctor nurse Frank back to health?  Why even point that character out at all?  By all rights, Frank should have been on life-support after he was left for dead.  Wouldn't it serve the movie more to just have him wash up on the beach and then taken to a hospital as a 'John Doe'?  Seems to me it would have served the same purpose and helped explain his recovery a little better.  I'm not even going to mention asking where all of Castle's scars went when he takes his shirt off.  He should be littered with pock-marks and scars that just aren't there.  That witch-doctor must really know his stuff ...<p>There was CLEARLY a mole in the department that Frank Castle was working for.  Why was this point never pursued?  Castle was CLEARLY sold-out by someone, and yet (even after his ridiculous "I'm still alive" declaration) nobody ever readdresses the issue?  Speaking of which, why even make that speech in front of police headquarters?  Wouldn't that completely blow you're element of surprise?  That moment raised about a dozen questions that the film never bothered to answer.<p>I normally never notice this kind of thing, but THE SCORE WAS HORRIBLE.  Every time Howard Saint's character was on the screen, I swear they played the theme of Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies.  For that matter, all the villains were nothing more then mobster card-board cut-outs.<p>As far as the villains go, aside from Saint, they were all cartoons.  The hit-man from Memphis and his musical interlude?  What was with that?  It did nothing to forward the plot at all.  You could have completely cut him from the movie, maybe saved it for the DVD and lower the movie's running time by about 15 minutes.  The Russian also looked like a character out of a Street Fighter video game.<p>As far as the action, Lion's Gate was obviously pulling its punches.  The Punisher is a BRUTAL CHARACTER; it was almost comedic watching him meticulously setting up these elaborate traps for Saints goons to fall into.  He's supposed to be 'Rambo' not 'The Count of Monte Cristo.'<p>It just seems to me that the idea of who this character is and what drives him was totally lost by the end of the movie.  It's better then the Dolph Lungren movie; but they still haven't gotten it right either.  Oh well, we still have Spiderman 2 to look forward to ...</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>One of my favorite characters in the world of comics (not to mention the world of fiction), is Frank Castle, a.k.a. &quot;The Punisher.&quot; He's a deeply flawed hero fueled with anger and hatred. He's a realistic character that makes you feel for him in other ways that other comic book heroes cannot. Maybe it's because the man is a real man and not somebody with special powers or abilities. He's just a man with a lot of guns and firepower seeking to dish out his own brand of justice. It is a dark and brutal movie with a lot of violence that will turn away some, but for the people who know what Frank Castle is about will appreciate how he is portrayed in this film.<br /><br /> Frank Castle has retired from his rough and dangerous job and now plans to make up for lost time with his family. Only problem is that in his last assignment, the son of a notorious crime lord, Howard Saint, was one of the casualties. Howard orders the death of Castle, and his wife adds, &quot;His whole family.&quot; And that is what happens. Castle's entire family, from his mother and father to his very own son and wife are massacred at what was supposed to be a happy family reunion, but they didn't finish the job as Frank Castle came back alive. Unsatisfied with how the police have been handling the situation, Frank decides it's time for him to take action and dish out justice and punishment his own way. And to start, he decides to take out the people responsible for the deaths of his family.<br /><br /> As I said, &quot;The Punisher&quot; is a brutally dark film that is so unlike any of the other comic book movies. This is because that's what &quot;The Punisher&quot; is; a dark tale about a man who goes around killing (not beating up) the bad guys. There's no way they could make this PG-13. In fact, I would've been disgusted if they had. It would've meant the story would be sacrificed. Let's face it, the &quot;Punisher&quot; comic books are no child's tale. So I was happy that they took it to the limit that they did, while I'm sure there will be people who won't be. The movie is extremely well-acted for a comic book movie. Tom Jane is EXCELLENT as &quot;Punisher&quot;, and I hope that if they do make a sequel that he is in it again. John Travolta is even great in this as the bad guy--but they also do a good job of showing his human side rather than just making him a one-dimensional character. The film looks dark and dreary--as it should be--and the overall product is well executed.<br /><br /> A great thing that stands out in this film is the actual story going on. It's not non-stop action. Does it make the film slow? At times, yes, but it didn't matter to me because I was so fascinated with what was going on with Castle and how he was coping. Although, I think a few more action scenes of him executing a few more bad guys would've done nicely (the movie has one of the coolest finales I have ever seen in an action movie). There's some great character development in this, which was a big problem with the first &quot;Punisher&quot; that came out years ago. Another plus is that it doesn't try to be overly funny. Sure, there are a few jokes in it (to lighten the movie up somewhat), but they don't overdo it. The only real problem I had with it was that I wanted to see more. I didn't want it to end. It made me want to see more of Frank Castle proceeding with his mission to wipe out criminals. I really hope that they make a sequel, and I really hope that they use Tom Jane again.<br /><br /> &quot;The Punisher&quot; succeeds in what it tries to achieve. It's a great and dark story about loss and justice. It's about the mind frame of someone who has lost everything at the hands of a criminal. I must warn you that this is no movie for little kids. The movie is rated R, and it lives up to that very rating. All in all, I was extremely pleased with this movie and I can't wait to own it on DVD. A terrific movie for people who admire dark and flawed heroes who have lost more than they can handle. -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>I had a feeling when I saw the previews for this movie that it wasn't going to be very good.  I was right.<br /><br />This is an aborted attempt at translating a very different kind of "hero" a la Marvel comics to the screen.  It had been done before, and it was pretty bad then too.  (Anyone remember Ivan Drago from "Rocky IV"?  He played The Punisher a little better than Tom Jane in this movie, and that should be all you need to know about the quality of the acting here.)<br /><br />The job of "The Punisher" in this film is to strut around without a shirt on, act like a darker Toby Keith/gunslingin' coolguy, and take vengeance on the people who murdered his family.  Keep in mind he's been shot five, six times on the orders of John Travolta (he's a gangster with a big car lot and people who dress in all black).  Was he at least seriously injured.  Nah.  Some voodoo witch doctor black guy who just happened to be around when the slaughter of his family took place and was also miraculously unharmed fixed him in a day or two.<br /><br />Nope. Frank Castle, this seemingly invincible cop who is bent on smoking cigarettes and drinking hard liquor while plotting revenge, doesn't even have a scar on this body after being blown up and shot multiple times.<br />He is miraculously delivered back to the exact city in a very short time and begins a game of bloodthirsty "intrigue" using one of the villain's henchmen so obvious and predictable it makes Andy Warhol's movie "Sleep"<br />seem unpredictable.<br /><br />But the other people who live in the apartment with Jane's Punisher--fatboy, loser, and reformed heroin addict potential love interest--put the nails in the already descending coffin of this awful excuse for a movie.  They are so badly drawn and so badly acted that you wonder if they are going to fall off the screen or start laughing wildly.  They try a few "Leave It To Beaver" moments in between Castle's drinking and intent haunted gaze on his firearms.<br /><br />But he is so haunted, vengeful, so cool that he can't work up too much dialogue with them.  That might have required some acting.  He's the demented silent type, a less talented Gary Cooper with a different agenda.  A big Russian guy (an extra from Barnum and Bailey's?) and Castle have a big brawl, each suffering injuries that would knock anyone unconscious or kill them very quickly.  Another thing: The Punisher, though mortal as anyone else, does not seem to have the problem of blood loss.<br /><br />In a completely cold, bland, and unmoving series of Cowboy Draw Your Gun pastiche, Castle takes his vengeance on the ever absent Howard Saint (John Travolta is who you see, but he's supposed to playing a role with that name).  Then, ripping off "The Crow" (an actually good movie about vigilantism), he sets ablaze the ominously luxuriant parking lot of this arch criminal.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is one of the most disturbing and well written characters in the history of Marvel.  It is sad indeed that any Hollywood exec with a reachable cellphone number and a chunk of change can take rich art and trash it like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>The Hulk sucked, Dare-Devil was so-so, and SpiderMan II was way overrated. This was the best Marvel Comic superhero brought to life so far.<br /><br />Hopefully 2005's "Iron Man" will be as good as The Punisher.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>.......pre-judge a film ever again without seeing it first.  I had been talking trash about this movie ever since the first teaser trailer.  Being a long time Punisher fan, and an avid reader of Garth Ennis' current run on the series, I felt deeply betrayed when I found out that the Punisher would only be in his mid-thirties (as opposed to around 50 in the comic) and that the story would take place in Tampa, Florida as opposed to a gritty New York setting.  The Punisher should be the easiest comic book adaptation ever.  He's a vigilante with no superpowers who takes out organized crime.  It's so simple it's stupid.  If masterpieces like Spider-Man and X-Men could be faithfully portrayed on the big screen, then Punisher should be a cake walk.  I was sure that it would be terrible and the critic reviews supported this theory.  Well, I wouldn't ever be satisified unless I saw it, so about a week before it left the theater, I sat in an empty screenroom around noon on a wednesday and saw The Punisher.<br /><br />Well, despite the changes, I really liked the film.  Liked it enough to buy it, even.  It's not without it's faults, but it was far better than the previous Dolph Lundren version and a whole lot better than Daredevil which I proclaim a worse movie than Gigli.  I liked Castle's heavy drinking and often depressed state of being.  I liked how he didn't just kill Saint...he turned everyone he trusted against him...then killed him.  I liked the references to the Garth Ennis series (Joan, Dave, and Bumpo were characters created by Ennis in the comic).  Even some of the scenes from the original Ennis limited series were added; such as the fight with Russian, the spring-loaded knife, and Dave getting his piercings pulled out.  And the popsicle-torture scene was taken from an issue from the early-eighties.  I loved it.<br /><br />So, yeah, I would have liked it if Castle was a Vietnam vet in his fifties.  I would have preferred that he hunted down organized crime lords in New York instead of Florida.  But I still had fun with this.  The lesson learned here is: I had preconceived ideas about this movie, and I had listened to all the critics and stayed away from it intitially....but I ended up really liking it.  So my advise to you is to not make up your mind about something until you see it; and don't listen to what the critics say.  Really....who cares what they think.  They get paid the same whether they like it or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A13F2IV3ME23R.html">A13F2IV3ME23R</a><br/><p>As all comic book characters are well built, T. Jane fit in well and as a whole the movie did follow the style of comic book writing.<br /><br />As a gripping movie - it was ok. Not the best out - but will still find its way into my collection.  Comic books for nostalga, movies for more visual effects.  People for more realism.<br /><br />I will admit that I prefer Dolph Lundgren's version of Frank Castle but Louis Gossett Jr added depth to the story.<br /><br />It had enough blood and guts and explosions for the average person. Just do a little reading of the comics - you should enjoy them both.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>This is a comic book movie, folks.  So if it plays like one, isn't that what was expected?  Thomas Jane (Stander, Dreamcatcher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as Frank Castle, a special FBI agent, whose involvement in a sting operation results in the death of the son of a nasty criminal named Howard Saint (played by the ever evil John Travolta).  Travolta's revenge is to have Castle killed, but dear Salome-like wife Livia (a torchy Laura Harring) wants Castle's whole family wiped out.  This is accomplished at a family reunion of Castle's family on Puerto Rico.  Dad Roy Scheider and Castle's whole family are brutally murdered; Castle himself is shot and left for dead.  Mistake # 1, and it's a big one.  Castle nurses himself back to health and sets out to even the score.  He hides out in a dumpy apartment building, where his good neighbors include Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos in one of her best performances and the delightful Ben Foster as Dave, a nose/eyebrow/mouth-studded wimp whose loyalty and friendship are to be commended.  The inclusion of this trio adds some warmth and humor to the otherwise dark proceedings.<br /><br />Jonathan Hensleigh directs like a junior John Woo; the film is violent, and there are some exceptionally good action scenes.  Kevin Nash as the Russian is awesome in his short battle with poor Frank.<br /><br />Thomas Jane has been accused of being lifeless and dull--I found him very good in the role.  If your whole family and life had been obliterated, how would YOU act?  While vigilante justice isn't to be condoned, IN A FILM LIKE THIS, you cheer for Jane to take care of the vile group.  Will Patton as the gay henchman, Samantha Mathis as Castle's doomed wife are also excellent.<br /><br />Critically bombed unjustly, I recommend this film for people who like action and seeing justice served.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Was it a masterpiece?  No.  But the Punisher did a good job of being exactly what it wanted to be:  A solid action movie.<br /><br />I think the problem lies in with the character itself.  In the late 80's and early 90's the Punisher was one of Marvel's top characters.  He starred in three of his own monthly titles.  A rare honor that previously had been reserved only for Spiderman and the X-men. Yet still, he was a realatively unknown character to the general populace.<br /><br />The Punisher is an anti-hero and I think the violence perhaps put critics off thinking maybe he was a vigilante in the vein of Batman.<br /><br />The plot is well known.  Frank Castle is a just retired FBI operative.  In his last bust the son of a Miami mobster, Howard Saint. (played well by John Travolta) is killed and he seeks revenge by Killing Castles entire family at a reunion in Puerto Rico.<br /><br />Castle survives his wounds and then seeks out first to destroy Saint's organization and then Saint and his cronies themselves.<br /><br />Thomas Jane I thought did a good job in understating his role.  The Punisher is NOT a fun guy.  He's a bit morose and very intense.  Jane was able to display both of these characteristics very well as the grieving husband and father an the hell-bent for revenge Punisher.<br /><br />Travolta's character and his henchmen are pretty two-dimensional and standard villains but that's ok.  We really don't want to see much development with guys we know are going to end up dead anyway, do we?<br /><br />I was glad to see the film-makers did not give into the urge and have Castle go the romantic route with neighbor Rebecca Romijn Stamos.  The comic character would never let himself get emotionally involved with anyone.<br /><br />The action sequences are done quite well.  My only beef would be perhaps it is a bit too comic-bookish with some of the villians such as the singing hitman from Memphis, and the big Russian played by pro wrestler Kevin Nash.<br /><br />I think these comic-type villians detracted a bit from the edginess of the movie.<br /><br />The DVD has some great extras including commentary, making of doumantery, features on the stunts and even a punisher mini-comic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Frank Castle has a decent life.  He has a family that loves him, a wife that will follow him to the ends of the Earth, and a son that looks up to him.  On the night of his retirement, he is involved with a shooting dealing with the youngest son of Howard Saint.  Not thinking twice about the death, he retires and heads to the beach to celebrate his first extended family reunion in five years.  Unfortunately, Howard Saint is not one to let the death of his son go forgotten.  He sends a group of men down to the island to kill all of Castle's family.  They proceed to take everything from Frank, and even try to end his life as well, but luckily he is a fighter, and survives the assassination attempt.  This action brings upon the birth of a man hell-bent on revenging his family, a survivor known as, the Punisher.<br /><br />What follows next are massive amounts of explosions, witty and cheesy catch-phrases, and an exploration of what goes bump in those dark alleyways. Director Jonathan Hensleigh has done an exceptional job of bringing the darkness to the silver screen.  Castle is a tragic figure, his family has been killed, and he wants to bring "punishment" to those that viciously did this to his life.  He is not a happy character.  He does not have joy surrounding him and Hensleigh stays true to that.  There are several scenes in this film where we could have seen a bubbly Hollywood side to Castle.  Some directors would have gone another direction to perhaps give us a glimpse of his decency, but Hensleigh never went there.  He keeps Castle mysterious and void of emotion.  He has feelings, but that does not sway his thoughts on vengeance.  I was proud of this film for keeping true to the character.  There were some beautiful scenes that were used in this film that just made me as giddy as a schoolgirl.  One of my favorite scenes is when Castle uses a razor edge to chop one of his assailants.  The way he held the weapon and the camera angle truly brought out the style of the comic.<br /><br />The Punisher is not a superhero.  He is a normal person that will bleed when shot, and feel pain when hit ... he is human.  That is something that I wanted to make sure would be seen in this film, and it was.  I did not want the Punisher to be a superhero that could dodge bullets and cause damage with his single fist, and thankfully this was not the direction that Hensleigh took him.  There were several scenes where Castle was shot, where he couldn't move because he was in pain, and where he drank way too much.  This was a story of man who was willing to go to the full extreme to bring vengeance to his family.  He represented the decision that each one of us considers when hurt by another.  He is an average man that is fueled by love and hate.  In fact, that was what I felt about this film.  I loved it and hated it.  There were moments when I felt embarrassed for the cast, wondering if they knew what they were saying and doing, but most of these scenes were countered with amazing shots that built a beautifully gritty story to this powerful human.<br /><br />Overall, it was decent to watch.  Not one that I would watch again and again, but one that I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel if it is ever released.<br /><br />Grade:  *** out of ****</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>I bought The Punisher when it originally came out so now I have both the original DVD and its new Extended Cut.<br /><br />As for the film itself, I liked the original but the new extended cut does what it should do. It gives the film a whole new look that was missing before! I won't give it away but it has a new subplot that makes the film make more sense (much like the director's cut of Daredevil) and makes it better in my view!<br /><br />On a personal note, for those that says its nothing but mindless violence and that it has no regard for human life obviously didn't watch the film or read the comics! Yes, there is gory violence but this isn't freakin' Spider-man (though I enjoy that character's movies as well)! The Punisher ISN'T a nice character. I am not married nor do I have children but if my wife and son (along with my extended family) was gunned down in front of my eyes, I don't think I'd have such a positive attitude either. Also, Frank Castle isn't so hellbent that he can't see suffering around him. If that was so, he wouldn't have helped Joan (played by Rebecca Romjin) with that creepy boyfriend of hers or befriend (sort of) Joan and her friends or left the "gift" that he left so on that note, Frank Castle wasn't totally twisted.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the DVD, it has the animated beginning both with the film and seperate. Also, there is a 10 minute short explaining the new extended cut as well as classic Punisher covers from the comics. I would also recommend keeping the original release for the extras (it has some good ones too). Overall, if you can stand the violence that comes, its a good film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>Frankly, when I first decided to watch this movie I wasn't expecting that much from it because I still remembered the original with Dolph Lundgren. I'm glad that I was wrong. This movie was absolutely incredible. I think what makes "The Punisher" such a great character is the fact that he's just a regular man driven by hatred and revenge. There are no capes, no flying, no gimmicks, no masks, no sidekicks, no gadgets, no moving at the speed of light, and no superhuman strength. He's just a regular man going through life with a tortured soul trying to avenge the brutal murder of his family, and you gotta love that part if nothing else. Thomas Jane was the perfect man for this role even though I didn't know much about any of his earlier work until this movie. The only thing my sister and I kept saying to ourselves is that Tom Jane really reminded us of the "Highlander" Chris Lambert (that's just an opinion of course). To keep it short though, I think it's worth watching at least once, but as with everything else, some will love it, and some will hate it. I LOVED IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>The Punisher is a action-packed rendition of the comic book formula.<br /><br />Unlike Spiderman, Batman and Superman, the Punisher is altogether different.  No cape nor super powers, just various kinds of firepower and ass kicking weaponry.<br /><br />Revenge and gritty action is the name of the game here, folks.<br /><br />A new action star has arrived, both in this actor and this franchise.  This was a most enjoyable, fast-paced movie that I enjoyed immensely.  John Travolta did a fair job at playing the devil-may-care baddie.<br /><br />But the supreme action sequences is where its at here in this movie.  Some good storyline as well, don't get me wrong.  But when Castle puts on his signiture shirt - the skeleton head - look out!  Because all hell is gonna break loose.<br /><br />A must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>The Punisher has been done before, but it wasn't much of a success.  The Dolph Lundgren version was popular only for its campy aspects and unrealistic gunfights.  This is a movie close to the early and middle eras of the comic book.  It is dark, gritty, ugly at times, and witha  joyless obsessed main character.  The thing that set apart the Punisher from other Marvel heroes is his lack of morals when dealing with evil.  With Daredevil he came from a dark place but had a code to never kill.  Spiderman, though scarred at a young age, still kept his hope and wouldn't kill.  Punisher went through his traumatic experience, and came out as a killer.  Not a man of justice, but a punisher of evil.<br /><br />Frank Castle is an FBI agent in this movie version.  He is involved as an undercover agent in a weapons scheme playing a german with connection to interested foreign parties.  Things seem to go off without a hitch until the foreign parties get nervous when the police show up and open fire on the American dealers, one of them is killed.  The only problem is that the person killed is connected.  His father is Howard Saint, a crime boss focused on money laundering.  He and his wife are crushed by the death his son, and he wants revenge, the wife wants the entire family killed.  So they send a group of hitmen that accomplish this task, save for Frank Castle, who manages to survive and swears revenge.<br /><br />This isn't the typical comic book movie.  The theme is a lot darker than most.  Though he has a trio of nutty neighbors in the trashy apartment he rents, the feeling of the movie is joyless and bleak.  The Saints live in their luxurious mansion but don't seem in the slightest bit happy.  Howard Saint is in luxury but jealously guards everything he has and sufferes from mild paranoia.  His wife seems to make the best out of it but lives under her husbands constant scrutiny.  His son is a fop and not the favorite who was killed.  His neighbors though quirky and friendly seem to be either down on their luck or are losers.  The gun fights aren't John Woo style action sequences, they are quick and ugly executions.<br /><br />But the movie does keep the feel of a comic book.  The two assasins are gimic light, but could easily be in a comic.  The first a blues singer/assasin.  The second the russian, played by a former pro wrestler, a massive assasin that beats his victims to death and has a massive tolerence to pain.  But that is as close to other comics as it got.  Early on it had cameos by superheroes and villians, but middle and later era was flat out standard fare villians; gangsters, drug dealers, terrorists, etc....<br /><br />The acting is good all around.  Frank Castle is downplayed and intense as he was in the comic.  John Travolta was excellent as Howard Saint.  A powerful man that in the center is very weak and insecure.  Willing to kill close friends out of jealousy with little or weak evidence.  His wife Livia Saint, a spoiled woman making the best of her rich cage and possesive husband, but the perfect American aristocrat, arrogant, mean spirited, and looking down at all those around her.<br /><br />This is a very decent movie, better than some of the comic adaptations of late.  Don't expect a happy movie or something with an upbeat ending.  Even when all the bad guys are killed there is a feeling that nothing has changed.  Yes he punished the guilty, but he has nothing in the end.  Family is gone, friends are gone, even money means nothing to him.  But still creates a good movie, albeit dark and having little in the realms of hope.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I bought this movie without ever seeing it and knowing that many critics had bashed this one pretty bad. Thanks to some of the amazon.com reviewers giving it 4 or 5 stars, I thought maybe it would be better than the critics thought and I knew it had to be much better than Daredevil. This movie is so much fun from start to finish! Way better than Daredevil or The Hulk and to me just as good as the first two Spiderman films. The action is good throughout without going too over the top and the creative kills were a nice touch to an already violent movie. Tom Jane nails the part of Frank Castle here and is a joy to behold as his character changes from family man to a one man assault team. I heard John Travolta went over the top here, but to me he plays a pretty laid back bad guy and I like what he did with this role. Yes, the neighbors are a little annoying (they were in the comics too), but there screen time is limited. The only character I really didn't was the model turned actress who played the third neighbor. She just couldn't act and got on my nerves fast. This is a must buy for all action and comic hero movie fans out there! This one will be watched many times in the coming weeks. High replay value = A worthy purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>WOW! Fantastic! This is by far the best action movie I've seen in ages! Harking back to the old shoot 'me up revenge flicks of the 80s, Jonathan Hensleigh's THE PUNISHER has the perfect ingredients for a great action movie: A great story (Something that a worryingly-large amount of movies today lack), no obvious CGI, equally impressive villains and with Thomas Jane, a name to watch out for from now on. The oft-mentioned "5th actor" - the soundtrack suits the dark mood really well, and the stunts, explosions, fight scenes, one-liners, evil eyes, fights to the death- all present and so much fun! John Tarvolta makes a welcome return to form aswell. Despite the incredible ending, the scene I liked the most was the massive punch-up between Castle and the Russian. Absolutely fantastic! I never thought it's say this, but bring on the sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>When comic book movies began making their comeback during the last few years, most of the movies were based on very well known characters from Marvel and DC Comics.  After a string of hits, Marvel decided to try their hand at adapting a character that isn't as well known, and in fact had already been adapted miserably in the early 90's, the character is The Punisher.<br /><br />The story for "The Punisher" begins when undercover agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is working on a drug sting, but the sting doesn't go as planned and a few of the criminals die in the process.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal, except for one of the criminals is the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), the biggest crime boss in Miami.  With the death of his son, Howard, places a hit on Frank Castle and his entire family.  Saint's thugs do as they're told, and assault Frank and his family during a vacation.  After being left for dead, Frank comes to, only to discover that his entire family has been murdered, and that he's badly wounded.  Once on the mend, Frank begins to plot his revenge and deliver his own brand of punishment for Howard Saint and his criminal empire.<br /><br />This movie was quite impressive for a comic book adaptation.  I thought it captured the character of Frank Castle really well.  Easily lets the viewer forget about the dismal "The Punisher" movie featuring Dolph Lungdren in the title role from 1992.  This movie featuring a strong cast, headed by Thomas Jane who does an excellent job capturing the devastation/depression of his family's murder, and channelling those emotions into vengeance.  John Travolta does a very good job playing the villain as usual, and you can tell he's enjoying this role.  The rest of the cast deliver strong supporting roles especially Rebecca Romijn and Ben Foster who bring Frank's eccentric new neighbors to life.<br /><br />The setups for the punishments are done very nicely, Frank is not just picking them off simply by shooting them as one might expect, rather Castle goes through an elaborate setup to take his revenge on the man who murdered his family, Howard Saint.  Nice adaptation of the characters Mr. Bumpo, Spacker Dave, and Joan from the Garth Ennis comics.  The violence is not gratuitous or over the top in the least, all very well done.  The only true complaints I have are very minor, the biggest being that nothing occurs in New York which is where Marvel's characters generally reside, The Punisher among them.  Also, they changed Frank Castle from being a Vietnam Vet into an undercover agent, which is fine I understand artistic license plus you want a young Frank Castle so that one's fine.<br /><br />Overall very well done despite what the critics say about it.  Very few problems, great action scenes, good acting.  Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a good action movie with a plot or just a comic book fan looking for a good adaptation.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>And trust me, when this guy is locked and loaded with an aresonal that can start world war 3, he can take on a whole army if he wanted, but those aren't his intensions; something else is.<br /><br />Frank Castle(Tom Jane) is a cop who acts as a drug dealer faking his guy's death.  And after his successful bust, he and his family after 5 years of no reunion finally party.  But there is was a flaw he overlooked.  one of the men on the other side that got wasted was the son of a weathy man, Howard Saint(John Travoltra) who is more pissed than a pot filled with it.  And vengence was his answer, by letting his troops go on a mad killing frenzy on te saints.  But Frank is still alive, and now, he wants complete payback.  But can he win a one man war with the saints?  Or will the saints be the ones who won, and still stay on top?<br /><br />This movie has alot of gunplay in it, some fighting, a tiny bit of nudity and stuff.  The acting was nice, usally I thought a American trying to be a Bad-@$$(Like Vin Diesel) would just make a horrible flick, but the mixture of a gritty dark tale, and a emotional motive, really made me like Frank Castle, or what he likes being called, the punisher.  It also had some comedy, like when the italian opera music was playing, and the big russian Giagantor dude went to work on Frank.  The one thing I didn't like about the movie, was it said it had prevassive brutal violence.  I really didn't find anything all that brutal.  If you wanna be rocked out of your socks with brutal-shock value violence, well, this really ain't the ticket.  Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q are some disturbingly brutal movies.<br /><br />The punisher is definitly a change from the everyday stupid story, PG-13 weak crap I usally see today.  And this movie has some pretty nice action sceenes from begining to end, altho it coulda had some more blood.  I never read the comic, but after seeing the movie, I'm pretty sure it was a good comic.  If you wanna see a decent action thriller movie, then check this out.<br /><br />peace</p></br></body></html>

There is a time in every person's life in which he/she feels isolated from the world, perhaps out of place or unjustly a receiver of misfortune.  Travis, on the other hand, is consumed by this sense of loneliness and despair, taking it to the brink of pure destruction and maniacal proportions.<p>DeNiro is hauntingly right on as the former Vietnam veteran who decides to get a job as a taxi driver for the streets of New York City.  As he cruises the big-city landscape, he realizes all of the hidious crime, starvation, murder, death, and macabre that consumes society.  When he is rejected by a love interest (Shepherd) due to his out-of-the-norm behavior, Travis begins a downward spiral:  he begins to train as if he were still in the military, buys numerous firearms and weapons, and ultimately plans to stage an assasination attempt on one of the political candidates planning to take over the city.<p>When Travis meets a twelve-year old prostitute (Jodie Foster, in a extremely profound and witty introductory performance), his motivations for violence and release are geared towards the awful individuals who have taken this poor girl into their possession and are encouraging her into a filthy profession.  This hatred for filth causes Travis to explode, creating a tormenting, horrific climax that will be remembered as one of the most severe in film history.  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is certainly an acquired taste and not a film for all adults.  It is a strikingly honest tale of how the inner troubles of a man can be extremely exaggerated, to the point that he knows no boundaries.<p>Director Scorsese uses dark camera angles and vivid images to portray his story, incorporating a musical score that embodies the essence of the film: an unoffensive saxaphone that dwindles into a deep, resounding boom.  A film that can shock and chill, one that should be celebrated for its original genius, but also a work that is almost too graphic and emotionally-draining to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>As I watched Taxi Driver for the first time in twenty-odd years, I was reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable.  Not because Unbreakable comes anywhere close to Taxi Driver in terms of cinematic merit, but because Taxi Driver seemed to be aiming at the same broad theme--a comic book-style hero in a gritty, adult world. Because, if anything, Travis Bickle seems to fit quite closely a real world Batman, enraged by the injustices of the world, unable to fit in, and ultimately taking the law into his own hands.  He has a raw honesty--in sizing up people, in not being offended by a porn movie--and an uncontrollable urge to act on a primal sense of right and wrong.<p>Clearly, Travis is also more complex--and more disturbed--than the average comic book hero.  After all, Scorcese is aiming for real life (as to which Unbreakable is a pale, upper-middle-class imitation), and Travis' own, flat reaction to his apparent "psychosis" (his lamentations about having "these thoughts" was particularly impressive) betray a condition that at least fits our preconceived notions of what it means to be mentally "ill."  But, unlike so many "sane" people, Travis does the unthinkable--he speaks to people honestly and openly, he gets enraged by injustice and immorality (no one else in the movie seems to care very much about 12 year old prostitutes), he has a nobility about himself (not giving in to sexual temptation from Jodie Foster's character).  And his apparent planning to attack a presidential candidate (the movie is never really clear as to whether he intends to harm the man, or even scare him) seems driven by the falsity of the candidate's message--his "we are the people" mantra echoing in a world where the common people (at least those encountered by Travis) are the last ones you'd want running things.<p>The ending is fascinating.  Is it real or a fantasy?  The clippings of newspaper articles, as the camera scans across the board, say Travis is dead, and then later that he is comatose, but recovering.  I suspect that the ending is a dream, the hallucination of a dying man who has his nobility vindicated in the end by appreciative parents and a city that needs more men like him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>A film like "Taxi Driver" could not be made today.  Even in it's day it was highly misunderstood even among it's admirers as an exploitation film.  The first time I saw this film was on a double-bill in 1982 with a repugnant slasher film, "Maniac".  It's reputation probably wasn't helped because it was the impetus for an assassination attempt on the President.  The seventies saw a lot of daring films greenlighted but even by these permissive standards "Taxi Driver" must have been a tough sell.  The story centers on the paranoia of a lonely, disengaged taxi driver,Travis Bickle, played by Robert DeNiro who is disgusted with the vice of his chosen city, New York.  He may be more dangerous than the vermin he dispises.  When his feeble attempts to connect with other people are rebuffed he falls back on the only way he knows, violence.  He also elevates himself in his mind as some kind of avenging angel.  He takes it upon himself to be the protector of a 13 year-old prostitute, whether she wants to be saved or not.  It goes without saying that DeNiro gives a commanding and daring performance here.  It was his first starring role in a major film and he makes an impression.  He is ably supported by a supporting cast that includes Harvey Keitel as a pimp, Cybil Shepherd as a pretty campaign worker who rebuffs Travis after he takes her to a porn film, and a young Jodie Foster as the prostitute.  Director Martin Scorsese does a superior job from an excellent script from Paul Schrader.  This was Schrader's first script that was produced and he has never surpassed "Taxi Driver" with any subsequent screenplays.  The cinematography by Michael Chapman is excellent, a kind of hazy picture of vice-ridden New York before it was cleaned up.  Enough cannot be said about the jazzy score by Bernard Herrmann that heightens whatever mood is being conveyed.  This DVD contains an excellent documentary, but no commentary by Scorsese.  On a final note, is the last scene reality or a dream?  Does Betsey(Shepherd) really get in Travis' taxi or is it something he just imagines like so many other things?</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>One of the best movies of all time.  There's a short list of movies one needs to experience more than just watch and this is one of them.  I'd throw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a> on that list.<br /><br />A really effective movie that gets you to contemplate your own surroundings.  Nothing is it at rest here and Scorsese and De Niro really bring this character to screen, especially De Niro.  You can't even consider him a "character" after watching De Niro's brilliant performance as Travis Bickle.<br /><br />The extras on this disc are amazing also.  Two commentaries and plenty of featurettes.  Finally, a fit version for this masterpiece of a movie.<br /><br />One of the best character studies of all time.  Highly recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Taxi Driver is set in New York, and focuses on a loner cab driver named Travis Brickle ( Robert De Niro). Travis is a somewhat mentally unstable Vietnam vet, who is sickened by the sleaze and violence that he sees at night on the streets of New York. One night, Travis has an encounter with a young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) and becomes determined to persuade her to leave her pimp (Harvey Kietel). As Travis slowly decends into depression, paranoia, and overall madness, he becomes determined to rid the streets of crime himself.<p>Taxi Driver is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. The reason the story is so great, is because it involves a taxi driver whose only human contact is the fares that he takes, which forces him to concentrate on the worst that society has to offer. This is what makes Travis feel like he is the only solution to society's problems. The film slowly takes you through each step of Travis's decent into madness. Travis Brickle is Robert De Niro's best performance in my opinion. DeNiro's ability to slowly break down the character is amazing, and watching De Niro transform himself into a crazy vigilante will give you the creeps. This includes the classic scene with De Niro standing in front of the mirror saying &quot;You talkin to me?!!&quot;. Jodi Foster, Harvey Kietel, Peter Boyle, and the rest of the cast were all great in their roles as well.<p>Overall, Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films. The film effectively showcases the scum of society and the creation of a crazy vigilante, and Robert De Niro gives the best performance of his career. The DVD features an oustanding making of featurette featuring Robert De Niro, Jodi Foster, and director Martin Scorsese.<p>A solid 5 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>'Taxi Driver' is one of the most passionate films ever made, everyone involved did it with such professionalism and dedication that you can't help but admire it. Scorsese scored big with this one, although this wasn;t  his first masterpiece, 'Mean Streets', another Scorsese triumph was made in  1973. Powerhouse directing by Scorsese, and brilliant screenplay by Paul  Schrader. But the acting is the thing that blows you away. Robert DeNiro  delivers one of the most expertly realized performances of all time, he  'was' Travis Bickle, the ultimate antihero, loneliness and violence have  never mixed so well together. His performance was basically a big  improvisation, the whole 'you talking to me' scene was never staged, that  was pure DeNiro. Travis Bickle is just about the loneliest character in the  history of cinema, and that's what 'Taxi Driver' is all about, basically  loneliness. Also a powerhouse performance by a very young Jodie Foster as a  12 year old prostitute, that's a role that could never be done again, even  now in the 22nd century. Cybill Sheppard and, surprise, Albert Brooks are  also good in support. An unforgettable film that really leaves an impact. A  milestone 70's film. Extras: you can spot Martin Scorsese in the background  in the scene where we first see Cybill Sheppard in her white dress, he also  appears as the psycho whose wife is cheating on him and takes Travis along  for the ride. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'Taxi Driver' is a dark film looking at one mans alienation from society and life around him. It looks at how he gradually descends into his own form of madness and you really get a sense for how he feels through De Niros chilling portrayal. The lack of sleep and night shifts Travis (the main protagonist) works only serve to isolate him further from reality and life. When he meets a young political campaigner and a prostitute, both of these relationships spur him into dark action against the scum of new york. I have to say the direction and acting was excellent, you really get a feel for the malevolence Travis feels around him and his sense of disjointed exhaustion. The soundtrack is very dated now and the same jazzy refrain used throughout the film started to get on my nerves. It is a good film and definitely one to watch, but I have to say I was expecting so much more after all the hype on these pages and from things i've heard before that I was left a touch disappointed. The ending is powerful and then kind of fizzles out afterwards, you'll know what I mean when you watch it. Overall a good film and worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>i can't believe i waited this long to finally watch this classic.this is one brilliant film.De Niro is excellent as the title character AKA Travis Bickel.Martin Scorsese directed this masterpiece.i don't wanna to oversell this film,but it's something else.i'm not gonna give any of the plot away,because i think any way who goes into this should view it without any preconceived notions.DE Niro is brilliant here,that much i'll say.i also loved the look of the film,the style,the colours.if you haven't seen it,i would highly recommend it.for me,Taxi Driver is a 5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>I'd heard Taxi Driver was a great movie, and with Scorcese at the helm and all kinds of famous actors in it to boot, I was expecting good things.  Nor was I disappointed.  Taxi Driver is a special movie.  It's a character study on one hand, a philisophical treatise on the other.  It simultaneously entertains with it's sultry shots of 1975 NYC, lots of good dialogue between the characters, and a story line that unfolds naturally - people who appreciate photography will especially like Taxi Driver - it's a joy to watch Scorcese tell this tale.<br /><br />The movie is accessible on many levels, the acting is fantastic and the story itself, subtle, violent, occasionally funny - and finally, something to think about for those that are paying attention.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />The thing to notice is when he's trying to decide if he should 'do a bad thing' and he's talking to one of the other taxi drivers asking for advice.  One of the things the guy says as he tries to talk him down is that we are what we do.. like you do a job, and that becomes who you are.  This movie is never very 'in your face' about it's message if it could be said to have one at all.  But what does happen?  Either way, Travis is kind of a sick puppy with the desire to kill.  When that desire is aimed at the politician, he's a wacko (he wants to whack him because the girl he loves and who rejected him, is working on his campaign - this would be a kind of revenge, showing who 'has the power' - in his twisted mind).<br /><br />On the other hand, he meets the underage prostitute (Jodie Foster), devolops a protective streak towards her and ultimately ends up offing her pimp and other would-be enablers of her profession.  This happens somewhat by accident.  His first mission was to off the politicician.  He takes up Jody Foster's mission as kind of a side inspiration and does the deed before he gets a chance to kill the politician.  When the smoke clears he's a hero.  An accidental hero.  Again, the words of the older taxi driver are fulfilled: 'You are what you do'.<br /><br />The IRONY is that it could so easily have gone the other way.  What would he have been if he'd managed to hit the politician?  Had it gone as he'd originally planned, he'd certainly have been nothing less than the 'trash' he despised - from any rational person's point of view.  How much of what we do is up to chance, luck, or as fate would have it?  The movie seems to unconsciously ask this question.  Travis is a 'walking contradiction'.  He hates the scum, the sickos, the perverts, but finally, it's only a stroke of fate that distinguishes him from them.<br /><br />Taxi Driver is a great ride, and there are many reasons to see it.<br /><br />Loved the mohawk. This movie is hard as nails.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Probably the most grittiest film from the 1970's, "Taxi Driver" stars Robert DeNiro as a New York cab driver who falls for a girl (played by Cybil Shepherd) working as a supporter for a would-be Senator. After she dumps him the taxi driver decides to garner her attention by attempting to shoot the politician in cold blood. The other plot of the movie focuses on the DeNiro character discovering a young prostitute (played by Jodie Foster) and his attempts to get her pimp away from her. The movie is well-known for its use of firearms and the line "You talkin' to me?" The film is violent, especially the last moments of the film, but this kind of motion picture had to be made to show the seediest side of New York City and how people survive in a metropolis. The movie garnered 4 Oscar nods including ones for Best Picture, Best Actor for DeNiro, and Best Supporting Actress for Foster. This set includes a "Making-of Documentary" which is informative and entertaining with interviews with the cast and crew. The American Film Institute listed "Taxi Driver" as "One Of The Best Films Of All Time!".</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>"Travis Bickle" has to be one of the most fascinating characters ever put on film, and this has to still rank as one of the best post-film noir era "noirs" ever made.<br /><br />Yeah the story is a bit seedy but it's an incredibly interesting portrait of a mentaly unbalanced cab driver (Bickle, played by Robert De Niro) and his obsessions with "cleaning up" New York City.<br /><br />In addition to De Niro's stunning performance, we see a young and gorgeous Cybill Shepherd and a very, very young (12 years old) Jodie Foster. I've always wondered what kind of parents would allow their 12-year-old daughter to play a role like this, but that's another subject. Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel (with shoulder-length hair!) and Peter Boyle all lend good supporting help.<br /><br />Bickle's transformation from a "disturbed" cabbie to a fully-deranged assassin is fantastic to watch, and includes one of the classic scenes in all film history: Bickle talking to the mirror and repeating the question, "You talking' to me?" That scene, and seeing De Niro in a Mohawk haircut later at a political rally are two scenes people never forget.<br /><br />The more times I've watched this, the more I appreciate the cinematography and the music in here. There are some wonderful night shots of the city's oil and rain-slicked streets. Also, Bernard Herrmann eerie soundtrack is an instrumental part of the success of this film and should never be neglected in discussing this film.<br /><br />I hope a good Blu-Ray, (high-defintiiom) transfer of this film will come out soon.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a mess. He can't sleep. His diet consists of pills and junk-food. Mostly though, Travis is lonely. He's utterly alone in the milling crowds of NYC. Travis doesn't understand how the city got this bad, this full of filth and human debris. Why has it been allowed to degenerate into such a cesspool? Why is he the only one who seems to notice or care? Why are all women the same? Why are all men such low-life trash? Why can't someone do something about it? It's up to Travis Bickle to make things right. To clean out this festering wound. Travis has a plan. He'll get the job done. Now, all he needs is a bunch of guns. TAXI DRIVER is the 1976 shocker from Martin Scorsese that scared a generation! So real is it's presentation of mental disintegration and mass murder that it has been blamed for many of society's ills. DeNiro is absolutely in the skin of Travis Bickle, bringing out subtle mannerisms and quirks that make him as complex as he is terrifying. Jodie Foster (12yo at the time) is so convincing as Iris / Easy the prostitute that she steals every scene she's in, especially in the diner. Iris is the only one Travis considers to be worth saving. She is the one pure person in an otherwise hopelessly diseased city. She is also just as lonely and in need of love as Travis himself. If he can save Iris, he can salvage some piece of himself. The other characters, such as Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), Wizard (Peter Boyle), and Sport (Harvey Keitel) are important in helping Travis to reach his breaking point. These are the people who either cause the problems or have no good answers to solve them. Betsy's rejection is a stab through his soul. Wizard's advice is useless drivel. Sport's domination of Iris is intolerable. Travis finally cracks wide open, becoming outwardly what he'd been fantasizing internally for quite a while. He'll fix it all. He'll make it right. Nothing else matters. This movie is cinematic perfection! Highest recommendation...</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>Being a cab driver for almost 18 years, Taxi Driver is a personal favorite of mine. Driving a cab is like a drug: you get to meet new people everyday; you don't have to wait a week or two to get paid---everything's cash money; you get to know the whole city; you learn where the hot spots are--the restaurants, the bars, the clubs, etc. You set your own hours and you choose where you want to work and whom you want to serve. You have no one breathing down your neck--you are your own boss. There's a saying among cabbies: only two kinds of people get more p**** than cabbies: movie stars and rock stars.<br /><br />Being a cab driver is like being a sponge. You become a therapist, a conscience, a drinking buddy, a strip club buddy, a shoulder to cry on, or a one-night stand. People show themselves to you, but you're a cabbie and you've seen it all anyway. For an extra-nice tip, a cab can be a rolling motel, a getaway car, or a safe haven to indulge strange pleasures. A cabbie is faceless from the back seat: he or she won't judge you.<br /><br />After a while, every cabbie develops a callus: every passenger becomes a blur. Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, sees society as converging dots flowing together like the scum on his windshield. Prostitutes, pimps, addicts, and winos gum the sidewalks. Urine stings every breath. Neon melts over his cab. This is the world that Travis lives in, and he hates it more and more everyday.<br /><br />The world has become a toilet to Travis Bickle. Out of this filth appears a flower of virtue that nothing can touch--a young gorgeous campaign-volunteer named Betsy played by Cybill Shepherd. She's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. Driving a cab at night, all Travis sees are whores; however, Betsy's incorruptible, and she alone can redeem mankind. She allows him to take her on a date. Though awkward, he says all the right things. He takes her to the theater to see a movie--a porno flick. Horrified and offended, she hails a cab and leaves him on the sidewalk. Travis is stunned. At that moment, a whore saunters by. They pause to gaze at each other--she is his mirror; they are one and the same.<br /><br />Betsy destroys Travis; she's just like all the others. Now, there's nothing in the world worth saving--now, he knows what he must do. He hones his body and his mind: no more smoking; no more drinking; no more bad food--he must be fit. He'll annihilate Betsy and the whole world. By chance, he stumbles into the middle of a pimp/whore squabble; the whore is a thirteen-year-old girl. Something rises up in Travis's heart, something he never felt before. He discovers something worth saving-- a lost thirteen-year-old whore named Iris (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />Taxi Driver was the second collaboration between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. Bernard Herman's magical score wafts over every scene. Taxi Driver was an omen, forecasting the senseless tragedies of both Columbine and Virginia Tech. No movie collection is adequate without this great film. See it. Buy it.

I had a custom tape made from it at one time.  The story is a great psycho-drama with all of the players perfectly cast.  Jodie Foster is believable as the "baby prostitute," Harvey Kietel, chilling as her pimp and Robert DeNiro is so fascinating to study as Travis Bickle, wierd product of NY subculture of the streets and psychological textbook example.  It is, in retrospect, a brilliant example of post-Vietnam War 1970's atmosphere in the large cities of our country.  Maybe too wierd of a movie for some to watch, but a mainstay of the viewing repretoire of a true artist.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>You've got to have been in a coma for the past 30 years not to have seen this movie.

The big shoot-out towards the end of the film is an unforgettable "classic." Tension-building direction from Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro - The Best.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Director Martin Scorcese and Robert De Niro (as Travis Bickle) collaborated on a film unlike almost any other I have seen. What to say about it? Bickle is a delusional and dysfunctional (probably deranged) taxi driver in Manhattan who is strongly attracted to Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful young woman centrally involved in the political campaign of Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris); Bickle also attempts to befriend Iris (Jodie Foster), a runaway teenage prostitute. He proclaims "I'm God's lonely man!" In some respects resembling the psychotic character Archer Maggott played by Telly Savalas in The Dirty Dozen, Bickle also sees himself as God's avenging angel whose mission in life is to eliminate all of the evil which he perceives in his world. After recently seeing this film again, I asked myself the same question I did in 1976: How many Travis Bickles are out there? All of the performances are outstanding. Working carefully with Paul Schrader's screenplay on which he presumably collaborated, Scorcese portrays a sordid, potentially violent underworld which is most dangerous after all the "good people" are comfortably settled and secure in their homes. Laurent Bouzereau's 70-minute "making of" feature provided with the Collector's Edition is highly informative, as are the mini-biographies of Scorcese, De Niro, Keitel, Foster, and Shepherd.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This is the film that made DeNiro and Scorsese famous!

Two things that Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) obviously is. The movies starts out with Travis going to a cab company for a job. The reason is he can't sleep at nights. At his job he meets a lot of odd people in his cab. But, he also meets his share when off work too. Like fellow cabbie Wizard (Peter Boyle) whom at one point Travis tries confiding in. He really is loney and has no one to be with. All he does is drive his cab, untill, one day he meets Betsy (Cybill Shepherd). She's working on political campaign for some politician. At first she thinks he's &quot;creepy&quot;. Tom (Albert Brooks) has I would say a crush on her. At first he tries to &quot;defend&quot; her against him. After the two go out for a brief time. She becomes digusted with him after he tries to take her to go see an adult movie. At this point the insanity kicks in. He now starts to talk about how the streets of New York make him sick. Everyone is &quot;scum&quot;. He can't breathe the air. In an effort to &quot;free&quot; himself, he decides to &quot;save&quot; a very young prositute Iris (Jodie Foster). The problem first of all is, she doesn't think she needs to be saved. She thinks things are going ok. Secondly, her pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) says he loves her. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; hits so many right spots to keep our interest. It has so many powerful moments. The acting by De Niro is truly a standout. His Oscar nomination was rightfully deserved. We see this transformation in his character, and to me, it's spellbounding. His &quot;our you looking at me&quot; speech has to be one of the most OVER quoted lines in film history, it's right up there with &quot;What am I a clown? Am I here to amuse you?&quot;. Scorsese is a director of considerable outstanding talents and this film allows him to showcase it very well. He also has a small cameo as a jealous husband who is spying on his wife, who is cheating on him.

It is, I believe, the first movie that really showed the brilliance of Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul  Schrader. This is a dark, disturbing journey into madness, realistically  capturing the mean streets in all their realism. Travis Bickle (Robert  DeNiro), is a deep examination of a man falling deeper and deeper into the  abyss of madness. Driven even deeper by what he sees in the world around  him. Schrader's screenplay at times has the feel of a documentary, as does  Scorsese's adaptation onto film. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; vibrates with a  realism seen in few movies. Maybe that's why it has stood the test of time  triumphantly. Seeing this movie once is not enough, because you need to see  it more than once to really get what it's saying, to truly understand it.  Scorsese's film is gritty and at times, shocking, but not dumb or bloody  just for entertainment. &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; explores through Bickle,  the nature of crazy people, really getting into the mind of a lonely man  who doesn't know much about the outside world because he seldom goes out to  explore it. The film is always interesting, Scorsese brings it to life  through the settings, camera angles and cinematography. The shoot-out at  the end is one of the most brilliant ever filmed because it seems  realistic, but not over-exagerrated, it's shocking, but we understand it.  &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; opened doors for more filmmakers who wanted to make  movies that didn't hold back, that were realistic in their representation  of the dark corners of society. It stands as a brilliant work which will be  studied and endured for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Robert De Niro's performance in TAXI DRIVER remains, after twenty-five years, one of the most powerful ever witnessed in an American film.  It is almost shocking today that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.  The reason isn't hard to locate.  Just as Shirley MacLaine lost in 1960 to Elizabeth Taylor when Academy voters thought the latter might be dying (obviously, she survived), so Robert De Niro lost in 1976 when Peter Finch, who had been nominated for NETWORK, actually died.  I liked Finch in NETWORK, but today his performance seems to pale beside that of De Niro's.  In addition to Henry Fonda's mythic performance as Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, it is almost inconceivable that his performance was not acknowledged at the time.<p>De Niro is in very nearly every scene in this film, and without a stunning performance in that role, you do not get a stunning film.  Luckily, De Niro is unforgettable.  Although his famous scene in front of the mirror (the "You talking to me" scene, which was entirely improvised) is rightfully celebrated, in every second of the film his presence dominates.  I seem to remember reading years ago in an interview with screenwriter Paul Schrader that Travis Bickle was based very much on the narrator from Dostoevsky's NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND.  If he didn't say that, I will.  It isn't just that Travis seems socially out of place, but morally and metaphysically out of place.  He doesn't seem to be a person with a genuine core, and at the end of the film, he seems equally capable of good or evil.  He ends up doing good, but Scorsese has pointed to the arbitrariness of his actions.  He could easily have assassinated the political candidate instead of the pimp.  He ends the movie a hero, but an more an ironic hero than an anti-hero.  In a flip of a metaphysical coin, he accidentally ends up a good guy instead of a madman.<p>In a way, this film is a group effort, with tremendous performances by Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster, and a tremendous score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann (CITIZEN KANE, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO).  But the main credit for this film should go jointly to De Niro, Scorsese, and Paul Schrader.  Unbelievably, neither Scorsese nor Schrader even received an Oscar nomination.  This, of course, says a lot more about the inherent conservatism of the Academy than about the job these men did.  In fact, most of the greatest directors to work in American cinema (Hitchcock, Ernst Lubitsch, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Orson Welles, among many others) never won a Best Director Oscar, and neither has Scorsese.  And very few better, more literate scripts have been produced in America.  <p>I'm writing here on the assumption that anyone reading this has seen this film, probably more than once.  If that isn't the case, this truly is one of the greatest American films.  It is a landmark film, showing the ferocity and loneliness that many find in modern life in a way that has only rarely been portrayed in any art form, whether cinema or literature.  To say that it is a "must see" film doesn't do it justice.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Is there an American film more wrongly and regularly misinterpreted than Martin Scorsese's 1976 masterpiece, Taxi Driver? Not even 2001: A Space Odyssey, by Stanley Kubrick, nor Apocalypse Now, by Francis Ford Coppola, have been intellectually, politically, and critically twisted and turned away from what they really are- and this all aside and apart from the silly debates over art influencing real world violence after John W. Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, in 1981, due to his own obsession with actress Jodie Foster. The film has been deconstructed and reconstructed (see references to Death Wish and The Searchers) according to prevailing political and artistic whims more than several times, and matters have been further complicated by the many claims of the film's protagonists, from screenwriter Paul Schrader (is there a better example of a filmic one hit wonder?), to director Scorsese, to star Robert De Niro, the claims and counterclaims about the film have devolved into legendry.<br /><br />Taxi Driver was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, but lost out to the formulaic boxer flick, Rocky, penned by Sylvester Stallone It did, however, win the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not only a great motion picture, but it is one of the best portraits of a character ever filmed, and Travis Bickle is one of the scariest characters in film history. Probably only Martin Landau's character, Judah Rosenthal, in Woody Allen's Crimes And Misdemeanors, is more truly horrifying (and certainly far more evil). But Bickle is every bit as scary, for he is far more unpredictable to those about him. Yes, he is not a cold blooded murderer, like Rosenthal, but he is certainly violent, and a racist- not of the KKK White Supremacist sort, but of the passive, scared little white boy sort; and much mileage has been gotten from the fact that the film's final shootout victims were all white, when in the original screenplay they had been all black (Scorsese and Schrader bowed to studio pressure to change that fact, because by not making a change, the beancounters claimed, the film might incite race riots, and lead to financial culpability). These elements are what make Bickle scary, and why he is so realistically portrayed. Yet, there is also the niggling truth even the film seems loath to admit, that Travis Bickle really and truly IS a hero, and not merely a crazed lunatic. Note that I wrote `not merely,' for this is an important point: because most critics resort to binary thought in such matters, that does not change the fact that Bickle is a dangerous and paranoid man and a hero; and these are not mutually opposing claims. And by `hero,' I mean it in the absolutely most sober sense of the word. Heroes are not perfect men, but they are real men (and women, of course). And heroes are not necessarily even ethically `good' men (imagine that!). But they are brave, they are determined, and they are relentless, in the pursuit of the goals, things, and people, they deem as good. But, most of all they are `real,' not like the fictive heroes that populate books and films, comic books and video games. And rarely has there ever been a more chillingly realistic portrayal of a hero in film than Travis Bickle. Now, do me the favor of not misinterpreting that, ok?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese, the writer/director of the Taxi Driver, has admitted that this film is the cathartic result of a bevy of dark thoughts that surrounded his mind during a very low period of his life. By the time the credits finally make their merciful way on screen, we can see exactly what Scorsese saw during those days and the residual effect it has on us, the viewers, will likely stay hauntingly familiar long after we have watched the conclusion of this film.<br /><br />PLOT:<br /><br />Tavis Bickle, a taxi driver and volunteer for a New York City political campaign, has tried it all. He's attempted doing things the right way, treating people with kindness and women with respect. Nevertheless, he is ignored and his chivalrous advances continually stepped upon or altogether discarded by one person after another. It is when Tavis realizes that he will forever be average and overlooked that he decides to make drastic changes in his world. Almost at once he begins driving the most dangerous portions of New York in his taxi, scouring the nighttime landscape with his mind cultivating a solution to his own personal, dark problems. Soon, his decision becomes conclusive: he will become a vigilante, and his first offering to the world will be in aiding a young teenaged prostitute by providing her a way out, no matter what it may cost Tavis personally in the process.<br /><br />Perhaps Scorsese's most poignant film, The Taxi Driver offers a bleak, but somehow refreshing, alternative to the concept of "taking it lying down." Here, in his vision, there is another solution, and one in which while many of us fantasize about, almost all of us refuse to make a reality.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>'Taxi Driver' is a classic.  Although it may seem dated, it is still a facinating study of lonliness and the paranoia, sadness, and frustration it can bring.  De Niro brings one of his best performances as a former vet slowly going psychotic.  A must see, but not for the faint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Travis Bickle is a cab driver. A cab driver because that is all he can do. In New York he feels the heat. He does not like what he sees in the back of his cab. He listens to it, and sees it, but he does not like it. He does not like it because everything is false. He believes that the world is not a good place. He believes that the America he lives in is one big fake. Maybe this is because Travis does not do anything more than drive a cab, but soon he will change all that. He will change it all for the better.<p>Travis is a man of morals. Travis is a taxi driver. Travis drives his taxis at night because he prefers that. Travis wants to do more but Travis does not want another job. Travis is not happy with what he does but it is all that he can do. Travis sees a woman who he likes. She is working for a Presidential candidate. Travis stalks her. Travis meets her. Travis does what anyone else would do when they go out with a girl. He takes her to see a blue movie.<p>Travis is dumped. Travis does not understand why. This is all further proof that everything is wrong about America. Travis sees a way to change all that. <p>This is the world according to Travis. A world that Travis will pack some heat with. Travis will have his revenge on them all. Travis will show them who is who and what is what. Travis will practice his lines in front of the mirror for that final confrontation that will show the world who he is and what is right and what is wrong.<p>"You talkin' to me?"<p>No one will stop Travis from completing his new found objective.

Travis will be the hero in the end... you'll see... oh yes you will...<p>*This is simply one of the all-time great classics about urban paranoia, isolation and redemption. De Niro practically holds the whole film on his own from start to finish. The ending is still one of the most shocking endings you will ever see. This is A+ drama with powerhouse acting. Unmissable.*</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in.  Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills.  Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>Few will disagree with me when I say that Scorsese's Taxi Driver is one of the greatest films ever made. This one helped define the 70s and changed the face of American cinema. Scorsese's directing is brilliant. DeNiro has never been better, nor has Cybill Shepard (except in The Last Picture Show). This is one of Harvey Keitel's finest performances, and Jodi Foster has her best role here. The acting is superb. The cinematography was groundbreaking with the camera moves Scorsese made. Superb editing. And while Bernard Herrmann's score is dated (definitely from the 70s), it is a classic and fits this film in a way no other music ever could. Add that to the fact that Herrmann died just after finishing recording for this film. What a way to end your career. This film is superb in every way.<p>The dvd is a treasure as well. You get a making of documentary that lasts just over an hour, taking the place of a commentary track (and this is one of the few documentaries that can replace a commentary track). There are storyboards, the screenplay, filmographs, advertising materials, and a photo montage that is narrated and covers trivia that isn't discussed in the documentary. This is a fine edition. <p>This is the movie that brought Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese, Jodi Foster, and Paul Schrader to forefront of the American eye.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>"Taxi Driver" is a classic, no matter what anyone says.  It's even considred one of the best 100 films of all time by the American Film Institute.  That alone says a lot, because a film donesn't reach that spot by accident.  This is a timely classic that continues to entertain people all around over and over again.<p>Directed by the great Martin Scorsese, this is the story about a man named, Travis Bickle.  He cannot sleep so he decides to be a taxi driver by night.  From his job he has seen the worst of the worst, and every day he seems to be losing his mind.  He turns psychotic every day and it only gets worse.  It eventually gets to the point where Travis wants to kill someone; anyone.  This is a terrifying glimpse into the darkest parts of city life that very few dare to explore.  This is the tale of one man who has had enough.<p>The movie is very well directed and written.  It is beautiful, dark, and haunting.  Disturbing as it may be, the story has such realism to it.  Robert De Niro outdoes himself in this film.  You can sense his drifting into madness so clear that it's scary.  They could have not achieved this goal if they had casted someone else for the role.<p>My favorite scene in the movie has to be when De Niro is talking to the secret service man.  It's so funny and yet so chilling at the same time.  And, of course, who can forget watching De Niro talking to himself in the mirror.  "You talkin' to ME?"<p>This new DVD version is beautiful.  The picture quality is outstanding, considering how old this film is, and that I once had the older version that just came out when DVDs were only getting started.  Lots of special features on this disk.  If you have the older version of this movie and you love this picture, I urge you to go and get this newer version of the DVD.  It is ten times better.<p>This is a classic, and no one can ever take that away.  However, keep in mind that since this is a classic, it does not mean that you will like the movie.  I cannot tell you if you will like it or not, and neither can anybody else.  Just because "Citizen Kane" is a classic didn't change the fact that I didn't like that movie.  If you are currious to see it, then rent it and see if you enjoy it.  Even if it turns out that you don't like it, I clearly doubt that this will be the worst rental you will choose.  "Taxi Driver" is a magnificent work of art, and it is film-making like you have never seen.  A great movie that can never be duplicated.  A spectacular film.  Not one single complaint here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>I can see why people love this movie and why others hate it. Taxi Driver is a mixed bag for me, parts of the film I find interesting but there are some slow and boring sections for me as well. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor, this is his defining role. Jodie Foster is also good as well, she plays a young streetwalker and De Niro's character tries to save her from a life on filth and suffering. The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>The 1970's are widely regarded as perhaps the most artistically exciting era in film, and "Taxi Driver" stands as one of the finest films of that great period and 30 years later, "Taxi Driver" is still Scorsese's best film and one of the greatest films of all time.  If, for whatever reason, you have any interest in films at all and still haven't seen "Taxi Driver", don't put it off another day.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver's" inimitable success is rooted in its two most prominent and seemingly conflicting elements: De Niro's brilliant, empathetic and real lead performance alongside Scorsese's expressionistic, overblown visuals.  Countless films have portrayed the city, and New York City in particular, as a hellish netherworld, but few do so as absolutely and convincingly as "Taxi Driver".  The NYC of "Taxi Driver" is a blinding, neon-lit freakshow of streetwalkers, killers and (worst of all) politicians where the billowing steam rises from sewer vents to hide the squalor in an opaque mist and the rain pours forever down.  Few viewers are liable to be too fond of what they see in this unreal city, and neither does Travis Bickle, our tortured anti-hero and one of the most memorable characters in all film.  Schrader deserves a lot of credit for conceiving Bickle so brilliantly, but few actors, if any, could've brought life to his contradictory yet somehow understandable personality like Robert De Niro.  These three figures, Scorsese, Schrader and De Niro, are the core of the film, but almost everything else comes together to perfection as well.<br /><br />This film is all about Travis Bickle, so much so that he's never off screen for more than a minute or two at a time, and not often at that.  Travis isn't from New York City, and isn't a part of it, though he still, somehow, seems to belong.  Bickle  is a lot of things, but his main trait is obvious from the get-go:  He is alone, alienated.  He hates the city;  he prays for the rain to come wash the filth from the streets, but he's drawn to those streets at the same time.  Travis, unable to sleep at night, decides to become a taxi driver even though he loathes and fears his clientele.  His reasons for taking the job, though unstated, are apparent:  Better to face the depravity of the streets than live alone with the uncertainty and emptiness within himself day in and day out.  When not working Travis sits alone in his dingy apartment, staring at the television with indifference, pours his anger into his diary and haunts seedy downtown porno theaters.  He feels a need to find something more, something outside of himself, but he doesn't know what it could be.  Before too long he finds a cause, a reason to exist, in the form of the beautiful campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and, later, the plight of teen-runaway Iris (Jodie Foster).  He wants to be with them, to protect them, but do they want that?  Do they need that?<br /><br />Bickle is a great character, for me anyway, because he's just a first-rate, if highly exaggerated and malformed, representation of the conflicts that breed in many people, particularly young men, I think. (Myself included.)  Bickle is a pure embodiment of idealism/romanticism curdling into bitter cynicism; the former, however, never totally dies and serves as fuel for the latter.  Travis acutely feels the sort of hopelessness that comes with this perspective; there's nothing Bickle can do, nothing logical, anyway, that will make any difference in the depraved world,  so he mindlessly loathes the darkness and clings to the few remaining misplaced threads of idealism (Placed in the two women he obsesses over, neither of whom much resembles what he imagines them to be) a coping method which inexorably leads to his final explosion.  As far as personal reflections go I, and almost all of us who can feel for Travis, aren't 1/1000 as messed up and nutty as he is, but the reflection is still there and that makes him really hit home.  You can't excuse his behavior, nor does the film ask you to, but you can see where he's coming from.  (Well, for the most part.  Some of the leaps he makes are pretty out there, but he *is* a nut...)<br /><br />I haven't said all that much about the plot so far, but there isn't really that much to say.  Travis drives the cab, fixates on the two females, muses on and on and eventually loses it at the violent finale.  But man, there are some great individual scenes stuffed in this frame:  Travis picks up a deranged man (played by Scorsese) who gives a chilling monologue about his plans to punish his unfaithful spouse; Travis converses with Wizard (A great turn from Peter Boyle) about life; We see Bickle's bizarre training regimen in his apartment as he prepares for the end; Travis humiliates himself horribly when he tries to go after Betsy. These individually great scenes all come together in climax that is absolutely stunning and brutal.<br /><br />A few odds and ends:<br /><br />- I love the criticism of politicians found here.  The film just has Palantine talk for some time and he *never* comes close to saying anything meaningful.  You can't fight your way through the slogans and double-talk, cause that's all there is.<br /><br />- "Taxi Driver" has some effective humor in it for such a bleak film.  I particularly enjoy the lie-filled letter Travis composes to his parents towards the end.<br /><br />- I'm not a huge fan of the score.  It works well in the most dramatic scenes but, as usual, Hermann never lets off.  He's always overblown beyond belief.<br /><br />- I don't have a strong position on whether the ending is reliable or not.  Both ways work for me.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Brilliant movie.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This searing movie from Martin Scorcese is one of the great films of the 1970's. It features Robert DeNiro in the role of a lifetime, as ex-Vietnam vet Travis Bickle, who can't sleep and drives a Cab at night as a form of therapy. Travis also has trouble relating to people and it is this that gives him difficulties when he meets Betsy (played wonderfully by Cybill Shepherd) and things go from bad to worse when he then meets Iris (Jodie Foster) a teenage prostitute.... The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle and Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Scorsese works magic in this film. A number of scenes from this film are unforgettable and some have become iconic. Obviously the "Are you talking to me..." mirror scene is the most well known but there are a number of others. Travis winds up a Secret Service agent, suggesting he would like to join. This is marvellously played, and you will notice that Travis has made some slight adjustments to his hair. Another classic scene, which certainly influenced Quentin Tarantino for a scene in 'Reservoir Dogs', is where Travis goes to buy some guns. The dialog is marvellous. Full credit to Paul Schrader for the brilliant script, without his contribution the film would not have as good.<br /><br />The film also contains the last ever film score from Bernard Hermann who had previously done Citizen Kane and Psycho to name but two. This score is really excellent. A Jazzy saxophone with a haunting melody, but that changes menacingly without warning. Quite brilliant.<br /><br />This is, particularly at the end, a very violent film and one with an ending that may leave you perplexed.

As he begins developing more psychotic thoughts, the plot becomes more interesting.  The several twists and turns keep audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  The grizzly streets of New York City offer a closer, more interesting look into every event.  Such dark theme makes this film ahead of its time; in fact, some may say it's also ahead of our time.  The multiple storylines keep the plot interesting the whole time, namely a woman, Betsy, he's obsessed with and a twelve-year-old prostitute, Iris (nickname &quot;Easy&quot;), that he wants to help.  This leads to a powerful conclusion.  The presented quality deserved its four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture of 1976.<p>The actors add their own powerful psychotic theme to &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.  Robert De Niro plays Travis delightfully.  His every expression is flawless.  Jodie Foster plays Iris beautifully as her character's pain and yearning are expressed to the fullest.

I've always said this about this performance in particular because I think it's such an alarmingly scary realization, but when you watch De Niro on screen and really analyze his actions you begin to reason and rationalize with him.  It takes a special kind of actor to elicit sympathy from a man like Travis Bickle, and it's only been done a handful of times (another performance like this one would be Edward Norton's haunting performance in `American History X'...getting sympathy and understanding out of a character we are trained to loathe).  I'm not saying that we condone his actions, but I am saying that we begin to understand where he's coming from even if he's not going about things appropriately.<br /><br />Travis Bickle is the definition of anti-hero.  He's an ex-marine who finds his life has become something he's not particularly proud of yet he's hesitant to really change.  He drives a cab at night because he cannot sleep.  He pursues a woman who barely knows because he wants to feel something, wants to belong somewhere.  He attempts to help a young woman deviate from the life of filth she's been reduced to because in a way it will validate his entire existence.  If he can make a difference then he will understand why he wakes up in the morning.  The problem falls, not in the `quote-unquote' noble aspirations of Bickle but in the harsh and selfish way he goes about fulfilling them.<br /><br />Travis Bickle's viewpoint on the world in which he lives is broadcast front and center.  His anger towards the scum of the earth, the disgusting place his home has become and all who contribute to its downfall is blunt and enveloping.  He has no quarrels expressing his viewpoint to anyone, even if it is offensive and hurtful.<br /><br />`Taxi Driver' is one of those films that demands your attention.  It's so much more than just a movie; it's a revelation, a movement, a statement that cements itself deeply into the viewers psyche.  You'll find yourself thinking about Travis long after the credits have rolled, contemplating his actions and the consequences of such actions.  There has been much debate over the meaning of the conclusion of the film so I'm not going to go into that here.  It's a major spoiler to anyone who has yet to see the film anyways so I feel it's unfair to address that so openly.  Just know that it's deeply ambiguous yet resounding and straightforward when you take the time to break it down.  Just be prepared to ponder it.<br /><br />The acting across the board is fantastic here.  I know that I've talked up De Niro quite a bit here but everyone else does great as well.  Most notable would be Cybill Shepherd and Jodie Foster since their affect on Bickle's life are most obvious.  I've never been a fan of Shepherd (although I loved her work with Willis on `Moonlighting') and so I was blown away by her performance that, while not commanding or necessarily strong, very well conveys the point she needed to make.  Jodie Foster is a standout in what proves to be her breakout performance.  As the young Iris she perfectly captures the frayed innocence of a child in her situation.  The rest of the supporting cast, from Albert Brooks to Peter Boyle to Harvey Keitel, all deliver effectively no matter how limited their screen time.  The most important and ultimately most effective performances though come from Robert De Niro and director Martin Scorsese who delivers such a powerful film here, such a moving and emotionally resonant masterpiece.  Scorsese has always been a master of the lens and his direction here perfectly capture everything from mood to emotion to action from not only his cast but his audience as well.<br /><br />*This DVD, chuck full of Documentaries, Featurettes and Commentaries begs to be owned and lauded.  These features have been explained and listed by many reviewers already so I'll just say that it's well worth the upgrade, especially if you are a huge fan of the film.  It's about time this masterpiece got the respect it deserved.*<br /><br />`Taxi Driver' is the definition of controversy, and it has been hailed by many, loathed by some and feared by others.  But, in the end there is really no denying that a film that can elicit such adamant reactions from its audience is worth the time to see and analyze.  I recommend this film without any hesitation for even if you don't admire, respect and adore this film as I do it will certainly become a topic of long discussion and ultimately that's what any film buff wants to be able to do, discuss a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adult age.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Martin Scorsese's seminal, defining film finally gets the Special Edition it has rightfully deserved for so very long.  This Two-Disc Collector's Edition of Taxi Driver packs a bevy of special features that not only outline the film's history, but it's impact on American cinema, and the impact of Scorsese to boot.  Featuring a new commentary track from writer Paul Schrader, featurettes and discussions with Scorsese, Schrader, Robert De Niro, Oliver Stone, and Roger Corman among others, retrospectives on Schrader's inspirations on writing the film, and comparisons between Travis Bickle's New York of 1975 to the New York of the present day.  As for the film itself, well, chances are if you're reading this, you already know what to expect here, and you already know what a classic Taxi Driver is.  Needless to say, even if you already own the original edition of Taxi Driver on DVD, this new Collector's Edition is a must own for longtime fans of one of the most influential and important films to come out of the 1970's.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have concocted a perfect movie with "Taxi Driver," which follows Robert deNiro's defining role of loner cabbie Travis Bickle.  The claustrophobic sets and tight cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's curiously tasty mix of polyphony and jazz in his final score, and the ever-present foley effect of an alarm clock ticking (connoting Bickle's state of mind of mental deterioration, a human time-bomb waiting to explode) all make for a highly personal character study of this self-described "God's Lonely Man."<p>What's more, Scorsese's triumph is getting the viewer to actually identify and sympathise with Travis, with his sense of isolation from society, with his obsession over Cybill Shepherd, his taking the young prositute, Iris (played with uncanny spunk by a young Jodie Foster) under his wing, and his unflagging mania for vengeance against "the scum, the dogs, the filth."  As he pads anonymously up and down Broadway, as he drives his taxi on rainswept streets in the wee hours of the morning, and as he sits alone in his apartment, pouring peach brandy over his Wheaties, we the viewers are along on his lonely ride and journey into fear.<p>Is Travis the hero, the antihero or the villain of this flick?  It really doesn't matter. Travis is a man compelled, his hand forced by the rot, corruption and indifferent hatred bred on the city streets.  The cesspool of crime is its logical consequence, just as much as is Travis, the loner turned lone gunman.  It is fitting that in his "training" scenes he is wearing cowboy boots, for he has a score to settle.  Not so much with Sport (played with abrasive wit by Harvey Keitel) and the pimps, johns and druggies that people this new urban frontier of lawlessness.  No, they are merely the tangible targets of his psychotic hate; The vengeance Travis metes out with his .44 Magnum is against a world that sees him as a virtual invisible man. Just as society turned their backs on the Vietnam vet, so does the woman of his dreams, Betsy (Shepherd).  Initially, Travis sees her as the last glimmer of hope for the redemption of a society gone to ruin.  But, when she rebuffs and deserts him over the clumsy social faux-pas of taking her to a porno movie on a first date, society loses all meaning to him, and he exacts his vengeance on society in order to transcend her rejection of him.  You can tell his fate is sealed when he sees his life "pointed in one direction....there never has been any choice for me." <p>The setting is modern, but what makes "Taxi Driver" into an eternal classic is its dark and tragic sense-of-life. Scorsese's movies would never be so darkly hopeless after this one; Even the gruesome "Goodfellas" had a much more lighthearted touch (if you can believe it).  This would also be Bernard Herrmann's last score.  In fact, he died just hours after recording the last bars of the score on a Hollywood sound stage.  It is a fitting swan-song for the movies' greatest composer, and a greater loss for Hollywood than they'll ever realise.<p>Darker than almost all films noir, think of "Death Wish" crossed with "Othello" when you think of "Taxi Driver."</p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>TAXI DRIVER is an iconic film, considered by many to be a masterpiece and the crowning achievement of both Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro.  Whatever your opinion this is a powerful film that starts strong and never lets up that has also stood the test of time.  Everything in the movie is done so realistically that the story could still be told today.  Robert  Deniro plays Travis.  We know little about him other than that he is an ex marine and a deep insomniac.  He also sees the world as a dirty place that needs to be cleaned up.  He becomes a taxi driver in the city of New York which takes on a realistic role of its own here.  We see the two sides of everything and the same goes for New York.  Nothing is held back on showing the realistic gritty underside of the city.<br /><br />But what of the transfer of this movie classic to blu ray.  Seems like all the classics are being brought to blu ray, some more succesfully than others.  The questions are always how does it look, is it an improvement over the dvd and does it bring the film to new life.  TAXI DRIVER was the first film to receive an enhanced 4k restoration and what it does is perform magic on a decades old film.  The video presentation is purely amazing.  It is funny for when the film starts the Columbia logo is very fuzzy and then the movie starts.  It is clear, crisp with colors strong.  The film is very definitive in that scenes are either nighttime or daytime, dark or light.  The blacks and dark colors are brilliant and all color ratios amazing.  Whites contrast perfectly.  No matter what the scene everything pops.  The night scenes are very realistic and when colors are introduced they are vibrant and real.  Nothing is overenhanced.  Instead the film looks the way it must have when released originally in theaters.  It is leaps and bounds over any dvd version.  The climactic scene at the end is brought to new devastating life with this new restoration.  Flesh tones are also perfect.  Blu ray is put to amazing use here restoring this classic film to all its glory.  The graininess here is meant to be here.  It represents New York City in full detail.  And the audio is just as perfect.  The DTS 5.1 audio allows the amazing soundtrack to fully blossom and soar over the entire film.  The score here tells the story as much as any character or visual.  And dialogue is strong and present.  Nothing is wrong here.  The film itself is told in a way that it is open to many different interpretations but the blu ray itself needs no debate.  It is spectacular.  I will reiterate again.  The film looks as pure and original as when in the theaters restored to its true glory.  Do not hesitate to double dip if you own the dvd.  This blu ray shows the movie as a whole new experience.  I give this blu ray my highest recommendations.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen. It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-eight years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.<br /><br />Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role. He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.<br /><br />On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.<br /><br />Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Travis Bickle - the "Taxi Driver" in the film - is not so much a psychopath but someone who is mentally ill. He struggles to relate and connect with other people, slowly becomes detached from reality, indulges in inappropriate behaviour, and has a naive sense of what is right and wrong.<br /><br />The loneliness and disconnection of Bickle has echoes in the character of Holden Caulfield in "The Catcher in the Rye" who likewise drifts around New York City searching for some kind of meaning.<br /><br />The ending always seemed a little strange until one accepts it as a fantasy of Bickles deranged mind.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" remains a powerful and disturbing film even after all these years despite far more graphic films because the characters are so believable.<br /><br />A great film from the great Martin Scorsese.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Watching Scorsese's unfailingly great "Taxi Driver" this weekend, I saw it as a haunting portrayal of a misled psychotic, who goes on a killing spree not to free the 12-year-old hooker from pimps but because he has his own misguided view of everything that's wrong with the world's morality. <p>That he's seen as a hero at the end of the film is a joke, a mistake made by people who think he did what he did to save Iris. Travis wasn't interested, I think, in saving Iris. He was just insane and didn't see Iris as one of the filth of humanity. He saw her as salvageable. He didn't go on the killing spree for her benefit, but her freedom was a lucky byproduct to Travis' madness.<p>This isn't "Death Wish"-type vengeance. Travis is insane, a villain who doesn't understand the depths of his own madness. While dating political volunteer Betsy, he's so unclear on how to go about it that he takes her to a dirty movie, buys her an album she already owns, then stalks her. He writes a manifesto about the evils of society. He's a war veteran, living an isolated life away from his parents. He's unable to sleep. He sees the world as a sick place, where he's the only normal man left. He's not a hero. He's not a tough guy. He's a basket case.<p>Notice how little dialogue he actually has with Iris, played incredibly by Jodie Foster, before deciding to "save" her from Sport. Iris doesn't even want him to do it. Who she is doesn't matter to Travis. What she represents matters more to Travis. He's embarking on a rampage, intending to kill lots of people (including the presidential candidate in a thwarted attempt), yet he only succeeds in killing the pimps.<p>He's not a hero, but society, in one of the film's best twists, makes him a little girl's savior. Betsy, at the end, forgives him without knowing the extent of his madness, and he smiles at her.<p>Then, he keeps driving, thinking, plotting.<p>This is a great, extremely bleak movie. And DeNiro's performance is pitch perfect.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>this is one of the best films of all time.<br /><br />great cast, great directing, the story is very real like,<br /><br />and its very chilling</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>I've seen this film at least five times prior to seeing it again last night.  It is as fresh and as perfect as the day it was made and I enjoyed every moment again.  It seems every actor in it became either a major film or tv star in the years after it was made 25 years ago. Robert DeNiro is at his finest as Travis Bickel, a New York taxi driver, who slips further and further into a breakdown state. He can't sleep so drives his cab all night long. He runs into an amazing cast of characters on the city's streets including Jodie Foster, a teenage prostitute who has Harvey Keitel as her pimp; Cybill Shepard as the idealized woman he wants to court (his idea of a date is taking her to a porno movie!); Albert Brooks as a political worker; Peter Boyle as a fellow cabbie; director Martin Scorsese in a cameo role as an obsessed husband watching his wife carry on an affair from the back of Travis's cab.  The soundtrack I've had for years too as it is the most gorgeous saxophone accompaniment.  Perhaps the most perfect aspect that struck me this time though was the writing.  Paul Schaefer's screenplay was dead on.  He grabbed ahold of Travis Bickel's paranoid, alienated world and delivered it dead-on to us.  If only other film-makers understood the need to start with an absolutely first rate script, perhaps more films would be winners like this one too.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Director Martin Scorsese (hot off of his critical breakthrough Mean Streets) directed this film that was destined to become an all time landmark in American cinema, and announced to the world the acting genius of Robert De Niro.  De Niro plays psychotic cabbie Travis Bickle; an ex-Marine who takes a job driving a taxi because he can't sleep.  He is driven to be a vigilante by seeing the ceaspool the city has become, while trying to protect a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).  Screenwriter Paul Schrader wrote the character of Travis Bickle so vividly, and De Niro perfectly captures the essence of this psychotic man living in a world decaying around him.  Peter Boyle, Cybil Sheppard, and Albert Brooks also star, and look for Scorsese in a small role as a man following his cheating wife (the exchange between him and De Niro has quite a lasting effect).  DVD extras include some interviews and trailers, but I would have loved to hear a commentary from Scorsese and/or De Niro.  All in all, Taxi Driver may not be for everyone, but those who have never gotten the chance to see this should consider seeing it.  The final ten minutes are some of the most gripping and chilling scenes in all of American cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/ATQTE464YAZM1.html">ATQTE464YAZM1</a><br/><p>Now first off I should warn people that this is not a movie for all tastes. If the following offends you:<p>- Graphic, ultrarealistic violence.<br />- Porn films<br />- The idea of taking your date to a porn film.<br />- 12 year old hookers.<br />- Graphic language involving sex with a 12 year old.<br />- Graphic language in general.<br />- Racial slurs<p>...then don't watch this film. <p>OK, now that I sound like I'm giving the movie a bad rap, let me continue with the good stuff: this film is the only movie where you root for the depressed psycho stalker. It sounds incredible, but its true. Robert DeNiro's character Travis Bickle is described in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 Colossal Guide as "an ordinary guy with a few problems." Few problems includes not being able to sleep, having a steady job as a taxi driver only because he has too, and dealing with his hatred for the world around him.<p>He attempts to change things by turning to a young woman working on a presidential campaign. What starts out great turns rotten after Travis tries to make her watch a porn film. Stalking her doesn't work, so he gives up and decides to take his rage on the corrupt New York of the time on some one else. That being the hoodlums toying with Jodie Foster, a 12 year old prostitute. He sets out to save her from life on the street - a one man war on prostituting minors.<p>Like I said, its the only movie where you cheer for the psycho.<p>Any way, you might wonder why I rank this "the perfect bad-day at work movie." Thats because it really is. Travis has to deal with customers having sex in the taxi or making him park the vehicle outside a house where they explain on killing some one. Travis doesn't like it, but its the only job he can have at the moment so he has to put up with the horrible conditions. Finally, he breaks free of his torment and gets back at in any way possible.<p>One night I came back after working an exhaustive 9 hour shift as a clerk for a grocery store. I had had a HORRIBLE day, so when I got home I popped this movie in my DVD player. I tell you, you never see Travis so much a hero as when you've had a horrible day at work and know just how he feels. Even if you feel disgusted by some of his actions, in reality we all have a bit of Travis in us all, and there are times when we all just wanna break out in, "Listen all you f***heads, you screw ups, this is the story of a man who would not take it any more..."</p></br><a href="../users/A3VV4GUGLUVUP1.html">A3VV4GUGLUVUP1</a><br/><p>Man, the 70s were chock full o' excellent films.  From "MASH" to "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Network," "Nashville," "Days of Heaven" and especially "Taxi Driver," the 1976 Martin Scorsese-directed grungy, street-level study of alienation.  Robert De Niro, memorable as the young Don Corleone in the second "Godfather" movie, brings us into the closing decades of the 20th century as Travis Bickle, the obscure and troubled cabbie.  This remains one of his signature portrayals.<br /><p>Primarily a character study with only a bare-bones plot, "Taxi Driver" reveals Bickle, whose experiences in Vietnam have left him a shell, a soft-spoken insomniac with a never-ending monologue about the sordid things he encounters while prowling the mean streets of New York.  He drives his cab through rain-washed streets and kills time in porno theaters, cut off from the rest of humanity for reasons even he can't fully comprehend.  Eventually, he meets and attempts to woo two women who will change his life:  Jodie Foster as a teenaged prostitute, and Cybill Shepherd as a dedicated campaign worker.  Unfortunately, Bickle's inability to articulate his torment and his mental problems inevitably lead him down an increasingly shadowy path.<br /><p>The film's climactic confrontation (between De Niro and Harvey Keitel as a pimp) scorches and burns but fails to provide a catharsis for De Niro's character (as it would in a lesser film), and its enigmatic ending remains much debated.  This is a dangerous film, seemingly as lethargic as Bickle's speech but, like the character himself, capable of erupting in violence.  John Hinkley would later use this film's political assassination plot as inspiration in his own pursuit of Jodie Foster; it's difficult to view the film without that association.  But this is a must-see, must-own film for serious buffs, DeNiro and/or Scorsese fans.<br /><p>Brilliant comedian/filmmaker Albert Brooks has an amusingly neurotic role as one of Shepherd's colleagues.  The always excellent Peter Boyle also stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>All the so called 'hype' this movie has generated is warranted and then some:nothing quite compares to it.  Something, to put it mildly, just went right.  The claustraphobic atmosphere of meaninglessness, alienation and pure depravity that Scorsese creates is nothing less than perfect. The all consuming glow of streetlamps, traffic signals and headlights allow us to see New York City as Travis sees it, a crowded hell where human being is separated from human being and 'survival of the fittest' is the brutal norm. De Niro's performance is beyond exceptional, it is transcendent.  He absolutely becomes Travis Bickle, a very lost and lonely young war veteran in a city full of people who seem to be asleep. For all intents and purposes, Robert De Niro no longer exists within the running time of this movie:indeed, he so good as Travis that he is sometimes much more frightening than the 'scum', like Harvey Keitel, that his character despises so much. If you've ever felt alone or marginalized in your life, this movie will immediately strike a deep chord with you.  I disagree, however, with interpreters who think that we are supposed to hate and revile Travis and see him as a sick, 'crazed loner' looking for any excuse to satiate his bloodthirsty rage. I would say that, on the contrary, Scorsese's timeless masterpiece is a work of the deepest empathy and compassion.  Travis Bickle is every man and woman who has felt abandoned and lost in a dark and seemingly insane world.  His self perceived 'moral superiority' is indeed a narcissistic delusion and a defense mechanism, but his feelings of rage and hatred toward a blind and sick society are very real and well founded indeed. I was hard pressed to find much optimism or hope in this movie, and our hero (or anti hero) is as sick and irretrievably lost at the end as he is at the beginning. It is basically a work of alarming pessimism and desperation, similar in many ways to George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. Any lover or student of film should buy this movie without hesitation.</p></br><a href="../users/AVF60NZ99H9D5.html">AVF60NZ99H9D5</a><br/><p>Great motion picture.

I will only say that I doubt Scorsese and Shrader are that clever to have thought of it. Say, for the sake of argument, that that's what they meant and intended...well, then, I'd say it's pure genius on their part. However, I doubt it.<br /><br />I still maintain, unless Bickle is spinning this resolution inside his noggin...it does not work.

I'm mostly indifferent. <p>One of the many problems I have with Taxi Driver is that there are too many unanswered questions about Travis' background, experience in the Marine Corp, etc. We know he was discharged while Vietnam was winding down but we don't have a clue what the source of his so-called "instability" is. Are we to assume that he had suffered some sort of trauma during the war...did he ever see any action...was he really discharged because of his instability? In fact, the guy seems perfectly normal other than a slightly obsessive compulsive complex which 70% of society is sporting, and he can't sleep. Awwww, poor thing... big deal. Does that alone make Travis a candidate for the nuthouse? NO! The truth is, we don't know what his alleged issues stem from and that is a major problem with this movie. His descent is so spontaneous when Betsy reacts about being dragged to an adult film, and he just snaps, we don't know why?!? (spoiler alert) Next thing you know the guy is buying guns like there's no tomorrow to feed his all-of-a-sudden John Wayne complex that springs from a source we can't, as an audience, connect with. <p>Good individual performances don't make a film, and don't salvage the many holes that litter the canvas of this highly overated drama. And somebody please explain to me all this talk about Travis searching for "redemption", from WHAT?? Jeez! The campy final shootout is a little too reminiscent of the Wild Bunch where spurting blood and bad editing wooed critics all around. The popularity of which is a tribute to the end of Western Civilization. And you know if my illegitimate brother from BizzaroWorld, boydjt, likes this thing it's got to be pretty bad. 2 checkers.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>A gritty, dark trip into an alley of alienation and isolation Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver" appears on Blu-ray in a restored nice looking edition. Always gritty looking detail has been improved and colors look extremely good here. This is a large improvement over the previous DVD edition of the film. At first the film appears a bit dicey when the Columbia logo rolls up on screen but the film improves markedly by the first couple of minutes.<br /><br />Offered in a hardcover book style with a replica of the original poster artwork as well as photos from the movie. Special features include the 1986 commentary track with Scorsese and Schrader from the Criterion laserdisc, an interactive feature that allows you to compare the script to the movie(the script appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen as you're watching the movie progressing with each new scene). It's interesting to compare the finished movie where the actors and Scorsese alter the dialogue to fit the their interpretation of the characters. We also get new commentary tracks by writer Schrader and Professor Robert Kolker. We also get new featurettes including "God's Lonely Man", "Producing 'Taxi Driver'", "Travis' New York" comparing 1975 to 2006, storyboard to film comparisons with Scorsese's introduction  and Scorsese discussing the making of the film. I didn't access the "Movie I.Q." special feature here.<br /><br />Shot on a very low budget (less than $1.5 million)and originally slated for director Brian DePalma (who ended up tackling "Obsession" also from a script by "Taxi Driver" writer Paul Schrader which also featured Bernard Herrmann writing the score), "Taxi Driver" became Scorsese and Schrader's first great film. It's fascinating to watch the script-to-screen comparison which illustrates the artistry of writer, actors and director bring to the project making it quite unique.<br /><br />Albert Brooks who makes his film debut here improvised his dialogue as his character wasn't all that fleshed out in the script. He's also quite amusing in a very dark disturbing film. Scorsese makes his debut here as an actor as well when the actor who was originally cast couldn't do the role due to an injury (he appears twice in the film you can also glimpse him sitting on the curb outside the campagin office in the beginning of the film). It's also pretty interesting watching Bickle's reaction to Scorsese's rant and who he considers to be, well, more disturbed than HIM.<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann's moving, powerful score sounds absolutely lovely here.<br /><br />Scorsese and Scharder's powerful glimpse into the mind of an alienated and disturbed lonely man trying to connect with others and finding the only way to do so is the murderous ramapage to "wash away the flith" continues to resonate today.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" on Blu-ray is HIGHLY recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>Travis Binkle (Robert DeNiro), a Vietnam veteran, takes a job as a taxi driver because he can't sleep at nights. While driving around, he becomes obsessed with "cleaning the scum from the streets", and in particular, with saving a 12 year old prostitute (Jodie Foster).<br /><br />It's sometimes hard to remember that Robert DeNiro was once a serious actor and not a semi-comedian who has sunk to the level of self-parody. However, watching "Taxi Driver" makes you realize how DeNiro gained his reputation in the first place. It is DeNiro's performance that makes "Taxi Driver" and without it, this film would have been long forgotten. That's not to say that the script, directing and other acting aren't also great. It's just that, the focus of this film is on one man's descent into madness and obsession, and without a convincing actor in the lead role, this film would not have worked. The intensity of DeNiro's performance translates well into Binkle's own intensity in his crusade.<br /><br />"Taxi Driver" has a reputation for the levels of violence that it contains, but with the exception of the final 10 - 15 minutes, it is actually surpringly non-violent. Having said that, this is a very disturbing film. Watching DeNiro practice pointing a gun made me wonder if this is what mentally unstable killers are like just before they commit a crime, and it comes as no surprise to hear that this is the film that inspired John Hinckley to attempt to assassinate Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />This film well deserves it's place on many "greatest films" lists and hopefully it will continue to remain on such lists for many years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Regarded as a cinematic masterpiece, `Taxi Driver' is one of those films that sticks with you long after your done watching.  Telling the twisted tale of Travis Bickle, a deranged ex-marine who drives cab and obsessive over two different women, `Taxi Driver' succeeds in both getting under your skin and getting into your head.  A lot of discussion is to be had over the conclusion of this film, so I won't really go into it (it's a major spoiler to any who have yet to see the film anyways), but there is also much to be said about the film in it's entirety as well.<br /><br />The lead character of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is one that may be hard to understand at first, but he's someone I found to be so relatable it's almost scary.  Travis is a confused soul, someone who obviously hates what the world has become and more notable what he's become to the world.  This is made obvious by the way he lies about himself in letters to his parents, making himself appear much more important than he really is.  He's also someone so concerned with mattering that he presses upon others his unwanted help in order to validate his reason for existence.<br /><br />This is first seen in the way he pursues Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), trying much too hard to impress upon her that they are meant to be.  The second is found in the way he tries to save the young prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).  It's not so much in the fact he wants her to have a better life but the way he goes about downgrading her in order to prove his point.  He's so disgusted with the world and its views but he in a sense is just as bad in the way he treats those he interacts with.<br /><br />So here's what I mean by Travis being `relatable'.  We all want to matter and we all want to make a difference, not just in our lives but for the most part in the lives of others as well.  The only problem is that rarely do we ever go about things the right way; most of the time we try so hard to fix problems we see that we in turn become part of a bigger problem.  That is what befell our anti-hero Travis here, for his intentions were pure but his actions were tainted.<br /><br />`Taxi Driver' will always be known for De Niro's brilliant performance, and rightfully so.  He became Travis Bickle in every sense of the word.  He was as creepy and eerie as one can be, but also as endearing and almost pitiful at the same time.  A breakout role for Foster is here as well, and Cybill Shepherd really shocked me with her performance as well.  Harvey Keitel comes off a bit amateur next to De Niro's commanding screen presence and Albert Brooks as well as the late Peter Boyle aren't given roles meaty enough for them to stand out, but regardless no one here even begins to take away from the film and that alone is a major plus.<br /><br />We may not all agree on the meaning behind this film, the power it holds or the moral the ending offers, but we can all agree that this is film making at its finest and deserves to be praised for that if nothing else.  Martin Scorsese, probably the greatest director to be SNUBBED of the Oscar year after year, made his name with this film, proving to the world that he had a point of view that needed to be heard!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Travis Bickle is one of the most confused and violent characters ever to grace the screen.  He is an ex-marine who becomes a taxi driver.  He is disgusted by all the filth and scum he sees in New York City, but he drives in the city's worst neighborhoods and picks up the slimiest of characters.  In voice overs, we hear him describe some of the debauchery that goes on in his cab.  He sees a beautiful young woman working in the campaign offices of a Presidential candidate.  He gets up the nerve to ask her out and they go to a luncheonette and have a nice conversation.  Then on another date he takes her to a pornographic movie and she is revolted by this and then spurns him.  One of the heartbreaking scenes in the movie is Travis calling her on a pay phone to apologize.  Martin Scorcese pans away from Travis and shows a long corridor while he is being rejected.  This sends Travis over the edge.  He gets a mohawk and plans an assassination attempt on the candidate which is aborted.  He also meets a 13 year old hooker named Iris.  He can't understand why she subjects herself to this life and why she is with a creepy pimp named Sport.  In the film's bloody climax, Travis kills Sport and ends up in a blood bath while Iris looks on horrified.  Robert De Niro plays Travis as powderkeg waiting to burst.  He lets Travis slowly slide into his own personal hell before finally exploding.  Cybil Shepard is charmingly beautiful as the campaign worker and Albert Brooks provides some levity as her co-worker.  Jodie Foster served noticed as Iris.  She plays the character with seeming self-assurance, but with an underlying fragility an amazing achievement for the then 13 year old.  Peter Boyle plays Wizard, who doles out philosophies on life to Travis, with an all-knowing nature.  Harvey Keitel plays Sport with the right amount heavy handiness and smarm.  The film established Martin Scorcese as a top-flight director.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>The first time I watched and reviewed Taxi Driver, I didn't like it so much. I think I may have given it a 4/10, or something. Fastforward to today, the release day of the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray, and viola. I bought it, knowing how much I didn't like it before. I was willing to pay money for something I knew I didn't like, just to give it a second shot. So anyway, I rewatched it, and I actually got much more out of it the second time. Admittedly, I'll need to watch it again a third time (with Director Marty Scorsese and Writer Paul Schrader's 1986 Criterion Commentary) to fully understand what happened in Travis Bickle's (played to perfection by one of film history's greatest assets, Robert De Niro) mind. I mean, we all have our good times, and bad. Everybody has issues, and many people hate the scum that can be found on inner city streets late at night. Not many let it bother them so much that they go damn near insane and kill people. I know I'll catch a little flack for this statement because these films are held in such contrasting regards, but this story reminded me of Kick-Ass (or vice versa). A guy gets fed up, and fights crime, etc. So I will need to watch it a third time to fully grasp it, but even so, I recognize quality when I see it. This film deserves to be considered one of the greatest American works of art. Hats off to Scorsese, De Niro, Bernard Herrmann for the magnificent score, and most of all the scribe who penned the screenplay, Paul Schrader. My score may seem a bit low for all the praise I'm giving this film, but keep in mind that I didn't like it when I first saw it, so that score is quite a leap. Highly Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) is a former Marine and a veteran of the Vietnam war. He frequently has trouble sleeping and is plagued by headaches. The pills he takes don't seem to help at all. Because he's likely to be awake all night anyway, Bickle takes a job driving a cab. He prefers the night shift.<br /><br />Scorsese's version of New York is gritty and realistic. Most of the film is shot at night and we see just how crazy some of the people are. It's a crime-ridden world populated by junkies and prostitutes. Bickle hates how much scum exists in the city, and he's referring to the people more than the dirty streets.<br /><br />Bickle is looking for something to brighten up his seedy existence and a woman catches his eye. Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) works in a local office for a senator who is hoping to become the next president. After pestering her for a while, she eventually agrees to go on a date with him. He talks to her in a very straightforward way. It's not clear whether he lacks intelligence, or if he doesn't see any point in hiding the truth about himself. His approach works and leads to one of the funniest scenes in the film when he takes her to see a movie.<br /><br />Other things attract Bickle's attention. He's particularly drawn to Iris (Jodie Foster), who is a 12-year-old prostitute. As his frustration mounts at the disgusting state of the city, he begins to devise a plan to clean up one small part. An incident on the street gives him the idea of saving Iris from her situation and giving her the opportunity to escape from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).<br /><br />It's interesting watching Bickle trying to escape his miserable existence. He figures out how to buy and use weapons and starts working out to strengthen his body. All the while, there's mounting tension, and we sense that Bickle is close to losing touch with reality completely.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong, with Shepherd, Foster and Keitel all playing their parts well. You'll also see Peter Boyle and Albert Brooks. One of the most surprising scenes involves a cameo from Scorsese. His character might even be the catalyst for the change which eventually occurs in Bickle.<br /><br />I have to mention Scorsese's decision to shoot most of the scenes at night. It was an inspired choice and adds so much atmosphere to the film. Bernard Herrmann's saxophone-heavy score is also an important part of the mix and helps helps transport us into Bickle's troubled world.<br /><br />De Niro has produced some incredible performances over the past 40 years and Travis Bickle is probably my favorite De Niro character. There's so much going on beneath the surface and De Niro portrays much of it with his body language.<br /><br />The meaning of the conclusion is open to debate, but if you take it purely at face value, it's quite uplifting.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation adds a lot to the experience and is a must-own for fans of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Taxi Driver" is a psychological thriller film where the viewer stands in the shoes of deluded Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro. Bickle presents as a social misfit who is looking for a job to fill his sleepless nights. His reality is certainly skewed as he takes a potential girlfriend, Betsy, to a pornographic movie screening as a first date. From Bickle's point of view the decay of society surrounds him, and he seeks to rid the city of seedy elements. Iris, a child prostitute, becomes a reason for him to carry out his plan, and she in many ways is an important focus in his life. De Niro convincingly plays Bickle with a deadpan persona that is driven purely by an invented concept of right and wrong.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This film comes from the 1970s auteur period of nakedly awful stories about the dregs and losers.  I remember enjoying my reaction to this as an undergraduate, the way that it kind of freaked me out, which is a substitute for experience in the young.  This time around, while I recognize its significance, fine acting, and relentless realism, I half wondered why I was putting myself through it.  OK, you endure it for the sake of art, but it is so awful that I may never do so again, which leads to the question, why buy it?<br /><br />Scorsese, DeNiro, Keitel, and Foster completely deserve the praise they received.  They portray losers in the drama of a massive, then-deteriorating city, in which a man is going insane.  He pulls Keitel and Foster into his web of horror and alienation with the surety of a pendulum, to the unspeakable violence of the climax.  It is painful to watch:  a horrible story about horrible people to whom horrible things will happen.  Then there is the commentary on the media:  Travis becomes a hero by his action, though it is clear the pendulum continues to swing.<br /><br />There is also a very good documentary about the film.  It is a must for Scorsese fans and Taxi buffs.<br /><br />It is a great film, just not very fun.  I would recomend renting it rather than buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VUO1LJGMSZQY.html">A3VUO1LJGMSZQY</a><br/><p>Have read numerous stellar reviews of new blu release: VERY tempted to re-purchase (in fact was still being contemplated in my cart until just a while ago!).  Decided to re-visit 2 dvd set, as basis for comparison (though just using others' comments to do so!), and was very surprised with how good THIS copy (still) looks! The 'grunge' factor of 1970's NYC (I believe) is well-represented, but the overall look is still impressive.  The upward look at the skyline, the gaunt face of Mr Bickle, the daytime exterior shots, are all very clean and crisp  -and undoubtedly benefit from the blu transfer-, but I am satisfied with this release (which also has a 2nd disc of 8 insightful featurettes, incl. a 70 min "making of", and several audio and subtitle options/commentaries on film itself). For those who do not yet own a copy, sure, get the blu (and the price is certainly competitive); but I will likely not, after having already invested $15 for this (IMHO high quality) standard def copy.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>The opening images of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly through clouds of steam, seems an authentic vision of the city as netherworld, a landscape of gaudy nightmares...

Taking a job as a taxi driver, Travis slowly begins to realize the futility of his life, and the lonelyness that begins to plague him.  His days are filled with regularity, and he begins to inspire a hate towards the city, which he regards to be filled with disgusting garbage (He's right for the most part)that needs to be washed away.

Audio: Original Chinese, and French, Spanish (all in 5.1 Dolby); English 5.1 DTS-HD. Video: 2.35:1. Subtitles: Eng/Fr/Spa. Extra features: fight scene close-up, "Hero defined" featurette, convo between Li and QT. Picture quality: on my 720p, very nice (especially "epic" scenes). Have heard some critique that it's not AS pristine in blu quality as it could be, but I found it sufficient. Am not a huge fan of this genre, but was told that if watched, do it in Chinese, as English dub is considered dreadful. Am therefore pleased with this purchase, especially given price!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>Just as I remembered it, Hero is one of the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous fantasy pictures ever made. Yimou Zhang's direction is exceptional, with breathless landscapes, intense perspectives and seamless action scenes that manage to shine coherently despite the frequent jump cuts. The film's rich sequence of colors gives each act a distinct, easily identifiable tone and flavor, which is naturally the most pronounced aspect most admirers will remember. What took me by surprise with this viewing, though, was how integral the audio was. Every action in each fantastic fight scene is matched by a subtle, but perfect, sound effect that hammers home the precision and power of each stomp, leap or swing. An ambitious visual feat that delivers in spades, it also carries a poignant, timeless message about the necessity and ultimate intentions of war.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>HERO is a like a beautifully choreographed epic dance [with plenty of stylized violence, as well as human drama].  The use of color and camera tricks is fabulous, and, the use of color to depict moods and set the atmosphere, is eye popping.  This really was reminiscent of Chinese hand painted screens, for me.  Some people have compared the retelling of the story (from three different perspectives) as similar to the approach of RASHOMAN (directed by Akira Kurosawa).  The question that remains for us is whether "Nameless" (Jet Li) is a ruthless murderer or a fearless warrior who has taken a stand for those castaways from the lower rungs of society.  The supporting cast is equally intriguing in their roles, and, the lines between good and evil become increasingly blurred through character examination and the reallignment of the angles of human manipulation. The story is as much psychological as it is action-packed.  I'm only sorry that I waited too long and only saw it on DVD.  This is one of those films that comes alive more on the big screen.  Director Zhang Yimou did a fantastic job and I am sure that this film will be honored for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>I love Zhang Yimou's films and found this one to be no exeception.  The use of color and imagery is amazing.  I'm not sure how many Americans realize that the old Technicolor movie cameras found their way to China allowing some its greatest directors to make use of the best and most stable color movie process around.  I'm sure it was an honor for Jet Li, Tony Leueng and Maggie Cheung to make a movie with him and such a wonderful movie too.  The story is told beautifully and movingly.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Jet Li came back to Hong Kong with this film. `Hero' is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless (Jet Li), a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.<br /><br />The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious. Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself. The language spoken is traditional mandarin, even though I couldn't understand a single word except for the word "Yes" but other then that I went on reading the subtitles. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but I could be mistaken). The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor. Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so I think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung were great in there roles. I feel that they had outclassed everyone in this film. Their scenes are so good it drains any remaining interest out of the main story.<br /><br /> The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action. Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination. The music, though quite similar to that in 'Crouching Tiger', is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.<br /><br />`Hero' is undoubtedly a beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>"Hero" has been getting a bad rap as an inferior version of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" but except for being of the same genre, "Hero" is as visually stunning, intelligently presented and much more story-oriented; therefore less martial arts driven, than its much-vaulted predecessor.<br /><br />Even though I am a great fan of the Ang Lee film, "Hero" is, in many ways, the more intense, more complicated and an even more physically gorgeous film. I particularly admire director Yimou Zhang's use of color as a way to propel the story forward: color as a narrative as well as a design device.<br /><br />The plot is told in several versions with different characters giving their version of the story, "Rashomon" style. Nameless (Jet Li) is the catalyst for all of the action and the transcendent Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Maggie Cheung (In the Mood for Love) add beauty and class to the proceedings.<br /><br />"Hero" is a gorgeous film, breathtaking in its visuals and unique storytelling and a triumph for all concerned.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Just got back from seeing this film in a sold out theater. I must admit, at least half of the audience seemed to dislike the movie a great deal (especially the guys). The fight scenes aren't really that great and most consist of flying around and close-ups of the actor's faces. The fight between Jet Li and Donnie Yen towards the start of the film being the exception, which was pretty good. The visuals are what make the movie work. No, not visual effects, but the colors and locations really have an impact and grasp your attention throughout the short 95 minute running time. Jet Li is pretty good, but really doesn't do a whole lot in terms of fighting and Zhang Ziyi is very pretty (the girl from "Crouching Tiger") as always. The story is actually pretty good and follows the plot layering that was used in "The Usual Suspects," where you hear a bunch of stories that are untrue until the truth is finally revealed at the end. I think it's worth seeing if you like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," and if not at least see it once it hits Dvd. You gotta see "Fist of Legend" for some true Jet Li butt-kickin, beccause you won't get it in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>First of all people need to understand or have some concept of the chinese culture before they can really understand this movie. This is truly a beautiful story of sacrifices made for the love of two people as well as the love of a country. The intrigue comes in when the viewers have to figure out which of the tale is the truth. Overall the story unfolds in a flurry of cinematographic magic and martial arts fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>Like many other reviewers, I was exposed to this movie through the Chinese DVD release. I was speechless with the art direction and the photography of "Hero". It ranks as one of the most beautiful movies ever made. The way the colors that prevail on a scene are in sync with the scene's mood, is not subtle, but it is impeccable and tasteful. In addition to this, the way Tun Dun's music once more is integral to the story shows how deep of an artistic relationship the director, Yimou Zhang, and the composer developed.<br /><br />While I can see how some people may find some of the fighting scenes a bit unrealistic, that doesn't take away from its brilliance and how artistic they are. In this movie we're being exposed to a different culture, one where honor, tradition and denial of instant gratification are above all things: something for us as Western people to learn from.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Hero' is a film that, whilst stunningly beautiful and with amazing cinematography, is one that can only be fully enjoyed the first time around. Sadly it loses it's impact with repeated viewing. Following an assassin who attempts to kill the emperor this film has plenty of plot twists and intrigue. Coupled with the vivid colours, incredible locations and set design and flawless fight choreography this makes for one visual feast. I've come to realise that however amazing the fight scenes are, they are less impressive second time round and they actually drag by the end of the film. Scene after scene of flowing combat, however graceful, become tiresome after a while. Luckily this film has a strong enough plotline to sustain it. Jet Li is great in the main role and all the supporting actors are highly admirable as well. This film is very much in the vein of others produced around this time ('Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon`, `House of Flying Daggers' and `Curse of the Golden Flower') I.e. it has lush, rich colours, awe inspiring costume design and the cinematography/direction is highly polished. This makes for a short, but captivating film and although it may lose it's charm after the first time you watch it, that first time is so breath taking it more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>The film takes place 2,000 years ago when China was split into seven feudal kingdoms. The tyrannical but shrewd and insightful King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) who wants to unite seven kingdoms in one powerful country, is the target of three legendary assassins: Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung), accompanied by Moon (Zhang Ziyi), his devoted servant. The titular Hero, the man without the name (Jet Li), who defeated the assassins, receives as an award a unique private audience with the King of Qin in his Royal Palace...<br /><br />I believe that this is an amazing film which has everything working perfectly: great story which is told in the manner of Kurosawa's Rash?mon, romance, action (and what the action it is...), political intrigue, suspense, fantasy - and if this is not enough, 'Hero' is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen - Christopher Doyle's cinematography, jaw - dropping use of colors, costume design, Tan Dun's musical score, and artfully choreographed fighting sequences leave you breathless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>With "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers" director Zhang Yimou has jettisoned to the forefront of filmmakers working today.  There is no denying that Yimou has a distinctively strong visual style.  That said, if it's all style and no substance, so what?  "Hero" is blessed with a good narrative.  Essentially, the theme of the film is what defines a hero.  The answers that Yimou offers are both surprising and enlightening.  Strong cast that includes Jet Li and Ziyi Zhang.  Essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>As entertainment and spectacle, this film shines.  I loved the powerful soundtrack and beautiful visuals.<br /><br />Also as a work of art, "Hero" rises much above most visually impressive movies of this genre---the plot does require a fair amount of concentration and thought to really understand, and during the last 30 minutes or so a strong Buddhist subtext arises unexpectedly.  This was a pleasant and remarkable surprise.<br /><br />The subtext is Buddhist, but also very nationalistic and politically convenient from the Chinese perspective---I'm sure that the still-totalitarian Chinese government must've been very happy to see this one come out!<br /><br />The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt that many of the fight scenes were a bit overboard, and things got a little melodramatic towards the end between the main characters.<br /><br />But it was a very fun way to spend 2 hours!</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This is a class of movies I've learned to like. It features great fight scenes and wire work, but with a clearly non-western flavor. There's always a mystical, even magical edge that western movies can't capture with a straight face.<br /><br />This one offers more than most. It describes a set of encounters between Nameless, the Hero, and assassins that had tried to take down the empire-building king. In a unique bit of visual story-telling, it goes over those encounters again and again. Each telling is changed by a different bit of spin-doctoring, to the point that the viewer may give up all hope of knowing the truth (whatever that means) of the original encounters. This could have been very confusing, except that each telling is color-coded. By themselves, the tinted stories are visually appealing. As a set they work very nicely. The one constant through all but the first interlude is Moon, loyal retainer to one of the assassins.<br /><br />Good action/adventure with a little more depth than a comparable movie from the West, and people generally keep their clothes on. The good guy wins in the end, but you'll have to find out for yourself what that means.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>This movie was a visual tour de force that I will have to see several times in order to take it all in.<br /><br />The symbolic use of colour is stunning, as are the action scenes, and photography.<br /><br />I did get lost a couple of times reading the subtitles while trying  not to miss any of the visual story.  This is another reason I'd like to see the film a few more times.<br /><br />Hero, legend, myth - all very well told!<br /><br />Sorting it all out is the viewers job...</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>If CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is a good book brought to the screen, then HERO is stunning poetry splashed across the silver screen in vivid colors, artful battles, and wonderful drama.<br /><br />During China's warring states period, the country was divided into seven kingdoms: Qin, Zhao, Han, Wei, Yan, Chu and Qi, and these kingdoms fought violently for years.  Understandably, thousands of people died ... and it is this very situation that serves as the narrative backbone for HERO.  The King of Qin seeks to unite all of China, and this desire made him the target of assassins.  In order to maintain his position, the king offered rewards (mostly the privilege to sit closer and closer to him) to anyone who could kill those opposed to him, and a nameless warrior (enter Jet Li) finally delivers the king the satisfaction he has long sought -- seeing the best assassins hunting for his head brought to their own end.<br /><br />Or has he?<br /><br />HERO is the kind of film that either one loves or one hates.  It polarizes audiences, presenting the story in a visual fashion that will either fascinate or dull the viewer.  For those it captures, HERO is an epic, possibly unrivaled in cinematic scope.  It needs to be seen to be loved or hated, and it needs to be seen, if for no other reason, for one to truly understand what the role of a 'hero' could quite possibly be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I feel like I have been waiting a long time to see this movie and that the trailer for "Hero" ("Ying xiong") has been teasing us for at least a year.  I have to admit that I fully expected to see an epic full of battle scenes and massed armies of men.  My mistake.  This film from China is a pointed fable, distilled from legend that may well be myth, and with a point that may well be lost on Western audiences.  This is clear from those viewers who are unwilling to accept the conventions of wire work in Chinese martial art pictures and whose standard of realism refuses to allow for the poetic ballet of combat.<br /><br />The prologue makes it clear that this story takes place in China before it was China, when the land was made up of seven warring provinces and the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming) dreamt of conquering the other six provinces and uniting the land.  For years the king has been unable to have a peaceful night of sleep because there are three assassins who are out to kill him.  Now comes a nameless warrior (Jet Li), who has come to the imperial court to be rewarded for killing the three unbeatable assassins.  He is warned that he may not approach within 100 paces of the king or he will be killed.  But because he has bested the assassin Sky (Donnie Yen) in combat, he is allowed with 20 paces to tell his story.<br /><br />Most of the story of "Hero" is told in flashback as Nameless tells his stories and the king questions him.  We also learn of the fates of Broken Sword (Tony Leung) and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), two assassins who were also a pair of lovers.  But there is more than one truth and more than one tale to be told in this film.  Director Zhang Yimou, improving on the artistry we first enjoyed in "Raise the Red Lantern," color codes the stories that we see.  First the story is told in lush shades of red, then in cool blue, again in white, and finally in green.  Drops of water and swirling yellow leaves all become parts of the dances of death during the fight sequences, captured by cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  "Hero" is a gorgeous film that uses its saturated colors better than any film of recent memory.  There is a code to the colors, but that is something you need to come to terms with on your own.<br /><br />Another strength of this film is that the fighting (choreographed by Wei Tung) and special effects do not overwhelm the actors who are required to play what is on some level the same scene as slightly different characters.  I know there are computer generated effects in this film, especially since there are more arrows shot in "Hero" than any film in history, but for once I did not get the feel that what I was seeing was not real.  That is become this film keeps coming back to questions of aesthetics, from the breathtaking use of color to the eloquent idea that swordsmanship and calligraphy are intrinsically awaited.<br /><br />Special mention has to be made of the music, composed by Dun Tan and featuring violin solos and fiddling by Itzhak Perlman along with drumming by the Japanese group Kodo.  I have never really seen one of those Hong Kong kung fu movies where everyone screams while they fight and I might never get around to it given the silent eloquence of the fights in movies like "Hero" (not to mention "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), where the moments are underscored by the sound of clashing swords, pounding drums, and a violin.  "Hero" is an art film, albeit one made on a larger and more colorful canvas.<br /><br />"Hero" may be sold as being a big film but it is really about something relatively plain and simple.  I disagree with the idea that either the style or substance of the film is beyond our Western sensibilities.  Apparently the reason the film has the "Quentin Tarantino Presents" tag at the start was so that Miramax would not cut 20 minutes of the film out on the pretext that it too Asian/confusing for Western audiences.  Indeed, I have seen some critics who professes to be confused about the complex plot and I can only wonder if they were equally confused by "Rashomon," an obvious reference point to this one (in many ways Yimou owes more to Akira Kurosawa's classic film than to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon").  Certainly after a century of cinema we are capable to looking at the same thing from multiple perspectives and enjoying this gem of a film that has finally made its way to our shores.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FRKEXDXDN1KI.html">A2FRKEXDXDN1KI</a><br/><p>Beautiful, artistic, poetic...an enchanting martial arts film that will captivate you with every scene!<br /><br />These are the words I feel about "HERO", the 2002 film directed by Zhang Yimou ("Curse of the Golden Flower", "The House of Flying Daggers" and "Happy Times") and a film that would feature cinematography by Christopher Doyle ("Chungking Express", "In the Mood For Love", "Fallen Angels", "Happy Together") and music by composer Tan Dan ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "The Legend of the Black Scorpion").<br /><br />The film would also star Asia's top talents which include Jet Li ("The Warlords", "Fearless", "Once Upon a Time in China", "Fist of Legend"), Tony Leung Chiu Wai ("Lust, Caution", "Red Cliff", "Tokyo Raiders", "Infernal Affairs"), Maggie Cheung ("Ashes of Time", "Sausalito", "In the Mood for Love", "Comrades: Almost a Love Story"),  Daoming Chen ("Peace Blossom", "My 1919', "Infernal Affairs III"), Zhang Ziyi ("House of Flying Dagger", "My Wife is a Gangster", "Musa the Warrior", "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") and Donnie Yen ("All's Well, End's Well", "Iron Monkey", "Flash Point" and "Bodyguards and Assassins").<br /><br />The film which was Hong Kong's most expensive film at the time, was critically acclaimed, won several awards and eventually would make over $178 million worldwide in the box office.<br /><br />"HERO" is presented on a two-ray Blu-ray disc with one being the primary Blu-ray and the other being a digital copy version of the film.  Also, the Blu-ray also comes in a slipcase.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"HERO" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and suffice to say, this film just looks incredible.  It's one of the most significant qualities of this film is its artistic direction, costume design, set design, location and most of all, the cinematography of Christopher Doyle.<br /><br />Personally, I have always have seen Christopher Doyle as an avant-garde cinematographer since he worked on Wong Kar Wai's "Chungking Express" and suffice to say, his amazing cinematography and the tight editing really pulled the artistic vision of director Zhang Yimou to new heights.<br /><br />Picture quality is vibrant.  Very vibrant and color plays a big part in this film.  Grain is seen on the film and I'm glad to see that Walt Disney has again kept with that and not gone the excessive DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) route.  But for a film that came out back in 2002, is it a reference film on Blu-ray?  Not really.  But it does look very good.  Part of the main reason is that despite the film being shot in beautiful locations and costume design and the colors really enhance the look of the film, it's no super clear, nor is it reference quality compared to recently released films on Blu-ray but still, "HERO" is just absolutely magnificent to watch.<br /><br />As for audio quality, this is where it pains me to give it slightly less than perfect score.  The film is presented with an English 5.1 DTS-HD losless audio track but the original Chinese language is only in Dolby Digital 5.1 (along with the Spanish and French).  For a film of this caliber, I was hoping there would be a lossless audio track for the Chinese language but unfortunately, it's not.<br /><br />But for some, I know it's a dealbreaker for some that the original language is not in lossless audio but the English version is and to be fair, I will say that the English dubwork is very good for this film.  For earlier DVD releases, Asian films released in the US had terrible English dubbing but I will say that "HERO" turned out very well.<br /><br />For audio, sounds such as the rains, swords clanging, arrows zipping through air... this is all captured quite well on the DTS-HD lossless audio track and sounds great.  For the most part, audio is front and central channel driven with dialogue, music and sound effects but many of the soundtracks do utilize the surround channels.  Again, I wish the original language was in lossless but for those who enjoyed the dubwork, you will be pleased by the DTS-HD audio.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"HERO" comes with the following special features (in 480i, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles):<br /><br />  * Close-Up of a Fight Scene - (9:18) The secrets of the fighting choreography of "HERO".  Quentin Tarentino, Jet Li and Donni Yuen discuss the fighting choreography.  Also, storyboard and fighting scene comparisons.  (Note: Some of the footage is the same as the one used on the main featurette).<br />  * Hero Defined - (24:01) The Director and talent on their experiences of working on the film and the challenges they faced.  Also, how locations were selected and what took place before the shooting of the film, during and after.<br />  * Storyboards - (5:19) A side-by-side (or more like top-and-bottom) comparison of the storyboards and final feature.<br />  * Inside the Action.  A Conversation with Quentin Tarentino and Jet Li - (13:55) Jet Li is interviewed by Quentin Tarentino about his past films and working on "Hero".<br />  * Soundtrack Spot - (:39) commercial spot for the "Hero" soundtrack.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />"HERO" is a film that really distinguishes itself from other martial arts film due to its artistic style, wonderful cinematography, well-chosen locations and of course, having a talented director and top talents of HK cinema definitely helps as well.<br /><br />For the most part, "HERO" was definitely one of those films that you can remember for many years later for its scenes.  From the vibrancy of the colors used, the battle scene on top of the lake (which Director Zhang Yimou wanted perfect still waters and didn't mind waiting to film when it happened), the thousands of arrowheads attacking the art school, there is simply many scenes that are just memorable.<br /><br />Sure, "HERO" is a beautiful film known for its cinematography, its talent, its location but what about the storyline?  The story of "HERO" is good but not great.  Where a film like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is one of those films that captured beauty through its storyline, "HERO" definitely relies on the visuals to enhance the storyline.  Because the film is split up into three arcs with three different stories of what took place, it's all about how the viewer interprets that storyline and how that storyline touches their soul.<br /><br />Personally, I have found "HERO" almost like a piece of art.  You embrace everything that went on to create that artistic piece.  From its characters as Jet Li and Donnie Yen are just fantastic when they battle each other during their scene.  You know that when these two are together onscreen, you're going to get a beautiful, captivating scene with the best fighting choreography.  When you see Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Chung, you know that these two have awesome chemistry and that they can bring out the more dramatic scenes and even during their fighting scenes, everything seems believable and the two enforce the vibrancy and color of the film.  The same goes with Zhang Ziyi who brings the more emotional scenes to the film.<br /><br />But is the Blu-ray release perfect?  Unfortunately, it misses the mark of perfection due to the Blu-ray not including a lossless audio track for the Chinese language.  I was so excited about "HERO" on Blu-ray and it's a given, we are going to get awesome picture quality because it's a colorful and vibrant film.  You know that the scene between Falling Snow vs. Moon with its rich red colors and yellow leaves is going to be absolutely brilliant on HD or the scene when Broken Sword and Falling Snow wear these blue outfits or their green outfits and you know that color is going to look great on Blu-ray.  But along with that awesome picture quality, you want awesome audio.<br /><br />The English dub is definitely one of the better English dubs for an Asian film and the lossless audio track was very good.  But I was torn by wanting to watch the film in its original language but knowing that the audio quality of the Chinese Dolby Digital 5.1 was nowhere near the 5.1 DTS-HD English track.  For a fan of this film, for me...it was bittersweet.<br /><br />So, overall "HERO" is definitely a wonderful film to catch on Blu-ray and it's great to see Disney give this release a digital copy as well.  But for the most part, "HERO" could have been a great release but without the Chinese audio track in HD, it ends up being just an average release.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>Zhang Yimou's "Hero" is probably one of the most visually beautiful and exquisitely filmed movies I have seen in many a year. Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).<br /><br />Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't having any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot.  The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green.  And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.<br /><br />The most compelling characters in the film are Sky and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts.  But Sky, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.  The acting is excellent all around.  Jet Li is an appealing and likeable figure, and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword.  The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.<br /><br />There are going to be endless comparisons between "Hero" and "Crouching Tiger", Ang Lee's masterpiece.  Visually, "Hero" can hold its own against "Crouching Tiger" any day in the week.  And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way "Crouching Tiger" does.  "Hero" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact.  Zhang doesn't do a "Rashomon" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>It's not fair to compare this movie to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" directed by Ang Lee.  These two movies are so far apart from one another, akin to chalk and cheese.  Where "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a no-nonsense straight-up story telling, "Hero" is more like a "Pulp Fiction" type of story telling.  The same story is told from different perspectives and then, we shall decide for ourselves what actually happened and what outcome would we expect from those happenings.  Many of my Chinese peers were utterly disappointed with "Hero" because it's arguably one of the most expensive Chinese movie ever made & yet, the final touch didn't quite live up to their expectation.  Naturally, it's a star-studded movie with appearances by Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Zhang Jiyi.  Due to Director's involvement in theatre productions in China, I would like to believe that he applied the visual touches of theatres into this cinema spectacle that I could only describe as spectacular.  This time around, the martial arts is emphasised with special effects, & in order to prevent viewers from been confused with narrations by Jet Li, the cast were given the blue, red, & white treatments.  For example, from one person's point of view, it's rendered the "blue", but from another person's, it's actually "red", & the truth is to be revealed in "white".  It's quite imaginative to concoct a story about these few assasins who had attempted various times to rid of Emperor Chin, the Emperor who united China from various Kingdoms, the Emperor who gave us the Great Wall of China, & also the Emperor who in his later years would sent his followers around the world looking for elixir of life to give him the gift of immortality, and as the legend goes, those followers of his ended up settling in Japan & thus, the Japanese today.  In the end, the assassins were the ones who convinced him that he's on the right path and thus, the formation of modern China.  Talking about mixing fact with fiction.  Overall, this is definitely a beautiful movie, a movie that deserves to be enjoyed but one also has to accept that it's an ambitious movie that didn't quite pick up an Oscar this year.  Still, it's still a good movie to be had.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"Hero" is the apocryphal story of the uniting of warring kingdoms in Asia into the country of China.  Three assassins who have sought to murder the king have themselves been murdered by the Nameless warrior (Li).  Now, Nameless is brought before that king (Daoming) to be rewarded for his heroic deeds.  While there, he recounts the tales of his battles with these assassins, and then the king offers another perspective on things that turns everything that has gone before on its head.<br /><br />"Hero" is an interesting movie that will not appeal to everyone.  It is in many ways reminicent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", but also very different.  Filled with vibrancy and color, every frame of this movie is amazing to look at.  It is very easy to get lost in the images presented by director Zhang Yimou.  The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and surreal.  Utilizing the "Wire-fu" first seen be American audiences in "Crouching Tiger", the characters leap and spin with no regard for gravity or any laws of physics.  The story itself seems straightforward, until the king offers a possible alternative for the way things actually happened.  Then, the movie takes a number of twists and turns that are mostly satisfying.<br /><br />"Hero" is not your typical action movie, and I cannot recommend this movie for everyone.  That being said, I think that this movie could be a pleasant surprise for some people looking for something a little different.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>Zhang Yimou's "Hero" is probably one of the most visually beautiful and exquisitely filmed movies I have seen in many a year. Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).<br /><br />Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't buying any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot. The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green. And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.<br /><br />The most compelling characters in the film are Snow and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts. But Snow, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.<br /><br />The acting is excellent all around. Jet Li is an appealing and likeable hero (or is he an anti-hero?), and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword. The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.<br /><br />There are going to be endless comparisons between "Hero" and "Crouching Tiger", Ang Lee's masterpiece. Visually, "Hero" can hold its own against "Crouching Tiger" any day in the week. And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way "Crouching Tiger" does. "Hero" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact. Zhang doesn't do a "Rashomon" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>I came to "Hero" expecting to see a critically acclaimed martial arts film. My attitude toward martial arts films might best be described as indifferent. I like some of them, but I'm not an enthusiastic fan. I only had to see the first few minutes of "Hero" to know that it was something special, though. The art direction and cinematography are so striking in the opening scene that I consciously thought that this film would be worth watching whether or not the story, characters, or fight sequences interested me. By the first sword fight, I was entranced by the film's beauty. When I saw the red and orange hues that followed, I thought "Hero" might be the most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen. And that was only the beginning. Director Zhang Yimou is one of the best directors in the world today...at making emotionally incisive, understated dramas. "Hero" is Zhang's first action film and, I think, his masterpiece. His characteristic depth and social insight are combined with the energy, history, and flexibility of the martial arts genre in "Hero". The result is larger than life story and characters in a film of uncommon beauty. Zhang has said that the audience will remember the images of "Hero" even if we forget the story. To say that he is right would be understating "Hero"'s visual impact. This may be the most beautiful film ever made, thanks in no small part to cinematography by Christopher Doyle and art direction by Huo Ting Xiao.<br /><br />"Hero" is a fable that takes place two millennia ago, during the era of warring states just before China was unified under its first Emperor. Qin is one of China's 7 states, and its King's sole ambition is to unite China under one rule. The Qin army's constant attacks on the 6 other kingdoms have made the King many enemies, however. Three assassins from Zhao have harassed the King for a decade, and he has promised riches and an audience to whomever defeats them. The reward is claimed by a Nameless (Jet Li) prefect, who arrives at the Court for his audience with the King. The King asks Nameless how he defeated the 3 great assassins: Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. So Nameless begins to tell the story of his battle with Sky (Donnie Yen), who visited his district, and his clever manipulation of Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) at the calligraphy school where they both studied.<br /><br />Many of "Hero"'s scenes have prominent color elements -red, blue, white, or green- depending on who is telling the story and why. The cinematography has to be seen to be believed. The fight sequences were choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Ching Siu-Tung. And martial arts fans will be pleased to see Jet Li and Donnie Yen reunited onscreen. The sword fighting sequences don't propel the story, however. They are well-integrated with the narrative and character development. And like everything else in "Hero", they are absolutely beautiful. You don't have to care for action or martial arts movies to enjoy "Hero". This is just a great film by any standard. 2000's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was the first Asian film to find a wide American audience. Its US box office was more than twice that of "Hero". I attribute that to hype. "Crouching Tiger" is a good genre film, but "Hero" is far superior. If you liked "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", you'll love "Hero". If you were underwhelmed by  "Crouching Tiger", you'll be overwhelmed by this film. Congratulations to Zhang Yimou for making a masterpiece that will be praised for generations. Don't be put off if you don't normally like martial arts movies. This is a sweeping drama that is punctuated by action. See "Hero" on the biggest screen you can find.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, storyboards, an interview with Jet Li, and a soundtrack spot. "Hero Defined" (23 minutes) is alternately narrated and subtitled in English. It follows "Hero" from pre-production through some of its 6-month shoot and includes interviews with director Zhang Yimou and the film's cast. I recommend it for Zhang's comments. "Storyboards" shows the storyboards for 4 action scenes next to the finished scene as it plays out. In "Inside the Action: A Conversation with Quentin Tarantino & Jet Li" (14 minutes), Tarantino interviews Jet Li about his career and martial arts in the movies. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish. Captioning is available in English. Dubbing is available in English and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Hero is a beautiful work of art, a visual feast for the senses featuring a powerful, complex storyline and some of the most exquisite swordplay I've ever seen.  Western filmmakers can never hope to rival the all-encompassing quality of a film like this because, to the West, martial arts are all about action, fighting, and violence.  I'm no martial arts expert - not even close - but I do know that the true martial artist is, as the name says, an artist, one who uses his limbs and entire body as unconscious extensions of a mind that has become one with the life inside and around him; it is much more of a mental than a physical endeavor.  And, as impressive as any particular fight scene may be, it is only secondary to whatever powerful forces lead up to it.<br /><br />I see no reason why Western audiences would not be enthused by this movie; the story is built on many intriguing layers, but the basic plot is seemingly easy to understand.  Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who comes to the court of the king (Daoming Chen) of the Quin province to present him with the swords of his greatest enemies, the assassins Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung).  Quin is the largest and most powerful of the Six Kingdoms, and the king's dreams of unification have been stymied for years because of the dangers posed by these deadly assassins.  The nameless hero is the first person granted the right to come closer than 100 paces from the king in the last three years.  It is odd that the knowledgeable king knew nothing of this minor official turned hero before now, so he is most interested in hearing how the nameless warrior dispatched the three most deadly fighters in all the land.  We are shown the story in a series of cinematographically gorgeous flashbacks awash in the most absorbing, vibrant of colors.  If you're thinking this sounds like a pretty simple story, though, you are quite wrong.  The king of Quin is a brilliant thinker who questions the nameless hero's story - and, eventually, the elusively remarkable truths standing at the heart of this epic film are revealed.  Hero is sure to play more powerfully to the Chinese who see in the king of Quin the man who united the disparate kingdoms and basically forged the Chinese nation-state, but the revelations imbedded in this intriguingly complex story contain nuggets of understanding for all who will see, hear, and contemplate them.<br /><br />The fight scenes that dominate the film are just exquisitely done.  You don't see a lot of martial arts films centered on the sword rather than hand-to-hand combat - probably because swordplay is difficult to master and choreograph.  The performers make it look as natural as breathing in this movie, however - it's not only incredibly impressive, it's extraordinarily beautiful to watch.  Wires schmires - it's pure poetry in motion.  Tan Dun's soundtrack only adds to the wondrous effect with its endlessly haunting strains.<br /><br />What really makes Hero stand out is the complexity of its characters.  The nameless hero, Sky, Broken Sword, Flying Snow, the king of Quin - these are not simple warriors; they are intricate creatures with deep, long-standing motivations, connoisseurs of the art they pursue, master strategists, dreamers, and men and women with ideals far more powerful than themselves.<br /><br />I have to mention the fact that Ziyi Zhang appears in this film as an apprentice to Broken Sword - although hers is not a major part.  Many will recognize her from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers.  For my money, she's the brightest light in Hong Kong cinema.<br /><br />This film is truly epic in scope - in terms of the cinematography as well as the incredible performances.  The only recent martial arts film I rate higher than Hero is House of Flying Daggers - and I don't expect any movie to top that extraordinary masterpiece any time soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created "House of Flying Daggers," Yimou created "Hero" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, "Hero" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: "Broken Sword", "Flying Snow" and "Long Sky" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.<br /><br />But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?<br /><br />Despite having been released much later, "Hero" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic "Rashomon," by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.<br /><br />And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.<br /><br />As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.<br /><br />Rich, visually entrancing and crammed with powerful emotions, "Hero" is one movie that won't leave your memory anytime soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>Zhang Yimou's films are like the "perfect woman". They're beautiful to look at and intelligent. <p> I've been reading that people have been comparing this film to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". People who compare this film to Lee's film, are not very educated in foreign films. And I don't say this to sound like a snob. "Hero" is similar to Chen Kaige's "The Emperor & the Assassin". The story-line follows the same time in history. And to be honest both film are masterpieces. But, I admit as I watched this film in it's opening moments I thought to myself that "Hero" seems to lack something "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "The Emperor & the Assassin" had. This film doesn't seem as majestic as either. Also the fight scenes don't seem as amazing as those in Lee's film. But, Zhang Yimou's film possess other qualities that make this film just as impressive. Yimou's film's are always heartfelt and emotional. There is such passion in his films. "Hero" is such an impressive movie. It's just as touching as Yimou's other masterpieces like "Raise the Red Lantern", "To Live" & "The Road Home".<p> The story revolves around a warrior named "nameless" (played by Jet Li). He has managed to kill three of the King's most feared assassins. And now has been rewarded by meeting the king. King, intrigued to discover how one man could have achieved such a feat, ask him to tell him the story of how he accomplished this. "Nameless" tells his story of how he was able to deceit the three of them. But, soon something unexpected happens in this movie, and this is when the movie had me hooked. And soon we are asked to question ourselves as to what is true. And soon we are thinking of another classic foreign film. Kurosawa's "Rashomon".<p> "Hero" has so many hearfelt moments in it that we gladly give our emotions to the characters. The movie's ultimate message, without spoiling the film for you, is about peace. Here once again Zhang Yimou has made a bold, beautiful, tender film that all should be able to enjoy. I haven't seen many movies so far this year, but, I doubt I'll be able to see a better film than this one.<p> Bottom-line: Might not have the gradeur of films like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "The Emperor & the Assassin", but, it makes up for it with it's emotional impact and Yimou's strong directing. So far, the year's best film!</p></br><a href="../users/AYUFQY3XG4ZBR.html">AYUFQY3XG4ZBR</a><br/><p>"Hero" is absolutely one of most beautifully filmed movies of ANY genre...EVER.  For that reason alone it is worth seeing, whether you are a fan of martial arts movies or not.<br /><br />The use of colors as themes, indeed practically as supporting actors in their own right is absolutely awe-inspiring.  The movie becomes impressionist art brought to life, and a particularly dazzling life at that.  The action sequences are sublime (the highlight for me was perhaps too early in the movie when Jet Li and Donnie Yen squared off at the "chess" club during a rainstorm.  These are two professionals of unquestioned pedigree and ability that are always a joy to watch in any fight sequence; they have clearly outdone themselves in "Hero"), and the wirework -while admittedly not to everyone's taste- is likewise inspired.<br /><br />Comparisons to the Japanese classic "Rashomon" are justified, even though "Rashomon" is essentially multiple perceptions of the same act and "Hero", also told mainly in a series of flashbacks, is more similar to the ending of the home video version of "Clue" (most immediate example that comes to mind; obviously "Hero" is a far moe serious film than "Clue"!).<br /><br />My only problem is that the ending completely betrays the direction in which film was heading from the very beginning.  Without giving away the ending, it is simply not believable to me that someone who has dedicated so much of his life toward accomplishing a specific task would allow the certainty of his commitment to be questioned or even remotely compromised so easily.  I have noticed a rash of pacifism in mainstream martial arts films over the past few years (perhaps starting with Li Mu Bai's decision to hang up the Green Destiny sword in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and running through Hanbei Mizoguchi's pleas for non-violence in "Samurai Fiction"), and frankly I find it rather unbecoming for the genre.  The title of "Hero" somewhat belies the decision of the protagonist, in my opinion.<br /><br />"Hero" shares some of the tragic Shakespearean elements of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"...and as a result both films are somewhat "deeper" in content than most martial arts movies, perhaps in an attempt to appeal beyond the typical cult audience and toward manistream moviegoers.  I'm not a class warrior or a movie snob enough to recoil in horror at the notion, but the soul of what makes these movies so enjoyable is somewhat compromised and that is somewhat disappointing if you have spent years watching the movies and developing your appreciation based on traditional martial arts film values.  Regardless of the action and effects and choreography that drop the jaw to the floor, the plot should have a resolution that is met with satisfaction within the viewer's soul.  And for THIS viewer, "Hero", though undeniably beautiful and almost certain to find a place on my shelf for its aesthetics alone, does not pass that test.  How unfortunate.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />The Hollywood action crowd could learn a thing or two from "Hero," a martial arts picture that tells a complex story to go along with its fight scenes and generates one unforgettable image after another.<br /><br />Set in the period before China became a united kingdom, "Hero" deals with such classic themes as courage, self-sacrifice, honor, revenge and romantic passion, and does so on a scale that is both intimate and epic.  In this tale about the founding of a nation, the protagonist is a master swordsman, known only as "Nameless," who is either an assassin of other would-be assassins who are out to kill a king, or an assassin bent on killing the king himself.  The beauty of the story is that it unfolds in the form of a mystery, almost "Rashomon"-like in the way it views the same incidents from the differing and often contradictory perspectives of various characters, some of them eyewitnesses to the events and others spinning tales out of pure speculation.  Like the images in a kaleidoscope, the plot points are constantly grouping, then falling to pieces, then re-grouping into other patterns until a full-blown picture of the entire story at last emerges.<br /><br />The kaleidoscope analogy is a fitting one, for it is in its visuals that "Hero" truly becomes a masterpiece.  The film is like an artist's canvas brought brilliantly to life, a canvas covered with the most vivid and eye-popping colors imaginable.  Whether it's the sight of huge armies marching against impressive landscapes, their flags of war fluttering in the breeze, or thousands upon thousands of arrows soaring through the air in a literal rain of death, or a beautifully choreographed fight scene in a meadow strewn with impossibly yellow and red autumn leaves, "Hero"'s imagery makes an indelible impression on the viewer.  As is the custom with many recent Chinese films, the swordfight scenes have been turned into slow motion ballets, with the participants defying gravity by flying effortlessly through the air to unimaginable heights.  This emphasis on the surreal gives the film the mythic quality it needs to tells its ancient tale.<br /><br />Yet, even with all its visual sumptuousness, "Hero" never forgets that it is, first and foremost, a story about people - their lives, their loves, and the conflicts they face as they play out the roles assigned to them by history.  Rather than getting buried under all the visuals, the characters are able to stand out from the background and make their mark on the viewer's heart.  This is helped immeasurably by the fine performances from Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Maggie Cheung among others.<br /><br />Kudos to writers Feng Li and Bin Wang, director Yimou Zhang, cinematographer Christopher Doyle, costume designer Emi Wada and all the other talented artists who have had a hand in crafting one of the most visually exquisite and intellectually satisfying films in recent memory.  American moviemakers please take note!</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>Action + Classic Narrative + Philosophy = a martial arts film with a brain.<br /><br />I picked up this film as a little light entertainment while lying on the couch recovering from an injury.  I was pleasantly surprized!  Yes, it has its share of typical martial arts action (i.e. people flying, walking on water, doing unbelievable stunts, etc.), but it is all tied together by a story line that makes sense and even causes the viewer to think afterward.  The film started a little slow, then quietly hooked me before I realized I was watching something with substance.  If it were not for the slow start I would invite friends over to see this film and discuss it.<br /><br />Now, for a tough question, is it better for a people to be bound together by even a bad government than for everyone to have the freedom to be a law unto themselves?  We see the question everywhere around us . . .<br /><br />1 Roman Catholic Church or 34,000 Protestant Churches?<br /><br />1 evil dictator or multiple warring tribes?<br /><br />Federal rights or States' rights?<br /><br />Should Taiwan and Hong Kong exist apart from China?<br /><br />Watch the film, then decide.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>I didn't know what to expect when I rented Hero, but I was pleasantly surprised. With its intense visual style, gracefully choreographed fight scenes and a storyline that you are really able to get into, Hero proves to be the only movie I've seen recently that is really worth a damn. I've heard people say it's the Chinese 'Braveheart' and I really think that sums this picture up. This definitely feels like epic filmmaking. I would absolutely recommend this one to not only people that are fans of martial arts movies, but also to people who are enraptured by awesome storytelling. Plus the visual style in this film is just phenomenal.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Monday, February 07, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Sumptuous imagery but somewhat lacking in substance.<br /><br />Hero tells the disjointed tale of a nameless warrior who is granted an audience with the future ruler of China.  The warrior claims to have vanquished three assassins who have plagued the royal household for years.  Through a variety of flashbacks we view the different angles of the story as told to the King until it is completely at odds with what was originally expected.  Compared to Crouching Tiger this film lacks the epic scope and humanistic sweep.  It tries too hard to be attractive.  There are moments of sumptuous beauty as the fights are framed and CG effects are poured in.  The wire work is great and the color palettes change in dramatic fashion with the combatants.  The film asks the viewer to make a lot of logical jumps for the purpose of plot advancement, and to embrace fully its eventual coda.  I wasn't quite ready to do that, but that didn't hinder me from enjoying the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>First off, this movie is way better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  The fact that it is based on a legend in China makes it even better.  Some of the most amazing directing and fight scenes I have ever seen.  The fighting is about 95% with swords (Kung Fu wasn't invented until many centuries later) but it is spectacular nonetheless.<br /><br />Jet Li is a warrior who supposedly has killed three assasins who were trying to kill the emperor.  As a reward, he is invited to the emperor's home (it is not really a palace but a big building) and allowed to approach the emperor within 10 paces (nobody else may come within 100 paces).<br /><br />He is given riches and must tell the tale how he disposed of the 3 assasins.  The tale is told 3 different ways.  Each time the director uses different colors.  First, yellow and red, then green, and finally white.  Each story is very different.  The tension builds to a highly climatic and unexpected ending.<br /><br />Not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>"Hero" is another visually amazing film from Asia. The entire cast is excellent in this period-piece, but the beautiful scenery and choreography steal the film. From the mountains to the costumes, the film is just beautiful. The story is well written even though some things are predictable. Even though many films have been similar to this one, it still has something that makes it it's own. Some of the things in this film I have never seen any where else. If you love recent martial arts films, then you owe it to yourself to check this one out. It's as good as it looks</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>"Hero" is a beautiful movie, as all Zhang Yimou movies are.  There are spectacular outdoor, epic-like scenes, and wondrously colorful costumes and fabrics (and swords!) in addition to the choreographed sword play.  I would also note that this movie was his most successful American box office flick--and therein lies a problem.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou is a great artist.  He uses the silver screen the way a Michelangelo or Rembrandt uses a canvas.  His sense of color and line and composition would cause Da Vinci or Picasso or any of the great Renaissance masters to sit up and take notice were they around today.  His films are universally admired not only for their visual artistry but--and this is where I take exception to the direction in which that this film suggests that Zhang Yimou is going--their story-telling ability and their unusual sensitivity to the human condition.  Here we have a fantasy of Chinese history brought to life.  We have supernatural swordplay--beautifully, hauntingly done, to be sure: sword play as ballet--but what we don't have is a real human story.<br /><br />This is more like a legend.  The great King of Qin, threatened by three great warriors--Sky, Broken Sword, and Flying Snow--is now threatened by a third, the Nameless one (like somebody out of a Clint Eastwood movie), who has pretended to vanquish the other three as a means to get within ten paces of the hated King in order to slay him.  This is history as seen from the point of view of Great Men, not history as the force of events and conditions greater than any single person.  This is also history as myth.  It is nationalistic: the great Chinese king unites "our land" in a great historical event in which the Chinese people can take pride.<br /><br />It also glorifies war.  The great gray mass of soldiers in the service of the king (Zhang Yimou actually used something like 18,000 soldiers from the Revolutionary Army of the People's Republic of China in the production) represents a force that will go on to triumph over lesser forces.  The King of Qin can be seen as the ultimate warlord, the warlord with the largest army and therefore the one who will win.<br /><br />Yet, there is a sense in which this does not sit well with Zhang Yimou.  He likes the individual heroes, and indeed would have Nameless achieve his personal victory except that Nameless sees in the end that killing the king would not be a victory at all.  Furthermore, Zhang Yimou celebrates in the choreographed sword dances of his heroes the indomitable human spirit that will in the long run, triumph over the forces of sheer might.  We can see this in not only the beauty of the dances, but in the association of calligraphy--that uniquely human art form--with the play of the sword.  He who practices calligraphy with his heart and soul also learns the secrets of the sword.<br /><br />My problem with all this is that just prior to seeing this film I viewed Hotel Rwanda (2004) in which ironically the horrendous human slaughter in Rwanda was achieved in large part through the use of machetes made in China.  Can we celebrate the sword about which it is said: if you live by the sword you will die by the sword?  These are words that have only a tiny impact to us compared to what they meant to the people of 2,000 years ago who actually knew what it meant to die by the sword.  Or should we more correctly celebrate the word, not the sword?  For it is also said that the word is mightier than the sword.<br /><br />I think Zhang Yimou knows this, and I suspect part of what he wanted to convey in this film is that sort of message.  However, I think his love of beauty and his sense of what works cinematically overcame what he might have intended, and instead of a great film we have one that is merely beautiful.<br /><br />But by all means see this.  See this for his artistry of course.  See this to compare it to the legendary kung fu movies.  See this for Jet Li who plays Nameless and is a great favorite of the Chinese cinema, and for Daoming Chen who plays the king.  And see this for the beautiful actresses Maggie Cheung, who plays Flying Snow, and Ziyi Zhang, who plays Moon.  And last but not least, see this for Tony Leung Chiu Wai who plays the enigmatic Broken Sword.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>Watching "Hero" for the first time was difficult. Who is the hero? Is he the supposed slayer of assassins he claims to be? Or is he hiding other motives? Are the assassins ruthless, cold murders? Or metaphysical poets of calligraphy and swordplay? A second viewing is required to absorb the subtleties of the portrayals.<br /><br />The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Each scene is saturated in a particular hue -- crimson, emerald, gold -- requiring an artist's palette to keep track of the color changes. The Chinese scenery is almost mythical in its beauty. The acting is alternately taut -- with movement kept to an absolute minimum -- and expansive, as in the many fight scenes.<br /><br />"Hero" is a movie of visual poetry, martial valor and physical tension. Though the use of wires in martial arts movies is now familiar to the point of clich&eacute;, their use in this film was astoundingly complex. The locations are extraordinary -- from a miraculously still lake to an autumn whirlwind of golden falling leaves. Thought the plot is rather spare, "Hero" is beautiful to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Make no mistake. This is a fine Martial Arts flick. While it does have some fantastic fight scenes (the choreography is definitely majestic; equal to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers"), it does have some beautiful scenery. You get to see deserts, forests, lakes, hills, and the palace of Qin all in just a hundred minutes. And the use of one color in particular sequences is what really makes this film more than it is, though I'm not sure what the colors really signify (I'm no film expert). Oh, and don't bother with the seemingly "unrealistic" things that go on in the film, like flying in the air and dodging arrows with nothing but your clothes, because it's art. It's not logic, but it's pure art. The only thing I didn't like about "Hero" was Zhang Ziyi. She is a great actress, but I found her doing a bit of overacting a few times. But with that said, everyone gives excellent performances. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen, Chen Daoming, and Ziyi turn out to be a great team of actors. Let's hope we see more from these men and women again.<br /><br />So go see this film. You'll be mesmerized.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Director Zhan Yimou is a great director of drama. But he has never directed an action film before. So I went into this with some trepidation. But he has shown with 'Hero', that he is an overall great director. This movie was very well cast and directed.<br /><br />Jet Li plays a nameless warrior who presents to the Emperor of Qin the weapons of the three greatest assassins. All of who had sworn to kill him. We are taken on a trip through the stories of the Nameless and how he killed the three assassins. And then once again when the emperor tells us his interpretation of what he perceives happen. Ever perception of the story has its on emotions, visually displayed by its own primary color. The filming is also epic; they were able to use the Chinese army to fill in as extras for the emperor's army.<br /><br />The conflict shows us the emotions involved with what that emperor was trying to do; unite the seven provinces under one rule. It does delve into both side's reasons and how one person's assassin is another's hero. And what we learn is both sides of any conflict have its heroes. But the main theme this movie tries to get across is that it is a great hero who thinks of his land before his own desires.<br /><br />For the martial artist we are treated to Jet Li and Donnie Yen fighting each other. It is a wonderful fight. And I hope we do not have to wait years to see them paired up again. This fight alone is worth watching the movie for.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Zhang Yimou's "Hero" is a feast for the eyes.  If there are any doubts as to the power of images and cinema's ability to astound by conveying imagery, such doubts will be erased by a viewing of this film.<br /><br />In feudal China, a warrior called Nameless (Jet Li) is taken to see the King of Qin (Daoming Chen).  The warrior is to be rewarded for dispatching three assassins - Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) - who had targeted the king.  Nameless is asked how he managed to overcome his foes and a series of stories unfold.  However, the king is not entirely convinced of the truth of the warrior's tales and offers his own interpretation of the events.<br /><br />The story of "Hero" echoes Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" (1950) in that the conflicting points of view keep you guessing as to the truth of the situation.  However, the narrative style employed is not the aspect of the film that will linger in your memory.  The surreal and breathtaking look of "Hero" is its most distinguishing feature.  The way in which wind, leaves, dust, water, and clothing is shot is like nothing the average filmgoer is used to seeing.  "Hero" manages to infuse the ordinary with such visual beauty that one cannot help but be hypnotized by the imagery on the screen.  Yet, do not get the impression that "Hero" is all style and no substance.  The acting is strong with Li, Chen, Yen, Leung, and Cheung all being memorable in their respective roles.  In addition, the message delivered at the end of the film is one that invites much contemplation.  Truly unique in its presentation and ambitious in aspiring to be an action tale with some food for thought, "Hero" is a film to be admired.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>What is Yimou Zhang's fixation with mixing martial arts with the tragic love story?  I guess it doesn't really matter, since this time he seems to have pulled it off pretty well.  "Hero" does what "House of Flying Daggers" tried but failed to do with any credibility -- to tell a poignant tale of passionate romance within the context of the classic Chinese martial arts film.<br /><br />Jet Li plays "Nameless", ostensibly the hero who saved the emperor of Qin from the deadly trio of assassins, Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow (the latter two being lovers).  Nameless is brought before the emperor, bearing the weapons of the three assassins as proof that he vanquished them, to be rewarded for his feat.  The emperor lavishes great honors on Nameless, and questions him about how he was able to defeat such powerful enemies.  As Nameless tells his tale, the storyline is played out as a series of flashbacks depicting each encounter.<br /><br />The emperor, however, is suspicious of Nameless, thinking him to be a crafty assassin himself and in league with the other three, using these concocted events as a way to get close to the emperor.  The emperor offers his own account of what he thinks really happened, and the story is retold to a different conclusion, again through a series of flashbacks.  Nameless notes that parts of the emperor's rendition are correct, but others are not, and tells a third and final version of the tale.  This leads to a surprising denouement, where the relationship of Broken Sword and Falling Snow is brought to a tragic climax.  The two disagree vehemently on whether the greater good would be served by killing the tyrannical emperor, as opposed to letting this strong ruler unite all the nations of China under one banner and thus end the wars that have raged for generations.  Broken Sword's ideal of "our land" and the good of the nation overrides his desire to kill the emperor, provoking a deadly challenge by Snow, with unexpected and unintended results.  In my opinion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.<br /><br />The rest of the film was relatively well done.  I thought the initial fight sequences involving Sky were great, but from there on the director relied way too much on the use of wires and special effects.  The remaining action scenes were a visual feast but lacked any real credibility, especially the fight at the lake, where Nameless and Broken Sword demonstrated an uncanny ability to walk on water.  The director's use of color was overwhelming and unmistakeable -- and at times overdone.  In general, though, the effect was positive and lent itself to a visually beautiful, if somewhat overly artsy, presentation.  If I were to compare "Hero" with "Crouching Tiger" and "Flying Daggers", I would definitely say this one is the best movie of the three.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>HERO is Yimou Zhang's first attempt at a martial arts film - and the novelty shows.  As the featurettes explain, he dreamed of making a sword film, searched for a story, and finally wrote his own story that would allow him to express his excitement about the genre.<br /><br />So, the story is minimal - Nameless Hero (Jet Li) gradually approaches the King of the province Qin as he relates how he protected the King from potential assassins.  The film is done in flashbacks to show how Nameless Hero accomplished his feats.  In the end a plot is revealed that brings the movie to an odd resolution.  And that is really all the story is about.<br /><br />The beauty here is in the choices of various colors to depict the various stages of Nameless Hero's quest: oranges become yellows become reds become greens become whites, etc.  The settings are placed within the vast deserts of China and in palace courtyards. The costumes and settings are magically lush and stunningly beautiful.  The action is the expected highly choreographed martial arts sequences that appear more like ballet than fighting.  The huge supporting casts of armies are amazingly well staged with epic action and surreal results.<br /><br />The overall message is about the way the once divided China of 2000 years ago became united into what is called 'the Land'.  That is really all we have as far as directorial message mission.  It matters little that the acting is minimal and wooden, that the use of flashbacks and revised flashforwards leaves some mystery as to which of the characters have been killed on several occasions (!).  The pleasure is in the looking - and this is a beautiful, active piece of art to watch.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>The film opens with narration from "The Nameless One," (portrayed by Jet Li), whose parents were killed by an invading army before they could give him a name. His adoptive parents gave him the name "The Nameless One" and like one who seeks to discover his destiny by finding purpose in life, Nameless studies the art of the sword for over 10 years, becoming a fearsome warrior that has taken on and defeated many other fearsome warriors.<br /><br />In this epic tale of the history of China, there is certainly more legend and fantasy than historic accuracy. The emperor of Qin has been ruthlessly taking over province after province in Asia, hoping to unite the people into one country, one tongue and one written language. His warriors kill by the thousands indiscriminantly under the authority of Qin, who has romantic notions of uniting his people by force while struggling with the ongoing paranoia of assassination attempts.<br /><br />Nameless is presented to the king of Qin as the best of warriors. He has single-handedly defeated previous formidable assassins to the king; Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung).<br /><br />Inquisitive, the king interrogates this heroic warrior and Nameless tells him the story of how he alone was able to defeat such cunning warriors. His story segues into a surreal and colorfuly rich tale with plots, subplots and twists and turns of love, hate, betrayal and jealousy. Each scene has exquisite sound as metal poles and swords clang together, you feel as though you are inbetween them. Each sub plot has its own color, season, calligraphy strokes and wind direction - a familiar theme to Asiaphiles and players of Mah-Johnng.<br /><br />The gravity-defying moves and feather-light landings of these martial artists are reminiscent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," but there the similarity ends. Like many epics, this too is a film of good vs. evil, but this film is different entirely from the Ang Lee epic. The moves are artistic and even poetic, but far more exhaustive to watch. You can literally get worn out watching these people fly across trees, water and the air and attempt to plunge swords into one another.<br /><br />The paranoid king doubts Nameless's story and accuses him of lying. The king tells his own version of events as they play out in his mind and we see the same players, wearing different colors, in different seasons and different directions of wind fighting and loving, with different outcomes.<br /><br />The king and Nameless play this verbal ping-pong back and forth and the candles that surround the king flicker ominously in one direction, then the next.<br /><br />Despite the sword play and twisted love tales, there is only artisitc, choreographed violence - we don't see severed limbs as in "Kill Bill," we don't see gushing blood & guts or squished eyeballs. There is a brief sex scene in which we see no real nudity and more is implied than seen. We see Jet Li's backside as he is stripped by the king's guards to ensure that he has no weapons hidden on his person - even his hair is iinspected. Only a partial glimpse is seen of his backside, so it's only partial, partial nudity at most. For the most part, this is a family friendly film - but I don't think I'd take a kid under the age of 13.<br /><br />If I were fluent in Mandarin and saw this in China, I would have given the film 5 stars, but due to the way the subtitles were rendered, I am forced to give the film 4 stars.<br /><br />On a DVD, the subtitles would be in the black area below the letterboxed film - but on the big screen, they stick the white letters on top of the bottom of the film, without any darker backdrop. The words are spanned from left to right almost edge to edge on the screen, so your eyes really have to dart back and forth unless you're in the back of the theater and the dialogue goes by way too fast to keep up if your eyes are having to scan back and forth 3 times to get all the subtitles. The white letters are placed above light objects that are in motion, which also makes it quite difficult to read. I have seen many foreign films and I have to say, this was the poorest subtitle rendering I have ever seen. I have never had a problem keeping up with subtitles in other films, but this one just wore my eyeballs out. My guess is that this will be resolved in the DVD version.<br /><br />So, if you see this on the big screen, you need to sit closer to the back than the front, or else you will not be able to keep up. There were many people commenting in the theater during the credits that they could not keep up with the pace of the dialogue because the subtitles were so difficult to read on non-contrasting backgrounds.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I've never been a big fan of martial arts films until recent years.  After seeing "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Iron Monkey", both incredible movies, I've realized that this genre has some really excellent work and now this movie, starring Jet Li, can be added to the list.  Though "Crouching Tiger" is still my favorite, this film is completely amazing and has some of the most beautiful imagery I've seen on film.  Whether it be a "shower of arrows" or golden leaves whirling around two fighters, this movie uses small things and turns them into a complete treasure for the eye.  Even color is used like a secondary character in this film.  I think this is one of the most stylized films I have seen in the last few years and Hollywood should take note.<br /><br />Jet Li was really good---this is the first film I've seen him in.  After seeing "Hero", I'll have to check out some of his other work in Chinese cinema.  Maggie Cheung is a beautiful actress and I hope to see more of her.  The rest of the cast do nicely in their roles, a couple of them also cast members from "Crouching Tiger".<br /><br />If for nothing else, you'll enjoy the look of this film.  But luckily for the viewer, there is more than that---a good story, great fighting sequences, a passionate love story.  A good movie that offers a little bit of everything to please everyone.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Hero, brings to the screen the story of a warrior who rids the realm of three assassins who threaten the emperor's life.

There really isn't much of Tan Dun in HERO, but the sound track is extremely artful and effective as a counterpoint to the spectacular cinematography. The visual splendor of this movie is what carries the action (or lack of action) and the actors. The "story" is complex, intellectually provoking, almost a cultural essay rather than an action flick. The acting is less than subtle -- do I dare say "wooden" -- except when the computer-assisted ballets of combat erupt. The whole narrative ends in a way that many non-Chinese may find uncomfortable, if they choose to analyze it. Next time I watch, I'm gonna kill the English subtitles (if it's possible) and treat the whole thing as a symphony of sounds and colors.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>After reading a few reviews for this movie I thought it was gonna be huge, epic battles.  Wrong.  There are some great battle scenes and the colors and images are breathtaking.  But, this movie is more of a love story than a war story.  I liked the way it was told, although it will probably confuse some people.  Jet Li is a great actor/martial artist/stunt coordinater/producer.  The other actors are good too.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is probably the hype.  While all the battle scenes are great, for me, they ended up ending too soon.  I also wasn't expecting the complex story, which I liked, but there were just a few too many twists and turns thrown in.<br /><br />Overall if you want to see a good martial arts/romance/historical<br /><br />piece then you should see this.

This film is huge in scope with magnificent sets, a large cast of extras all clad in ancient armor, and beautiful locales for all the scenes to unfold shrouded in a veil of fantastic cinematography.  I was reminded of two Kurosawa films, in particular: "Ran" and "Rashomon."  "Ran" because of the sheer size of this film with regards to sets, cast, and costumes; and "Rashomon" because of the unusual plotting.  It isn't until the film is nearing its conclusion that the entire truth is revealed with an historical aspect thrown in for good measure.  Of course, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is the most immediate comparison in modern day cinema with regards to the balletic choreography during the many fight sequences.  The magical fantasy that was so charming in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is given a much more serious tone here with ancient history/folklore as the driving spiritual force behind the story.  There are some minor flaws.  The one that stands out the most is when two similar scenes are compared.  Both are fight sequences that take place within the matched warriors' minds.  The early sequence is shot in black and white, while the later scene is shot in color.  That sort of lack of consistency is the main reason I cannot consider this a masterpiece.  There were many other small, though unfortunately noticable flaws scattered throughout the story, but to nitpick would be to forget how good the rest of the film is.  The cinematography is the true star here, though many of the actors acquit themselves with talent and dignity.  This is a glorious and colorful spectacle from one of my favorite directors, Zhang Yimou.  It was interesting that he chose to do an action film when his most notable films are all dramas.  Some of his finest works include "Raise the Red Lantern," "Ju Dou," and my personal favorite, "To Live."  As for the DVD, the special features section highlights include a comprehensive documentary featurette and a sit-in with Quentin Tarantino and Jet Li talking about the film and other martial arts films of note.  All in all, this DVD is a solid purchase.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Hero is a beautiful and stunning film. The cinematography is outstanding. And just seeing the landscapes of the Chinese countryside are breath-taking.<br /><br />I have to admit for me the story was alittle hard to follow. The subtitles moved alittle to fast in places, and I missed some of it. In certain scenes I may have been looking at the beautiful<br /><br />landscapes and just missed the subtitles. And the same story is told in three different versions so it does not flow continuously.<br /><br />The special effects were also amazing. And these were done in such a way that they added to the beauty of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>This is a movie that hits you on every possible level, emotionally, visually, aurally - nearly every sense is engaged.<br /><br />Rarely has a director's use of color to capture and frame action and emotion succeeded as magnificently as does Yimou Zhang in "Hero."  Told through a sequence of four strongly defined acts within a framing device of narrative sequences between the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) and Nameless (Jet Li) each act presents a different spin on how Nameless (Hero) conquered the three most feared would be assassins of the King, becoming the only man garnering trust and honor enough to come within 10 paces of the fearful of his life ruler.  Zhang imbues each act with a distinctive and explosive yet marvelously controlled palette:  Red, White, Blue, and Green, each setting the emotional tone, advancing the physical drama, the resultant effect a marvelous achievement combining art and action.<br /><br />As stunning as Hero is visually as a story its actors must pull their own and here Zhang is blessed with an ensemble up to the difficult challenges presented them in a deceptively simple tale.  I cannot praise highly enough the work each brings to the film lending even further to the feeling of luxuriousness Zhang has imparted into every frame.<br /><br />Throughout its four Rashomon-like sequences, each actor takes on divergent motivations to achieve their actions altering personalities while simultaneously maintaining the centrality essential to their established characters. In this regard, Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Broken Arrow), Maggie Cheung (Flying Snow), and Ziyi Zhang (Moon), with Messrs. Lee and Chen present a formidable acting ensemble.<br /><br />Greater challenge is given to each as Hero, necessarily offers little opportunity exists for traditional character development.  In spite of that challenge Zhang's cast exceeds every imposed limitation and create fascinatingly complex characters who become easy to care for as they go about the business of breaking our hearts.<br /><br />As deeply felt - and as integral - as the emotional content, Hero's action sequences are executed with a combination of old world bravado and new age technology that is - quite literally - breathtaking.  The scenes of Qin's army -thousands of them - in battle, marching or surrounding the palace, is overwhelming in its sheer manpower.<br /><br />Hand-to-hand combats, with their Shaolin priest inspired feats of flying up walls, atop lakes or through the air are nothing short of spectacular, their stylized violent images ravishing and the most beautiful in an already staggeringly striking film.<br /><br />Entwined throughout is a nationalistic tale of disparate warring factions unifying to become one China.  Unfortunately many have misconstrued the film's message comparing sublimation and sacrifice of individual will for the greater good, with Hitler's plan for a master race.  Nothing could be further from truth and spirit of this remarkable film.<br /><br />p.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>This is such an odd movie.  It is surreal.  Its greatest strength is its physical beauty, its use of color, its use of masses of uniformed men, the panoply of it all.<br /><br />Its greatest weakness for me was that it had me experiencing the agitation of its main characters.  That's never fun for me.  It is a bit emotionally draining.<br /><br />We have the convention of one individual outperforming thousands, the super-hero silliness.  But rather than criticize the unreality of it, we can only accept it as part of the surreal character of a film that is a beautiful poem to watch.<br /><br />The plot doesn't bear scrutiny.  It is a story of assassins whose target is an ambitious king of a region of China, intent on conquering the nation piece by piece in order to unify all of it.<br /><br />Do the assassins want revenge for the attack against their own region, or do they choose to sacrifice their own land in favor of unity?  Are they assassins or aren't they?<br /><br />Why stop at China?  Why not justify the conquest of the entire world in the name of unity?  Wouldn't this prevent future wars?<br /><br />No of course it wouldn't.  There would be the rebellions.  Unity works best when the defeated party has a change of heart and rejoins the nation, as happened in the USA.<br /><br />Human rights are more important than political unity, which can be either good or bad.  Do we unify the world in the name of Hitler?  Unity in itself is neither good nor bad, and accepting this truth weakens the argument of this movie.<br /><br />The plot is pretty weak, since it all boils down to whether the assassins want to kill or don't.  What kind of movie is that?  I want to kill you.  No, on second thought, maybe I don't.  I don't think it is much of a plot.<br /><br />The weakness of the plot and the agitation of the main characters influence me to knock the rating down to 3 stars, but the beauty of the movie prevents me from dropping any lower.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created "House of Flying Daggers," Yimou created "Hero" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, "Hero" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: "Broken Sword", "Flying Snow" and "Long Sky" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.<br /><br />But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?<br /><br />Despite having been released much later, "Hero" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic "Rashomon," by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.<br /><br />And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.<br /><br />As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>Set in what we know today as China but about 2000 years ago Hero is told in several sections and gets kind of confusing at times. Apparently the king of Qin, one of six sections of the future China, has been troubled for years by three assassins. One day a nameless man (Jet Li) comes in and tells the tale of how he has defeated the King's enemies. The king listens and then tells him that wasn't the way it was , it was this way and proceeds to tell the story a different way (in his version apparently only one of the killers is apparently dead and Li is working with the other two). Both versions use flashbacks and a lot of detail & locations as well as a predominating color in each story's segments.<br /><br />It was very interesting to look at, I loved a lot of the details but found the use of color distracting.<br /><br />I don't remember how I might've rated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I think I liked it better overall. Ziyi Zhang ws in both movies, I'd like to see more of her work.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>After seeing Mr. Yimou's other 2 films about the feudal warlords of ancient China (House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower), I have become a fan. Indeed, with "Hero", he has created a world unto itself, magical and mystical, thanks to brilliant use of color (Christopher Doyle's award winning cinematography is stunning) and the exceptional use of Tan Dun's music (with help from Itzhak Perlman). Multiple plots and the interpretation of events make this a film to pay attention to, and at a swift 99 minute running time, it's worthy of multiple viewings. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Ziyi Zhang, Chiu Wai, among others, are perfectly cast. If this is a "trilogy", I think "Hero" is the best of the three. It's truly a visual and cerebral treat!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Though Hero is less than two hours long, it feels like a sweeping epic.  Maybe that's because of the brilliant cinematography, the engaging set pieces, the surprisingly emotional performances, and twisty storytelling that propels the film.  Jet Li, who it is great to see in a film of this type without a hip-hop soundtrack or a team-up with DMX, plays Nameless: a mysterious warrior claiming to have defeated three warriors who had intended to assassinate the reigning King of Qin.  As the story unfolds, twists are abound, as Nameless recalls the events, and the King gives his own interpretation.  The fight scenes are exceptionally done, even though there are plenty who will find them redundant, overdone, and possibly even drawn out or boring.  Hero isn't a film for pure action junkies who love American Jet Li flicks like Kiss of the Dragon or Romeo Must Die, but it would do them well to see this and keep an open mind.  Beautifully executed, Hero is a smash.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Okay, people...let's get a hold of ourselves.  Many have knocked the martial arts sequences in HERO as being horribly unrealistic and that this fact has ruined the movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  True, the martial arts in this film are not the "realistic" acrobatics of Jackie Chan.  Instead, it is pure visual poetry.  These martial arts sequences are absolutely beautiful to watch.  Anyone that can watch them without coming away with a sense of awe is just plain blind in my book.<br /><br />In fact, that goes for the entire movie.  HERO is one of the most gorgeous films I have seen in a long time.  Not only are the sequences superb, but the scenic locations are also breathtaking.  Moreover, the extensive use of color is astounding.  While watching it, I felt completely transported into a different world and found myself lost in the film's sheer beauty.  Furthermore, the mythical story is extremely complex, interweaving several themes & variations of the central plot.  The audience gradually discovers the truth of this film and it continued to surprise me throughout its length.<br /><br />I am not sure why so many people did not like this film.  I can only guess that they were expecting a pure-action film with Jet Li taking on a country, "Rambo" style.  I, for one, am happy that we were treated to something more.  HERO has plot, heart, emotion, and style.  And let us not forget the outstanding action it does provide: the action sequences in this film are some of the best ever captured on film.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Red version: Hero is the story of one man's quest (Nameless, played by Jet Li) to destroy the three assassins (lovers Broken Sword played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Flying Snow played by Maggie Cheung, and Sky played by Donnie Yen) who tried to kill the King of Qin (Chen Daoming).  Nameless bests Sky in combat, and Broken Sword and Flying Snow betray each other, all the while fighting off the King's entire army, until Nameless finally kills Snow. At least, that's the story Nameless tells the King, who is privileged with advancing within ten paces of him.<br /><br />Blue version: The King disagrees.  He knows the assassin lovers and doesn't believe the story. He instead believes that the three assassins sacrificed their own lives to allow Nameless the audience with the King, and thus a chance to commit regicide himself. He has developed a special move, the King theorizes, that can kill a man at ten paces.<br /><br />White version: Now the truth comes out.  Nameless explains who he is, where he came from, and why he is in the King's palace. Nameless has a technique that can skewer a person while missing all their vital organs, making the blow look fatal. He used it on Sky and he uses it again on Flying Snow. Surprisingly, Broken Sword is against the entire notion of assassinating the King at all, a decision that harkens back to the duo's first assassination attempt. It failed only because Broken Sword chose not to kill the King.<br /><br />Throughout the movie parallels are made between calligraphy and martial arts, and specifically the symbol for the word "sword." There are deeper meanings within the brush strokes, a form of enlightenment that Broken Sword achieved and that the King discovers in his conversation with his would-be assassin. Nameless' decision and the effect it has on the other assassins provides the twist to the tale.<br /><br />Hero is a breathtaking movie, filled with balletic martial arts, lovely scenes in vivid colors, and natural settings reflecting China's ancient history and beauty.  It's entertaining and moving, and the relationship between Broken Sword and Flying Snow anchors the piece.  The three different tales, each depicted by a particular color scheme, provides different backdrops for heroics, drama, and warfare.<br /><br />On the other hand, Hero is a Chinese cinematic version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399144463">Who Moved My Cheese</a>" - it reinforces the status quo with a sinister charm.  Killing kings is foolish, says Hero, because it only leads to more war.  Nameless' decision is one of sacrifice, one for the many.  Were this only a fable, the story wouldn't be politically charged.  But the King of Qin went on to become the Emperor of China, who did a lot of great things.  So, you know, killing him would be bad because China wouldn't be nearly as great without him.<br /><br />The question becomes whether or not that matters on a greater moral scale.  Hero clearly makes the point that we should feel sympathy for the poor King in his enlightened state. Revenge never gets anyone anywhere. And yet by reducing the course of history to the assassination of one man, Hero makes many assumptions: about the importance of said man, about the progress of China, about our own human failings.  It's a very Chinese movie, which makes it either more authentic or less palatable to American audiences. It all depends on your definition of the term "hero."</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>I cannot say I have ever been more amazed at visual style of a movie director more than when I first saw Hero on the big screen. Its got colors, atmoshphere, style, story. It has SOMETHING that makes you watch it with your jaw dropped. Beautiful.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>HERO was originally released in Asia in 2002 under the title YING XIONG.  The film stars Jet Li as a fighter and local lawman known as Nameless. The movie takes place in ancient times when the country of China did not yet exist and was simply a broken nation of seven different kingdoms. The King of Qin is a wise and mighty ruler and is determined to unite the warring kingdoms into one country. Nameless is sent to the King after it is known that he has killed three assassins, two men and one woman, who have tried to murder the King before. Nameless tells his story and a battle of wits ensues as the story is revised several times.<br /><br />There is some pretty darn cool sword fighting that takes place in HERO and the visual imagery is stunningly beautiful. The plot device of retelling the story several times makes the film more interesting than if it was a simple straitforward tale and the slow character development of Nameless and King that builds before our eyes augments the other positive aspects of the movie.<br /><br />However, HERO is a movie and simply as a movie, it's not as good as it could have been.  For example, some of the action sequences are drawn out way too long and come off as being cheesy (many in the theatre I attended laughed at some of the most serious battle sequences in the film). Also, because the story is retold several times, viewers can easily become confused and disinterested.  As a work of art though, HERO is magnificent and is worth watching just to admire its beauty.  Appreciate it for what it is and nothing more.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>In 2002, Yimou Zhang directed the Chinese martial-arts film entitled "Hero", or "Ying Xiong" in transliterated Mandarin Chinese.  Released theatrically in the U.S. in 2004, the film's story centers around three assassins, a warrior and a king who are experts with martial arts in pre-unified China.  Each of the assassins are from the kingdom of Zhao and want to kill the king (Daoming Chen) of the neighboring kingdom known as Qin. As the film begins, the king of Qin has requested a visit from a nameless warrior (Jet Li) who claims to have defeated the assassins.  The nameless warrior enters a great empty hall and is told to sit about 50 paces from the king to tell his story.  The king sits on a raised platform. In front of the platform and separating him from the rest of the great hall are a hundred or more flickering oil-filled lamps shaped like small soldiers.  As the nameless soldier begins to tell his story about how he defeated the assassins, the film flashes back to a Zhao village with a massive Qin army approaching.  Inside the Zhao village is a school of calligraphy in which the assassins have come to live: Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Ziyi Zhang, who played the pivotal character of Jen Yu in the 2000 film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon").  In this first version of the story with all of the Zhao people wearing red, the Qin army opens fire with a massive number of arrows shot from very long bows.  The arrows begin to destroy the village and the calligraphy school.  The assassins escape the onslaught, but are encountered by the nameless warrior who successfully defeats them.  Returning to the king of Qin's great hall, the king is suspicious of the nameless warrior's story and proceeds to tell what he believes really happened.  In this second version of the nameless warrior's battle with the three assassins, they all wear blue and a beautiful battle scene unfolds over a lake with floating choreography reminiscent of the 2000 film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon".  Returning again to the king of Qin's great hall, the king becomes suspicious of the warrior's true intensions as the flickering oil lamps blow in a particular direction to warn the king.  It is here the final and more honest telling of the story begins with the three assassins and the nameless warrior all wearing white.  Here, Broken Sword explains why several years earlier he did not kill the king of Qin when he and Flying Snow had the opportunity to do so.  During this explanation the film flashes back several more years to the king of Qin's great hall, which is filled with green drapes.  With Broken Sword and Flying Snow each wearing green and taking on the king's massive army, Broken Sword engages in a personal battle with the king; but makes a surprising choice.  Here, at last, the full meaning of the story becomes clear as time shifts back to the present for a highly emotional ending.<br /><br />With a combination of exquisite uses of color, beautiful cinematography, superb martial arts choreography and a complex story, "Hero" is a wonderful film to watch.  If you enjoyed films such as the 2000 "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or the 2004 "The House of Flying Daggers" (in which Ziyi Zhang also starred), you will probably enjoy "Hero".  What is important to remember with "Hero" is the historical context for the film: the first emperor of China was the king of the kingdom of Qin, who successfully and brutally conquered the other former Chinese kingdoms to unify China. Other memorable characters in the film include Sky (Donnie Yen), the scholar (Liu Zhong Yuan), the old servant (Zheng Tia Yong), the general (Chang Xiao Yang) and the commander (Zhang Ya Kun).  Overall, I rate the 2002 film "Hero" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>Hero has Fantastic Cinematography, Choreography, an Amazing story, and Brilliant film production.  This is a masterful film, and a movie to treasure.  I also recommend purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q6VXC">House of Flying Daggers</a>.  For those who somehow missed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>, I suggest adding that to your wish list, as well.<br /><br />I was only slightly interested in martial arts films, until <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXR4">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a> was created, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q6VXC">House of Flying Daggers</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030590I">Hero</a> have expanded my interests.  These movies are truly masterful productions, and they have inspired many other beautiful films.  This genre is unique and highly recommended.<br /><br />If the name Quentin Tarantino freaks you out, or makes you think only of Gore, Violence, and potty mouths....relax.  This is different: not his usual fare.  Personally, I love Quentin Tarantino movies, but I can understand why some people might avoid HERO, due to his other work.  No worries; this is not what you might expect from Quentin Tarantino.  He is a genius, and this movie fits well with the genre of oriental / martial arts / beautiful cinematography films listed above.<br /><br />Don't judge the movie by the name on the cover, but by the reviews and images on the cover.  You will be impressed, amazed, and gain a new respect for Quentin Tarantino.</p></br><a href="../users/A34ZAYTNP67S83.html">A34ZAYTNP67S83</a><br/><p>While this film is breathtaking in its cinematography, and the CGI effects are used ably enough, there just isn't enough coherence to make it worth owning.<p>In other words, all the mystic mumbo-jumbo that "Crouching Tiger..." spouted are present, only without the conviction behind them.  <p>Not to say that the acting is sub-par, but the story itself seems disjointed, almost rushed.  That being said, the production values are nothing short of remarkable.  The set design department outdid themselves, to say the least.  I can't think of too many other films that had me enthralled merely by virtue of their outstanding production.  But this is one of them.<p>A beautiful film to watch, but check out "Ju-Dou" and "Raise The Red Lantern" for superior storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8GXSCB1R05T.html">A2B8GXSCB1R05T</a><br/><p>"Hero" is a very ambitious film, attempting to combine quiet introspective philosophy with visually stunning action and pageantry.  It is like an intimate epic.  The scope is grand to say the least, with full armies on the march as well as intense and magical personal duels, all of which serves as decoration to the Buddhist philosophy being put forward.<p>It is very beautiful, and this is probably the first thing to be noticed.  The various elements, actors, scenery and colors all combine to create a visual splendor.  It is a very painterly movie, a feast for the eyes.  Specifically, color is used to create moods and to differentiate the various storylines.  If the visuals are painterly, then the Martial Arts are dancerly, along the same line as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," to which inevitable comparisons must be drawn.  The actors are equally beautiful as well, and "Hero, truly a feast for the eyes, could probably be enjoyed in this manner, without any dialog. <p>Storywise, it is a variation on the familiar "Rashomon" theme of "what is the truth?"  The same story is told and re-told, each time moving closer to the purity of truth, and with truth comes enlightenment.  This is an intimate tale,  a quiet verbal duel between an Emperor, so fearsome and lonely than no human can approach within one hundred paces of him, and a nameless subject, who might just be a true hero.  Between them, a story is told of epic engagements, artists and warriors, and what is actually worth fighting and dying for.<p>I won't spoil too much of the story, as part of "Hero's" strength and insight lies in discovery.  That is not to say that it is full of surprises and twist endings, but rather that, like all Buddhist insight, the answer of the movies riddle lies as much in the viewer as in the actors.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I have seen this film on dvd and have enjoyed it ever since, but now --- thanks to Quentin Tarantino --- I've been given the chance to see Zhang Yimou's film where it should be seen: on a big-screen theater.<br /><br />Hero is one of those rare films that transcends its genre roots. In simplest terms, Yimou's epic is nothing but a kung fu film. Where Yimou's film excels and exceeds its predecessors is in its use of the color palette. Hero's use of vibrant solid colors to represent a certain sequence of events and point of view is surpassed only by Akira Kurosawa's classic Shakesperean samurai epic Ran. As in Kurosawa's classic, Yimou infuses the screen with vibrant colors to tell a story of love, vengeance and in the end, the true meaning of heroism. Hero's scenes burst with color. From the solid crimson that dominates the Calligraphy School sequence to the solid colors of red, turquoise, yellow, etc.. on the characters costumes. Just the use of color alone makes Hero a must-see film for students of film and cinematography.<br /><br />Yimou's film owes alot of its narrative to Kurosawa's other Shakespearean samurai classic Rashomon. His film tells the events detailed by Jet Li's character, Nameless, to the Emperor Qin of China through flashbacks. Each telling is countered by a different version the Emperor has been told in advance. Each Rashomon-like sequence also points out that truth will always be subjective. What is truth for one individual may turn out to be a lie for another. The dialogue between Nameless and the Emperor are as riveting as the martial arts scenes the dominate each flashback sequence. I would give Hero a less than perfect score just for the fact that its story gets lost once in awhile in the visuals and pageantry of Yimou's direction. This might become a problem for audience who can't keep track of what they're watching and reading the subtitles at the same time.<br /><br />Jet Li has always been a favorite actor of mine. I've seen most of his films from his Hong Kong kung fu films to the mediocre ones he has made since arriving in the United States to try his hand in becoming a Hollywood star.. Hero shows that Jet Li is more than a silent, kick-ass martial artist who is only good in making kung fu flicks. He does more than his share of fighting in Yimou's film, but during his dialogue exchange with the Emperor Qin, Li demonstrates that he is a very good actor. The audience is never really sure what his character's agenda from the beginning and part of this should be laid at Li's acting chops. He keeps Nameless enigmatic, but at the same time charismatic enough for people to root for his character. It is not til the end that we find out what has been motivating Li's character. The other actors in Hero are a who's who of Asian cinema: Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen and Zhang Ziyi. The limited time that Zhang Ziyi is given in Hero doesn't diminish her excellent work. I honestly think that her work in this film is much better and more polished than the one she did for Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She's even more beautiful in this film than she's ever been. She conveys her characters youth, passion and impetousness with equal fervor. Maggie Cheung is the opposite, but no less impressive. Her character is the balance to Ziyi's. She gives a wonderful performance of calm reserve holding back pent-up passion and emotion. Like Lee's martial arts epic, Hero treats its female characters on equal footing with its male players. This is quite a feat since the story itself is based historically during China's Warring States period when females where not given equal treatment barring the few exceptions.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou has made an extraordinarily beautiful, lyrical and classically epic film. One doesn't have to be a martial arts aficionado to thoroughly enjoy Hero. It should satisfy and entertain both men and women. It is quite a shame that it took Miramax 2 years to release this film in the United States (it was released in 2002 in Asia and has already been nominated for Best Foreign Film during the 2002 Oscars). Region 0 dvd copies are already in the market and people have ended up seeing this film only in that format. I suggest for those who have only seen this film in that way to run out to whichever theater is showing it and buy themselves a ticket to see this film the only way to see it: on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>Hero is a beautiful film. The saturated color of the costumes,autumn leaves, mountain lakes, painted deserts and palaces was superb. The martial arts scenes were amazingly directed, best described as surreal ballet in fast motion.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, changing direction three times, and thus keeping the viewers on their toes. The story is related first through the eyes of Jet Li, an assassin acting like a provincial officer. His story of the deaths of three assassins certainly has internal consistency. However the Emperor is too wise to fall for a coherent story. The Emperor then relates his suspected version of the deaths of the 3 assassins. The Emperor's story unmasks Jet Li, but the plot takes one last twist as Jet Li tell the third variation of the complicated dance of revenge, attraction, rage, and trust.<br /><br />The film left me very disturbed however in that the underlying philosophy is that the stability of the state, even a state created by a blood thirsty tyrant, is of such value that individuals must sacrifice their lives for the unity of China. Whereas this concept may be acceptable in China where the authority of the state must be preserved at all costs, is far different from the political philosophy of the United States where citizens can rebel and react against tyranny.<br /><br />The film is beautiful but in the end it is a creature of another culture and political philosophy from our own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) presents himself to the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), who is engaged in the forceful unification of the separate lands that will one day constitute China.  Nameless claims to have slain the three master assassins (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, and Donnie Yen) that have dedicated themselves to destroying the King, and the king allows Nameless to come within 100 paces of the throne to relate his adventure.  When he has finished, the king has his own interpretation of events, which throws doubt on all we have heard.  Both versions are presented in flashback.<br /><br />This film has an interesting structure and a good basic story, but ultimately emerges as an overblown homage to a tyrant.  All of the main characters are presented as beings who exist on a rarefied plane where every act and thought is fraught with nuance and philosophical implication.  This includes the King of Qin, who is not simply a conquering despot, but a selfless philosopher-king who just happens to command an enormous army and doesn't flinch at slaughtering his opponents, even when they offer no resistance, such as the passive students of a calligraphy school.  The strong jingoistic slant is perhaps not surprising, given that this is the most expensive film in Chinese history; I suppose that government cooperation does not come without strings attached.<br /><br />In addition to the above objections, the film is just plain overblown.  I loved "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  It featured incredible wirework and beautiful cinematography as well, but it was all in service of a compelling story and a convincing romance.  Director Zhang Yimou spares no effort to outdo Ang Lee's film by straining to make every single frame beautiful with a capital B.  Everything is color-coordinated, wind-blown, perfectly lighted, and slo mo.  He seems to have forgotten that a fight scene should also be exciting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>I started off my day watching "Spider Man", cause I was in that mood to see "Spider Man 2" again, but I decided to see "HERO". Besides I've been waiting for this film sense 2002 when the Academy nominated it for Best Foreign Film. My mother and I wanted see it, because we thought it was going to be another martial arts film. And I bet that's the way the rest of America felt.<br /><br />I was thinking "Okay another Jet Li film, nothing to worry about, I mean think about it. "Lethal Weapons 4", "Black Mask", I mean Jet Li hasn't done good movies. Man was I WRONG. This film is probably the best film of the year. The colors of the characters clothes tell us which story is real or fake. The story is told from more than one point of view. You can't tell which story is real until the ending, an ending that I will not spoil.<br /><br />The fight scenes are the best I've seen sense "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Infact this film is better than "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", the fight scenes is  the story beneath the story, not like "The Matrix Trilogy" that has mindless, mindless action and not enough dialogue.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil anything about this film. I will always see why people would say "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is way better than "Hero", I mean that film was a milestone in martial arts, but "Hero" is done in a different way, a better way.  This film is so beautiful its scary. I almost threw up seeing the beauty of this film, I wanted to pause the film so I can contemplate on what I just saw. Of course I'm still wondering which story was real or fake, but that's just a minor flaw. I LOVE THIS FILM.<br /><br />P.S. I forgot to give credit to Zhang Yimou and Zhang Ziyi. Yimou, you are one of the best directors in the business. Ziyi, you are a great actress.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>A friend of mine gave me the original, subtitled version of Hero, and I liked it... sort of.<br /><br />It is a very pretty film and some of the fight scenes are of Jet Li quality (really good) while others are "Crouching Tiger"-style high-wire acts (not so good). Jet Li stars in this big budget film as a soldier/assasin who starts questioning the motives of his king. He is the main reason why I watched this film and I was not disappointed by his stunt work, nor his acting ability.<br /><br />There is alot of talk about honor and Zen philosophy, a whole lot. People who went crazy over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon will probably like this film more than me, it is much better than that dreck but I wish that it more wireless fight scenes in Hero.<br /><br />I recommend that people rent the original version, I'm sure this edited version has a different ending tailored for American audiences (a bad idea).</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I thought it was weird seeing the two men looking like they were flying on top of water. The action is inceredible. Jet Li plays an amazing part. This film was shot in China. Maggie Cheung never had any martial arts experence an she fought terrfic. Her and Jet Li were dodging and blocking all those arrows both of them can't be human. What was odd was seeing the characters die and come back to life then die again. I gave it four stars cause it should of been rated "R" cause in the being Jet Li naked ass was showing and I wanted to see more blood in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Why, oh why do I continue to subject myself to Chinese import movies.  Here's what I mean, I didn't want to see "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", it just didn't appear to be that interesting to me, yet critics applauded the film for its intense action and drama, so like a brainwashed moron I watched the film, and go figure I hated it.  Apparently I didn't learn my lesson though, since I was convinced yet again by critics and by a couple of friends this time, to see the Quentin Tarentino produced, Jet Li epic "Hero".  This movie with subtitles or dubbed, either way has incredibly boring and wooden dialogue, and the action sequences, while awesome lack the realism that I was hoping for to some extent.  I'm ok with over-the-top action, that is unrealistic to an extent, but the action in this movie was just like that in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", impressive but unrealistic.  The difference between the action scenes in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Hero", is that in "Hero" the wirework used to create the action is quite obvious because some of the flying appears to be wobbly and clunky.  Well, that's enough complaints for now, let's get on with the story description for "Hero" and then I'll give a final breakdown to finish things off.<br /><br />"Hero" is a movie that apparently was made in China a few years before it's release here in the states, because when the movie was in theaters the Chinese import-DVD was at several retailers.  The story of "Hero" is set before China became one country, when the different regions of China were divided up into warring provinces.  The ruler of the Qin province has a plan to unite all of the warring provinces together to form one nation.  However, some of the other provinces do not want this to occur for fear of being oppressed under the ruler of Qin or anyone else that may not have their province's best interests in mind.  To thwart the unification from occurring, several highly paid and trained assassins are sent to eliminate the ruler of Qin, and anyone else who gets in their way.  After cutting down one soldier and/or bodyguard after another, the assassins are getting closer and closer to achieving their goal, that is until they encounter a local prefect (Jet Li) of one of the villages of Qin.  This prefect, though only one man, single handedly eliminated all of the assassins and now serves to protect the ruler of Qin at all costs.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I knew I would probably not enjoy this movie too much, but I thought surely my friends would not lead me astray (I didn't have the same faith in the movie critics), sadly my faith was misplaced.  Though the movie had potential, in my mind, it quickly squandered it, leaving us with a story that defies belief (even more than "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), I mean one man taking on entire armies, give me a break.  The acting and dialogue seemed wooden, and truthfully the parts of the story that are purely drama are incredibly boring and really don't propel the movie forward at all, they are only there to fill space between overblown fight scenes.  The special effects and wirework were impressive in some scenes while others weren't as good.  "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" contained better special effects and wirework than this film.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie, unless you absolutely loved "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" or are a fan of Jet Li, then you might enjoy this film.  Otherwise I suggest avoiding this movie and seeing a much better Jet Li movie, "Unleashed".<br /><br />"Hero" is rated PG-13 for violence and minor sensuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>Scenario and showmanship are good and entertaining, if you can overlook that people walk on water, walls, and fly around.

It was purchased by Miramax and sat on the shelf for two years and then became a surprise hit in the U.S. when it was released theatrically.<br /><br />Jet Li is charismatic as the nameless man who confronts the emperor with three weapons from three assassins who had sworn to kill the emperor.  As he tells the story of each man, we see these episodes exquisitely filmed with dazzling action and in a dominant color.<br /><br />Words fail to convey the scope and beauty of this stunning film that, when all is said and done, is a sweeping philosophical metaphor for totalitarianism.  (Isn't there always a political agenda for such grand enterprises approved by the Chinese government.)<br /><br />Limited extras include a short, lively conversation between a distracted, plump Quentin Tarantino and a polite, almost shy Jet Li with film clips showing Li's extraordinary martial arts fighting skills from other films.  (Li was a top martial arts champion for five years starting when he was only 13!)</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero.<br /><br />  Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks.<br /><br />  Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring.<br /><br />  The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like "music is like sword-fighting," and "calligraphy is like sword-fighting" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.<br /><br />  And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around.<br /><br />  There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C-</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 2002 Chinese movie is an epic extravaganza in the best action film tradition.  It is much more than that, however, as it was conceived with a bigger purpose in mind.  It is not just about the swordplay.  It is about just what it takes to be a hero.  There are themes of love, vengeance and redemption as well as personal dramas inside of all the action.  This is the most expensive Chinese film ever made and I understand the Chinese army itself is cast as the extras.  It was filmed in a remote area of China where it was very windy.  And the scenes all reflect this.  For example there is one action scene with two women engaged in swordplay where golden leaves are blowing all around.<br /><br />The plot seems simple at first.  A swordsman is being honored for conquering a king's enemies.  But as the story unfolds, it is much more complicated than that and we see the same story told over again from several different points of view.  Each time our understanding of it deepens.  And although it is not realistic and could never quite happen this way (especially the choreographed action scenes) the theme is universal even though the plot is a little hard to follow.<br /><br />I have nothing but accolades for the people who brought this to America.  I understand that Quentin Tarantino was involved in this project.  He's seen in one of the extras on the DVD in an interview with the star, Jet Li.  There's also an excellent extra about the director, Zhang Yimou, which really enhanced my appreciation of the film I had just viewed and kept me up long after my bedtime just to relish every moment of it.<br /><br />I loved this film and give it a high recommendation.  It might not be for everybody.

The emperor doubts the original story the hero gives and gives his own interpretation of how events unfolded.  The hero then retells the correct story.<br /><br />In other words, the story is told three times.  While this sounds like it Groundhogs Day reincarnated, it is far from that in that each version is completely different from each other and doesn't have you sitting there going, "Oh, no, not again."  The story grabs you and keeps you interested.  In fact, at the end of the movie I found myself wishing for more.<br /><br />As with similar movies in this genre; Hidden Tiger, Couching Dragon and Iron Monkey; the martial arts in this movie is phenomenal... though some of it is rather comical.<br /><br />If you liked movies like the ones just listed you will find yourself loving this movie.  I think this one is even better because you've got the story telling imagination of Quentin Tarantino to help things along.  Highly recommended even if you aren't into martial arts because of the excellent story that is told.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>With indelible impressions of the subtle beauty and depth of "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" and "House of Flying Daggers" still fresh on the mind, this viewer approached "Hero" with caution, anticipation and wonder ... could another WuXia film leave a similar impact? The answer is a joyful and reverberating  "Yes!" The special features section of the DVD is just as important to view as the film itself. It is important to understand how the film was born and came to life on the screen. First, the decision to include some of the best and most famous Asian actors and actresses is highly critical. The fact that it took almost 24 months to complete the screen play, which was written by the Director, Zhang Yimou along with Li Feng and Ang Bin is most amazing and unique. It is a joy to hear Zhang Yimou, the director explain his view point in writing this unique story, which is crucial to understanding the deeper aspects of human nature. The creative process comes alive and it is just as fascinating to hear and understand as viewing the stunning film and scenery of different locations in China ...<br /><br />The story line is subtle and simple: a Chinese swordsman is brought before the King of a province of China to explain how he managed to kill three assassins and arrive before the King within 10 paces of his throne. The king analyzes his story and through keen questioning, in a most legal and lawyer-like fashion, he dissects the truth. There is Confucious-like depth to the manner in which the story unfolds as the King is told the three different versions of the swordsman, Nameless's experiences.<br /><br />Each story has one of these colors associated with it: red, blue, or green. Different aspects of the story are emphasized with other visual artistic wonders, for example, leaves falling during a fight between Nameless and Snow. In the final scene our "Hero" b helps unite China for future generations. The meaning and depth of the story and visual cinematography are priceless and beyond word descriptions. One must view the film for total appreciation where words do indeed fail.

Yinzheng's desire to conquer his six neighboring provinces and unify the country led to years of bloodshed, and in this film, there are 2 men and a woman, who are mentally powerful enough and adept in their fighting skills to go against him. Jet Li is marvelous as the Nameless one, and Maggie Cheung gorgeous as Flying Snow, but it is Tony Leung ("Chungking Express") who shines above all. A man who exudes strength and beauty in many of its forms, he is fantastic as Broken Sword. Also excellent are Chen Dao Ming as the Yinzheng, Zhang Ziyi as Moon, and Donnie Yen as Sky.<br /><br />For director/writer/producer Zhang Yimou, a master of dramas like "Raise the Red Lantern, " this was his first endeavor in the action genre, and he creates scenes that seem as though they are being sculpted, with flowing curtains and walls that tumble with ethereal grace. Christopher Doyle's cinematography of vast panoramas is a feast for the eyes, and added to this scenic banquet is a musical score by Tan Dun that is a delight, with violin solos by Itzhak Perlman. The story is also cleverly told, with various versions of the same plot presented. Satisfying on many levels, "Hero" is a stylish epic that can be seen repeatedly, with more to be gained with each viewing.<br /><br />It is interesting to compare this film with Chen Kaige's exquisite "The Emperor and the Assassin," which tells basically the same story from an historical perspective. DVD extras include "Hero Defined," with interviews with the filmmakers and cast, "Storyboards," and "Inside the Action," a conversation with Jet Li and Quentin Tarantino. Total playing time is 99 minutes.<br />"People give up their lives for many reasons, for friendship, for love, or an ideal...and people kill for the same reasons."</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>This movie takes place around the time of Chinese unification, where many provinces were forced through war to come together.  Loosely based on a story from around that time, a Nameless warrior played by Jet Li slays three enemies of the state and presents their swords to the emperor.  Narrated by the Emperor of Qin (strongest emperor of pre-Modern China) and Nameless, the plot is based around Nameless's three fights.  However, simplicity is thrown out as the Emperor questions to see if that is Nameless's true motive.<br /><br />The story plays in a decently complex fashion as we travel with the words of Nameless or the Emperor to events that either were or might have been depending on Nameless's honesty.  However, at heart there is more to this story than just that, because each of Nameless's adventures (real or unreal) tell tales of sacrifice and love, for people and for nations.<br /><br />The usage of colors was spectacular and made the fight scenes that much more beautiful.  The only lack luster component of the film to me is that now almost all of the fighting seems like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" all over again.  That was novel then, but not so novel now.<br /><br />Overall though, I still really appreciated the story.  I especially found it fascinating how the story wound around Nameless's intentions for seeing the Emperor.<br /><br />(This movie was inspired by a strong sense of nationalism, maybe for what China was like then as compared to now.  That is still a strong component though and whether you liked the movie or not it is still important to acknowledge the underlying them of patriotism for China.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>I bought this movie on DVD, the 98 minute one.

Visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, "Hero" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: "Broken Sword", "Flying Snow" and "Long Sky" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen).<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses jealousy, calligraphy, and his wits to defeat them. But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind Hero's story?<br /><br />"Hero" follows in the footsteps of "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." And while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. But despite all the wire-fu, "Hero" dips into an area that "Crouching Tiger" didn't -- it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic "Rashomon," by giving us different versions of the same story. What is the truth? That is left blurred, and eventually the people who tell the stories are more important than the truth.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou creates a film where style overcomes the realistic, full of color and scenery and beauty. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. The fight scenes are, simply put, balletic. They fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen leaves. But none of this jars the viewer if they remember that in this film, the style and beauty of the action is what makes it effective.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors, as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity.<br /><br />Zhang Yimou's first foray into the martial arts genre is a roaring success. It lacks the freshness of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," but it stands firmly on its own feet with a beautifully intricate story and amazing action scenes. A must-see.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Without a doubt, "Hero" was absolutely the finest movie of it's genre that I've ever experienced.  The filming locations in China were breathtaking providing for intense visual eye candy.  The panoramic cinematography was exquisite.  The beautifully crafted story was woven around masterfully choreographed martial arts and sword fighting sequences.<br /><br />Jet Li playing the character Nameless, is an unquestioned nonpareil of martial arts skills.  He is the hero named in the movie title.  Before the creation of what we now know as China, the land was a conglomeration of 7 warring provinces.  The most powerful of which was called Qin.  The king of Qin possessed a vision of the unification of these provinces.  Of course this dream was not shared by all.<br /><br />Li, born in the rival province of Zhao, was orphaned and adopted into a family in Qin.  Ten years of rigorous training honed him into the finest swordsman in all of the Qin province.  He had vanquished three of the most deadly assassins who had been plaguing the king of Qin, in order to gain his confidence.  His ultimate aspiration was to assassinate the king himself.  The three assassins known as Sky, Broken Sword and Snow, also martial arts experts helped structure Li's resolve to attain his goal.<br /><br />This Quentin Tarantino sponsored martial arts masterpiece, expertly directed by Yimou Zhang, was both a powerful and sensually appealing cinematic experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>For those accustomed to seeing Jet Li in campy (if entertaining) American movies like Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, Hero may come as a bit of a shock at first.  Directed by Zhang Yimou, who's apparently a pretty big deal in China, Hero is an epic morality tale writ large, filled with outsized emotions and political intrigue that just goes to show you not much has changed in the past 2000 years or so.  On its face, it concerns the king of Qin's campaign to unite the seven states of China, but there's a lot more going on beneath the surface.  What starts out as a story of a humble civil servant doing his duty for his king eventually turns into an operatic tale of vengeance, honor, and conflicting values, with plenty of breaks for the kind of rousing martial-arts action that made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so legendary.<br /><br />The quote that opens the film states that in any war there are heroes on both sides, and indeed Hero more than anything else is an examination of the idea of heroism.  The most important idea to be taken from this movie (in this writer's humble opinion, of course), is that of idealism, more specifically how it serves to motivate people.  Nameless is obviously an example of how people's ideals can evolve over time, as his motivations shift from a narrow desire for revenge to a broader concern for the greater good of his people (whether his actions are the best way to achieve the greater good is debatable, but beside the point).  Similarly, we see how Broken Sword and Snow quarrel over the wisdom of assassinating the Emperor, even though both have noble intentions, or at least think they do.  Even the Emperor himself is a paragon of moral ambiguity, as he relentlessly pursues his goal in spite of his awareness of the cost in human lives (incidentally, if you want to see this subject explored from a decidedly different angle, check out the even better film The Emperor and the Assassin).  In the end, whether explicitly or not, each major character has statement to make (actually, Zhang Ziyi's Moon is somewhat extraneous, but I'm willing to let it slide because she's hot).<br /><br />Of course, this being a Jet Li movie and all, much attention is going to be focused on the fight scenes, and none of them fail to disappoint, whether Li is involved in them or not.  It's movies like this one for which the term "poetry in motion" was invented.  And if you think there aren't enough swordfights in film these days, you should check this movie out at the earliest possible moment.  Just about every battle here is tense, precisely choreographed and shot, and at times even emotional. While there's plenty (maybe a bit too much) of the expected high-flying, intricate action, the scenery ends up becoming more of a focus since it's just so damn stunning.  As many have noted, each fight scene showcases a predominant color, be it red, green, or white, but what's more important is the attention to detail that Yimou put into filming them.  Everything has some significance, from swirling leaves to falling drops of water to the string music that plays during the early battle between Nameless and Sky.  This is the rare movie that can consistently engage your senses without overloading them.<br /><br />It's not just the combat scenes that provide some major eye candy, though: visually, this whole movie is a stunner.  The cinematography gives some idea of the vastness of the Chinese landscape, with awe-inspiring shots of steppes, deserts, and forests, and the scenes involving massed Chinese armies are among the most foreboding and impressive I've seen anywhere.  The arrow attack on the calligraphy school, in addition to being rather poignant in its own way, is particularly impressive in its use of perspective, with shots that do for arrows what John Woo's direction has done for bullets.  In a similar vein, although it's a minor detail, the scene where Nameless sticks his sword through the middle of an arrow shaft is just about the coolest thing in martial-arts movie history.<br /><br />Since so much has been said on the subject, I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't throw in my two cents about the political implications of Hero.  Personally, I find the accusations that this movie is an apology for communism or totalitarianism to be exaggerated if not utterly baseless.  Yes, we all know China is a communist country, and communists do all kinds of naughty things, but this movie hardly goes out of its way to endorse any particular ideology.  It's really more about such themes as unity, sacrifice, and patriotism, which countless filmmakers the world over have explored without mentioning communism.  More to the point, with the exception of the postscript that appears on the screen after the action has already ended, the movie doesn't endorse the actions of Nameless or anyone else; it merely demonstrates that different people have different notions of what constitutes "doing the right thing."  While viewers are certainly going to draw their own political messages from this movie, the ideas explored here are far more eternal and universal than any ephemeral debate over systems of governance or the virtues of centralized power.  People need to just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is, not start inferring messages that don't exist.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This film may be disturbing for many people accustomed to the usual patterns of the Western vision about the meaning of the hero .<br /><br />Hero according the Greek meaning has nothing to do with this special hero.<br /><br />The difference is overclear.

Even if you may argue the Heracles ' twelve works ,  the hero never acts under a collective sense .<br /><br />And this is the clue . The Oriental hero will act under a collective criterion :To unify the people and the land . But beware about this point ; the real hero never acts under any ideology because he does not know the rules of the game ; he is a nature force and his actions are out a rational concept . Consider the case of Sigfried in The Ring for instance : He dies precisely when he enters to a conventionalist world with rules and agreements ; those terms are nothing for him.<br /><br />That's is less than understandable for a hero who suddenly resurrected in China .<br /><br />Any other argument is invalid to justify this strange behavior. Every one of the rivals who fight with our hero know they are uncapable to reach the goal because they lack the noblesse and purity of spirit ; as they act under the passion , they know they are not the adequate messengers and obviously they accept involuntarialy he is the only one capable to show the King the hidden desire , the collective voice of that enormous community .<br /><br />The visual splendor illuminates the screen  all along the film .<br /><br />The highlights sequences of the movie are in the field when the yellow leaves are falling and swept by the wind in the female conflict and the other in the Palace under the green curtains falling .<br /><br />Yimou Zang is actually the most remarkable chinese film maker .<br /><br />Watch this amazing fable and convince by yourself the role of the hero has never been reach the throne ; hero's role goes beyond that goal . He is born to intend to change the world no matter how expensive be the prize . And the death is a fellow partner due it will be very hard for any one of us to find a hero writing his memories . His life is brief , his origins are always unknown and his fate  will never be the same of the common man .<br /><br />That is his bliss!</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Well, this is one of those movies where everyone who gives it a positive review is bound to say exactly the same thing, but I'll go ahead and review it anyway. Simply put, this is the most visually striking film I've ever seen with some astounding action scenes, while still having an interesting plot and strong emotional impact. That is about as strong of an endorsement as I can imagine.<br /><br />Despite it's various points of interest, the visual splendor of the film is certainly the most impressive aspect.  As I said before, this is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Frankly, little I can think of comes at all close.  Visually, it works on all levels. It has stunning, varied landscapes ranging from snowy mountains to forests in autumn to desolate, rocky steppes and great deserts filled with sand dunes.  Personally, I seem have less appreciation for natural landscapes than most, yet every outdoor landscape in this film is awe-inspiringly beautiful.  The costumes are outstanding as well, with deep, pure colors.  Beyond this, the film uses color beautifully in general, with most scenes having a dominant color in character and landscape, which changes from Red to Blue to Green to White and so on.  This use of color also fills the film with an appropriate sense of surreality, befitting the supernatural and occasionally parable-esque nature of the film.  The film also contains the strange beauties of military formations. There are awe-inspiring shots of the endless ranks with their fluid symmetries, scenes of cavalry riding through the windswept desert and the frightful volleys of arrows. Despite not being a war movie this has the finest visualization of ground forces that I've ever seen, surpassing even the extraordinary The Thin Red Line. (In terms of aesthetic beauty, not realism, of course)  Naturally, this is all beautifully shot, with tons of extreme longshots, which wonderfully showcase the beauty of both the human and inhuman portions of the scene.  On top of this, the action scenes are fantastic.  Personally, I consider the fight between Nameless and Sky at the beginning of the film to be one of the finest 1 on 1 fights I've ever seen.  The fight between Moon and Flying Snow in the leaf strewn forest is also particularly extraordinary, albeit more for the scenery than for the fight choreography.  The only minor misstep is the fight at the lake in the mountains, which is fine except that it repeats itself a bit too much.  There are many who are opposed to wire-work and the use of CG and whatnot, and those sorts will likely have issues with the fights found here.  Indeed, the action scenes here are usually as much art film as they are action film, and most of them are so wildly stylized that purists won't care for them. So consider yourself warned, not that you needed to be had you seen any ads for the film.  I suppose I could go on and on about how this film looks, but I could never hope to give you a true sense of how fantastic this film looks. Just see it yourself.<br /><br />Unlike many films with such an emphasis on visuals and action-scenes, this film has interesting characters and a well developed plot.  I could go into specifics, but suffice to say that it managed to retain hold my interest from beginning to end, the ending of the film is genuinely sad, and every significant character in the film is sympathetic in their own way, even though they may be at odds with one another.  This is as much as you could ask for from a purely dramatic film, much less a martial arts film.  Some people have found this film a bit confusing, as it is primarily told via flashbacks,  which may or may not have actually occurred.  Personally, I wasn't confused, and at worst you will likely be lost only briefly if ever.  And the plot isn't the main interest in the film anyway.<br /><br />Some have complained of the pro-communist elements of this film, but I can honestly say as one who strongly opposes communism both as it exists hypothetically and practically that this doesn't bother me at all.  Most significantly, it is mainly implicitly pro-communist, in that it is patriotic and pro-China as an idea rather than specifically supporting the communist government.  Beyond, little that is in the film specifically applies to communism in a way that wouldn't apply to most other societies.  At it's heart, it simply promotes  peace and self-sacrifice for the common good, both of which are valued in pretty much all societies, and are qualities which I can readily support.<br /><br />Well, that's it. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen, so you ought to go see it.</p></br></body></html>

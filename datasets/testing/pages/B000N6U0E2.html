His performance is layered, structured and intelligent, but amidst all of that he still comes across natural and refreshing, never forced or mechanical.  Every emotion runs through his blood effortlessly and full of believable conviction.  I've always been a fan of Smith, but here he returns to the brilliance he possessed in `Ali', coupling his on screen fire with heart and soul that transcends the meaningless boundary's of comic relief but that which leaves a deep rooted sense of character and warmth.  Smith disappears inside Christopher Gardener but he never loses himself, his charm and his commanding presence.<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' tells the true life story of Christopher Gardener, a family man who gets wrapped up in the wrong pyramid scheme and ends up broke and homeless.  His wife Linda, played by Thandie Newton, walks out on him he's left desolate and alone.  The love for his son Christopher, played brilliantly by Smith's own son Jaden, is what keeps Gardener holding on in pursuit of a better life.<br /><br />One thing that Christopher has going for him is potential.  He's a smart man with ambition and determination and so when he sees an opportunity to rise above himself through an internship with a law-firm he takes it despite the fact of no pay and he uses it to better himself and his surroundings.  Smith's wide range of emotions are what keeps this story compelling and entertaining, from his sadness and grief stricken situation to his cheerful demeanor he masquerades in for his sons sake to that emotional clap of relief as he realizes his dreams amidst a crowded sidewalk, Smith breaks down his own barriers and builds for himself a place alongside the acting giants of today.<br /><br />With pros there must also exist cons, and those cons appear in a few different forms.  The first form is that of co-star Thandie Newton who develops a bad habit of repelling the viewer.  Her character, while unsympathetic in general, is overly unsympathetic not to mention a tad-bit annoying, and that's putting it nicely.  Where's that girl I saw in `Crash' who stole the entire show from her co-stars, who electrified the screen and screamed "nominate me"?  She's lost albeit in a mess of a character who could have been so much more but turned out so much worse than anticipated.  The flow of the film is a bit choppy as well.  Some parts flow by effortlessly while others drag on and even get a bit redundant.  The director at times tries too hard to emphasize Gardeners destitute condition when that said condition is already made apparent enough for the average viewer.<br /><br />That said, there is still a lot of good to remember when recalling this film, and Will Smith's brilliant performance is reason enough to watch it at least once.  I also must mention Smith's young son Jaden who perfectly compliments his father's passion by effortlessly mastering his performance which is sympathetic, controlled and elegant, never over the top or exaggerated like it could have been.  He comes across as poised as his father and as at home in his performance as an actor who's been doing this all his life.  One day this young actor will reach the feats his father has, and with a beginning as strong as this one he may end up there sooner than later.  This story is one to be heard, and told as beautifully as it is here makes it easy on the ears.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>The real life story of Chris Gardner is an inspiration, those were very difficult times for most of America and we prevailed, Chris prevailed even more so than the rest of us.  Will Smith has become an excellent actor worth following and his son did a fine job on his first time out.<br /><br />I agree that this movie comes to an abrute conclusion and would have liked to seen more of his success and the success of his son, but I have a feeling that would lead to disappointment.<br /><br />My family enjoyed watching and I will probably watch it a couple more times, but don't see it as my go to movie for getting me out of a rute or inspiring me to do great things, just the things that I have to do.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the true life story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith), a bone density scanner salesman seeking to make a career change in 1981 to become a stockbroker. He pursues his dream in spite of his wife leaving him, and insists on custody of his son, Christopher. He finally lands an unpaid, six-month internship, where only one of twenty candidates will be offered a paying job. Every obstacle imaginable is in his path, but father and son will just have to prevail.<br /><br />I looked forward to seeing this movie with some trepidation. The title for one thing, had me on guard against the protaganist being some kind of misspelling apologist, and I am adamantly opposed to people of that kidney. Early on, however, I was disabused of that notion, and found instead that the central character was in fact, a correct spelling stickler. What a relief.<br /><br />He is also a fan of the poetic writing of Thomas Jefferson in The Declaration of Independence, and in voice-over ruminates on how Jefferson , in his wisdom, realized that perfect happiness might not ever be possible, but was something that nevertheless, all had a right to pursue.<br /><br />The other contributing factor to the aforementioned trepidation was that this retelling of the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches fable would be tedious drudgery. Too much hard work. This was not your usual Hollywood mindless entertainment, instant gratification for Live-For-The-Momentsters, but it was well worth the time and effort invested. Hard work, yes, but productive work that paid many dividends.<br /><br />In a promotional appearance on a talk show (probably Letterman, since I eschew Leno) with his real life son Jaden Smith in tow (who also plays his character's son in the film), Will Smith bragged about what a great actor his son was. He had even given him advice pertaining to his own acting that had greatly enhanced his performance. I was very skeptical of this claim, because of course he would be biased in his son's favor. But, after seeing the film, I would have to agree with him. His son did a great job walking that tight rope between being cute, but not so damn cute that it becomes annoying.<br /><br />A prime example of that is the kid who plays Bobby Jr. on the sitcom, All of Us: Khamani Griffin. In case you haven't seen it, the show was conceived and created by Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and is based on their own modern approach to raising kids with divorced parents, in evolving, caring relationships. Bobby Jr. is so repulsively cute that he would make anyone want to puke after watching him for five seconds. Surprisingly, that never happens in this movie, possibly because of the harrowing situations father and son goes through together.<br /><br />Will Smith did some great acting here as well. One scene in a Metro/BART terminal restroom was very moving. Homeless, he and his son are forced to sleep there, and he tries to make it an adventure. He is lugging one of his unsold bone density scanners, which he has rescued from a crazy street person who believed it was a time machine. He tells his son it really is a time machine, and when they press the button, pretends they are back in the time of dinosaurs, and the restroom is a cave. He cries actual tears here, and is totally believable. Another scene with a Rubik's Cube shows another side of his thespian skills, as well as evoking 1981. Another scene where he must interview for the stockbroker internship in paint splattered jeans was well done. Don't ask why. Parking tickets. If you have ever lived in San Francisco, you would know what that was like.<br /><br />In fact, San Francisco in 1981 was pretty much how it looked in this movie. Sometimes movies or TV Shows are set in San Francisco, but they get everything wrong. Like you know it was shot in LA, with just a few establishing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge thrown in, but totally in the wrong place. Suddenly Susan, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina. The crazy street person (John Robb) who thought his bone density scanner was a time machine was a bit jarring, like the tone suddenly shifted, and we were in a different, less realistic movie, or one of those stupid sitcoms, but since this was based on the real-life experience, I have no doubt that it probably happened exactly as depicted. All of the rest of the people were very believable, especially the stockbrokers. A friend of mine, who actually was a stockbroker intern during that same time and place concurred that it was pretty accurate.<br /><br />Finally, I was pretty excited when I saw the opening credits and found that Thandie Newton was in it, but she didn't have much to do as his wife but nag and eventually leave him. Oh, well. That is a pursuit for another movie, I suppose.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong this is a good film, but...for me (in this medium) it was trying too hard and dragged the rags to riches plot out for way too long.  I realize this is based off a true story.  However, I wished the screenwriter would have given the script a few more peaks or breaks from the unrelenting obstacles Chris Gardner faces; especially if the payoff was going to be so short.  After going through this fire with Mr. Gardner, we're only rewarded with three minutes of elation and a placard telling us he went on to be a multi-millionaire.  I feel emotionally short-changed.  I mean we don't even see how much the job went on to pay him.  However, Chris Gardner's story will make the people who are settling for mediocre re-evaluate.  Movie's best line:  'If you want something, go after it.  Period.'<br /><br />Overall: Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>I really think this movie is the best that Will Smith has done, and I liked that his real life Son played his Son in the movie.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story of a man who was dealt more than his share of bad luck, grief,burdens and poverty.<br /><br />Nothing just seems to go his way at all. His wife gets tired of the daily struggle to make ends meet, and she leaves him alone to raise his Son on a meager salary, and times just keep getting tougher for him.<br /><br />They continue to move down in the world instead of up, and finally, they are homeless, and have to stand in a line every night to get a bed in a homeless shelter. It is so very sad, and you really feel for these characters!<br /><br />Things begin to change however, when he sees what stockbroker's make, and gets into a competetive internship, where out of 20 people, only one will make it. While he is studying for this, He not only has the pressure of work, but has raising his Son to deal with.<br /><br />Of course all his ambition pays off, and it is a joy to see things turn around for him-FINALLY!!!<br /><br />This is really a movie to cheer about.I am sure if you see this that you will love it! It is Will Smith at his very best, and in the most tender role I have ever seen him in!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>"You have to have money to make money."  That's what they say, and, unless you're as determined as Chris Gardner (Will Smith), you don't have a chance.  Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, "They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?"  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as "expensive...and only slightly better at creating images" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, "My children were gonna know who their father is."  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it."  Inspiring for all of us, this film may sound off themes from `Death of a Salesman,' but the results and details are often desperate, but offer us all hope.  (Blog, if you believe feel-good movies are not all acts of plagiarism.)  Based on a true story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I'm not a big Will Smith fan, but he is very good here and deserves his Golden Globe nomination. His real life son, who plays his son in the film, is much better than I thought he would be. I thought the whole movie would be feel good and sappy, but most of it is a real downer. At least it ends on a good note. I'm glad I saw it, but if I wasn't so bored today, I could have waited for it to hit DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>It's within every subtlety, the redness of his eyes, the quivering of his chin and the weariness with which he watches his son that Will Smith delivers one of the year's finest performances.  I've always been a fan of Will Smith, and this film really shows he's more than just a funny guy, he really can express real emotion, and it's the subtlety with which he expresses it that really shows his acting chops.  In a role that could have easily been `over-acted', Will Smith gives us raw human feeling and emotion that we can all relate to and understand.<br /><br />As Chris Gardener, a man who made a few bad decisions and is now paying the price, Will Smith shows us many layers of this man.  He's angry with his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) for her lack of faith in him...he's disappointed in himself for not having been more than he is...and most of all he's scared of disappointing his son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  After venturing into the business of selling a bone density x-ray machine, a machine that is all but impossible to sell, Chris ends up broke and unable to keep his family together.  His wife Linda leaves him and soon he's thrown out of his apartment and left on the street.<br /><br />In an attempt to make a better life for his son Chris enrolls in an internship with a local Stock Brokerage Firm and really pushes himself to be the best he can in order to get the job and provide for his family.  Yes, there are times when this film feels very slow, long and even generic.  They repeat a lot of scenes in order to really show the horrible state he and his son were in, the obstacles he had to overcome all in hopes to make his triumph in the end all the more heartwarming, but it's really Will Smith's performance that makes the film what it is...that and his chemistry with real life son Jaden who definitely takes after his father and serves up one of the most endearing and real characters brought to the cinema this year.<br /><br />Yes, `The Pursuit of Happyness' may be the `Cinderella Man' of 2006 (personally `Cinderella Man' was the better film), but with powerful performances but the two Smiths it's brought to a different level and made worthy of the viewers time, attention and money...and Will Smith I'm sure with rightfully receive his second Oscar nomination!</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Pursuit Of Happyness" is excellent! Will Smith (who also served as a producer on the film) (as Chris Gardner) gives the best performance (and recently, Golden Globe-nominated) of his career yet and the scenes with him and his son, played ironically, by his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, are beautifully well-done. The directing by Gabriele Muccino is excellent. The story and screenplay by Steve Conrad (who also wrote "The Weather Man" (2005), which is also based on Gardner's real-life autobiography, is excellent. The music by Andrea Guerra (who was Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Song for "Hotel Rwanda" (2004) is excellent. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who is also doing the cinematography to the upcoming "3:10 To Yuma" (2007) is excellent. The film editing by Hughes Winborne (who won the Oscar for his work on "Crash" (2005) is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian (who, recently did the casting to "Deja Vu" (2006) is excellent. The production design by J. Michael Riva (who is also doing the production design to the upcoming "Spider-Man 3" (2007) & "Iron Man" (2008) is excellent. The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who is also doing the set decoration to the upcoming "Iron Man" (2008) is excellent. The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to "Dreamgirls" (2006) is excellent. Will Smith has never been better in his performance as Chris Gardner, a sure-fire Oscar nomination for his performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Will Smith continues to amaze me.  Up until his performance in "I, Robot," I couldn't see him for anything more than a goofy rapper-turned-actor who played characters based solely on the degree of their sarcasm and humor.  In "I, Robot," I began to see beyond the old Smith and came to see him as an adult who could pull off excellent roles.  With "The Pursuit of Happyness," Smith shows that he's matured even more.  Not once did I picture him as Carlton's cousin or the cocky flyboy from "Independence Day."  He has come full circle as an actor and deserves to be recognized for it.<br /><br />"Happyness" is based on the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who lost everything trying to do what's best for his family and eventually becoming a top stockbroker and businessman.  The viewer basically lives out the struggles of a man with not much more than street smarts and a high school diploma to get him, his girlfriend, and son through life.  Fed up with the life Gardner provides, his wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him and (reluctantly) their son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) for the greener pastures of New York.  Determined to make it in San Francisco, Gardner takes a non-paying internship with Dean Witter and has to rely on his dwindling and hard-to-sell stock of bone density scanners to put food on the table.  Needless to say, Gardner and his son face immense hardships, eventually being forced to live on the street, staying in a public bathroom and shelters in order to survive.<br /><br />The story's outcome is wonderful and heartwarming.  I'm not ashamed to say that this film made me cry.  It is a perfect realization of every father's greatest fear:  not being able to provide for his family.<br /><br />Kudos to Gardner for overcoming immense odds.  Kudos to Smith, his son, and the rest of the cast and crew who made "The Pursuit of Happyness" a stellar film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Aside from the well-deserved accolades for Mr. Smith, Sr, there are many things to like about this film. It was slow-moving, and after about an hour, it was established that this guy was having a tough time. One thing we noticed was the sensitivity and unconditional love for his son, and his very common sense approach to life at large without crippling the son's mind for life. The screenwriters are to be commended for adapting Chris  Gardner's auto-biography in a direct, matter-of-fact way. I thought the pairing of Mr. Smith and his son, Jaden, was fine (unlike others' opinions). I also thought that Thandie Newton played the wife with the utmost despair, a frustration that she simply couldn't deal with. I would like to know what ultimately happened to her, as well as the young son, now in his late 20's. The DVD had some good extras, especially about Mr. Gardner and his in-put during filming. My favorite element of the film is that it involved very little racism. Mr. Gardner never complained that his bad luck was due to "being Black", and instead used his wit, wisdom and intelligence to make a seemingly hopeless stuation work to his ultimate advantage. He's a fine role model for ALL people who think they're at the rope's end. It CAN be done, as Mr. Gardner proved, and there are valuable lessons here, for those who take the time to let them soak in. Indeed, the slow pace is deliberate, thanks to director Gabrielle Meccino. I think it was the bottom-line idea... watch, listen, learn, grow...</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Chris Gardner is barely making ends meet by selling bone density scanners when the bottom drops out and his son's mother leaves him.  He decides that he will take a gamble and go without a salary for 6 months in order to be an intern at Dean Whitter and compete for one job with 19 other interns.  Things go from bad to worse, but through it all Gardner is a faithful father to his son and he does the best he can to raise him and train to be a stock broker at the same time.  Real-life father and son Will and Jaden Smith are well-cast as the inspirational Chris and Christopher Gardner.  There is an extra feature in which Chris Gardner is interviewed and he is shown going through an emotional time of reliving the difficulties of his life during the early 80's, when this movie takes place.  It is an inspiration to see what can be accomplished when a man stays true to his family values and refuses to give up his dream.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....<br /><br />Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.<br /><br />Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.<br /><br />The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.<br /><br />Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happyness.<br /><br />(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, "The Pursuit of Happyness" is a heartwarming film about Chris (Will Smith), a down on his luck father who is struggling to get ahead in life and provide for his young son (played by Will's real-life son, Jaden Smith). Chris attempts to dig himself out of an unsuccessful career as a salesman and get a job as a stockbroker instead. Seeing as how he has no stockbroking skills, Chris needs to start from the bottom up, and he manages to acquire a prestigious internship with a brokerage firm. Unfortunately the internship is unpaid, and Chris finds himself struggling to secure money for food and shelter. He and his son end up in a homeless shelter, and Chris hopes that his six-month internship will pay off with a job offer in the end.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. It illustrates how even the most hardworking people can end up on the streets through absolutely no fault of their own. Both of the Smith boys did a great job in the movie, and they had me cheering with them and crying for them the whole way through. What an inspiring movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The Pursuit of Happyness stars Will Smith, who plays Chris Gardner, in an emotional drama based on a true story. Set in 1981, Chris is a struggling medical equipment salesman. Chris is a smart guy, but made the mistake of selling medical equipment in which he had to buy all the product up front and then finds out no one wants the stuff.  So, Chris has a wife that basically hates him and a job that isn't paying and bills that are due. With his life going down the tubes, Chris sees the lifestyles that the successful stockbrokers have and wants it. He applies for an internship and gets it, but finds out the job doesn't pay a salary. Then his wife leaves him and his young son, played by Smith's actual son.<br /><br />Chris juggles daycare and bills and selling the medical equipment while trying to learn the ins and outs of selling stocks. Eventually, the bills catch up with him and Chris and his son are homeless, forced to fight for places in line at homeless shelters.<br /><br />This movie was a successful Christmas blockbuster and the preview packs an emotional punch. I expected a feel-good tear jerker, but what I got was a drama without the highs and lows expected from the genre.  The problem I saw is the lack of conflict. Sure, Chris is homeless and poor, but we know he eventually succeeds.  Also, every executive Chris encounters treats him nicely or with respect, so we never see Chris as the object of ridicule that he could have been considering his at time rough appearance.  This is a well made movie and entertaining, but it moves along at a predictable pace<br /><br />By no means do I think this is a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Smith is excellent, his kid (Jaden Smith) isn't as good of an actor as some have said. Especially enjoyable is Chris's interaction with some of the Dean Witter clients and his ploy to get free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers game. This movie has a few moments of bad language but other than that is a good family film.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>Moviegoers don't have to wait for Atlas Shrugged to view a riveting drama about the heroics of a business entrepreneur. Actor Will Smith shines in his portrayal of a real-life, self-made investment broker in this emotionally exhausting but ultimately inspiring biopic.<br /><br />It's the 1981 recession, and Chris Gardner struggles to make ends meet as a self-employed medical-equipment salesman who has a family to support in San Francisco. With a stack of bone-density scanners gathering dust in his efficiency apartment kitchen, and with wife Linda (Thandie Newton) pulling double shifts at a neighborhood laundry, he can barely pay the bills. Chris spends his days shuttling his five-year-old son, Christopher, to day care (the film's title refers to Chris's constantly nagging the owner of the day-care center to correct the word's spelling on a mural there) and trying to hawk his expensive equipment to doctors and hospitals with shrinking budgets.<br /><br />Looking for a way out of his dead-end job, Chris spots a well-heeled businessman (Geoff Callan) parking a red Ferrari and quizzes him. "Man, I've got two questions for you: What do you do, and how do you do it?" The man informs him he's a stock broker with the prestigious Dean Witter Reynolds firm and that he's "good with numbers and people."<br /><br />Suddenly, Chris sees his life as it could be. Watching the men and women exiting the brokerage house, he reflects, "They all looked so damned happy to me," and wonders, "Why couldn't I look like that?" After impressing one of the senior brokers (Brian Howe) by solving a Rubik's Cube puzzle during a taxicab ride, Chris applies for a Dean Witter internship program and lands an interview.<br /><br />However, all that Linda can see in Chris's decision to become a broker is a pipe dream. "Salesman to intern is backwards," she protests. Unable to handle the stress of the landlord breathing down their necks for back rent, she leaves, forcing Chris to raise their son alone. As if that weren't enough, on the night before his big interview with Dean Witter, the police show up at his doorstep to arrest him for a pile of unpaid parking tickets.<br /><br />After spending the night in the police lockup, Chris--disheveled, wearing jeans and a tank-top undershirt--barely makes it to his interview on time. "I could not think of a lie bizarre enough," he explains awkwardly to his skeptical interviewers. "I just got out of jail for unpaid parking tickets and my wife left me." One asks him: "What if a man walked in here with no shirt, and I gave him a job?" Chris replies good-naturedly: "He must've had on some really nice pants."<br /><br />Chris lands a spot in the internship program, not by bluffing his way out of the awkward situation, but through his forthright honesty and sense of humor.  However, there's a catch--the internship is unpaid and will last six months. Even after the program ends, there are no guarantees: only one intern out of twenty will be hired by the firm.<br /><br />Already having moved with his son into a hotel room to save money, Chris is faced with the dilemma of either trying to provide fully for his son right away or taking the chance that after a half-year he'll land a salaried position as an investment broker. Figuring that he can make rent and keep Christopher in day care if he can sell just one bone-density scanner a month after work and on weekends, he decides to go for it. (In this regard, the movie takes a little dramatic license: In Chris Gardner's real life, the internship paid a small stipend each month, and he quit his job selling the scanners when he took the internship; he was not self-employed.)<br /><br />But his troubles are just starting. When the IRS seizes his checking account for back taxes, Chris and his boy are evicted from their hotel room. With only the clothes on their backs, they are turned out on the streets. But whether sleeping on subways, buses, or in luncheonette booths, Chris never leaves Christopher's side or reveals a hint of discouragement.<br /><br />As much as The Pursuit of Happyness is the story of Chris Gardner's struggle to succeed in the business world, it's also the story of a father's love for and commitment to his child. At their lowest point--forced to spend the night sleeping on the floor of a men's room in a train station--he never lets on to his boy that their state is desperate, even as he's about to go to pieces. Much like the Roberto Benigni character in 1997's Life Is Beautiful, Chris conceals the indignity of their situation from his youngster by playing a make-believe game of hiding from cavemen and dinosaurs. The scenes between father and son are among the movie's most natural, convincing, and genuinely moving, no doubt because of the bond between Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden, who plays Christopher.<br /><br />At one point, while shooting hoops at a neighborhood playground, Chris realizes the power that an adult's words can have on a child. He makes a self-effacing quip, telling Christopher not to bother spending too much time working on his game because he himself was never any good at basketball, either. The boy puts down the ball and slumps in resignation. Angry at himself for his own thoughtlessness, Chris counsels his son:<br /><br />Don't ever let someone tell you you can't do something! Not even me!. . . .You got a dream, you gotta protect it! People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period!<br /><br />What makes this movie ring so true is that Chris Gardner heeds his own advice, even though he seems trapped in an inescapable maze. Constantly down but never out, he refuses to slink away and abandon his dream. His quest becomes a frantic chase: rushing to catch buses, arriving late at sales calls, picking up his son from daycare, tracking down a bone scanner that some hippies stole from him, securing a place to sleep in a homeless shelter. But homelessness is never depicted--or regarded--as more than a transient condition. And Chris Gardner is always in transit: everywhere he goes, he's running. Indeed, I believe Smith spends more screen time running than Dustin Hoffman did in the 1976 thriller Marathon Man.<br /><br />Unlike the anti-business messages conveyed by so many of today's movies, this film depicts the business world as gruelingly tough, but ultimately fair--even liberating. Most refreshing are the scenes showing Chris in the Dean Witter internship program. I cheered to myself as he applied his quick head for numbers, shaving seconds off "cold calls" by not hanging up between phone conversations and by going straight to the top of a company's contact directory rather than starting at the bottom, as is customary.<br /><br />In many respects, The Pursuit of Happyness reminded me of business-themed comedies from the 1980s, such as Trading Places and Working Girl, but without the bitter "getting even with the boss" side plots. If anything, the movie extols the productive nature of the stock market while regarding government as the parasite. While talking with a prospect who wants a retirement fund that yields high returns but low taxes, Gardner quips, "So, basically, you don't want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own."<br /><br />Italian director Gabriele Muccino--best known for his 2001 romantic comedy The Last Kiss--adapts his lighthearted style effortlessly to this somewhat weighty story, his first American film. Meanwhile, director of photography Phedon Papamichael exploits the steep streets of San Francisco and Oakland as a metaphor to capture the ups and downs of Chris's world. In the Dean Witter offices, Papamichael's camera moves left-to-right, visually conveying the business world's virtues of drive, economy, and progression. For his part, Will Smith digs deep into his dramatically demanding role, giving his most forceful performance to date. Is this really the same easy-going guy who starred in "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and Men in Black?<br /><br />As for the real-life Chris Gardner, today he is a multi-millionaire who runs an investment firm in Chicago. Speaking about this stirring, feel-good movie (which, ironically, is at times also one of the bleakest movies I've ever seen), Gardner hailed the ability of Smith and director Muccino to capture life "when the whole world tells you how small you are, but you see how big you really can be."<br /><br />And big he is. The Pursuit of Happyness is one of the most positive and heroic portraits of a businessman that I've ever seen. The choices that Chris Gardner makes under the most trying of circumstances reveal his indomitable, optimistic resolve and character. Smith, who produced as well as starred, first seized upon the idea of making this movie after seeing an ABC "20/20" profile of Gardner. "Chris represents the American Dream," he remarked. "The promise of America is such a great idea. Nowhere else in the world could a Chris Gardner exist."<br /><br />And, I might add, nowhere else in the world could a movie honoring a Chris Gardner exist.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>I must say with the deepest warmth about this movie.  I thought it was going to be corny.  A real father and his son portraying in a movie about a father and son movie.  Above all, Will Smith.  Now, I remember him when Parents just didn't Understand.  But he won me over easily.  I felt his struggle.  Just when I think he would come out of it, something else happens.  It was like Keep kicking him when he's already down.  I thought Will Smith did a great and inspiring job.  His son was good, but Will Smith did an amazing job.  Hats off!! Great motivation piece of film with a message of never give up, by all means.</p></br><a href="../users/AB9QXH5URDLER.html">AB9QXH5URDLER</a><br/><p>PROSITIVES:  This heartwarming film, based on true life, once again exalts the American Dream that anything is possible with a little luck and a lot of hard work.  All African Americans should watch this film.  Here is the depiction of an African American hero who refuses to give up, even when the odds are hopelessly against him.  All those who are facing major life setbacks should also watch this film.  This film offers more than entertainment.  This film offers encouragement to carry on.  All those who struggle with family relationships should see this film.  This film shows a love between a father and son that weathers the storms of life.  This film encourages family members to hold on a little longer.  Anyone not yet mentioned should see this film.  This film is one of those rare works of art that has the potential to improve society.  Will Smith does an excellent job in his role as Chris Gardner.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:  I only gave this film four stars because it begins to get a little slow about 2/3 of the way through and the conclusion is predictable.  The film's media publicity probably brought a few more people to the film, but gave away too much of the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Chris Gardner (Will Smith) lives in a cheap rental apartment with his partner, Linda (Thandie Newton), who is the mother of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Gardner works as a salesman and is trying his hardest to support his family, but nobody wants to buy his bone density scanners. Bills are piling up, the rent is two months behind, and his landlord is running out of patience.<br /><br />Gardner's world changes when he has a chance encounter on the street with a stockbroker. The man owns a flashy car and Gardner notes that everyone walking out of the office building seems happy. He decides to apply to Dean Witter in an attempt to solve all of his problems.<br /><br />Getting the attention of his potential employer is not easy, but the film, which is set it 1981, uses a Rubik's Cube to demonstrate Gardner's intelligence. Gardner manages to share a cab with a Dean Witter employee who is in a position to recommend him for an interview, and he solves the puzzle of the Rubik's Cube during the journey. That leads to an interview, but Gardner is arrested for non-payment of parking tickets the night before. He turns up for the interview covered in paint and without a shirt. It's a great scene with a lot of humor and Gardner somehow passes the interview.<br /><br />The film is based on a true story and shows a typical struggle of a man trying to make his way in the world. You might compare it to It's a Wonderful Life in many ways. Linda eventually decides to leave Gardner, but he insists that Christopher will stay with him. It's here that the film stands out. The relationship between father and son is the very heart of the film. Gardner tries to support Christopher, but money is always a problem. The pair are forced to endure some rough times, but Christopher trusts his father and rarely complains.<br /><br />I think Pursuit of Happyness was a breakthrough role for Smith. We already knew that he could pull off action roles and comedy, but he had to show considerable range to play Chris Gardner. The performance earned him an Oscar nomination and it was truly deserved.<br /><br />It's interesting watching Gardner claw his way up while he serves his internship. His dual role as a father limits the time he can spend working and studying, but he makes the best use of what time he has available. Jaden Smith was effective as Christopher, though I wonder how much acting was necessary when your on-screen father is your real father.<br /><br />Director Gabriele Muccino did a good job of focusing on Smith's emotional side and I found myself fully-invested with Gardner's struggle the whole time.<br /><br />The film makes me wonder how many people are quietly struggling through similar problems every day. In the current economic climate, things are even tougher than they were in 1981. What would you do to ensure that your family is able to survive? Taking two or three jobs is an option, but that places a strain on you and on all of your relationships.<br /><br />How do you define happiness? Is it enough just to be able to survive? I've explored this theme in a number of reviews and it's highly relevant here. I don't think Gardner was simply pursuing money and career success; he was taking care of his child. Maybe it's important to feel like you are making the most of your abilities? Pride in your performance is one measure of success, and so is spending time with the people you love. I think The Pursuit of Happyness explores a number of important themes. The definition of happiness is subjective. Do you know what your own definition would be?</p></br><a href="../users/A29E6IO3DZG6IY.html">A29E6IO3DZG6IY</a><br/><p>This movie has amazing depth and resonated with me on many levels. Will Smith's performance is excellent. The film is well done, drew me in and held my interest to the end.<br />Chris' struggle is as real as it gets. His perseverance and fortitude in spite of grueling life trials, is inspiring. It's also a testament to the power of a child's love and trust and the importance of keeping family together.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this film, and for family viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>This is another fine performance from Will Smith, who plays Chris snr. I tend to feel that after his performance in Ali, he only seems to be getting better. This has some really touching on-screen moments with his son (which are all the more poignant knowing it's Smiths real son) and shows how far a man will go to provide and care for his family. You feel his frustrations as he faces each new setback with strength and determination and you feel yourself rooting for him the whole film. The relationship between Chris snr and his wife are hard to watch as you see their marriage breakdown and unless you've been in that kind of situation I guess you'll never know how hard it can be. This film also has some lighter moments that will raise a smile and I have to say it is a film i enjoyed way more than I expected to and would recommend to anyone out there.

In 1981, Gardner (Will Smith) watched his business, selling bone density scanners, decline along with his marriage. He accepts an unpaid internship with Dean Witter as a chance to improve his life and his young son's, for whom he has custody. Together Gardner and his young son endure many hardships, including homelessness, as Gardner pursues his dream.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>In The Pursuit of Happyness, Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) goes from being an out-of-luck medical appliance salesman to an intern at a major brokerage firm.  This happens while he is a single father, loses his home, and literally lives out of his suitcase.<br /><br />It is a movie that focuses on determination and perseverance, and love.<br /><br />I understand this is a fictionalized account of the real Chris Gardner, currently a multimillionaire philanthropist and motivational speaker.  His path to fame and fortune was rough, and that is what was portrayed by Smith in this movie.  As Gardner (Smith) faces challenge after challenge, his son, Christopher (played by Will Smith's own son), is right there with him, going from apartment to hotel to homeless shelter.  The personal agonies hit you in the gut, so that the viewer is left with an unsatisfying... guilt?  Fear?  Many viewers cannot understand the impact of seeing a five dollar bill leave your pocket, knowing that the bill represents food for the day, now gone.<br /><br />And when Gardner receives the competitive six month internship (yay), hears that only one of the twenty interns will be hired (brrrr), and finds out that interns are not paid a penny during that period (ouch), you will feel his angst.<br /><br />Watching Gardner's frustrations and trials was almost voyeuristic.  I wish there was more of a catharsis ("a release of emotional tension, as after an overwhelming experience, that restores or refreshes the spirit") at the end to give my stomach a chance to recover.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie is full of heart.

It's the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who has struggled with both his finances and his support for his son. His only chance of success is becoming a stockbroker, and he tries his hardest during his internship while taking care of the only person he cares about. And he does this when he is evicted from his own home, and starts living in a motel, a subway train, even in a public bathroom. But Chris never gives up on not only his dreams of success, but his dream of his own son fulfilling his own dreams of success.<br /><br />Surely, this is a very inspirational film about perseverance, success, and family. And now this film is way more significant today. We're in the middle of a chaotic economic crisis, and it looks to be getting worse. Thousands of people are losing jobs and businesses, hundreds of homes are in foreclosure, food and gas prices have gone up, and big corporations are going bankrupt and being shut down. Of all the misery that the entire world is facing, there is still hope. We just can't give up on our own dreams. we can make it. We have to work hard at what we do and what we want to be, even if we can't pay our bills on time. Right now I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm still not giving up on my dreams of being a n author, despite many obstacles that I'm facing right now. My parents, older brother, and I have moved into an apartment just last year, and we're still facing major challenges. My parents and my brother aren't making that much money and are having trouble with payments, while I'm struggling with my grades (and money) during my fourth year in a community college and it looks like I've still got a few more years until I can actually transfer to a university. But I shouldn't feel horrible about all this. I still believe that we can pull this all off. We have to feel confident that we can achieve a great deal in the future. Right now, I'm in the process of writing several short stories, and I'm hoping to publish at least some of it this year. And maybe in a couple of years, I could publish my very first novel. With the obstacles I'm facing, I'm sure I can beat them.<br /><br />This is why "The Pursuit of Happyness," and Chris Gardner himself, is so special. It's a constant reminder that are dreams can be fulfilled. We have to work hard and believe in ourselves. If we quit, then we are disappointing ourselves and the people are supporting us. In the end, it's all about perseverance.<br /><br />"You got a dream, you got to protect. When people can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it. You want something...you go get it. Period." -Will Smith, as Chris Gardner</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Inspirational, rags-to-riches story starring Will Smith and son Jaden Smith (who plays Will's son in the film) makes for an agreeable evening's home entertainment, though if you've seen the film's trailer you've pretty much seen the film.  It was also a little strange to see brokerage employees as heartwarming guys who want to see Will's down-on-his-luck Chris Gardner character succeed.  But I guess the movie gets a few points for unpredictability on that score.  Generous extra features give us a look at the real-life Chris Gardner, the novelty of Will Smith working with his young son Jaden, and the amusing situations arising from the film's Italian director- Gabriele Mucchino- not being able to speak very good English.  I definitely enjoyed "The Pursuit of Happyness" (despite the title's annoying and intentional spelling error), but to part company with several of my fellow Amazon reviewers, I can't say it's one to write home about.  Crisp, sharp image and excellent sound on the DVD, though.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>This true story opens in San Francisco in the eighties, where salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is barely able to make ends meet.  His wife (Thandie Newton) gets fed up and leaves, and Chris must juggle a non-paying internship with a brokerage firm with caring for his five-year old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). With no income, Chris and Christopher go from cheap apartment to cheaper motel and eventually become homeless.<br /><br />I waited a long time to see this movie because I thought it would be sugary-sweet and corny, but it's not; it's realistic and scary, heartwarming, and inspiring.  Smith portrays Chris as an intelligent, hardworking, and extremely likeable man who sees his world crumble around him.  He gives a truly memorable performance.  His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.<br /><br />This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Pursuit of Happyness" is an unabashed tearjerker about the American Dream and commitment to family in the face of great odds. It was inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, who spent some time in the 1980s homeless while trying to care for his young son and make it through a stockbroker internship. The film is fictionalized but stays true to Gardner's struggle for success and dedication to his son. Gardner's autobiography, which goes by the same title, was actually published after the film was written. In San Francisco, 1981, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) can't make ends meet selling portable bone density scanners, while his embittered wife Linda (Thandie Newton) waitresses 2 shifts a day. Chris spies a man with an enviable sportscar on the street one day and asks him what he does for a living. He's a stockbroker. So Chris decides that's what he'll be. He must be at the top of his class after 6 months in Dean Witter's competitive internship program to be hired. Meanwhile, Chris has no wife, no money, no paying job, and a 5-year old son (Jaden Smith).<br /><br />A story of hardship and hard work, paternal love and frustration, could easily be too saccharine for words. It's saved from this fate by Chris Gardner's desperation. Behind his indomitable pluck, Gardner is truly desperate. He has no money, no home, uncertain prospects, and the responsibility of providing for a young child. He hides his circumstances from his colleagues. He's spends an inordinate amount of energy chasing errant bone scanners around town. He compromises his ethics. His single-mindedness eventually takes a toll on his son. Chris is struggling for his life. And his financial problems are something the audience can understand and may themselves fear. That's why "The Pursuit of Happyness" works so well. Credit is due Will Smith's Oscar-nominated performance and Italian director Gabriele Muccino's understanding of intense emotions painted with small strokes.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 4 featurettes, the song "I Can" by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz (5 min, audio), and a feature commentary. "Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream" (17 min) interviews Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith, and the producers about choosing Muccino to direct. Muccino talks about filming in San Francisco and working in English. "Father and Son: On Screen and Off" (7 min) recounts casting Jaden Smith after auditioning hundreds of other children, and Will Smith talks about working with his son. "The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner" (12 min) interviews Gardner about his participation in the film, and Will Smith talks about learning from him. "Inside the Rubik's Cube" (6 min) is a fun short documentary on the persistent popularity of the Cube. There is a nice audio commentary by director Gabriele Muccino, in English. Muccino tells us how he got the job, discusses themes, recreating the 1980s, Will Smith's trust, locations, and some technical details. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness.  Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.<br /><br />Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt.  Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film.  Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco.  Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.<br /><br />With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry.  The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed.  How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.<br /><br />Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines.  Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy.  The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent.  PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is well worth the journey.

That probably lends some bias to this story as I have never truly desired money as much as the characters here.  I do not mock or disregard poverty at all, but it's kind of weird to market a movie based on the struggle for wealth to middle- and upper-class citizens when they are already doing reasonable all right.  I guess it's an off sense of morality on my part, but in my case it's weird to see so much focus on material gain.<br /><br />Even so, this is certainly an admirable story that I feel made a more-than-decent movie that brings a tear and a heart ache to me to watch the suffering of a father and son--both excellent people.  I found myself cheering as this common man was able to go against all odds to achieve on Wall Street.<br /><br />This is a role that is somewhat different from others Will Smith has done, but he and his son did an excellent job.  Smith has that character sass and determination that I feel made him perfect for the part.<br /><br />The true story I feel is even more inspirational. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie and worthy of its praise.  It's just almost patronizing in its way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I certainly didn't expect such a powerful, moving film.  Everything you've read from the other reviewers is true.<br /><br />If I were to write a "what is it about?" plot summary, I could read that summary and conclude, "nothing I'd want to watch."  I'd be very wrong.  Again, it is impressive, just like my title says.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be quite compelling.

Very cool movie.<br /><br />Why Will's character couldn't commute from a lesser expensive place to live, I'll never know, but dragging his kid through skid row really pays off in the end! I'm being a bit critical there. Actually, wwhen all's said and done "The Pursuit of Happyness" really packs quite a punch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I thought this would be a "feel good" movie, but really it's a "feel bad" movie until the end.  What this man went through to keep his commitment to be there for his son was painful to watch, especially because the movie is based on a true story.<br /><br />I think others have described this film more than adequately, so I'll just try to add a few points here beyond the obvious inspirational quality of the movie.<br /><br />First, the bonus features really are bonuses.  The "making of" documentary is a "must see" after you've watched the movie.  The mini documentary on the Rubics Cube is great too!<br /><br />Second, something some may not notice that I did was the painstaking attention to detail in reproducing the early 1980's.  (This was mentioned in the "making of" documentary)  When we see scenes taken outside where there is a lot of traffic, I saw many cars but not one that was after 1981.  All the appliances, electronic devices, and other set decorations took me right back to about 1980.  Quite amazing.  Way more work went into this movie that you'd expect.<br /><br />This movie shows what the opposite of cynicism looks like.  And, it gave me something to really think about.  Maybe it's the persuit of "happyness" that makes life worthwhile, as much or more than being "happy".<br /><br />Finally, I very much appreciated the fact that the story was ethnically neutral, for lack of a better term.  What I mean is that the situation Chris Gardner found himself in could have happened to anyone regardless of background.  He was essentially a gifted person who made a bad business decision and soon found himself in a desparate situation.  He found some happy people (stock brokers) and decided to persue that happiness, and against the odds he succeeded.</p></br><a href="../users/A34PAZQ73SL163.html">A34PAZQ73SL163</a><br/><p>I wasn't a big Will Smith fan before seeing The Pursuit of Happyness but now I am. Here he gives an incredible performance as the quintessential good man who struggles to survive against random events which nearly overwhelm him (and would probably overwhelm anyone else). I just got done making a point about the movie Apocalypto which I will also make here. Movies like these fully reveal how silly we are to spend so much time obsessed with race, sex, and class in our society because no matter what your persuasion or ethnicity is most of us can easily relate intimately to those who differ from us when the circumstances necessitate it. In this film we cheer for Smith to succeed with all of our might. Our desire to see him make it is all-consuming.<br /><br />All of us, no matter what we look like, can relate to the character of Chris Gardner. The first hour of the film is almost painful to watch as we see a bright, capable, assertive man get beaten down by the vagaries of life. They called him "Ten Gallon Head" in high school because of how smart he was but most of the film is a testament to man's impotence and limitations when confronted with forces he cannot control. His intelligence does not even seem to matter. Gardner seems to "run bad" for 95 percent of the movie.<br /><br />Yet, his character and belief in himself are pervasively on display. He is a role model to everyone. Despite the disasters that keep punching him in the gut he refuses to quit. He refuses to accept defeat. He fights until...well, see the film. I bet you'll love the ending as much as I did. Yes, it is a tear-jerker but I was quite taken with The Pursuit of Happyness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This was a nice little 'feel good' movie. It never tries to be anything but that and hits right on the old heart strings. It is suppose to be based on a true story which in todays world might have meant that a white guy applied for a job and was a track star and they got this movie out of that story. I think that Will Smith was going for Tom Cruises record of being the greatest runner in the history of cinema. Smith, who I don't think is a great actor but who does an adequate job runs, runs and runs some more thru this entire movie. His little kid is perfectly cast again as the 'little cute kid' who tugs those tear ducts and pulls at your heart.<br /><br />Not a great movie but a good feel good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I had high expectations of this film, what with Will Smith, his son, and the down-on-your-luck-single-man-with-a-child bit.  On the side of sentimentality it delivered the prerequisite emotional tugs to heart strings.  But it really did nothing more than that.  I was immensely impressed with the extra footage of the real Chris Gardner and his presence, and wished even more that Smith had embodied even a scrap of it.  From an acting standpoint, it wasn't even a stretch for Smith, though I'm sure working with his son was a learning experience.  I think he ran more in this film than any action film I've ever seen him in.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>If you have a heart, this one's a real tear jerker.  Look past the basic premise of a man trying to get a job.  See the movie very carefully:  it's about a man struggling for survival so that he and his sone can fulfill that American dream:  the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />You just feel bad for Chris Gardner in this movie.  No matter how hard he tried to do something, it seemed like he could never catch a break, but he never let that stop him from trying.  Your heart does go out to him on this one.  Despite the bad luck, he never let showed his son that he lost hope.  He always kept his chin up as he became more and more humbled in his situation.  That's why the end is so poignant and endearing.<br /><br />I could barely see this movie because I cried so hard.  I knew from just watching the trailer that Will Smith would garner and Oscar nomination; however, it was a close call toss up between him and Forest Whitaker portraying General Idi Amin.  Really, really close.  I still would have picked Will Smith because this story seemed to resonate with me, and I would have given this the Oscar for Best Picture, as well, but things as they were, it did not come to pass.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that Will Smith and hisproducer John Lassiter actively sought Italian director Gabriele Muccino to direct this.  Muccino did "the Las Kiss" and "Remember me, My Love".  This whole movie experieince is based upon risk taking.  Will Smith took a risk on Gabriele Muccino to do this movie.  Muccino did a fabulous job being that this was his first non-Italian film ever.  Secondly, they auditioned so many kids to play the son of Chris Gardner, and they couldn't find any.  So they decided to give Will Smith's son a chance to read, and it turned out he was the best audition and he got cast.  So this is a first Father-son movie for Will Smith.  Thirdly, the whole movie centers aorund how the real Chris Gardner took a risk in his sales job to become a stock broker and after hitting a serious low and given his God-given chance, he finally becasme a success.<br /><br />How does a movie like this not get Best Picture?  Well, it's a good story and worth the watch with a good lesson for all.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>this film was a reflection of a man's dilemmas in real life. will smith, the wonderful actor that he is, really captured this mans tragedy, his suffering, his will to fight, to achieve what others thought impossible. he gave you that feeling that almost anything can be done. will smith is brilliant, the man is an A+. he put such feeling and emotions into the film that you really felt for him. and his son jaden might just take after his father. nice job. overall this movie was nicely done. there was a lesson to be learned, a life to portray, and so many things to deal with. basically how the average person is living. paycheck to paycheck all the same worries, the rent, the bills, and having to struggle. he was the man and he had to do something. he had to fix the problem, and although it took risk, fight, and everything he had, along side his son he made it happen. it wasn't easy, but nothing ever is that's worth fighting for. great movie, no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Everyone's used to seeing Will Smith in the action/funny man role and it does get old after a while. But thankfully, as he's getting older, he's turning to different roles in the last few years, there's been Ali (which I haven't seen, but read some good reviews) and this. (We'll exclude Hitch completely.)<br /><br />Pursuit of Happyness is based on a true story, about a period in a man's life, where absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong, does go wrong. I've kinda been on a downer the past couple of days and this is the perfect movie to help you along if you're in that kinda mood, and I topped my mood off even worse by watching the last couple of discs of the final ever seaon of Quantum Leap. Thoroughly depressed? You bet.<br /><br />Will plays Chris Gardner absolutely brilliantly, and it's a role he's never really done before. I was so involved in the movie that I forgot to even look out for Dan Castellaneta (Homer in the Simpsons) - clue: he asks Chris for a donut! It's a truly heart wrenching story, and I was nearly in tears at some points, from having to bunk down for the night in a men's toilets, to having all the money taken from his account in one swoop. His wife walks out on him, leaving with a five year old son (who's Will's real life son), he's selling something that is probably unsellable, he gets arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, and just when he thinks nothing else can happen, it does.<br /><br />The way this film depicts poverty in America looks extremely accurate and gut wrenchingly honest. It hurts to watch it, but then the movie is enriched by the fact the two actors playing father & son are actually father & son, and it's a great chemistry and bond between them, but must have been hard for Jaden at some points, particularly when he has to be yelled at. He's quite the little scene stealer isn't he? But then so was the old guy who thought the x-ray machine thing was a time machine. He was hilarious, I wanted to see more of him.<br /><br />It's a truly magical movie, and I won't give too much more away than I already have. But if you've seen enough of Will doing the action man movie, this is one to pick up. It's definitely worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>If you have a vision/goal for yourself & your family and you work hard to realize those dreams, then you will succeed in life.<br /><br />Mr. Gardner is a wonderful example of the typical person with the vision/goal of living the all American dream.

I have heard my friends praising Jaden Smith's performance. Yet it's the story and Will Smith that grabbed my attention.<br /><br />It's sometimes uneasy to see how Chris Gardner made ends meet in the movie and he did it all for his son. The good work of charity organizations, the people who responded to his phone calls and bought his scanners helped. (I begin to think of all those promotion phone calls I turned down.) Chris's sheer determination, perseverance and guts to  survive his 6-month internship were again not an easy act to follow. It took every bit of his intelligence to pull it off. This is a feel good movie to make us reflect how much we already have; how a little help can make a big difference to others' lives. A thought provoking movie indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>The person the movie is about was talked about in the investment world long before the movie was released; however, I had no CLUE as to the depth of hardship he had to overcome to get where he is at today.

It tells the true story of CHRIS GARDNER, a man who, along with his son Christopher, lived on the streets of San Francisco as he explored the shot in the dark chance that he would be one of 20 men who would be offered a job after an internship at a brokerage firm.<br /><br />Very few people could actually survive living life on the streets of America and Chris Gardner is one of them. PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS shows how the homeless community in America isn't always drunks and loonies. The film captures the downward spiral and the desperation that Gardner experienced. Not to mention, it is captured incredibly well by Will Smith.<br /><br />This is a movie not to miss. Heartbreaking and inspirational. Don't miss the MEET CHRIS GARDNER featurette in the special features. Almost as interesting as the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, and, yes, more SPOILERS.<br /><br />Stockbroker Chris Gardner's real life rags-to-riches story was featured in a 15 minute segment on 20/20 some years ago and it was memorable and inspirational enough that, now, we have THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, a film based, more or less, on that story. Now, certain facts have been altered a bit, ostensibly, for better dramatic consumption. Three examples of changes that were wrought are: back in 1981, Chris actually had custody of his infant son, not a five year old; instead of being unpaid, he did receive a meager stipend in his brokering internship; and Chris's wife Linda is fully fictionalized in the film. Whether such changes work or are even needed is, of course, left for you to decide. What's not up to debate is the quality of man it takes to pull off an underdog story like this. The real Chris Gardner must've been (and, presumably, still is) a formidably resilient man who made his own luck, who remained undeterred by a life that was kicking him to the curb.<br /><br />The film's plot: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (The misspelled "happyness" originates from an outside mural displayed on the crappy Chinatown day care center to which Chris sends his son) is set in 1981, in San Francisco. Go-getter Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who had been an excellent student as a child but who now, as an adult, feels he's basically amounted to nothing, is eking out a hand-to-mouth living as an unsuccessful hawker of a hospital equipment called a bone density scanner, which proves to be a flop with the medical community. With a young 5 year old and an increasingly bitter wife to provide for, it's tough going for Chris. In fact, it's his wife Linda (a worn down, shrewish Thandie Newton), who toils in multiple shifts and, more often than not, furnishes the capital. Linda finds this lifestyle too unbearable and soon takes off for New York. Upon the insistence of Chris, she reluctantly leaves their son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in his care. Bye bye, Linda.<br /><br />Chris has a plan. A few scenes back, a fleeting encounter with a friendly stockbroker sporting a red Ferrari - who informed him that all one needed to have success in stocks was to be "good with people and good with numbers" - had impacted him enough  that he had decided to become a stockbroker himself. A month of persistence (or, basically, politely hounding an executive outside his brokerage building and then impressing him with his Rubik's Cube skills) lands him an interview for a prospective 6-month internship program with the prestigious Dean Witter firm, with the possibility of being hired at internship's end. He passes the interview and is offered a spot in the program, despite showing up dressed like a transient (a long story, involving paint, parking tickets, and prison). However, to his dismay, he finds that it is an unsalaried internship; after some long, hard thinking, he decides to still go for it, while re-dedicating himself to selling more of his bone density scanners to make ends meet.<br /><br />Of course, things go bad immediately. With his wife and her steady income gone, Chris struggles badly. He runs afoul of the landlord, the IRS, and, in one kinda funny sequence, of one dogged taxi driver. He does manage to sell a scanner, only to have his finances subsequently confiscated by the IRS. Down to literally mere dollars, he and his son succumb to poverty and become homeless; they find themselves forced to wait in line for hours to get into homeless shelters and, when not getting in the shelter, having to spend nights in public rest rooms. Meanwhile, during the day, Chris dons his business attire and attends his internship. He finds it difficult to compete with the other 19 aspirers in the program as they manage to put in 9 hours daily, whereas he's only able to spend 6 hours in the firm (he has to pick up his son from day care, catch the bus, get in line for the shelter, etc). To compensate, while in the firm, he doesn't drink water (thus, less time in the bathroom) and keeps the phone constantly in hand (discovering he gains 8 minutes by doing so). As the 6 months of internship continue to elapse, things get progressively worse for the Gardner family. And then the last day of internship comes...<br /><br />I won't lie, it's a pretty dark, gloomy film; but there's a beauty and a sincerity to it. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is imbued with a certain stark honesty, depicting Chris' struggles as he copes with his internship while simultaneously walking that tightrope between life on and off the streets. This film is sentimental without being too cloying and contains enough levity to thankfully provide a much-needed counterpoint to the main character's dreary, ever worsening plight.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this film. It's 180 degrees away from the normal, breezy Will Smith flick. Although he's done serious cinema in the past, he's never put as much of his soul and his heart as he does in this one. It's evident that PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a personal project of his. One reason for his emotional investment is, undeniably, the casting of young Christopher, unaffectedly portrayed by Jaden Smith, who happens to be Will Smith's real life son. Their natural chemistry is what makes this whole shebang works. The bond between the two is a delight to behold. If there's any doubt that Will Smith is genuinely a nice guy, his sweet, easy relationship with his son should dispel any doubt, if there were any, to begin with. Young Jaden Smith is a fresh, new talent who is effectively unmannered in his acting and also delivers with some pretty good kid jokes.<br /><br />I've never had any doubts that the Fresh Prince can act. He proved that early on in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. Will Smith was also great in ALI, and he is equally charismatic here as he unveils a focused commitment to dramatic acting. Once again, his innate likability holds him in good stead. There are moments in the film where he'll make you positively weep. Witness his performance as he and Christopher are forced to spend a night in a BART station men's room, or the fleeting look of bleakness which crosses his face when he's forced to relinquish his last five dollar bill to loan his boss cab fare, and, brilliantly depicted, the held-in-check emotions he displays in the movie's culminating moments when he finds out he just got hired (c'mon, you did know he was gonna get the gig, right?). I wouldn't be at all surprised if an Oscar nomination is in the offing.<br /><br />So what else can I say to convince folks to check this film out? This movie is fairly stark without being patronizing, hopeful without being saccharine. Yes, there are several patented Hollywood moments (how could there not?), but these are curtailed by Smith's awesomely gritty performance. His protagonist is a man of big smarts whose dignity, optimism, perseverance, resilience, and love for his son never flag. Chris Gardner realizes, too, that resorting to bitterness and anger isn't the answer. Instead, throughout his travails, he maintains his composure, his wits, his smile, and his warmth, qualities which inevitably carry him to the summit. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting. I'm so glad I saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>If anyone has viewed the respective talk shows over the past few weeks, he or she is familiar with the story of Chris Gardner, a down-on-his-luck father that overcame overwhelming odds to become an established stockbroker and successful businessman in his own right.  It is story that has been vividly brought to the screen with a dynamic and heart-wrenching performance from star Will Smith and a poignant acting debut from the actor's real-life son, Jaden.  Both father and son play so well off each other that it was indeed a stroke of genius for such a casting coup.<br /><br />Thandie Newton continues to deliver memorable turns as she assays the role of Gardner's wife Linda who abandons both husband and son for the chance of a better life in New York, miles away from their San Francisco location.<br /><br />Speaking of "the city by the bay," it continues to be one of the most appealing locations and director Gabriele Muccino takes advantage of this fact, always making sure that the audience sees notable landmarks in the background.<br /><br />In a movie of this type, where the "saccharine level" could be very high, Muccino keeps them at a minimum, only showing three scenes that start the tear ducts to do their jobs.  This is a tribute to his skills as a director.<br /><br />Andrea Guerra's score is never overpowering, always effectively subtle to coincide with the on-screen events.<br /><br />In all, "The Pursuit of Happyness" is one film that should be pursued by all moviegoers.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  So did a great many others.  It took in more than $160 million in the U. S. and over $300 million worldwide.  Why?  Because everyone knows more about hard times than they care to admit.  We know what its like to be up against it financially, have a period in our lives when it is hard to pay the rent or make the mortgage payment.  While most of us haven't had to use a men's room as sleeping accommodations, we know what it is like to want to care for our children and have times when we can't provide for them as we would like. Most people know what it is like to have more meals of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles than they would choose to have if they had more green in their wallets. Many more people know what a shutoff warning from the utility company looks like than would tell you about it.<br /><br />We know what it is like to have dreams and to pursue them under pressure and against tough odds.  We know what it is like to want to teach our kids about life and then later regret giving them our own disappointments rather than the truth and how that might sap their own dreams and vitality - the gifts of youth - and to want to take those words back.<br /><br />Almost all marriages have tough times.  Not every marriage collapses, but the pressures of life have killed marriages that could have made it under different circumstances.  We know what it is like to make a mistake in choosing a bad job and having to work our way out of it.<br /><br />For these reasons, and many more, we relate to this movie.  It is terrific.  And the performances by Will and Jaden Smith are something quite special.  Will Smith is always charismatic on the screen, but this time he wisely lets Jaden have that dramatic space and Will plays Chris Gardner, a real man under real pressure.  Chris is a brilliant man who didn't have the opportunities to develop his intellectual talents as he should have had.  He and his hard working wife made a tough business decision in trying to sell bone density scanners, but it was a product wasn't as accepted in the marketplace as they had hoped.  Now Linda (played with the right notes by Thandie Newton) has to work two shifts while their money gets spread thinner and thinner - to the point of evaporation.  A nice touch is when Linda pours the left over iced tea in their dinner glasses back into the pitcher.  Only people really hurting do that kind of thing.<br /><br />However, despite the hardship, this is a positive and heartwarming movie.  We root for everyone in the film.  We realize that a lot of the pain in the film is caused by mis-communication or a total lack of willingness or ability to simply go and explain the situation to another.  Maybe that was impossible and things would not have worked out as well if they had.  Still, we wish people would just say this or that to that person there.<br /><br />A terrific movie.  Enjoy it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>Father and Son performances that will take your breath away. Not the greatest movie, a little slow at times, but Will and young Jaden Smith make for one of the best duels of the year. Thandie Newton very believably plays the haggard and stressed wife and mother. Great acting ensemble all around.<br /><br />The kid definitely has a future ahead of him should he pursue it. Will Smith is very convincing in his characterized climb from the bottom to the top. Probably his best work to date.<br /><br />It's never too late to achieve our dreams!</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>I'm told that soprano sax hack Kenny G once played a sustained, uninterrupted note for an entire hour.  (There is no data available regarding how many audience members took their own lives in response.)  In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith tops this dubious distinction by playing the same note for 2 hours straight, no variation in pitch, tempo, color, texture - unadulterated schmaltz.  Smith is box office gold because he's just so darn wholesome and non-threatening, which is precisely why he had no prayer of pulling this off.  Had it been played for real, this would have been a dark and chilling movie, ultimately an inspiring one, but it's far too well-scrubbed for that.<br /><br />Smith plays Chris Gardner, and Gardner's overriding passion is to be a good father.  He and real life son Jaden Smith traipse through the film like a couple of hobos; one expects to see them holding cigar butts with toothpicks and playing harmonicas.  Mom, played by the exotically beautiful Thandie Newton, abandons Chris, son, and the pleasures of San Francisco to work as a waitress in New York.  (Presumably there were no more waitress positions available in San Fran.)  Why she breaks that strongest of all bonds - mother and child - is never explained, she's a straw character exiting early.  This leaves us with only dad and son, and dad's big dream - which is to be a stockbroker.  The mystery of why anyone in his right mind would want to be a stockbroker is explained early on when Chris sees one parking a Ferrari - say no more!  Obviously a car like that is happiness - I mean happyness.<br /><br />Of course, you and I know better.  We know that the end of Chris's rainbow is not a pot of money; much less the maniacal streetwalking stockbrokers engage in to make that kind of money.  It is, of course, the relationship he has with his son - which he has had all along.  Unfortunately the director doesn't seem to know this, because all action drives from impoverishment to ultimate acceptance in the temple of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.  Any chance the film had of touching a nerve depended entirely on a convincing performance by young Smith.  He is every bit as likeable as dear old dad, a real chip off the old blockhead, but there's no spark there at all.<br /><br />As the film reminds us, Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, i.e. one must seek it.  My advice, look a little harder.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This could have easily been the movie of the year.

He pursues through very tough times, and manages to keep his son happy, and finally is able to find real happiness with the success of his word, his morals, and excellent work ethic.  An inspirational story for all.  The characters in this film are all believable, and it is great to think that this is based on a true story.

It seems like I've known guys like this throughout my life ,sometimes they do make it,but more often they take a nosedive and pull people down with them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>It's hard not to review this movie with my heart instead of my head.  I found the film to be inspirational, and it had me glued to the screen.  I would recommend it heartily to be seen in the theater, and not to wait for the DVD.<br /><br />It is formulaic, there is little suspense, and director Gabriele Muccino makes sure that you understand not only the happy ending, but the hardship.  The chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden makes the film work, and both Smith and Thandie Newton give performances that remind us of just how good they both are.<br /><br />While the film does not really visit the theme of how growing up black and male in America and especially in dysfunctional circumstances, (as Gardner's book did)can cause you to lose hope -- it does show us the despair and fear, leading to anger and regret, that comes of taking risks and finding yourself waking up poor.  With the right touch, the filmmakers emphasize that Gardner's willingness to pursue, really pursue, a better life for he and his son, made a difference.<br /><br />A fine film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This is a great movie, it really is.

In spite of all these troubles, the main character, chris, is able to get a prestigious internship with a brokerage firm.  Things work out, and after many troubles, he is able to succeed. Will does a great job with this character, so the entire movie is worth the time watching it.

You might pass her on the street without a second glance, which I think freed up something in Newton, allowing her to do some of her very best work here.  Of course she has a thankless part because nobody cares about her anyhow, as everyone has pointed out.  It's sort of like the way Meryl Streep is treated in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, except here she doesn't even get to come back at the end, not even a phone call to let her boy know she made it safely to New York.<br /><br />Am I the only one who watched all the extras to this movie and tried in vain to find out what happened to the little boy?  What's the mystery all about.  We find out in every corner of the menu that Chris Gardner became the most successful black enterpreneur of all time.  But what about the son?  Is he even alive?  Hope I'm not putting my foot in my mouth, but I'm curious.<br /><br />When Chris sells his bone scanning machine to the kindly doctor, he cashes his check at Ted's Market, which is on my block South of Market here in San Francisco.  There are big blowup photos all over the deli counter, shots of Will and Chris making nice with the store workers and other neighbors.  It's always fun to see a movie filmed in San Francisco, and I hate those people who quibble about locations, but if you live here you will laugh when you see that every San Francisco park seems to have a BART entrance at the corner, whereas in real life BART is built to service the most builtup sections of the Bay Area, not the country club locations.  I hate people like myself who nitpick about these matters!<br /><br />Finally, I better duck from the rotten tomatoes, but in my opinion little Jaden Christopher Smith is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen, and I give Will the same credit I gave Aaron Spelling for trying to make Tori a star despite unpromising credentials.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>It takes a while to figure out what you're good at. It's not easy for a black man to get ahead in this cold world; you must persue your dream against all odds.  Nine times out of ten the journey is more important for character and integrity than the goal. That goes for anybody, but nevertheless, this Will Smith vehicle works on all levels. Come on kids!  You can do it too!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"The Pursuit of Happyness" is a based-on-truth story about Chris Gardner, freelance salesman of portable bone density tracer. But carrying a heavy machine around in San Francisco is a hard work especially when he has to send his son to the daycare center, and not every doctor is interested in his `gismo.' Down on his luck, he accepts an unpaid job in the training program of a stockbroking house, but in spite of (or because of) his eagerness, his wife become more estranged, giving a cold shoulder to him.<br /><br />Will Smith is perfect as Chris Gardner, who eventually has to sleep in a public restroom in the subway with his son, making him believe that this is a `cave.' Because of the warmth and humor in Will Smith's performance and the visible rapport with his son (played by his real-life son Jaden), the film is not depressing as you might believe. Still some people (not me) might feel so looking at Chris doing jobs as unpaid intern, hit by a car in the street, and still going back to work even though he is uncertain of his future (only one applicant will pass the test).<br /><br />Italian-born director Gabriele Muccino avoids sugary sentiments in this Horatio Alger-like tale, and at times Chris' zealous attitudes look pathetic (don't miss one scene where Chris is seen dragging his son to catch a bus). It is clear that Muccino is trying to present his own version of American dream. The film gets really credible and its satire becomes biting when the company's bosses casually ask him to do things like lending five dollars. The bosses are not bad people (no `villains' appear), but they just don't see the vast gaps (financial and otherwise) between them and Chris even though they are both wearing suits.<br /><br />However, like many major studio films made by non-American directors brought in Hollywood, we can see director is trying to be different in contents, but we don't see in what way exactly. I read many reviews on this film, and though many used such words as inspirational and uplifting, some people said the film is depressing. The fact is `The Pursuit of Happyness' could be both, not content with being either of them. After all, what made Chris apply for the stockbroker's trainee course first? Was it a red Ferrari or his son's happiness?<br /><br />We are not sure of that. We are sure of Will Smith's heart-warming turn, however, and that is probably the greatest thing in `The Pursuit of Happyness' which is a feel-good movie, but there is somewhere in the film an untold part you can vaguely sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Every time Will Smith ran in this film, I'd hear a part of me cheer him. I doubt he can act any better. Let's save ourselves sometime and give him at least an Oscar Nomination for this film called Pursuit of Happyness. Now, you may wonder what is about this film that's worth liking. Mere words (or my words) can't explain but I'll try.<br /><br />Chris Gardener(Will Smith) is a man who's wife has left him. He has no income and lives on selling some machine. He has one son who's five years old. He runs around to find a job vacancy or to sell his machine. Sometimes he runs from the taxi driver while at other time he runs behinds hippies and crazy folks. There is much more but I'll let that be.<br /><br />Queer intrigue attaches itself it's self to Will Smith in this film. Everything about him makes you want to cheer him on. I relate to Will Smith. His fears, troubles, tears, smiles, gestures and shoes become yours by the end of the first hour.<br /><br />Don't miss this film. I'm not gonna call it life affirming. All I can say about this movie is Will Smith, Will Smith and Will Smith.<br /><br />Respect is no longer earned. It is snatched.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Down on his luck Chris Gardner (Smith) sells bone density scanners to local hospitals and doctors in 1981 in San Francisco.  His wife Linda (Newton) is unpleasant and demanding.  His son, Christopher, is a happy kid, but is effected by his parents' disharmony.  Soon, Linda leaves him and he is evicted from his home.  He has little money, and his hopes lie with an internship program at Dean Witter.  He is the least likely of the bunch to succeed in the class until he amazes the program head by solving his Rubik's Cube.  He enters the program and struggles to do that as well as sell his scanners and raise his kid.<br /><br />This is your standard rags to riches story.  With an emphasis on the rags part.  "The Pursuit of Happyness" is pretty much a downer for 90 minutes as Chris must deal with everything that is thrown at him.  Will Smith does a good job making Chris feel like a real person.  He is not perfect, but he tries really hard, and that makes him easy to like.  His real life son Jayden is also good as Christopher.  This is an OK movie with a good performance by Smith that may benefit him come Oscar time.  If you are looking for an inspiring movie, this may fill that need.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>Pros: I read an article in my college newspaper from a columnist who made fun of a homeless man selling Streetwise. He basically proclaimed that if no one was selling condoms, liquor, Greek paraphernalia, or telling them about a party, then they shouldn't be bugging him on the way to class to sell a newspaper. I was absolutely outraged and wrote a nice long article to that newspaper and another publication to make sure my voice was heard. There are far too many elitist people in this world too wrapped up in their own personal drama to reflect the fact that they should be thankful for what they have.  In this movie, we learn about a man who has made a bad business decision by buying medical equipment and going into debt trying to make a profit from it.  With his employment issues, he also has a wife who is working overtime and a son who has a very unprofessional daycare instructor.  To make matters worse, his wife leaves him and he is evicted from his apartment.  But the strongest part about it is that even with all of the things going on around him, he is still so determined to sell his equipment, take care of his son, be civil with his wife, and try to find a career that works. I read an article in JET magazine about the real life Chris Gardner, and one of the shelter employees said that it was rare that someone could come out of poverty into being a millionaire. This story had to be told--if not for those selfish people who don't understand why people are standing on the corner because they have no place else to go; that homeless men have a rough time getting into those shelters because so many are for women and children; and how charities work.  Whether it was Christmas or not, this type of story needs to be told because so many (like that simple-minded writer I spoke of earlier) turn a deaf ear to anybody not in their economic group. It's aggravating and stressful.  I appreciated Smith being apart of this movie so much.  It's cool when he tries his hand at other genres (science fiction, action, documentaries) and I love that he will take on so many different roles, from killing aliens to molding into a very strong and admirable homeless man who will succeed by all means necessary.  This was a very touching film and I loved every minute of it.  There is nothing more adorable than to see a father who loves his child, and I'm so glad that Smith's son was able to play the part of the son.<br />On top of that, when I was leaving the theater, this thugged out dude was on his cell phone talking to a friend about how much this movie motivated him and made him want to make money.  When Will Smith touches brothas to want to make legitimate money, there's no way I can give it anything but a thumbs up.  A lady I know who reads NOTHING but grocery lists raced to the bookstore to buy Chris' book.  Once again, this movie touched a lot of people in different ways.<br /><br />Cons: None.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>Listen, the message in this movie is a great one.  Work hard and you will succeed.  I am shocked at how many people seem to think the only thing this movie promotes is earning money.  What about the dedication Chris displayed to his son?  What about the earning self-respect by finding something important and meaningful to do with your life.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about the movie was that it could have been a more honest portrayal of the real man.  He wasn't the saint that we see Will Smith portraying him to be.  People are flawed (I know I am, because I haven't found a man who will commit to me yet) and Chris Gardner or whatever his name is is not an exception.  He was honest about it in his book, but the movie makes him out to be this absolutely perfect angel.  What a crock.<br /><br />But all that said, to live a comfortable life we all have to earn money.  It makes the world go 'round and we all need it.  Period, end of story.  Chris made a lot of it and that doesn't guarantee him a happy life but it sure makes the journey smoother.  Shame on those who prefer socialism (i.e. - communism) to the brand of capitalism we practice here in the great United States.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie,but not as much as I thought I would.

His wife Linda played by Thandie Newton is becoming disillusioned working a double shift and still fighting to keep the wolf away from the door.  Frustrated she checks out of the marriage in little more than a cameo role and without much protest leaves Smith to care for their son.<br /><br />Smith, a naturally bright guy without the benefit of a college education gets an opportunity to vie for an internship as a stock broker for Dean Witter Reynolds.  As the competitive internship is unsalaried, Smith literally kills himself trying to make ends meet, winding up in a homeless shelter.<br /><br />His perseverance fueled by his deeply emotional relationship with his son, ultimately and thankfully pays off as he attains his goal.<br /><br />For an uplifting story I found that the plot was far too heavy in the depressing details of Smith's striving to succeed which made the film seem needlessly long.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>The biggest problem with this film is the script;it needs to be trimmed severely.Two hours of plodding disappointment and "bad luck" for about two minutes of happiness does not make for the most effective viewing.Much of the hardship could have been compressed and the point would have still been made effectively.Will Smith's performance of(inspired by a true story) Chris Gardner is truly outstanding and the film is worth a see just for that alone;but overall the film has a drone about it that stays stuck in a downward spiral just like it's lead character.DOOR TO DOOR with William H.Macy is a better treatment of a similar subject.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>***UPDATE:  I had the incredible good fortune to hear Gardner's story firsthand when my wife surprised me with tickets to see him when he visited our area and spoke at the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce on May 2, 2007.  He basically told his story as it was revealed in the film and noted some changes the film made such as in reality his son was only 2 when all this happened to him and not 5.  He did say something terrifically funny when he said, "I'm amazed that it cost Hollywood 70 million dollars to reproduce what I experienced for free."  His presentation was filled with such precious gems like that one.  Gardner continues to give back to people who desperately need it as his book was available after his speech and a portion of the proceeds went to a local charity and he does this everywhere he speaks.  Gardner is a truly inspirational individual and I was honored to hear his story firsthand.<br /><br />This is one of those films that can be very difficult to review without alienating somebody.  If you criticize Will Smith, his legions of fans will go on the attack.  If you criticize the film itself, you'll get blasted for being heartless.  Lastly, if, God forbid, you criticize a child's performance, you are considered ruthless.  I can see by the number of negative votes that I have received here that my point is somewhat valid even though I took great pains to praise this film where it appropriately deserved it, but I guess my criticism where poorly received.  I wish people knew how to use these "helpful" buttons more as they aren't meant to ONLY support reviews one agrees with.  I have given many "helpful" votes to review I totally disagree with as they supported their opinion well and got me to consider things I hadn't before.  Oh, well.  Here is my review and I still stand by it today.<br /><br />"The Pursuit of Happyness" was a hard film to watch as I believe it was intended by those involved as it is always very difficult to witness the heartaching struggles others sometimes have.  This is a truly moving story of a poverty-stricken family and a dad who all too often creates his own obstacles in life, but, nevertheless, continues to move forward with courage, dignity, love, and patience that few possess.  Although a flawed hero, Will's character, Gardner, is a hero in the true sense of the word and one can't help but feel that old phrase "There but through the grace of God walk I."  The main character and storyline are truly inspirational and Smith's acting here is something to really behold, but the film, for me, did have some serious flaws.<br /><br />On the positive end, the acting by Smith is nothing less than flawless.  His eyes show his pain and joy at any given moment.  I was absolutely brought to tears myself (my family too) when he's holed up in a subway bathroom with his kid pretending it's a cave and they are hiding out from dinosaurs.  Smith's slow, laborious, and silent weeping in that bathroom on the floor while holding his sleeeping son is one of the most emotional scenes ever filmed and that scene alone requires an Oscar nomination for him (which would be his second).  I was also moved to tears when Smith's character gets the job at the end of the film and does all he can not to cry in front of his new employers.  I have been in such a situation myself after losing a job and when I found another after a year of unemployment and losing my home; I could really relate to Smith's struggle to not cry in front of his new bosses.  By the way, I didn't spoil anything here as all, if not most, are aware of this man's success story already.<br /><br />Will's son is not the best actor, but he's engaging enough.  Some cliched script writing hurts him more than his ability to deliver a line.  He's just too perfect of a kid to believe and that affects how I actually view his performance and that, perhaps, isn't fair.  However, who can resist a real-life father and son act?  I can't.  It's just sad that the writers have him saying some silly and/or too mature lines over and over again.  In an overall good film this is a serious flaw that really stands out and can be distracting.<br /><br />In addition, the direction was another serious flaw with the film.  It labors too long in some areas and goes too fast in others, yet, I must admit that I appreciate the level of acting the director gets out of his actors in spite of his poor pacing and uneven direction.  I am as exhausted as Smith's character by the end of the film as he's always running somewhere.  I realize that may have been the intention of the film, but in actuality, it is annoying after awhile with it's redundancy.  Again, I know we are being asked to experience the tragedy of this man's existance at the worst time in his life; however, I'm also noting that the repetitive scenes of dispair wear away at an audience's patience at times.  I noticed many squirming in their seats at numerous such scenes.  A good point can be lost when overdone.  I had the awkward feeling that the director was feeling outshined by his cast and tried too hard to put his personal stamp on the film.<br /><br />I did love some specific elements in the film like how meaningless money is to those that have it.  A very memorable moment is when Smith's boss asks him for $5 to cover a cab ride and he gives it to him, leaving nothing left for himself or his son but a few dollars.  Oh, how we take money for granted.  Another such scene is when he shares a cab with another boss who stiffs him the $20 cab fee (assuming everyone has at least $20 bucks on them), forcing Smith's character to literally flee the cab and be chased by the driver, which, by the way, was a very well-directed sequence.<br /><br />All in all, this is a competent film with an extraordinary performance by Will Smith which earned him a well-deserved second Oscar nomination for Best Actor (the first was for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMQ">Ali</a>), but just don't be surprised that the overall quality of the film is that of a TV-Movie; albeit, a very well-made TV-Movie.  I recommend this film for those who have the patience to sit through this kind of film which can be difficult due to its subject matter and its uneven pacing.  Poverty is never pretty to witness or experience, but stories like this need to be told and we need to listen to what it has to say.  This is a very inspirational film with moving performance and a number of memorable scenes.  I might not "buy" this DVD when it comes out (something I reserve for films that have great repeat value), but I would surely rent it and view it again and recommend others to view it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>The Pursuit of Happyness is the sad but uplifting true story of millionairre stockbroker Chris Gardner. Will Smith (Hitch) plays Gardner with such a sincerity that I will be rooting for him to win this year's Oscar for Best Actor when, not if, he is nominated.<br /><br />The movie pursues Gardner as he struggles with cash, which ends him up on the street with his son, played by Smith's real life son Jaden, who in my opinion deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as well. After being evicted from his home for failing to pay the rent, Gardner goes from the subway restroom to homeless shelters, as his dream of becoming a stockbroker takes it's first but difficult steps as a non-paid intern at a major stock brokerage firm.<br /><br />Pursuit teaches us that we must follow our dreams no matter what might happen. It is truly an inspirational movie that should garner many Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture, and one for Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton who plays Gardner's impatient wife, as well as an award nomination and win for both Smith and son!<br /><br />One of the best films of 2006.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This starts out as a nice story about a single dad with incredible effort and talent who goes from nothing to owning his own brokerage firm in S.F.

Yes, the film is based on a true, inspirational story and Will's real life son Jaden, playing his on screen son is adorable. There are also numerous enjoyable performances by the supporting cast, specially the homeless guy (John Robb) looking for a time machine. Product values are superior throughout and the storyline possesses both depth and character. The problem is that Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) personal crisis goes on too long and by the time things are finally turning positive the film abruptly ends and the audience is denied the opportunity to sit back for a moment and relish the emotional high from his accomplishment.<br /><br />A good film, definitely something you should see.

Yeeeoooowwwccchhhh! Excuse me for a moment; I need to inject some insulin before the diabetic shock from the treacle dialogue takes hold.<br /><br />Okay, thanks for holding on. I'm all better.<br /><br />Well, I'm sure to get some negative hits at Amazon, after I post this review, but here it goes...<br /><br />Chris Gardner (Smith), the struggling father of a small boy, Christopher (Smith), struggles to sell pieces of medical equipment no doctor seems to want, struggles to get his kid to a third rate, but cheap daycare, and struggles to maintain a home with his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), who works double shifts in a hotel laundry. He just struggles. Chris eventually loses one of the medical devices and this is the last straw for Linda, who walks out. Unable to pay the rent, Chris and his son are evicted and they move into a seedy motel in the Mission district of San Francisco. Chris watches a man park his expensive car at the curb and learns the man is a stockbroker at Dean Witter. Hounding the head of personnel, Jay Twistle (Brian Howe), Chris eventually wins an interview and soon lands an internship with the prestigious brokerage. An unpaid internship. While he works through the competitive internship, Chris sets out to sell the remaining medical devices, to support him and his son, providing their only source of income. Only one in the class of twenty will be hired so it's a struggle. As Chris tries to keep his son safe and fed, he studies his manual, tries to sell the machines, and tries to impress his bosses. Will Chris Gardner be able to overcome the struggle?<br /><br />"The Pursuit of Happyness" (yes, I know Microsoft, it is misspelled), directed by Gabriele Muccino, starring Will Smith and his real son, Jaden, is "inspired by" the real story of Chris Gardner.<br /><br />"Happyness" is the perfect film for this time of year. Designed to provide a brief respite for all of the mall shoppers, give them a bit of fluff, between checkout lines at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, and give them a little inspiration before they trudge out to deal with the next store employee who has had one too many customers like you today. I'm sure some people will be moved and some people will be inspired, it is difficult to not be moved when Gardner finally gets the job at Dean Witter. Oh, I'm not spoiling anything. Even if you didn't already know this, they would never make a film about someone who didn't get the job. That is what the film is about, persevering beyond the struggles. Maybe you'll come out of the film with that extra little oomph in your step, ready to face your own struggles with holiday woes.<br /><br />But "Happyness" is so much more than a little piece of fluff. It is a very calculated move by Smith to get an Oscar nomination. If he tells you otherwise, he is lying. Smith is a movie star and commands a top salary for every film. He can open any film, good or bad, because he has legions of fans willing to pay to see any film he is in. Heck, he can open "The Pursuit of Happyness", making it the number one film for the weekend. But he, like every actor, isn't content with simply appearing in box office fluff. Right before this film, there was a trailer for Adam Sandler's next film "Reign Over Me", in which he plays a depressed widower who meets up with an old college chum (Don Cheadle). Sandler and Smith are remarkably similar. If Sandler appears in a silly comedy, the film is box office gold. If Smith appears in a sci fi comedy or an action film, box office gold. But both want respectability and the way to achieve that is to make films like "The Pursuit of Happyness" and "Reign Over Me". These films show they can act, become something other than their popular on screen persona. Sandler has been dipping his toes in this pool for a while, making films like "Punch Drunk Love" and "Spanglish" along with his more sophomoric comedies.<br /><br />So, going in, we already know the outcome of "Happyness", which means there is no suspense. The only point in watching the film is to watch the struggle. And Gardner struggles. No doubt about that. As the voice over narration states, he signs over his life savings to buy these machines, the medical devices no doctor seems to want. He loses his car, because he has a problem with parking tickets, so he has to carry them all over the Bay Area. He has to make sure he can pick up his son on time. He has to count every penny, to make sure he can feed his son. And more. When the money starts to run out, they are kicked out of their apartment. Then the slide downward continues.<br /><br />But Chris can't let this affect him, as it would most. He has a son to look after. So he signs up for the internship. As he deals with all of these other problems, he also has to study and learn all about his new job. "Pursuit" piles on the challenges and the few moments Chris is able to spend with his young son are filled with moments of "divine insight". Chris imparts one helpful comment after another, determined his son will not suffer the same mistakes he has made. "Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something."<br /><br />The problem with "Pursuit" is two-fold. Because there is not suspense about whether he will get the job, we must be content with the depiction of the struggle. And how he struggles. One obstacle after another is thrown at him. This presents the second problem. Chris Gardner is so saintly, his character has no evolution or change at all. He starts out a good father and ends the film as a good father. He is a saint and the film knows it. At one point, when Chris and Christopher are sleeping in a homeless shelter run by a church, `poppa' moves to a darkened corner to work on his last medical device; the device is broken and he needs to fix it before he can sell it. When he manages to fix it, a brilliant white light emanates from the machine and the film moves away to a long shot, to show the light emanating from Chris' center, the center of his very being. If you look at the poster for this film, you may notice that a light obscures where Smith is holding his son's hand. Chris is a martyr who will do anything for the betterment of his son's life.<br /><br />Every year, a number of fine actors and actresses are nominated for an Academy Award. If you do a survey, you will find that an inordinate amount of these nominations went to actors who portray handicapped people of one type or another. And a large number of winners have played these roles. It also helps if a pretty or handsome actor takes on the role, to `show their range'. In "Pursuit", Chris Gardner has a handicap of sorts; a phenomenal lack of good decision making skills. From marrying Linda and having a son with her, to spending his life savings on the medical devices, from asking a hippie to safeguard one of the machines while he has an interview, to chasing a homeless man through BART to retrieve one of those heavy medical devices, Chris never makes the right decision. Yet, he perseveres. And the moment when Chris gets the job with Dean Witter is an emotional one. Maybe Smith does deserve a nomination for making this performance work.<br /><br />"Pursuit" doesn't seem to believe anyone has more than one facet to their character. Chris is good. Linda is bad. Thandie Newton's Linda does nothing but complain, act sullen, put out and annoyed, grudgingly kissing her son and husband. Believe me, she has every right to be this way, but because Chris is so saintly, we look at Linda as a shrew. She has to work two shifts? Look at how this man has struggled to sell these machines all over the Bay Area, lugging the heavy machines on multiple buses and through crowded BART trains. How dare she complain, even though Chris created the problem by not paying his parking tickets. When she walks out, the film wants us to have no sympathy for her, Chris is the saint in this picture and he must have the sympathy.<br /><br />All of the people who Chris comes into contact with are either good or meant to provide comic relief. He has an encounter with a hippy and another with a crazy homeless man, but all of the partners at Dean Witter are supportive and encouraging. Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer and many other characters on "The Simpsons") plays Alan Frakesh, the office manager who runs the intern training program. Chris becomes his errand boy and Alan unknowingly threatens some of the deals Chris is working on. But this character goes nowhere. Because he `unknowingly' threatens these deals, he is still `good'. And he doesn't provide enough comic relief to make the role interesting.<br /><br />Jaden Smith is okay as Christopher. He's no Tatum O'Neal, but he's not as precocious as some child actors. Most of his scenes require him to do little more than display one emotion, and he does this well. In some, he is mopey, in others, happy. Hopefully, his adult life won't mirror the daughter of Ryan O'Neal's either.<br /><br />"The Pursuit of Happyness" is meant to be an inspiring holiday tale, designed to move people to tears as they watch Chris Gardner's struggle. But it is such a calculated piece of filmmaking that it was difficult for me to watch. It doesn't help that many of the moments between Chris and Christopher are punctuated by dialogue that seems ingested from every single self help book ever written. Hopefully, Dr. Phil is getting a royalty.<br /><br />I cry when I watch "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" and "Pursuit" didn't move me that much.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"The Pursuit of Happiness" tells the story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a lower middle class black man whose dream of prosperity is evaporating. He and his wife invested heavily in a portable bone densitometer, but sales are horrible and the family is just a step ahead of eviction. Slowly but surely, Chris loses nearly everything, until he is left almost literally with nothing but his young son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) and the clothes on his back. By luck, he connects with a group of E.F. Hutton employees and starts a long and uncertain trip out of his predicament.<br /><br />The film does a phenomenal job of communicating just how difficult it can be to rise from the margins, even if one is talented and ambitious. Gardner must feed and house his son while studying for a soul-crushing investment exam, showing up to work fresh every day and managing child care. The difficulties he faces are enormous and daunting, and would have deterred many a less hardy soul.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />But from a filmic perspective, there were problems. How many close calls can a viewer endure without getting irritated? And using the name of a real investment firm pretty much gives away the ending. Then too, there was the lack of emotional intensity between the characters, with the exception of Jaden, who was delightful and real throughout. One had to wonder as well about the likelihood that a man who washed himself in subway bathrooms could be fresh -- both mentally and aromatically - every day for months. And without once cutting corners in the childcare area.<br /><br />"Pursuit of Happiness" is a fine movie that depicts the experience of individuals who are dogged about achieving their dreams. But it does so at the cost of its own integrity, shortchanging the damage that such a pursuit, no matter how well-motivated, has on those around them. By the end of the film, I was unconvinced by Chris Gardner's sterling character and mistrustful of the depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Will Smith is the main reason I went to see this film.  He stars as Chris Gardner.  Back in 1981, his life was hard.  His girlfriend/wife (I've heard both, and the movie never makes it clear) is working double shifts to support the two of them and their son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  Chris, meanwhile, is working as hard has he can to sell bone density machines.  He's already bought them, so he needs to sell them to get his life savings back.<br /><br />One day, he happens to meet a successful stock broker.  Chris is fascinated by the wealth this guy has, so he begins to pursue it as a new career, not knowing all the stress that is involved.  He learns of an internship offered by Dean Witter, and tries to get into the program despite his lack of formal education.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his life is going downhill.  His landlord is tired of waiting for the rent and his wife decides to leave for New York.  Can he balance being a single dad with a spot in this competitive internship?<br /><br />The first strike against the movie is the trailer.  That's right.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen this movie.  I half expected that when I went to see it, so that's not my main complaint.<br /><br />I went to the film expecting an inspiring true story.  I got a true story.  While the theme "If you work hard, you can accomplish anything" does come out, the movie focuses on all the struggles.  It got depressing long before the end with very little to balance it out.<br /><br />And, of course, there are Chris's actions.  While I did spend most of the film rooting for him to succeed, there were times it was hard.  He risked too much since he had to care for his son.  And he didn't seem to be able to keep track of his machines either.<br /><br />What I can't fault is Will Smith's performance.  He is a powerful actor who does an excellent job bringing Chris to life.  Jaden Smith does a decent job playing the son, he good but certainly not the next big child star.  Their bond was touching and provided some of the lighter moments.<br /><br />I really had looked forward to this movie, but in the end was highly disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>so pursuit of happiness actually means pursuit of the dollar $$$$ sign. the i or y is not important. the correct spelling of happiness should be HAPPINE$$. but if you got mucho $$$$, don't let IRS, the real DEVIL that bible never told you clearly but definitely beyond god's control, pursuit you. because the pursuit of your $$$$ is the only happiness of the IRS.<br />will smith & son both wonderfully played the roles this movie should have. will smith definitely should be nominated as one of the best actors for an oscar. it's a very sad movie. and from the very beginning to the end, about 99% of the movie was so sad and devastate. it's not easy to watch along.<br />why the fox cried when the rabbit died? why i couldn't help thinking of those of my overdue monthly payments when i watched this movie? why i couldn't help thinking that within another month, i've got to pay income tax again, yet there's no money in my bank accounts, and i couldn't barely pay all the regular bills come every month?  where's the $$$$? where's my happiness?<br />so after six months' internship struggle, this guy finally became the chosen one and started to get paid with $$$$, so his happiness henceforth started, and once he successfully got $$$$, he got the happiness. there's nothing new there. because MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING, IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT EQUALS HAPPINE$$!<br />why everytime when i walked out onto the parking lot, my eyes always looked down and searched every corner? yeah, i remembered that i've found $20.00 bill in some parking lot long time ago and i was so happy. since then every time when i was on any parking lot, i was always in pursuit of happiness. but so far no luck.....</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Pursuit of Happiness  (DVD)<br /><br />Pursuit of Happiness starring Will Smith and Will Smith's real life son is so boring that I couldn't finish watching it and I don't understand all the hype.

There are no significant flaws which threaten to ruin the movie.<br /><br />Turning to the story itself, as most people know, this movie is "inspired by a true story" involving a man who faces enormous financial hardships, to the point where he and his son wind up homeless.  The problems he encounters are so relentless that it becomes almost too painful to watch.  But he's gifted at math, has good interpersonal skills, and works incredibly hard, so he eventually winds up with a nice job in a San Francisco financial firm, and later goes on to start his own firm and become a multi-millionaire.<br /><br />A story like this will naturally appeal to an American audience because it taps in to the meritocratic notion that the American dream is accessible to most of us if we're willing to work hard and make sacrifices.  But we can question how much this moving and inspiring story can really serve as a model for the masses.  I would say not much.  In a country of 300 million people, you'll always be able to find stories like this, but they're the exception, not the norm, and of course that's what makes this story worthy of a movie.  Moreover, the main character clearly had abilities and a work ethic far beyond the norm, so it took very special strengths to prevail over such especially bad luck.  But I do think this story illustrates the upper limits of what's possible, and most people can draw the lesson that working hard will still provide at least some benefit, even if the benefit falls short of one's ultimate dreams.<br /><br />Another lesson which is perhaps equally important is that children may value and need our love and attention more than the material resources we can provide.  That's certainly the case in this story, and I suspect that this can be generalized to most children.  Something to consider for dads (and moms) who are preoccupied with putting in long hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone looking for an uplifting story, even if few people can replicate an ending as happy as this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"The Pursuit Of Happyness" is an emotionally enriching cinematic experience.  It's basically a tribute to the pursuing one's dreams despite the obstacles that are thrown in front of you and perservering in the end.  Will Smith's Chris Gardner is an industrious chap with a lot of charm and savvy but suffers from a little misdirection.  He begins the film peddling around San Francisco doctor's offices bone density scanners.  This venture doesn't make him rich so he soon sets his goal on an internship with Dean Witter for a one-in-twenty shot at being a stockbroker.  There are many pitfalls to attaining his dream.  His wife recently left him with a five year old son to fend for.  The internship is unpaid.  He's evicted from a number of domiciles and at times forced to live in shelters and public bathrooms.  Racism isn't really cited as a reason for Chris' predicament but there are subtle hints like when Dean Witter's instructor forces Chris to park his car.  Despite it all Chris never wavers from his determination.  Credit Will Smith for giving a full-bodied portrait of a man who wants his piece of the American Pie.  Not to give anything away, the look on the face of Chris as he meets with the Dean Witter executives toward the films end will bring out the tear ducts.  Jaden Smith, Will's real life son and his son in the film, gives a naturally charming and unaffected performance.  "The Pursuit of Happyness" should soon be a bona fide word-of-mouth classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This story from the heart shows the triumph of the human spirit.

His life hit the doldrums when his wife left him, and he has to take care of his young son. Soon he is evicted from his house and has to sleep with his son in a public bathroom (and later on homeless shelters). A small light at the end of the tunnel appears when he is accepted as an unpaid intern at a stock brokerage firm - he is one of 20 such interns, and only one will be chosen after six months to join the company in a lucrative job. Meanwhile, he has to make ends meet with his young son as he best can, facing debts, evictions, bills, etc. Some people criticize the movie as being too pro capitalist. There is some truth to that, as the rich guys who head the stock brokerage firm are shown to be all nice men, while the poor (with the exception of Chris) are bitter, resentful, unhappy with their lives. Yet, the movie also shows realistically what is to be a poor man in America as very few Hollywood movies do. All in all, a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Life isn't easy.  Life is incredibly difficult.  It's full of challenges and obstacles.  On each one of our individual journeys there are thousands of things that can happen to knock us off our feet and set us back hundreds of paces.  It can be really frustrating and confusing.  Yet, the trials of life shouldn't be an excuse for giving up.  We can move forward towards "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."  That's what Chris Gardner did.<br /><br />THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an inspiring movie about some of the events in Gardner's life and how he was able to overcome them.  Gardner (played by Will Smith) was a struggling salesman of portable bone density scanners.  He used his life savings to pay for the venture and it was a costly mistake, but Gardner didn't give up.  He was determined to work the pavement, going from one medical office to another until he sold every last unit and could move on to better things.  His wife is unhappy in their marriage, his car has been possessed by the City of San Francisco, and they are almost three months behind due on their rent.  In this desperate time Gardner becomes inspired to apply for an internship at a major stock brokerage firm.  He impresses the employers and is offered the competitive internship, only to discover that it's a six month unpaid internship.  Determined to change things around, Gardner takes the position.  His wife leaves and Gardner is left to raise their son alone.  Together the father and son struggle as they are evicted from one place and another, homelessness, an auto accident, tax seizure, and mediocre child care all in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of America's great actors.  He can do drama, action, comedy, romance, and just about any other genre and not just do it, but do it well.  In this film he is joined by his own son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, portraying Gardner's son, Christopher.  Will Smith and Jaden must have a strong relationship and it comes across in the movie.  The real-life relationship between the film's stars helps ground the movie even more.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS.  The movie seemed real and true. Unlike many inspirational stories and biopics I've seen, it wasn't an over-sentimental, mushy, feel-good fluffy film.  Instead, to me, I felt like I was watching a few chapters from the biography of someone's life; a person who had overcome some incredible odds.  I also enjoyed the strong relationship displayed between Gardner and Christopher.  So often in movies, even ones based on real people, children neglect their parents and parents neglect their children.  That wasn't the case in this film.  It's nice for a change to watch a movie that shows a deep and strong relationship between a father and his son.  Now, that's inspirational.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>When Oprah Winfrey interviewed the real Christopher Gardner, I found his story absolutely amazing, more so than the film adaptation of his life, "The Pursuit of Happyness." There are many things to appreciate about this kind of film: it's an inspiring Rags to Riches story with a main character who must overcome adversity if he's to succeed. It also reinforces a number of life lessons that many have yet to learn. However, something different needed to be done if the intention was to actually impress me; yes, this film is inspiring, but so is "Working Girl," "Cinderella Man," and "Erin Brockovich." This kind of film has been made many, many times before, and frankly, it's getting tiresome.<br /><br />So why am I giving it four stars? I suppose because, as worn out and cliched as this story is, it at least has some decent performances and a good message. And it delivers exactly as you expect it to: if you want a feel good film, you've got a feel good film. I'm sure those of you who aren't as jaded as I am will be reduced to tears by the plight of Gardner, played in the film by Will Smith. He overcomes a number of difficult circumstances, ones that many wouldn't be able to handle if they were in his place. Living in San Francisco in 1981, Gardner tried his hand at selling bulky bone density machines to hospitals, thinking that such a technology would be preferred over traditional x-rays. Unfortunately, most of the hospitals considered them to be unnecessary luxuries and weren't willing to invest.<br /><br />As a result of slow business, Gardner and his family are in a financial crisis: their rent is months overdue; they owe the IRS; and they can't rely solely on the wife's income. How fortuitous that he should pass a man getting out of his Ferrari. "What do you do and how do you do it?" asks Gardner. "I'm a stockbroker," replies the man, pointing to the building they're both standing next to. He also says that you don't necessarily have to go to college to be a stockbroker; you only need to be good with numbers and good with people. This inspires Gardner to apply for the internship program at Dean Witter. He's offered a position (aided by his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube). Despite the fact that he'll receive no salary, and despite the fact that he's down on his luck, he accepts the offer, believing that if he can work through the internship, something better will come along.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's too little too late in terms of his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton). Years of financial strain have pushed her to the breaking point, and she decides to leave for New York. Of course, she wants to take their five-year-old son, Chris, Jr. (played by Smith's real life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), but both she and Gardner know that she can't care for him. Thus, Chris is left with his father. This suits Gardner just fine; early on, his voiceover narration says that he didn't meet his real father until he was twenty-six, and that no matter what, he would make sure his children knew who their father was.<br /><br />For most of the rest of the film, it seems as if everything will continue to go downhill. For one thing, he can no longer afford to pay his rent, meaning he has to leave his apartment. He and his son move into a local motel, where he pays half of what he paid for rent. But then the IRS finally catches up with him, taking over six hundred dollars out of his bank account. He's left with just over twenty dollars, which is not nearly enough to pay for their room. This paves the way for one of the film's more devastating scenes; with nowhere else to go for the night, they lock themselves in a subway bathroom. The impact of the scene is heightened by the fact that someone continuously rattles the door on the other end.<br /><br />The effectiveness of this scene depended on its originality. I say this because the rest of the film is unflatteringly run of the mill. At one point, when shooting hoops with his son, Gardner says, "Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You want something, you go for it, period." It's a fine sentiment, certainly, but haven't we heard such sentiments before? And consider the character of Alan Frakesh (Dan Castellaneta), the Dean Witter employee who trains the new interns; while he never talks down to Gardner, he does ask him to do degrading menial tasks, such as getting him coffee, buying him donuts, and re-parking his car to avoid the street sweepers. I can't help but wonder if he was included merely as a counterpoint to Gardner's good spirit; are villains of these kind required in such films?<br /><br />Nonetheless, I was moved by Gardner's tenacity, which is another reason why I went ahead and gave the film four stars. He clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word "quit," which is one of the best attitudes to have in life. Even when forced to wait in long lines to stay in homeless shelters, he refuses to settle for what he has been dealt. He's determined to make a better life for himself and his son, which is difficult considering Chris, Jr. doesn't completely understand what his father is going through. He's merely a boy of five, with a basketball, a little multicolored backpack, and a Captain America figurine in his possession. There's no denying that the kid is as cute as a button, which is probably what enabled me to look past the heavy-handedness of his line, "You're a good papa."<br /><br />I don't think there's any question of whether or not Gardner overcomes adversity; the real life Christopher Gardner is now a multimillionaire in his own firm. The fact that he succeeded clearly makes his story inspiring, and for that, I'm recommending "The Pursuit of Happyness." Still, I got the sense that this film adaptation altered the story to make it more appealing for a mass audience, which resulted in a number of tried and true elements that have long since worn out their welcome. It can't be a good thing when a five-minute segment on "Oprah" is more interesting than a two-hour film; Gardner told Oprah his childhood Christmas Day experience. While he was taking a bath, his abusive stepfather stormed in, held a gun at him, and told him to get out of the apartment. Naked and wet, Gardner was left outside on a freezing December night. That kind of material would have made more of an impact than the material in "The Pursuit of Happyness" did. Unfortunately, I'm forced to settle for yet another feel good tearjerker.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is the story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) and the difficulties in his life prior to "making it".  His wife Linda (played by Thandie Newton (Crash)) just can't take the hardships anymore and leaves.  Chris is left with custody of his son Christopher (played by Smith's own son Jaden Smith).<br /><br />Chris suffers through many hardships, including eviction, staying in homeless shelters, tax collectors, and being jailed overnight for parking tickets.  He still manages to hang onto his son Christopher, even through devastating privation.  Chris is intent on selling a high end but spendy bone scanner machine to the medical community, but when his opportunity comes up to make a bid at becoming an employee of Dean Witter, he decides to go for it despite the unpaid time and attention it will take from his despairing life.<br /><br />Chris obtains a one in a lifetime shot, by hard work alone, to obtain the position he dreamed of.  But as one other reviewers put it, we never get the chance to see Chris on the high end of his hard work.  The movie would have been better if it had shown the results of Chris's dedication and determination.  Instead, we're left in the darkness of his becoming, with a few on-screen announcements intended to satisfy our need for closure of Chris's troubles.<br /><br />While very well done, the movie only earns three stars from me because of the abrupt ending.  It's one thing to document someone's hardship, but if (as in real life as the movie portrays) there is a happy ending, then the movie should include the happy ending.  I didn't sit through all this anguish for nothing.  Worth a rent, it's up to you for a purchase.

After the usual hero roles playing mostly himself, Will digs deep to portray a flawed bone density scanner salesman trying to keep his family together. The scanner business is not as profitable as he imagined and after sinking all his money in a venture to sell these machines he's down to his last few machines and last few bucks, the landlord is threatening to kick them out, his wife(Thandie Newton in a finely wired performance) is at the end of her rope, his car is towed away for unpaid parking tickets, his son(played by his real-life son, Jaden Smith is in a daycare center in Chinatown where he mostly watches tv). Can it get any worse? It does. This film does not pull any punches or play it for cheap maudlin sentiment, you take this man's journey and you feel his angst, disappoinment's and eventual joy. When you are down and out and everything is going wrong, hang on and never let go, Chris Gardner's life is an example of what perserverance can pay off. The man is now a multi-millionaire. I loved this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>This film is based on Chris Gardner's autobiography ... it is a true-story. Sooo ...<br /><br />Ignore the one and two-star ratings which claim this film is "depressing." Foremost, the film is uplifting ... it is (forgive the cliche) a film which clearly illustrates the "triumph of the human spirit." It would have been a gross-misstep to "downplay" Gardner's challenges and hardships: this is what makes the ending as powerful as it is. Moreover, this film underscores that which is all-too-overlooked in our society: the unconditional love of a father for his child. Hollywood loves mothers, but often vilifies fathers ... it is refreshing to see a turn in the trend. And, that Will Smith's own son plays his on-screen son ... it is a tribute to fathers and sons everywhere.<br /><br />The quality of the film itself is worthy of a four or five-star rating. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting (watch for a cameo by the real Chris Gardner at the film's conclusion), and the film-extras: all are near immaculate. Hopefully, this will help allay the fears that the one and two-star ratings may have instilled. And, also allow me to say, that I am not a fan of mainstream film ... but I did enjoy this honest portrait of an incredible man.<br /><br />When you purchase this film, be certain to watch the film-extra "The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner." Though the feature-film is entirely self-contained (you do not need this documentary-short to explain any aspect of the film), it is a treat to see the real-life Chris Gardner and glean some insight into this man's commitment to attaining the "American Dream" for his son (which was still possible in '81).<br /><br />For a bit of fun, also check-out the extra "Inside the Rubik's Cube." You will be stunned to see what a cult-phenomenon this "toy" remains even today!!<br /><br />Watch this film if you have an interest in "triumph over adversity," 1980's culture, or the oft-maligned, very-necessary role of fathers in our life.<br /><br />Suggested Reading: Gardner, Chris.

I won't lie but I cried at the end; I was really rooting for him big time. the son was darn good; he was truly good and I am sorry that Will didn't win the award though this year the award for Best Actor was pretty challenging; Nevertheless, the film is worth the price of admission and more and good for those times when you feel your on your last leg.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Smith is a gifted actor, and this film really showcases his emotional range. His natural rapport with his son is in no way one-sided; Jaden Smith is believable and very charming. Certainly, the audience can feel secure that Chris Gardner, the main character, will succeed in some fashion or else a film would never have been based on his autobiography, but the simple, sentimental score, well-written screenplay, subtle direction and, above all, Will Smith's acting make us strive with Gardner, cry with him, and hurt with him.<br /><br />Gardner's tale is like "Die Hard" for the masses; he has to endure being arrested, being evicted, fighting for a bed at the homeless shelter, trying to keep appointments and to study while holding down two full-time jobs with no car, sprinting all over San Francisco, attempting to keep himself and his son clean--it just does not stop. Watch Smith's face during the film--he shows us a man who only just manages to fend off despair. He bleeds and weeps because of the injustice in the world, with disappointment at how his potential has been wasted, with the weight of all his past failures, and with worry for his son. But he clings to the path he has chosen in the belief that it will lead him from this torment. One can actually see the dead look in Smith's eyes, the punch-drunk expression of one who is suffering, who is juggling so many burdens that his mind spills over with the effort, for whom a seemingly minor setback is a Big Deal. Smith gets it, and he makes us get it, too.<br /><br />Incidentally, he could probably have been a stuntman or a professional athlete. He has had running scenes in many of his films to date, and in this movie he looks ready to set a new record for the 400 meters. Smith is a little too fit and energetic for a homeless guy who hardly sleeps and eats in a soup kitchen for much of the movie, but his running and carrying feats illustrate Gardner's bulldog tenacity, and how his own physical power and endurance aided him in achieving his ends. All I have to say is this movie is one of the best this year. I couldn't believe how good Will Smith did in this film. I also couldn't imagine a bone density scanner salesman lived a part of his life this way. Sleeping in a bathroom at a Subway station! On top of toilet paper! It made me feel good that I sleep in a bed at night! I do hope with an inspiring story like this, that he claims any upcoming awards.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>As a big Will Smith fan, I was hoping for a great performance by the actor in "The Pursuit of Happyness".  In "Men in Black", "Enemy of the State", and "I, Robot" Smith delivered amazing performances.  In "Ali", "Bad Boys II", and "Wild Wild West", Smith not only delivered lackluster performances, but he chose scripts that really failed to deliver anything worth the price of admission.  But this film, this absolute brilliant masterpiece of movie making creativity, deserves a whole lot of recognition!<br /><br />  "The Pursuit of Happyness" is one of the most "real-to-life" movies to come around in a while.  The script is energetic, interesting, and smart; the acting is second to none; and the performance Will Smith turns in is without a doubt his best work to date.<br /><br />  This is the kind of movie that can inspire people to see past their struggles and look toward the light at the end of the tunnel.  People who are going through financial, spiritual, and mental struggles need a film like "The Pursuit of Happyness" to remind them that lots of people have struggled, are struggling, and will struggle to be the best they can be in life.<br /><br />  Will Smith (playing the role of Chris Gardner) and his on screen wife, Linda (played by Thandie Newton), are exceptionally convincing as two parents trying to make things work when everything in their lives seems to be falling apart.  Smith is stunningly realistic as a man just about to go over the deep end as life throws him as many punches as his Ali character actually took in the boxing ring.  Some of the scenes where Smith and Newton are verbally jousting looked as if a physical confrontation was about to come to fruition, but it doesn't.<br /><br />  Smith had to rely on every single emotion, physical characteristics of humans, and making another person's story appear as his own to pull this film off.  This is his crowning achievement as far as this critic is concerned.  Much like Val Kilmer could make movies from now until the day he is unable to act and never be able to top his performance as Doc Holiday in the movie "Tombstone", Will Smith may never be able to rise above his accomplishments in this performance.<br /><br />  Jaden Smith plays the part of Christopher (Chris Gardner's son) and is just as convincing as his real life father throughout the entire film.  The two work magic on the big screen.  And as much as I don't get into the whole put-a-cute-kid-in-a-movie-and-you-can't-lose philosophy, Jaden Smith is a kid you just can't help but enjoy seeing say predictable things in the movie.  The kid doesn't overact at all.  That's a big plus for a film like this, where it is based on a true story.<br /><br />  Brian Howe (playing the part of Jay Twistle) is great as the man who gives Gardner his first big shot at a more positive future.  His fascination with the Rubik's Cube while riding in a taxi, Gardner begging him for a chance at becoming a stockbroker, is a scene I won't soon forget.  Two men in a taxi, trying to solve Rubik's Cube, with one of the men trying to find a way to solve the puzzle of his own life, and one man not even realizing the desperation that was riding beside him in the taxi; now that's irony.  Isn't that exactly what causes a lot of the pain we see in the world today - the lack of one group of humans to see the needs and thoughts of another group of humans?<br /><br />  Will Smith is a great actor, and he seems like a genuinely good person with a great future.  He is not your typical Hollywood Big Head, with the all the superstar baggage we see with most of the Hollywood elite.  The main character in this movie seems like the best example of what Smith's real life integrity is like; and it's a good statement!  I wish Smith and his family all the best!  Thanks for working so hard on this film.<br /><br />  If you are reading this review and trying to decide if "The Pursuit of Happiness" is a movie worth seeing, just ask yourself if you are interested in the story of human struggle.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest you see this film.<br /><br />  See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>The Pursuit of Happyness has to be seen, cause its a real story about<br /><br />real people.  When Will Smith decided to tackle this one, we would hear<br /><br />many facts about  Chris Gardner and when i watched the movie anticipating<br /><br />what i heard, some things that should have been in the movie were not included in the movie. I did'nt mind that. But then they end the movie after seeing  Chris Gardner in hard times most of the movie,we dont get  the satisfaction to see any glimpse of him in happier time after<br /><br />succeeding at what he worked soo hard....hey we just wanted a few minutes, but they slapped on the end of the movie with a few words...<br /><br />Movie is a must .....but i find the quick ending a shot below the belt for<br /><br />us viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Will Smith gives a stinging performance. Very heartfelt and compelling. This is one amazing film. this acting once again is flawless in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>We are not used to seeing Will Smith playing the father taking care of his son alone. Especially in his world under Reagan. He lost his wife, then his apartment, then a second apartment, then he had to go to homeless people's shelters, with his son mind you, sleep in BART toilets, with his son mind you, work like hell to get a new profession in the world of finance, go on selling some of the medical machines he was selling before to just make ends meet, to avoid the worst possible, losing his child, his son. And he manages to keep his cool, to remain friendly with everyone, even those who obviously exploit him, and he proves himself and he gets the job, one out of twenty. The whole film is dominated by a quotation from the Declaration of Independence, the "pursuit of happyness". And this pursuit is a real chase but a chase that does not so much take place outside, because outside it is a hunt not for happiness but for the game that is homeless, defenseless, out of luck and deprived of the minimum. But the chase, and the pursuit, is in one's mind first and foremost. If you are not free in your mind, if you have no project and if you do not have the motivation and the determination to get it going, you will not overcome the difficulties life will bring. Though I think this is true for everyone, that motivation and determination are the basic qualities you need to get anywhere in life, the end result will be quite different and vary a lot according to the point where you started and the opportunities that will come along across your own path and that you will be able to catch. We definitely are equal potentially, but the end results of people in their lives vary tremendously and then at this point equality is no longer the main characteristic. That makes the film slightly sad. For one financial success, how many meager survivals?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Will Smith stars with his son Jaden in this true story about going for it all when life seems like it is giving you no opportunity at all.<br /><br />Chris Gardner was always working to make it selling medical equipment which he acquired out of his own pocket to sell to small Doctors offices.  His family life is in shambles and he is really going nowhere with a son who is caught between Gardner and his ex.  Gardner thinks about an opportunity he hears of working for an investment firm as an intern and he goes for it.<br /><br />He faces many challenges while attempting to even get into the program, where only one person of all who go through it are selected.  The premise of the movie, is that we in the USA have the right to pursue happiness.  It is not a given.  Carter worked to pursue what would make him happy and this movie is even a way to give back.<br /><br />You will see some of the actual areas where Carter actually operated, even the homeless shelter is the actual one where he stayed eeking out a living.  (The DVDs features will tell you a whole lot more about that that is even touching just by itself.)<br /><br />This is a movie about winning in life, and mostly, not giving up when things seem the worst.  I could name a cliche or two, but really, this man applied what it took for him to be a success, and Smith really delivers.<br /><br />I cannot understand the one and two star votes here.  This is a movie of meaning and Smith does an outstanding performance.  Get Pursuit of Happyness, you just might learn something.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, "The Pursuit of Happyness" features Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a struggling San Francisco medical equipment salesman beset with financial problems.  Tired of the struggle, his wife moves out and leaves him with their little boy.  As they spiral down the financial shaft, they are reduced to sleeping in homeless shelters and in subway bathrooms.<br /><br />Gardner lands an unpaid internship to become a Dean Witter stockbroker.  Juggling the demands of fatherhood, keeping financial wolves at bay, selling his remaining inventory of bone density scanners and cracking the books to become a broker, Smith's character pursues his vision like one who has run out of alternatives.<br /><br />Yes, it's a bit hokey and at times requires you to swallow the implausible, but this is an uplifting film that can inspire you to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, The Pursuit of Happyness (which stars Will Smith and his actual son Jaden) is about Chris Gardner. Chris is a smart, capable guy, but he's gotten himself into a bad situation. He sunk his life savings into selling bone density scanners, which don't seem to be moving very quickly. And his girlfriend Linda (played by Thandie Newton, looking as bad as a person that gorgeous can look), who's been working double shifts to make ends meet, gets fed up. She's going to leave him and take the kid, but Chris won't let her. So she leaves him AND the kid. Here's where things get interesting. In an effort to better their situation, Chris applies for a competitive broker internship. He's learned that out of a pool of 20 interns, only one will be offered a job at the end of the six-month program. He gets the internship. Problem? It's unpaid.<br /><br />So, Chris has to start selling some scanners, FAST. He has moderate success, but there are still times when the father/son team is living pretty close to the bone. During some scenes, such as when the little family finds itself homeless for a while, I almost cried. These are the kinds of characters I can root for. Chris is doing everything possible to keep body and soul together and make a future for himself and his son. And sometimes, it still isn't enough. But the guy just won't give up. He powers through the worst of circumstances. He puts a brave face on for his kid. He keeps his wits about him. He doesn't cave. You gotta love a guy like that.<br /><br />Will Smith is great in this. He must have gotten in awesome shape, too, because he spends alot of the movie in a flat-out run. (Talk about hustle.) And Jaden is adorable. His sweet, soft little-boy face. His good nature. His ultimate trust in his dad (on screen and off). A totally effortless performance, it was perfect for this movie. You will love this kid.<br /><br />I recommend The Pursuit of Happyness. And if you're a parent, I doubly recommend it. It's absolutely inspirational.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>We all struggle at some point in our lifes. This movie is based on the true story of Chris Gardner, a salesman, that went from selling medical scanners to being a stock broker for Dean Witter. That of course is not the amazing part of the story. The true test he endured was managing to raise a son while he was flat broke and chasing down his stolen scanners. Will Smith gives a dramatic performance that will not easily be bested by others that have done them so well. He obviously reached down deep to pull up a true understanding of suffering as a poor father that would give anything to provide for his family. Thandie Newton turns in a wonderful performance as his wife and Janden Smith does a fine job as his son. This movie takes us along with a father from the brink of disaster to the heights of joy and happiness. Keep the Kleenex handy. Good quality DVD with a few standard extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>This movie has got to be one of the best 117 minutes to spend with. Will Smith delivers in this movie on the true story of Chris Gardner, a man in 1981 with a prospect of an uncertain future in San Francisco after his wife leaves him to raise their only child. It's a movie that features a roller coaster of emotions for those who watch it. It's refreshing to know that there is a positive ending to this true life story of a man who was an unpaid intern for a brokerage firm and later became a success story on Wall Street! Highly recommended film for everyone!</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Will and Jaden Smith do a lovely job here, with the former playing against type and the latter making a nice debut in a very natural, unprecocious way.  I could have done without some of the more obvious, in-your-face stuff about pursuing happiness and the haves versus have-nots, but these are minor quibbles.  You really feel for Chris Gardner as he tries to make enough money to keep his son in day care, feed himself, and still train as an investment intern.<br />  Wow...you know you've really hit rock bottom if you and your kid have to sleep on t.p. on the floor of a bathroom in a subway station.  So sad.  I would have cried too.</p></br></body></html>

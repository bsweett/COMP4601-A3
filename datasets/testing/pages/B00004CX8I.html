Right when you think it's safe to laugh, you find yourself sitting on the sofa in complete shock. There are many elements to this film and they are all entwined perfectly.<p>Nicholson plays an eccentric who is forced to stay at a psych ward. It's there that he begins to make his co-nutties feel a little bit better about themselves. He ends up becoming the nemesis of the head nurse, and she counters by making his life a living hell. The end of the film will shock you and make you feel resentment towards the authorities in the hospital. <p>This film has a great message, humor, a high shock value, and Jack Nicholson at his very best. You cannot go wrong with this film, one of my personal all time favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>though i'm not that big on Nicholson as i once was this film has held up remarkable well.very solid story&amp;direction.a must see&amp;have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson was born to play this role, a rebel incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital who realizes he won't get out at the end of his 'jail sentence' because he was committed, i.e., he didn't enter voluntarily - so he's stuck there until the high mucky-mucks determine that he's "cured." Nicholson is not the kind of guy to play by the rules, not even to get out of this place, and the more he acts out against the cold attitude of the authorities (Nurse Ratched, in particular, whose name has become synonymous with cruel and implacable persons in authority), the more his fate is sealed.<br />This fantastic movie, which swept the 1976 Oscars in every main category, is based on Milos Forman's book of the same name. Like the book, the film is filled with memorable characters, and it's hard to believe that they're even acting. In many places, the movie takes on the feel of a documentary; it's that realistic and well-acted.<br />An iconic and classic movie that will last forever. Its themes are timeless and universal: one man's reaction (with courage, pride, stubbornness, and sacrifice) to a repressive institution .<br />Marvelous. Ten stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>This movie is one of the best films that emerged from the 1970s decade, &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; ranks in the same level of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot; among other films from that great movie era. The performance that Jack Nicholson delivered is absolutely brilliant, he created a charismatic and free spirited character.<br /><br /> Louise Fletcher (as nurse Mildred Ratched) gave another incredible performance that results in one of best movie nemesis of all time, a low-key, dominating character. The support cast is also excellent, it features enjoyable characters played by solid actors such as Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Will Sampson.<br /><br /> This movie is a great combination of drama, satire and comedy, the film can make the audience laugh in one scene, and cry in the next one. The director of the movie, Milos Forman did a great job with the entire cast, Forman helped every actor to produce genuine feelings and emotions in front of the cameras.<br /><br /> This is the kind of movie that you can see year after year, and enjoy it every time and discover something new. &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; should be in every movie fan collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>We are expecting Jack Nicholson and we have Jack Nicholson. The film is great in itself to show how psychiatric hospitals are prisons, even voluntary prisons, when patients are made to believe that they are not ready to leave and go back home. It is also great to show how the patients become dependent on the hospital, the medication, the treatment and the personnel by being deprived of all control over their life or lives. They cannot decide anything, even by voting, even by having a majority in that vote. The personnel is ready to make the beds and the chairs vote in order for the patients not to have a majority. Even the simple things like cigarettes, television, card games or even taking a nap at will are denied or rationed to the patients and they become at least social vegetables, and at times physical vegetables. Jack Nicholson arrives in there as a tornado and creates havoc. He is absolutely perfect for the part, maybe because he plays a part he knows perfectly well, or maybe even because he plays his own personal part. And of course the system defends itself, lobotomizes Jack Nicholson and everything goes back to normal.<p>But the film is a metaphor of America, because only one will escape this hell : the Indian, who made everyone believe he was deaf and dumb. Indians are reduced to silence. But he escapes because he is stronger than anyone else, which means that he stayed because his world had disappeared, because his civilization had been destroyed. But he escapes and runs away across the countryside at dawn. This is in itself the central metaphor of the film : to be free you have to escape this society. To be free an Indian has to escape this white prison. But he escapes into a vast prairie, the vast prairie, and he runs away into that prairie in some surreal light : this is of course a metaphor of death and paradise for Indians. Hence there is no escape except into accepting imprisonment and being locked up in silence, or into death and eternal life that is nothing else but death after all.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" (1975) is on every list of favorite films. It was the first film since "It Happened One Night" (1934) to win all five of the top Academy Awards, for best picture, actor (Nicholson), actress (Louise Fletcher), director (Milos Forman) and screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).Roger Ebert<br /><br />The film, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is based on Ken Kesey's 1962 best-selling novel, "contained the prophetic essence of the whole Vietnam period of revolutionary politics going psychedelic", as stated by Pauline Kael.<br /><br />The movie's portrays a simple approach.  Mcmurphy reminds me of my best friend, a free spirit in a closed system. The free spirit in this case is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is one of the high points in his career. Jack is a beloved star, an actor who is male.  He gets away with things because he knows how to.<br /><br />Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, plays an inflexible woman and nurse. She must be in control of everything and everybody.<br /><br />"The film is known as an anti-establishment parable, but achieves its success by deliberately choosing to use the mental patients as comic caricatures. This decision leads to the fishing trip, which is at once the most popular, and the most false, scene in the movie. It is McMurphy's great joyous thumb in the eye to Ratched and her kind, but the energy of the sequence cannot disguise the unease and confusion of men who, in many cases, have no idea where they are, or why." Pauline Kael<br /><br />Through-out the film I had two recurring thoughts. What is really going on in McMurphy's mind, and how much different and how much alike this mental institution is than the one where I received my mental health nursing education. In my estimation the film revolves around what McMurphy is thinking and then, how he acts out on those thoughts. The amazing reality is that the treatment works for McMurphy, who'd a thunk it? One of the last scenes where McMurphy is lying on the floor, thinking. Has he given up?  I felt a  great deal of ambivalence about him, because I did not know whether to laugh or cry.  The antagonism between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy is pa;pable. She is straight-laced, and he is a free spirit.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-08-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734079">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800124693">As Good As It Gets</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304712936">Amadeus</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST premiered on Broadway 11/13/63, had a short 82 performance run and closed on 1/25/64. Opening night cast included Kirk Douglas as R.P. McMurphy, Ed Ames as Chief Bromden, William Daniels as Dale Harding, Gerald S. O'Loughlin as Cheswick, Arlene Golonka as McMurphy's ladyfriend, Candy Star and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit.<br /><br />This film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel won Oscars for Best Picture, director Milos Forman, star Jack Nicholson, co-star Louise Fletcher and Best Screenplay. It was the first movie since Frank Capra's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GUYAZY">IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT</a> (1934) to sweep these major categories. "Cuckoo's Nest" grossed over $112 million (in 1975 dollars).<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Randle McMurphy is sent from state prison to a psych hospital for evaluation. When he bets with other patients that he can "put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet," McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such "therapies" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.<br /><br />The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the "deaf & dumb" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.9) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) - Jack Nicholson/Louise Fletcher/Will Sampson/Christopher Lloyd/Danny DeVito/Vincent Schiavelli/William Redfield/Brad Dourif/Scatman Crothers</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This lyric jag was a crude and sinister metaphor about Vietnam Hell and all the unimaginable consequences  The book was published in 1962 and reveals the distorted state of things .in those years .<br /><br />A convict -I mean an outsider- is committed to a mental institution for examination.

Very, very funny in parts, but heartbreaking, too. And Jack Nicholson is perfect in the role of McMurphy, who managed to get himself transferred from the jail to the mental hospital because he thought it would be easier. Guess again.<br /><br />The special feature material on this two-disc set helps explain why it was so very accurate. And take it from someone who has been on both sides of the keys in mental hospitals (worked in one as one of my first jobs; patient in several during my wicked hippie days), it is quite authentic. It was filmed in a real state hospital (Oregon, I think), and the actors spent a good bit of time there before they started to shoot. Also, the director was smart enough to let them ad-lib and adjust their lines and the stage direction to what they had observed of real patients in the hospital.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher, who plays Big Nurse, is just exactly the right combination of smarmy sweet and undertone of hard steel to accurately portray the sort of people who rise to positions of responsibility in such an institution. She is 100% control freak. She also knows how to twist everything to make it sound like it's the patients doing it to themselves. You want to call her evil, but you know she probably does believe that this is what is best for the patients.<br /><br />One scene that will live forever is the group session in which McMurphy discovers that all of the other patients on the ward are voluntary commitments who could leave any time they wanted. His shock at this is so heartbreaking, and he plays it perfectly.<br /><br />My favorite character is Chief, the huge native American who goes from a very convincing catatonia to McMurphy's rescuer. But don't expect a rescue scene like McMurphy has been planning. Life is too complicated for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)<br />Drama, 133 minutes<br />Directed by Milos Forman<br />Starring Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and he can pull off anything from serious drama, to horror, or even comedy. I loved his portrayal of Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets, but I think R. P. McMurphy is my favorite Nicholson character.<br /><br />McMurphy is placed in a mental institution for evaluation, but he's really just trying to avoid prison and hard work. We know that he's faking it the whole time. His fellow patients are a weird mixture of oddballs. Some are dangerous, others merely insecure. McMurphy discovers that most of the patients are there on a voluntary basis and he observes that they are no crazier than the average person on the street.<br /><br />There's a great scene when McMurphy arranges a road trip of sorts and we see how some of the others function when they are in the real world. It does raise an interesting point about mental illness. How much is a result of our environment? Can some of the problems be remedied simply by being placed in the right environment?<br /><br />The characters have plenty of depth and we gradually learn some of their hopes and fears. The best moment in the entire film involves Juicy Fruit, but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen the film. If you have, you'll know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />McMurphy is perceived as subversive and potentially dangerous. When Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) refuses to show the World Series on TV, McMurphy whips the other patients into a frenzy by acting out an imaginary game.<br /><br />The acting talent on display is seriously good. You can see early performances from the likes of Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito, as well as Brad Dourif's breakout performance as Billy.<br /><br />The film contains a lot of humor as Nicholson pushes his role to the limit, but there are sad and frightening moments included in the mix. The mood can turn from peaceful to chaotic in the blink of an eye, and reflects the true nature of mental illness. The ending is particularly moving and can be considered both hopeful and desperately sad.<br /><br />According to IMDB, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest became the first film in 41 years to sweep the major categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best (Adapted) Screenplay. The accolades were thoroughly deserved.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>This movie is an all-time classic because it retains its ability to entertain and to move its audience over the years.  It's been 30 years but this film ages very well as its theme of power corrupting and the triumph of the human will over tyranny, injustice and downright evil intentions is still relevant today.  Add that to brilliant acting by Nicholson in his best ever performance in a role that seems to have been written just for him as well as by Fletcher who is so good in her role as Nurse Ratched ("Wretched")that she ranks among the top 10 of all time villainesses or bitches you'd love to stick a knife into.  This movie serves as a great metaphor for the triumph of the underdog over absolute power given to those who abuse it.  It was literally shocking for me to see (no pun intended) just how medieval and cruel "treatment" of the insane was (and hopefully not still is) in the 60s.  Released at about the time of the end of the Vietnam war this film would have struck a chord with audiences of the time experiencing something similar in trying to overcome injustices of the powers that be as symbolised by Nixon in how absolute power almost inevitably leads to corruption and the suffering of the true innocents.  This powerful movie will always be among my all-time favourites.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this dvd version is very poor as the picture quality has many imperfections such as white spots having not been restored and barely rises above VHS quality.  The sound quality is also poor having not been remastered.  My advice is to give this version a miss and to wait for a well restored and remastered version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options as well as good Special Features to surface either in the standard or in the new Blu-ray formats.  Surely a classic like this deserves a lot better than this poor quality dvd version.<br /><br />Updated 27 June 2011: 4 stars<br /><br />Amazon won't let me do a separate review for this and so I'll append this here: the digibook blu-ray version of this film is certainly worth the upgrade.  The picture quality while not pristine perfect is much, much better than the dvd version I reviewed above.  The iritating white spots and other film imperfections have been removed although grain does appear at a few points throughout the film but not overly so to complain too much about.  The sound quality is also a vast improvement over the dvd coming in Dolby HD 5.1 surround although truth be told most of the sound is heavily front loaded on the original master anyway and as this film is really mostly dialogue driven the lack of true surround is not too disturbing.  The digibook itself is very nice to behold and I do confess to having a fancy for digibook blu-ray releases like this because it makes it easier for those who already have the dvd to want to double-dip.<br /><br />Undeniably great film content, vastly improved picture and sound quality and very nice digibook release makes this blu-ray release a high recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This has been buzzing around my ears among my friends and without a doubt; it is one of the best films of all time. Mixing mental health with humor is a tough brand to sell; come to fine out it took several years for this movie to be made. Kirk Douglas had bought the rights hoping to star in it himself, but struggled to find a studio who would produce it; his son Michael eventually did it, but had the foresight to stay off the screen. When you watch it, it's not hard to work out why no-one would touch it - it's subject matter was just too quirky and controversial for Hollywood in the 60s. The film was ideal for representing a burgeoning discontent with society during the post-Vietnam malaise; its audience, like its characters, was feeling enormous dissatisfaction with rules, authority, government and the stupefying way it was treating its people. No wonder that it struck such a chord with cinema-goers.<br /><br />Many liberties that we take for granted are explored within the narrative of the film: communication (in therapy sessions, where the nurse leads the discussion) freedom (during the 'escape') alcohol (during the party) sex (Billy's turn with the hooker McMurphy imports). The reactions of Nurse Ratched and the orderlies symbolize the reactions of authority when we digress from its designated path; the response of the inmates is to return to the routines and drudgery they entail. The analogy with the restrictive nature of society is glaring.<br /><br />Enter Randle McMurphy, no respecter of rules or routines, a man who is riotous but also unselfish. Brilliantly played by Jack Nicholson (a masterly piece of casting) McMurphy challenges the established norms and routines of the hospital in pursuit of fun, which irks and then aggravates Nurse Ratched. The positive impact on the other patients is clear and noticeable; it suggests that there is value in breaking away from social expectations, in being spontaneous, in occasionally pursuing personal pleasure or individual goals beyond those authority grants to you. The conclusion suggests that those in authority will do anything to silence those who challenge the social order, but that freedom *is* ultimately accessible, whether by death (McMurphy) or escape (Chief Bromden).<br /><br />Social analysis aside, the movie is great fun: there are a lot of laughs, a lot of thought-provoking moments, and a few tears. It's certainly one of the finest moments in cinematic history - it came at a time when it was drastically needed by the viewing public, but its content and themes are no less relevant and interesting to us today.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This is one of the most iconic movies of all time, sweeping the oscars and rightfully so, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is a brilliant film.  Jack Nicholson in his oscar winning performance as R.P. McMurphy chanels everything that makes Jack the actor he is for a once in a lifetime performance.  McMurphy has five accounts of assault and is facing jail time, so he decides that a term in a mental ward has got to be better than the pen, so he fakes insanity (sort-of) so he can serve his sentence in different suroundings.  Once in the door though, it's not so easy to leave again.  He has to face down Nurse Ratched (Louse Fletcher in a very tame, subdued yet powerful performance that also won her the oscar) and Nurse Ratched is not easily persuaded...just watch the debate over watching the world series.  There are many scenes in this film that are staples in movie history, many scenes that stand out as what movies are supposed to be, and the acting on all fronts is spot-on.  A young Danny DeVito plays the innocent and playful Martini, and Christopher Lloyd in his first roll plays the very memerable Taber.  But it's, of course, Jack Nicholson that steals every scene, although I have to say that Sydney Lassick as Cheswick was some very hard competition...he was perfect in his role...just watch his tantrum over cigarettes.  Anyways, this is one of those films you should be required to see, but your not so many may not have seen it...I just hope that after reading this review you'll go out and rent it ASAP.  This film is more than just a film about crazies, it's a film about responcibility and maturity, and you can see that as the film progresses and McMurphy realizes that being sane doesn't mean your being smart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>What makes One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest one of the more amazing adaptations from book to film is the superb acting and the flawless job casting the roles. Having Jack Nicholson take on the role of McMurphy, a man who tries to get out his prison term by faking being crazy, was a brilliant move, as he epitomizes the snide, sarcastic, rebellious character. Also, there are exceptional jobs done by both Brad Doriff as Billie, one of the patients in the asylum, and Louise Fletcher as the soft spoken, but superior Nurse Ratched, who butts head with McMurphy. The film also features many well-known names and faces: Danny DeVito in his film debut, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson (as "Chief").<br /><br />The film's main theme is antiestablishment and rebellion over authority, but still there is a human side to all of the mischeviousness. McMurphy realizes almost immediately after getting to the institution that things won't go as merrily and easy as he had planned, but is confident that he will break Nurse Ratched's will within a week, so much so that he offers a wager with some of the patients. McMurphy tries to rally the boys to have special privileges and to do things like watch the world series, and the crux of the film is about this battle between individual and authority. Along the way, he meets and gets to know many of the wards, and sees their problems up close. He befriends a silent, towering Native American man, Chief, who becomes an important character in the film's final resolution.<br />The film also explores what it means to be "free." Many of the wards, McMurphy comes to find out, do not have to be in the institution, but are there voluntarily, perhaps so they don't have to face the outside world. McMurphy's sense of freedom--which is to do and say whatever he wants-- is constantly being impeded and prevented by Nurse Ratched. In a critical point in the film, the Chief sees this freedom being crushed, and must decide what to do.<br /><br />I loved the two disc set, which also offers a documentary that looks at the making of the film, so this definitely is the one to get (I mention this because Amazon lumps all versions of the film together in one review).<br /><br />I remember seeing this movie back in a film studies class, and it was fantastic to watch it again. It has humor and wit, but also pathos and tragedy. It is a great film, and worthy of the many accolades it took home that year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>It's inevitable that a universally lauded motion picture - the crown jewel of the new Hollywood period and perhaps the most famous of all truly independent American productions - would be committed to numerous, increasingly lavish DVD and Blu-Ray editions. What's incredible is that every one of them is still in print!<br /><br />For those truly obsessed fans out there, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NF97L2">Blu-ray</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NF97LC">DVD</a> Collector's Editions are the way to go: loaded with silly goodies and the oft-tedious documentary, Completely Cuckoo (uploaded and removed from YouTube at least twice), it's the best available option for those who don't know that they're crossing a line from admiring aesthete to slobbering fanboy.<br /><br />Videophiles who demand an HD experience without all that consumerist excess will also be very well-served by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KN8WJ2">the standard Blu-ray</a>, the content of which is equivalent to this product's SD version.<br /><br />Finally, for those of us too cheap or lazy (in the instance of this reviewer, both) to obtain a Blu-ray player, one can opt for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732181">the spare 1997 DVD</a> or this handsome two-disc set. The former suffices for a casual viewing, but if you want to own a very good Cuckoo's Nest at a tolerable expense, this is your best bet.<br /><br />It looks as good as it's ever going to in standard definition, a considerably better transfer than that of the '97 disc. Artifacts are all too visible via an HD screen or projection, but negligible at a healthy distance. What's really terrific is the sound of it, a perfectly crisp 5.1 Dolby mix far superior to its predecessor's muddled 2.0 stereo track, which was scarcely better than that of the old Republic Pictures VHS tape. Of the two mono dubbed dialogue tracks from the earlier edition, the Spanish one is not included here and the French option was cleaned up as a Dolby 2.0 track; the latter was performed well and is easy on the ears, though a bit boggy in the lower registers. It's also important that this disc's picture is anamorphic, as its yellow, verbatim English, Spanish and French subtitles appear within the boundaries of its aspect ratio. Feel free to stretch the picture across a 16x9 screen, because it was designed to cover every centimeter while ensuring that subs can be read.<br /><br />I hoped that the commentary track spoken by Milos Forman, Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz would be engaging from the start, but the first twenty minutes of it drags. Information about the film's financing and location scouting isn't of much interest, and most viewers are likely to be distracted by on-screen activity. When the track's discussion shifts to the film's casting and production in the Oregon State Hospital, the director and producers have plenty of entertaining anecdotes to tell. As usual, Forman and Douglas tend to contradict one another regarding minor details; it's up to the listener to decide which of them is more honest or has a better memory. If you're expecting specific scene-by-scene recollections from any of the three, they're few and far between. More importantly, as the speakers were recorded separately, this track lacks the congenial warmth and cohesion of a group recording.<br /><br />The second disc is mostly superfluous. Its featurette documentary, The Making of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, is merely a truncated version of Completely Cuckoo, cut to nearly half its length. Much of its interview footage of Forman, Douglas, Zaentz, Dean Brooks, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli and screenwriter Bo Goldman is interesting enough, but this shorter slog is still dull, and veers too often into that uncomfortably self-reverential zone inhabited by a few of the interviewees. Even worse, over half of what's stated by Douglas, Zaentz and especially Forman was reiterated in the commentary track, some of it so seemingly identical that I can't help but wonder if audio from the featurette was recycled for the commentary!<br /><br />Of all the special features, the deleted scenes are the best - untreated bits of introduction and exposition that won't surprise anyone who's read Kesey's phenomenal novel, and which were more likely to have ruined a couple of crucial surprises than instill foreshadowing had they been included in the final cut.<br /><br />Included in every edition, the theatrical trailer is a sloppy mess: an artless collage of notable scenes, sans context.<br /><br />In spite of the complaints that I've lodged against much of this set's supplementary content, it really is the one to own for any budget-strapped admirer of this great picture. Its tri-fold presentation features an accessible scene index and immediately recognizable screen stills in gorgeous full color, most notable among them a wide shot of Chief Bromden's fountain-haul catharsis behind the transparent disc trays. Still fresh in an age when American individualism and liberty are falling away, Cuckoo's Nest is one of those films that's destined to last forever. Its quality is indisputable, its themes ageless.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're only interested in the story, forget about all these discs and read Kesey's book. Not only is it an indispensable moral story that'll be relevant for as long as modernity persists, but it contains some of the finest idiomatic American prose you'll ever read in a popular novel.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Having already read the book, I was eager to see this movie. I've seen plenty of movies that have been shoddy adaptations of books, but this movie was definitely not one of them. For those of you who have not read the book, the movie is clear enough on what it is about, requiring no previous knowledge of the book (unlike certain other movies, such as Harry Potter) and if you did read the book, I am sure you'll be happy to notice that the movie remains overall faithful, with the changes being minor. A bit has been cut out, but that's to be expected with book to movie adaptations.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is an awesome actor, and he really embraced this role. While I imagined Randle Patrick McMurphy to be taller and stronger (and more Irish-looking), Jack had the right attitude for the role, so I can forgive the person in charge of casting. Everyone else also did a great job, especially Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. Overall a wonderful movie, 4.5/5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AJD9EA658HCFW.html">AJD9EA658HCFW</a><br/><p>"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is a classic film. The acting by Jack Nicholson (R.P. McMurphy) and Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) is wonderful !! Also, the supporting cast did a great job!<br />"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is about a man (R.P. McMurphy) who is transfered to a mental institution, for testing to determine if he is "insane" or not. McMurphy, who is no more then a rebel goes through many obsticles and adventures during the film that are very funny, and yet some serious and sad.<br />"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is very deserving of the best-picture award it won in 1975 along with other awards won.<br />This is a must-see film that is satisfying to all types of audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>The 1970's were the best year for cinematic movie making; "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is one of the best films from that decade and has now gone down in history as being an all-time classic. This masterpiece is perfect in every sense of the word from the performances to the direction to the writing. "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is also one of those rare films that was nominated for every major Academy Award; it in turn won in all the top categories including being Best Picture of 1975.<br /> Jack Nicholson, in a flawless performance, plays a man signed into a mental hospital. His character, McMurphy, is not at all crazy, but he is put in this particular hospital to be evaluated after spending time on a state farm (jail). Once at the hospital McMurphy meets many patients as well as the rigid Nurse Ratchet. To say that McMurphy livens up the hospital as well as its inhibitants is an undersatement. The movie is hilarious, but at the same time touching as mental illness is explored in a humorous way.<br /> The DVD comes with a 47 minute documentary on the making of the film. Michael Douglas (one of the film's producers), Louise Fletcher, director Milos Forman, and others are all interviewed. Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, is not in the featurette. The film is a 2001 digital transfer from restored elements and there is a splendid commentary from Forman, Douglas, and Saul Zaentz. Subtitles are in English and French and the trailer is included.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is edgy, surprisely comical, and heartbreaking in parts. Jack Nicholson won his first Oscar for this movie, this is his best role to date. Nicholson brings depth and vulgarity to his role, he knows how to balance between with ease and talent. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratchett, I'll just say she is not a sweetheart, she plays a character that most people won't like but she's fabulous in this drama. I highly recommend watching this beloved classic, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>This is such a great movie! I never laughed so much in a drama and it wasn't because of something unintentional. There are genuine laughs to be had in this fantastic sad but inspirational story. Nicholson has never been better and won an Oscar for his role as R.P. McMurphy! Films like this are few and far between. If you've never seen this 5 time Oscar winning movie you don't know what your missing. A classic gem that should be in everyone's film collection. The DVD transfer is excellent with interesting extras on the 2 disc edition.!</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>First off, the acting in this movie is amazing. Jack Nicholson gives the best performance of his life and is simply unbelievable. His performance is in my opinion one of the best ever. Sydney Lassick delivers also an extraordinary performance as Charlie Cheswick. On the other hand, I didn't find Louise Fletcher to do that good of a job. I found her performance to be way overrated and found it to be fairly descent but definitely not worthy of best actress.<br /><br />Now to the movie. Beware if you are sensitive, the movie is very sad and depressing. You'll probably cry at the awful treatment that you see. I found myself cussing at the TV and screaming at nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I mean, I hated her. I was screaming at her nonstop. She was so awful to everyone. This mental institution is so awful that it is probably making everyone there a lot more crazy than they were. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy, a guy who fakes insanity to get out of prison. He is therefore sent to a mental institution. There, he is the leader. He befriends everyone and is their leader. They love him and he loves them. But, Nurse Ratched and her goons stand in his way to freedom and won't even let them watch the world series. The movie is very sad and touching and the ending is at first terribly depressing and then there is a joyous occasion. The electroshocking of the patients is awful and made me feel like wanting to strike back against this. You'll hate the goons and that stupid nurse Ratched. The movie is haunting and I was so into it that I would be cheering for the patients, laughing with them, crying with them, and hurling insults at nurse Ratched. I was so into it that I'd be like: "You stupid bit**!!! Just let them watch the World Seires! Come on!" I got very emotionally into it and connected with all of the patients. This movie is a haunting journey and the treatment in this institution is criminal and is making all of the patients insane or more insane than they were. This is an excellent movie that is worthy of any serious collection and is in my opinion Jack Nicholson's best movie and his finest performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>This is a good movie, certainly not a standout masterpiece or anything but overall its worthy of seeing, once.  Jack gives a good performance, he does crazy very well.  Its got some pretty funny things like the fishing trip, and when they get drunk.  Its pretty sad at the end but chief had to do it or Jack would have been a vegetable for the rest of his life.  The shining is better though.  7 out of a 10.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson is R.P. McMurphy, prison inmate, trouble-maker, wiseguy, and aspiring lunatic. He's just gotten himself committed to the nuthouse in order to escape work detail at the prison. McMurphy figures he's hit the jackpot! He believes he's fooled everyone, and will simply coast out his remaining term. Then he meets nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the jagged rocks upon which McMurphy's freedom boat will crash. Nurse Ratched is a pompous, manipulative, poker-faced witch. She hides a seething evil behind her blank expression. McMurphy takes her on, thinking he can defeat her with his sarcasm and wit. All he wants is to let the other &quot;nuts&quot; have a little fun in their otherwise dull, suffocatingly controlled lives. He breaks out and takes them all on a fishing trip at sea. He gets the guys to play blackjack, and acts out the play-by-play of an imaginary ballgame when nurse Ratched foils his plans to watch the world series on TV. Finally, McMurphy sneeks booze and babes into the ward. Nurse Ratched is NOT amused! She must show McMurphy who is truly in command. OFOTCN is a tale of institutional terror. Should anyone, regardless of mental state, be treated like children? Should they be controlled / medicated in a way that turns them into vegetables? Can &quot;professionals&quot; be trusted with the care of those they are supposed to help? Or will they just warehouse them, treating them like animals in captivity? What if the doctors or nurses themselves are secretly, silently harmful? This movie explores some of the darkest recesses of humanity, leaving us with lots of questions and a lump in our throat. Ultimately, OFOTCN is about freedom in the face of tyranny. Highest recommendation...</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this book was written by ken kesey who used the money to gallavant around the country in the 60s in a school bus and do drugs with a bunch of dirty ol hippies.the story is about a guy who plays crazy to get out of a work farm and into a asylum.jack nicholson is that guy.also included are that crazy dr in back to the future,danny devito,a stuttereererer named billy bibbit,a huge indian whose mute and deaf,some smart ass home boys who help the nurse,a nurse with big boobs etc.children will not be amused by this.it is a tragic story.this movie has adventure,romance,comedy,drama,tragedy and above all is well written.it is very emotional.the nurse is over the top obnoxious and people like her should be put to sleep.amazingly,it is alkmost identical to the book.people say its a classic and well,they are right for once.really its almost entirely funny until the end parts.jack nicholson did his finest work ever in this story.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, a newly acquired mental patient in Nurse Ratched's (mean, ugly lady) ward.

The novel "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" by Ken Kesey was more vulgar and outrageous than the film, but the film keeps the characters the same. The big chief was hilarious breaking out of the hospital at the end. Nobody could have lifted that sink out of the ground. Gargantuan!

So don't cringe at my 4 star rating of this movie, I give the movie itself 5 stars at least! My review will be of the earlier edition.<br /><br />First the movie... Jack Nicholson, in top form, plays Randall McMurphy, the newest arrival on the ward at a state mental institution. He has been transfered from prison to be "observed" to determine if he is really as "crazy" as he seems. He sees it as a kind of a vacation for the time he has left and at first is pretty happy to be there. He immediatley begins to breathe a little life into this otherwise "sedate" ward, much to the chagrin of the overseerer, the very evil Nurse Ratched(played brillantly by Louise Fletcher). She is the devil in a nurses uniform. She has had complete control and her finger on the button of every patiteint there until the arrival of "Mac".<br /><br />The other patitents (with excellant performances by Danny Devito,Christopher Llyod and Brad Dourif among others)normally obiediant and under her thumb start to come out of there shells and go along for the ride with "Mac". And what a ride, they have new experiences that make them feel like real men.(Look for Scatman Crothers on the night shift)<br /><br />Nurse Ratched knows which buttons to press to get them back under her control though, and she's REAL good at it. So it is a battle of wills between Mac and Ratched, and I won't give away the results in case you havn't seen it.<br /><br />The film under the direction of Milos Forman swept the 5 big ones at Oscar time(1975), and well deserved. It was also honored with many other international awards. We truly get a feeling for these men and the conditions they live under.<br /><br />Now the DVD. For the most part. it's pretty good. The picture is clear, no graininess, but the colors seem a little dated. The widescreen in good (There is a standard format on the other side for those who prefer), The sound is not the greatest. The background music is great but the dialouge seems to go in and out, sometimes muffled sometimes to loud. It is in Dolby Dig 2.0. If your interested in the Extras, there are some (filmographies, tribute to Scatman Crothers, facts about the making of the movie), there is no live commentary. There are subtitles in Eng French and Spanish.<br /><br />Although I have not seen the newly released special edition yet, I see that it has been digitally restored and is now in Dolby Dig 5.1. And for those that love the extras, looks like there are lots, including a documentary. If you are buying it for the first time, the new one is only a few dollars more, I say go for it if you can. I plan to upgrade mine, this film is unique and too good not to see it in the best possible format. In either case this is a must have film for your collection.<br /><br />See Jack Run.......Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>This 1989 CANNON Group videotape is a full screen SP speed dub that has clean HiFi audio.<br /><br />ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST premiered on Broadway 11/13/63, had a short 82 performance run and closed on 1/25/64.

O'Loughlin as Cheswick and Arlene Golonka as McMurphy's ladyfriend, Candy Star and Gene Wilder as Billy Bibbit.<br /><br />This film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel won Oscars for Best Picture, director Milos Forman, star Jack Nicholson, co-star Louise Fletcher and Best Screenplay. It was the first movie since Frank Capra's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800114566">IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT</a> (1934) to sweep these major categories. "Cuckoo's Nest" grossed over $112 million (in 1975 dollars).<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Randle McMurphy is sent from state prison to a psych hospital for evaluation. When he bets with other patients that he can "put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet," McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such "therapies" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.<br /><br />The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the "deaf & dumb" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.<br /><br />Also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NF97LC">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.9) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) - Jack Nicholson/Louise Fletcher/Will Sampson/Christopher Lloyd/Danny DeVito/Vincent Schiavelli/William Redfield/Brad Dourif/Scatman Crothers</p></br><a href="../users/A29IPLCBZ3LIGX.html">A29IPLCBZ3LIGX</a><br/><p>Given the age of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, the BD high definition transfer is a wonder to behold!

You see, the film might not be spotless, the fashions may be out of date, and no computer-animation is in sight.  Fortunately, films like "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next" exist to show that some themes are relevant in ANY era.<br /><br />The basic plot of "Cuckoo" centers on R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a troublemaker who is being "evaluated" by a mental institution because, frankly, the law doesn't know what to do with him anymore.  During this trial period, however, McMurphy (clearly no crazier than the lot of us) begins to "stir up" the other "patients" by trying to get them to stand up against the domineering Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and showing them that a real life doesn't have to include pills, wanderings, and white uniforms (especially when he finds that most of them are "voluntary" anyway!).  Unfortunately, for McMurphy's sake, this "rash" behavior sends a ripple effect through the entire facility that ends up in disastrous effects for him.<br /><br />Having a wee bit of experience in the mental-evaluation field, I can say that the issues presented in this film are still being hashed out on the "battlefields" of such facilities to this very day.  What is "crazy"?  How can one detect it?  Is it possible to fight against institutions of the state?  Upon finishing the viewing experience, those questions (among many others) will float around in our head long after the TV is turned off.<br /><br />The incredible acting in the movie also increases the enjoyment factor exponentially.  Nicholson is brilliant, as usual, while the cast of "cooks" (including a very young Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito) are at times a riot, but also can be quite touching.  Plus, Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (though never outwardly violent) is one of the creepiest, most hated characters in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Thus, if you have never seen this film, please go out and do so NOW!  It may not be overtly flashy like the big-budget epics of today, but its message and acting will immediately rank it quite high on your "favorite films" list.  It deserved every Academy Award it won in 1975.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Many murder shows have as a plotline that the murderer decides to plead insanity, rather than face the real consequences of his actions. It is thought that the easy life of an insane asylum is far better than the bars of a prison. Certainly RP McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks so. All he's done is have sex with a 15 year old - she claimed she was 18 - and he doesn't feel like doing work duty to wile away his time. He plays insane and figures he'll sit around and talk with the loonies for a while instead.<br /><br />Unfortunately for RP, the woman in charge of this ward is Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). She runs a tight ship, and likes everything just so. Into her tidy little world comes the freewheeling RP, out to get the inmates to do wild things like watch the World Series instead of sit around and talk therapy.<br /><br />Even though Nurse Ratched denies RP's quest to watch baseball, still, she almost seems to be helping the inmates - talking reasonably with them, giving them logical reasons why things are the way they are. Still, as time goes on, you start to sense that her priorities aren't necessarily with the patients. What she says seems reasonable - but the manner in which she pursues things, even when it's clearly bothering the patients, makes you think otherwise.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, it is quite clear that Nurse Ratched is deliberately taking actions to cause great harm to her patients, to keep them docile and dependant. RP is only inches away from escape ...<br /><br />What is amazing about this movie is not the specific plot - which rambles in and out of the various insane inmates' minds - but is the ensemble of actors gathered. Many of these actors went on to win awards, and each one is pretty much perfect in his or her role. Yes, the two main characters richly deserve the Oscars they won. But the casting director did a stupendous job here, casting the cream of the crop in terms of who could play each of these individuals. It is that group effort that really allows the realism to shine through, and to make this movie just as powerful and relatable now as it was when it first came out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Note: This movie was #20 on the AFI top 100 movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>This is a GREAT movie.

What amazed me is that he seemed ignorant of the fact that every story thrives on those sorts of ambiguities, not least the story of the Bible which, I suggest, offers very few characters who could serve as role models without qualification. Might I mention Moses, Esther and David as just three 'morally ambigious' characters (and heroes, at that) of the Old Testament. I mention this because I can imagine (and I think I recall actually hearing) 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' being rejected by a Christian critic on precisely those grounds.<p>Randle P. McMurphy is rebellious, licentious and from a Christian perspective, immoral. He is a violent criminal, a rapist, and yet he emerges as the hero out of this tale of a man's struggle against the establishment. McMurphy finds himself fighting against an institution which imprisons its members within a regime designed only to make them conform and serve the interests of the institution, though ostensibly for the wellbeing of the members; a regime kept alive by depriving the members of the truth about who they are; a regime in which dependency and conformity are maintained through deception and indoctrination.<p>It was in the day when Erving Goffmann published his famous sociological study, 'Asylums,' that 'Cuckoo's Nest' had its genesis, though the film's comment goes beyond criticising merely mental institutions and their inhumane treatment of human beings. It is a vigorously anti-establishment film which rails against injustice and oppression by showing us a man's attempt to escape conformity, however ambiguous some of his actions might be when viewed in a moral light. But so compelling is the portrayal of life in a mental institution that one can scarcely ignore the warnings the film has for society. People - in fact, Christians - need to pay attention.<p>I suspect that Christian critics who have found rape, violence and attempted murder (rightly) distasteful and rejected this film on that basis, have shot themselves in the foot. For whilst there is uproar about McMurphy's failings and the wrongness of his rebellious ways, a very revealing fact emerges. Why no uproar over the equally morally ambigious (and objectionable) character of Nurse Ratched? Why do the same critics not rally against her failings and the wrongness of her manipulative and malicious schemes which, ultimately, have far more disastrous consequences than McMurphy's actions (namely, Billy's death and McMurphy's labotomy)? The answer is that she belongs to the system, that she is middle-class, respectable, that she has authority, and therefore it scarcely occurs that we ought to be questioning her moral culpability or otherwise. Therein lies the revealing fact: that the evangelical critic has his agenda shaped far more by the system of this world - dare I say it, by the middle classes, even - than by honest, unbiased reflection.<p>So I do not say that the moral tone of the film is pleasant. But I do suggest that in the end Nurse Ratched comes out by far the more guilty of the two main protaganists, and this ought to prompt the Christian critic to ask what the film might have to say about the way society is ordered - even if it makes him a little uncomfortable about some of his less defensible presuppositions.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Ken Kesey's brilliant novel is perfectly adapted to the screen and expertly directed by Milos Forman.  Within these friendly confines Jack Nicholson gave the performance by which I measure all his others.  Randall Patrick McMurphy is a rebel.  He's anti-establishment.  He likes women and to have a drink and to watch baseball.  In some ways he represents the absolute worst of men, yet at the same time he also represents much of the best in men, and at ALL times he is definitely a &quot;man's man&quot;.<p>He has been sent to prison for statutory rape, but he's not particularly remorseful about it because the girl looked and acted older and wanted it.  We should be appalled by McMurphy's attitude, yet Nicholson plays him pretty much the way Kesey wrote him, and we sympathize with him.<p>McMurphy has earned a trip to the state mental hospital by acting &quot;a little nuts&quot; and you recognize by watching that McMurphy is the kind of guy who would not hesitate to &quot;act a little nuts&quot; to get off of the hard manual labor of a state pen chain-gang.  But at this mental hospital McMurphy runs up against his worst nightmare: Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched.<p>Louise Fletcher earned her best actress Oscar in one of the most methodically unsympathetic roles in silver screen history.  Nurse Ratched pretends to have the best interests of the patients in mind, yet she is obviously subtly manipulating not only the patients, but also the remainder of the hospital staff to maintain an iron rod of control over her little corner of the universe. Crossing Nurse Ratched is a certain path to disaster for those who are in her sphere.<p>McMurphy and Ratched cross swords over and over.  It could have become boring or depressing, but we are entertained repeatedly by McMurphy's ingenious or bravura attempts to one-up Nurse Ratched.  Yet SHE is the one who has the power in this universe, and I could only marvel at her as she cold-heartedly crushes the life from McMurphy and the other patients.  <p>If ever Academy Awards were given out for &quot;Best Supporting Cast&quot;, this one would have taken that one as well.<br />A film for the ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one of only three films in history to win the Academy Awards for best picture, actor, actress and director (It Happened One Night & Silence Of The Lambs are the others). They were richly deserved as Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Milos Forman are all outstanding. The film is based on the Ken Kesey novel and takes place in a state mental institution. Mr. Nicholson is R.P. McMurphy who is a convict and decides it's better to spend some time in the loony bin instead of jail. Once in, he stirs the pot and locks horns with the iron-fisted Nurse Ratched played by Ms. Fietcher. The film, as the book, looks at the rigidness of the so called establishment and it's goal of making everyone, through whatever means necessary, conform to its rules. Mr. Nicholson brings a manic energy and charm to the role of R.P. McMurphy. Ms. Fletcher is menacing as the evil Nurse Ratched and Brad Dourif is superb as a mental patient.

And I'm not normally keen on Jack Nicholson - although I may be getting a minor thing for Christian Slater now. (Guess what that means? Buying all his DVDs!) But for some reason, all the characters in this are wonderful, including the weird-eyebrowed Randall P McMurphy! Others in this include: the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif, who some might recognise, seemingly reprising his role later in the first Urban Legend movie), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest.<br /><br />If you've seen Girl Interrupted, then this is basically the same, but full of guys, some right, some not, and many of the extras in the background are actual mental patients.<br /><br />The film is actually based on a book by Ken Kesey, albeit, not a very good book, as I couldn't get my head around it, and put it down after a couple of pages. Ken Kesey said he would never watch the movie version and even sued the movie's producers because it wasn't shown from Chief Bromden's perspective (as the novel is). Apparently, years later, he claimed to be lying in bed flipping through TV channels when he settled onto a late-night movie that looked sort of interesting, only to realize after a few minutes that it was this film. He then changed channels.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is brilliant in this, despite the freaky eyebrows. He acts when he doesn't have any lines to say. If you just watch him during the group therapy session, his expressions are terrific, and he just reacts to everything so well.<br /><br />The film has some unforgettable moments. Who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance?<br /><br />In the stage production, apart from being gorgeous, Christian Slater had the same mannerisms as Jack Nicholson, and all the cast did brilliantly. McKenzie Crook (Gareth from The Office) played Billy, and although he didn't stutter as much, he played the part, and looked kinda cute at the same time - he suits his hair longer.<br /><br />The one thing I was disappointed in the stage production, was Christopher Lloyd's character not really being featured - I think his character was incorporated with another one. It's disappointing in the movie too, as he doesn't have that much screen time, but when he does, his face is so funny! I just have two things to say: "PECULIAR!" and the cigarette scene all by itself. When I first saw him in this (having practically grown up with the Back To The Future movies), I couldn't believe they were the same guy - he's really nice looking!<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of tension between Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) and McMurphy, but I always think if McMurphy could have had his wicked way with her, he would have done! There was a lot of tension in scenes between them, I don't know whether anyone else noticed. But sometimes you just want them to rip each other's clothes off!<br /><br />The ending to this, I simply can't watch. I've seen it once, and that was enough for me. Like the ending of The Shining, it stays with you. The ending gets me very upset, although I feel it was the right thing to do. I'll watch the rest of the movie quite the thing, but as soon as the ending comes, I'll either hide, or go out the room. It's really powerful.<br /><br />The movie swept the Oscars in 1975, and is always a favourite among people who were around at the time. Consequently, it's one of my favourites, and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Now, about Christian Slater - I've seen him in Hard Rain, Robin Hood, True Romance, what else do I need to get where he looks extra cute?!<br /><br />And another thing - whoever decided that Christian should go topless at least twice in the stage production is a genius!</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>I was always under the impression that this film was a comedy. I was very mistaken, but I enjoyed the film anyway. Aside from that false judgement, I was biased against the movie because of the era in which it was made. As a classic film fan, it is sometimes difficult not to resent some of the films that helped Hollywood progress away from the traditions of the classic era. However, any way you look at this movie, it is hard not to recognize the quality of the story and of the actors' performances.<br /><br />One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film about a man Randle (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental institution to be evaluated because of his behavior in jail. The doctors think he could be faking insanity in order to avoid the rest of his jail time, but he keeps them guessing with strange behavior. Randle becomes friends with the men in the ward, a diverse group including a young man with a stutter named Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), a deaf and dumb Indian called Chief (Will Sampson), a rigid man named Harding (William Redfield), and a hyperactive Italian called Martini (Danny deVito). Randle helps these men to fight back against the abusive power of the nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) causing trouble for everyone but giving them a sense of idenity and happiness.<br /><br />This is a long film, but it is very emotional and powerful. Nicholson makes his character likable but appropriately flawed. Dourif presents his character innocently and sweetly like a little brother one needs to protect. Sampson is excellent as the Chief, one of the most interesting characters in the film. The ending to the movie is unsettling and sad, but it is thought-provoking and a wonderful finish to this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Based on Ken Kesey's 1962 memoirish novel, the resulting movie's a timeless metaphor for the human condition.<br /><br />Sterling performances by the entire cast mesh perfectly under Milos Foreman's precise direction.  Jack Nicholson is the everyman who discovers a desperate sanity amidst the madness, but it's Louise Fletcher who steals the show as an unforgettable nurse devoid of compassion.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>First a quick synopsis of the movie - a criminal (in a marvelous performance by Jack Nicholson) &quot;pretends&quot; to be insane to get out of prison and spend his sentence in a mental hospital.  When he discovers that he's stuck in the hospital until he's certified sane by his doctors (rather than the length of his sentence) he plans to break out, with the help of selected fellow patients.  Along the way, his acts of rebellion against authority become a type of therapy for the patients, much more effective than that delivered by the medical staff. <p>This movie won a number of awards, and seems brilliant and refreshing today, given the claptrap Hollywood is currently producing.  While I do not think Louise Fletcher's performance is great, most would disagree, including the Academy.  The other performances are all brilliant, starting with Nicholson, and moving right down the list through the supporting characters.<p>The movie, while brilliant, is not always entertaining.  It's not perfect, and there are parts that are even mundane, which lowers its score slightly from the 5-star level.  The quality of the DVD drops it to three stars.  The sound and picture are both not very good - I have 1950's B-grade movies with higher quality.  The extras are non-existent.  Surely a movie with such a pedigree and of such importance artistically deserves better!  At least the price reflects this, but let's hope they come out with a better DVD version of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>In this multi-Academy award winning flick based on Ken Kesey's novel, actor Jack Nicholson as jail-bird Randle P. McMurphy seeks escape from the prison work farm by feigning madness.  He is committed to a psychiatric ward for the mentally disturbed for evaluation while the staff try to determine whether his behaviour is genuine insanity or mere rebellion.  But being with the mentally ill isn't as rosy as McMurphy imagined it to be, particularly under the repressive regime operated by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  In the battle of mind-games with Ratched, McMurphy discovers that even a simple thing as watching the World Series is impossible, because it might disturb the patients' routine.  <p>Only three movies have ever taken out all five major Academy awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay), and "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" is one of that elite group.  To say that the acting is superb is an understatement.  It takes a lot of talent to convincingly portray someone mentally disturbed, but this cast accomplishes it with brilliance.  The supporting roles as nearly as terrific as the leading roles: Sydney Lassick as the shaky inarticulate Charlie Cheswick, Brad Dourif as the stuttering virgin Billy Bibbit, Danny DeVito as the infantile Martini, Christopher Lloyd as the wide-eyed trouble-maker Tabor, William Redfield as the eloquent intellectual Dale Harding, and Will Sampson as the mute Indian giant.<p>But the mentally ill are depicted not merely as objects for examination and pity, but with genuine sympathy as victims under an oppressive regime.  Admittedly they're also the source for warm humor; Highlights include McMurphy's commentary of an imaginary baseball game with all the "nuts" cheering, and McMurphy's creative introduction of all patients as "doctors" from the mental institution as they hijack a fishing boat.  Those who work with the mentally disturbed in real life will be the first to tell you that you need a sense of humor in dealing with them.  But humor doesn't exclude compassion, and this movie raises serious questions about the treatment of the mentally ill.<p>Everything is geared towards arousing sympathy for the mentally disturbed: minimalist music and silence, dreary colors, bright lighting, and male care-givers who are police-like unnamed uniforms.  These factors combine to create an atmosphere that conveys a clinical and sterile environment devoid of compassion for those who need it.  Nurse Ratched is depicted as a cold and distant woman without feelings for those in her charge, and her authoritarian role personifies an establishment that cares little for the mentally ill.  Rather than show compassion for the weak, she uses therapy sessions to uncover whatever hope and spirit they have and destroy it.  McMurphy's embodiment of this human spirit is somewhat exaggerated (the way he initiates interest in basketball games and escapes on a fishing expedition is not entirely plausible), but it makes the point.  Interestingly, some have seen the movie as a social criticism on all oppression of the human spirit, with a broad application even to ideologies like communism.  As others have said: tyranny has many faces, and the story of freedom from oppression goes beyond the walls of a mental asylum.<p>The criticism of the handling of the mentally ill is most evident in how the institution handles McMurphy.  We identify with McMurphy because we know his insanity is faked, and yet the "treatment" he receives is thoroughly troubling, especially when those in charge resort to electric-shock therapy.  Is there a parallel in the way that many social problems (eg depression, ADD) are today diagnosed as mental illnesses and treated with drugs?  The tragic way in which McMurphy's "mental illness" is mishandled at the conclusion arouses righteous anger, and is a disturbing indictment on all mistreatment of the mentally ill.  There is no crowd-pleasing feel-good ending as his attempt to topple the establishment fails.  Yet the lack of a happy ending makes his criticisms of the establishment all the more piercing.  <p>The movie was rated R for frequent profanity/blasphemy, crude sexual talk and one violent scene at the end (there are also scenes involving alcohol, suicide, an incident where sexual promiscuity is applauded, and an implied endorsement of mercy killing).  The violence and language is deliberately distasteful and one can hardly feel sympathy for McMurphy as an immoral criminal (he is a convicted rapist, rebels against authority, sets up a gambling casino, and encourages Billy to lose his virginity).  Yet one has to feel sympathy for him as he is abused by an inhumane establishment that is equally criminal in its own way by failing to show genuine compassion for those entrusted in its care.  If McMurphy's character is distasteful and criminal, so is the character of care given to the mentally ill.  Rather than become sidetracked by McMurphy's failings, we need to take a serious look at the failings of the establishment as embodied in Ratched.  The tragic consequences (represented by Billy's death & McMurphy's lobotomy) of these failings are just as horrific as the consequences of an immoral life.  Understood in this way, this movie is much more than a vindication of the free human spirit and an endorsement of rebellious anti-authoritarianism.  More importantly it functions as a biting criticism against the abuse of authority to crush that spirit.  This is not a pleasant movie to watch, but it packs a powerful philosophical punch and raises profound questions that are more enduring than mere entertainment.<p>The conclusion does offer a note of hope, as the silent Indian escapes the cuckoo's nest (perhaps a metaphor of true freedom being found in escaping the establishment and modern institutionalized civilization?).  But we are still left with disturbing questions about those who do not escape: Would we really want our family members in a place like this?  This is a disturbing movie that raises disturbing questions about the treatment of the disturbed - but questions that need to be asked ... and answered.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ.html">A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ</a><br/><p>Based upon the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, the book, along with this great film, is said to be some kind of social commentary, being a clash of the establishment and rebellion.  Some people say that this movie is merely just a footnote of the times.  I disagree.  In 2009, I can watch this movie and understand it greatly, and I can still appreciate this movie's many little sayings on various human qualities (according to the reviewer, the novel is more trippy or something.  Beats me).  Oh, and it also has fun and freshness thanks to the many quirky characters (hey, it's a mental hospital!).<br /><br />Unlike what other people say, I don't think this movie is really a product of it's time.  Such themes as sadism, supression, and other means of control are nothing new, things that are probably just human nature and happen all the time.  People who get great pleasure from controlling others who are inferior regarding mental strength is nothing exclusive to the early 60's.  Teachers these days sometimes do it to kids.  Roommates can do it to another roommate.  Observing others, and you will most definitely find many elements of human nature.  I agree with Jim Emerson in that the characters actions are all human nature, not just the mindset of it's times.<br /><br />This also is a character study that I don't mind studying at all.  These kind of characters are quirky, totally likeable, with tons of traits that make you feel emotions for these characters portrayed on screen (being fictional, no less).  They do it with ease.  Randal McMurphy is a rebel who is likeable, and I feel that Nurse Ratched is a despicable human being, with no sympathy toward her.  These two central people fight for their own beliefs, and it's great to see Ratched's tryannical and slightly sadistic and cruel iron fist slowly go down in a vain attempt to stop the rebel.  Sidestepping the battle between the two, the rest of the ward is just as good, with the same kind of traits.  The Chief is a noble, interesting, and mysterious man who really makes an impression.  You can learn a lot more by reading the book on this character (since the book is narrated from his eyes).  I also find quite al iking for Billy on a particular note, simply because I feel it's just so bad to have a mother who prevents her son from liking women (what a life that must be).  His demise in particular makes you wince when you think about it.<br /><br />I could go on and on, and while they don't feel like your friends or anything of that nature (I tend to only feel that way about Dazed and Confused), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest feels just like one of the classic stories where you love reading about them and the story, and don't feel like your falling victim to the 3rd person syndrome.<br /><br />I also think the directing is very nice, as well as the music and visuals.  Sure, this isn't a highly stylized picture of any sorts, in fact, the grainy picture (thanks to the picture of the DVD and the movie's old print, I think) makes it seem kind of flat, almost documentary looking style.  However, while that's cool, the directing is top notch, effortlessy made.  However, I think what also makes the movie look special is what he captures.  I think this guy captures some great shots, and there's nothing more.  Oregon is a beautiful state (this whole movie is shot on site), and the scene where he breaks the inmates out of feels is as refreshing on screen as it would be in real life.  The music makes the movie even more better.  Especially a scene such as described works wonders, because the music is light, and beautifully captures the whole moment of it.  Easy to see why Milos Forman got an Academy Award for Best Director, his 1st out of his 2nd Academy Award (Amadeus).<br /><br />I admit that I kind of beamed when I read "Smashingly Effective, Emotionally Powerful" from the late great Pauline Kael, hearing it from a critic such as that (she seems very opinionated and doesn't shower praise like some other critics).  I only thought the bad thing was the ending, which was good but not as good as the novel version.  While this movie may not quite live up to that, I feel that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to still be a film that has q bit of everything, including humor, some tragedy, some social commentary, and a place with people you would probably want to visit more than once.  This is an entertaining and powerful movie worth seeing again and again.<br /><br />B+</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>This is an old one but it is still one of Jack Nicholson's best. It is the story of a convict who thinks he might be able to take it easy and get off of work details if he gets himself committed to a psychiatric facility. That part of his scheme works but he does not count on how structured life can be in a psych ward. Throughout the film, Nicholson tries to get the system to bend to his will and his wishes. In doing so, he has a few small victories but usually winds up having problems associated with those victories. Some of those problems can be tragic.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating aspects to this film is watching how Nicholson's character shapes and changes the characters of the other inmates. Again, sometimes this is for the better and sometimes it is for the worse. At the end, when we see how the admittedly unlikable character of Nicholson winds up, we also see a small victory that seems to make much of what went before worthwhile.<br /><br />This film features strong performances by all involved and is first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy who is sent to a mental institution for observation; he ends up getting some of the patients to assert themselves more than they ever have before. Most of the patients are "volunteer" patients, afraid of the outside world; Nicholson shakes them up and gives them some confidence. But when he attacks the head nurse after she "psychologically" maltreats a boy, he is given shock treatment until he's just about a vegetable. The movie is a powerful blend of comedy and institutional horror; it's a tour-de-force performance for Nicholson. The movie won all 5 top Oscars. It's a great tribute to the human spirit.<br /><br />This 2-disc special edition contains an excellent documentary about the movie's creation along with other terrific extras. This is the DVD to get.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning performance as Randle Patrick McMurphy is one of many highlights of this 1975 adaptation of the Ken Kesey novel.  Nicholson's McMurphy is a new inmate in a psychiatric ward who quickly rebels against the oppressive staff (which is personified by Nurse Ratched; played by Louise Fletcher in her Oscar winning role) while making quite an impact on his fellow inmates.  Director Milos Forman populates the film with memorable sequences while the screenplay offers many memorable, and in some cases unforgettable, characters; but none can steal the thunder of Jack Nicholson in the role he was born to play.  The rest of the cast includes Brad Dourif (in his film debut), Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, William Refield, Scatman Crothers, and an unforgettable Will Sampson as people you won't soon forget; and all of whom give superb performances.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest went on to sweep the Oscar's for all the major award categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) while it solidified itself as a true masterpiece of film.  The film itself hasn't aged a day, and is still as much of a classic today as it was when first released almost thirty years ago.  The DVD itself is worth noting as well: including a commentary by Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz; plus an interesting documentary and some deleted scenes as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>This is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not saying it is the greatest ever made- there are many more titles that could easily vie for that title. Unlike many other classic works of cinematic art, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST doesn't break ground in its camera work or composition. There are very few memorable shots visually or technically speaking. However, director Forman knows what to do: he gets out of the way and lets his actors tell the captivating story filled with sacrifice and rough grace. The story's universal theme of the individual courageously fighting for identity against "the machine" inspires while entertaining. A feat few contemporary movies successfully pull off. <p>CUCKOO'S NEST is an actor's movie. The ensemble work here by Nicholson, Fletcher, Lloyd, Redfield, Lassick, Sampson, Devito and the rest is among the finest ever captured. Not a false note plays in any of the performances. These actors fully inhabit the skins of these characters and therefore, create three dimensional people that connect spiritually and fully to the audience's empathy.<p>The script is air tight as it oscillates between comedy and tragedy. This occurs often not only in the same scene but in the same take. The film compliments the novel nicely (but exist in completely different spheres), although much of the books surreal symbolism is lost in favor of a clear linear narrative. The film also shifts the point of view from Chief's (in the novel) to McMurphy.  Many of my favorite lines in film history are in this movie. "Least I tried, G*******t, least I did that!" is a motto that has guided my life.<p>When viewed with its near twin COOL HAND LUKE (my third favorite film of all time), one can see the possibly dated, but no less intriguing subtext of the criminal/prisoner as savior. Many souls are saved as a direct result of McMurphy's (and Luke's) ultimate sacrifice.<p>The film is entertaining, enlightening and reflective without the slightest hint of pretension.<p>A brief note about this special edition two disc DVD: the behind the scenes material only briefly mentions author Ken Kesey. There is no footage of him weighing in with his experiences writing the original novel. This is criminal.  I know the late Kesey disowned this film and I don't blame him considering the experience he had. However the producers and screenwriter virtually ignore the brilliant Oregonian who wrote one of America's greatest novels.<br /><br />With each viewing (I've seen the film probably 30+ times) it appears as fresh and beautiful as the first. A definite 10 out of 10 must own contemporary classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This film has a special place in my heart because it was the first film I saw starring Jack Nicholson.  When he first appears on screen here after being uncuffed by the guards, you can feel the whole screen just light up with Jack's burning charisma.  I was determined to seek out after this anything I could with Nicholson because Jack was the man("Goin South", anyone?).  When "Cuckoo's Nest" came out in 1975 Nicholson had already established himself as a star in films.  The only thing that he needed was that shiny gold statuette to validate him as a legend.  Anyone who read Ken Kesey's book on which this was based would agree that Nicholson was born to play R.P. McMurphy.  A rebel stuck in a psychiatric ward would afford Nicholson the opportunity to chew the scenery.  Watching this film again recently I was struck how subdued his performance is here.  Not to be overlooked is Louise Fletcher's performance as the controlling Nurse Ratched.  Her work here is very much the equal of Nicholson's.  The temptation to play this part broadly may have been there, but Fletcher plays her in an understated manner that not so much imbues sympathy for her character but pathos.  The strong supporting cast here includes Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and most effectively Brad Dourif as Billy, an introverted patient who Ratched probably exhibits the most control over.  One weakness of the film is the casting of Chief<br /><br />Bromden, a large deaf and dumb Indian played by Will Sampson.  In Kesey's book, Bromden is the narrator of the story.  The only thing Sampson brings to the part is that he is a big Indian.  Praise also must be given to director Milos Forman, a recent emigre to this country from Czechoslavakia for translating this American story to big screen and to Bo Goldman for adapting Kesey's novel, even though at the time Kesey wasted little time in trashing the film.  On a final note, a few years ago I was fortunate to have seen the stage adaptation of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" in New York with Gary Sinise playing McMurphy.  Expecting a re-enactment of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this production had their own unique interpretation of the material.  As far as Sinise's portrayal, let's just say you would not confuse his interpretation of McMurphy with Jack Nicholson's.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>This is an unforgettable film. Jack Nicholson gives one hell of a classic and memorable performance in this film directed by the great Milos Forman. Nicholson plays Randall McMurphy, a rebel inmate of sorts at a psychiatric hospital who fights the system and refuses to give in the hospital's orders or behavior. It's a real groundbreaking film. Nicholson's main adversary is the cold Nurse Ratchett(great name!), played superbly by Louise Fletcher. A remarkable performance. There are also a number of familiar faces in the film. You will definitley recognize Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, and Brad Douriff, as some of the inmates. Will Sampson also gives a memorable performance. There are scenes here that are truly shocking. Anyone who has seen this probably knows what I mean when I say that. All of our actors are dead on perfect as mentally unstable patients. A remarkable cast. The end scene of the film is shocking and definitley won't be forgotten. Go watch this classic film and see one of our biggest and best legends in an astonishing performance. This is deeply recommended!.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>This classic is just as riveting and superb as it was when first released in 1975.  ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a cinematic triumph and a powerful allegory about the machinations of the Establishment, otherwise known as Authority.  In this film Authority is personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who calmly yet firmly intimidates and terrorizes her charges into submission.  And her charges?  None other than patients in a mental asylum, with most of them living there voluntarily, preferring Ratched's predictable and strict rules than taking their chances in the unpredictable outside world.  Accordingly, when Authority is challenged, and challenged effectively, first the other patients welcome the rebellion--and then Authority lashes back, and does whatever is needed to control and suppress the environment.  But there are consequences; at least one patient is influenced enough to strike out on his own, culminating in a euphoric victory over the status quo.<br /><br />Of course the challenge to Authority is none other than Randall Patrick McMurphy, a slick con faking insanity to avoid actual prison and hard labor.  This character is the glue that holds everything else together, and Jack Nicholson is stellar as McMurphy, playing him with a comedic edge that is captivating.  Yet the entire cast is exceptional--and utterly believable--from Fletcher to Christopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif to Danny DeVito to Will Sampson to the rest of the ensemble.  This movie doesn't feel like a movie--it feels like a documentary depicting a mental ward as it's manipulated by a nurse, then counter-manipulated by one man.  The inherent rebellion against rigid Authority is timeless, making ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST poignant and meaningful then, now, and forever.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>I've seen "One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest" (1975) as soon as it was released to theaters and was deeply affected by its dramatic force.<br />Recently I was able to see it again. It is greater than I recall it to be!<br /><br />IMHO this is director Milos Forman's best movie, better than his other two excellent opuses: "Amadeus" (1984) and "Rag Time" (1981).<br /><br />The outstanding strength of this drama is based on a strange confrontation. In one side stands the Rightful Nurse and in the other The Crook; she applies the Law to attain unlawful goals and exercise power; he evades the Law to attain justice and welfare for his impaired mates.<br />Both characters meet head-on with devastating results for them and the people surrounding them. The issue that shocks me most is to realize how an outsider may be able to asses which are the needs of internees where professionals fail.<br /><br />There are three major high points in this film: playacting, script and direction.<br />Jack Nicholson as The Crook delivers one of his best performances in a career that has many high quality characterizations. He is able to convey to the viewers the complex and contradictory personality of McMurphy and win the Oscar to Best Actor in Leading Role.<br />Louise Fletcher performs at the same height as Nicholson with more sober acting resources and also deservedly won the Oscar. Actually she never again reached that level of excellence.<br />In secondary roles Danny de Vito, Vincent Schiavelli, Will Sampson and specially Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee) are paramount.<br /><br />The script due to Bo Goldman & Lawrence Hauben makes the most of every scene and gives no respite.<br /><br />Finally Milos Forman's direction is impeccable extracting the best from each actress & actor and delivers an unforgettable film that will be remembered as one of the best of the '70s.<br /><br />This is a great movie for adult audience and deserves to be in any movie fan collection!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>So I watched this gem of a two-disc special edition last night and loved it more than the first time I viewed it probably five years ago. Apparently it managed to sweep all five major Academy Awards in 1975 (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and was very well deserved.<br /><br />A crook manages to get off a work farm and sent to a mental institution for evaluation. R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson endeavors to shake things up around the ward and show the men there that they aren't nearly as crazy as they think they are. Some of his shananigans include gambling, watching a fake world series game, hi-jacking a bus with inmates on it to go fishing, and sneaking girls and booze into the ward at night. When he discovers that antagonizing Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, could get him committed and only permit him to leave on her time instead of his own, he decides to plan an escape. The constant battle for control on the ward is very entertaining and at times heart breaking.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's energy and improvised antics never fail to entertain and engage your attention throughout. When he isn't performing for the others, he manages to be quite an sympathetic fellow trying to better the lives of people around him through his crude techniques. The Nurse is amazingly calm, strict, and has a never-ending tact for digging to the core of the patients' defenses to maintain control and keep them miserably docile. She rarely raises her voice and yet it's obvious she doesn't need to in order to get people to listen to her.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also amazing featuring Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others. They deviate back and forth from being vacant, hysterical, and occasionally have sane moments that make them very human. In particular, the Chief (Will Sampson) who has convinced everyone that he is deaf and dumb goes on a journey back to communication and the real world with McMurphy's help. The ending is happy and tragic all at the same time, but I won't say why for those of you who haven't gotten to view it yet. I very highly recommend it, and this DVD is a great edition.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />The restored picture really makes a big difference in viewing. The Behind-the-Scenes documentary is very interesting talking about the time period, the themes from the book, the casting, and the time members of the crew spent at a similar facility to prepare for their roles and how they refused to drop character during the shoot. The Cast/Director Career Highlights don't give you much more information than if you used IMDB, but the audio commentary by the director is again very interesting, though the documentary is better.</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>Relesed in 1975, "One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest" won all five major Academy Awards:best picture, best actor in lead role, best actress in lead role, best director, and best screenplay.<br />An adaption of a 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, and filmed in the setting of the novel: Oregon State Hospital, this movie is not a love story or a romantic plot. Rather, this is a story of man's struggle in every society where dictatorship aborts dreams and dignities.<br />A recidivist criminal, McMurphy, is transferred to a mental insitution instead of prison.As his trick to spend an easier sentence, McMurphy(played by Jack Nicholson) thought he can leave any time he wishes since he's perfectly sane. The cast of the mental patients was perfectly picked to show a submissive group of people that most of them chose this life and chose being in this asylum.<br />I once read about a scientific experiment were researchers divided a large fish tank in half by putting a glass wall in the middle. A barracuda was put on one side of the tank and a mackerel on the other. The hungry barracuda tried to get the mackerel but smacked into the glass barrier. Again and again, the barracuda smacked the glass in its attempt to reach its dinner. Finally, realizing how futile its attempts were, the barracuda gave up. Researchers then removed the wall to see what would happen. Surprisingly, the barracuda made no new attempts to reach the mackerel. It eventually starved to death even though food was within easy reach.. The technical term for what happened is "learned helplessness". The barracuda had learned to be helpless from its many failed attempts to reach the other fish. When the barrier was removed, the barracuda continued to operate as if the glass wall was still there.<br />This Learned helplessness is the best term to describe the patients of the asylem depicted in the movie. A group of people that couldn't change any thing in their devestating lives and chose to be in a place were things were pre-chosen for them any way. McMurphy , the charismatic rebel by nature, tried to stand up to the main authority represented by a tyrant called Nurse Ratched played outstandingly by Louise Fletcher. The confrontations between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched started to by funny and silly but developed to be tragically fatal as McMurphy finds out that Ratched don't only have the authority to control the patients physically and mentally, but also the authority to keep him in the insititution for ever and even permanantly disable him.<br />The great acting will keep your heart ingaged while the story of a dream, friendship and the sense of belonging is being born among the guys. High prices are paid to reach a dream, but the dream will live while telling the story of:<br />Wire, briar, limber-lock<br />Three geese in a flock<br />One flew east, one flew west<br />And one flew over the Cuckoo's nest.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K94LXX833JTT.html">A1K94LXX833JTT</a><br/><p>This film profoundly moved me when I finally saw it, long after its 1975 release (while working at a place I won't name that reminded me a little too much of the institution in the film!).  It burns with the intensity of human struggle against oppression, showing how strong, how fragile, and how precious the spark of freedom and dignity is even in what might seem the most unlikely place for it, a mental institution.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson, who won a well deserved Oscar for the role, plays a convict of mixed character who thinks he can game the system but gets in over his head.  His erratic behavior has gotten him transfered from a prison work farm to a mental hospital, which he appears to see as an easier place to serve his time.  Initially careless and arrogant in his dealing with both staff and patients, he comes to care about his fellow inmates, some there voluntarily.  Partly on their behalf he becomes locked into a battle of wills with the domineering, cold Nurse Ratched, who effectively controls the hospital (Louise Fletcher, who also won an Oscar for her role).  While much of the film plays as comedy, the overall frame is that of tragedy mixed with ambiguous victory.  It's easy to see political/social/philosophical context and implications, worth reflecting on, but the basic humanity of the story is central.<br /><br />Besides the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (Milos Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, from the novel by Ken Kesey).<br /><br />The new Blu-ray DVD will carry the same special features as the SD Special Edition:<br /><br />-- audio commentary with director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz<br />-- "The Making of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest" documentary (47 minutes)<br />-- additional footage: McMurphy and Dr. Spivey, Chief Captured between Mops, Shaving Chief, Who's the Top Loony Here?, McMurphy Meets Nurse Ratched, First Group Therapy Session, A Bunch a Chickens at a Pecking Party, Mr. McMurphy, Where Are Your Clothes?<br />-- theatrical trailer<br /><br />Specs: 1.85:1 Widescreen 1080p Hi-Def, English Dolby Digital 5.1, French 1.0, Spanish 1.0, German 1.0, Italian 1.0, subtitles in English, Spanish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish.  Extras are in standard definition.<br /><br />Hi def is always nice, but this isn't a film that requires high definition to be fully enjoyed, I think, and the SD Special Edition has good video and sound, so if you already have the Special Edition or can get it more cheaply than the Blu-ray, you might like it just about as well.<br /><br />By the way, this film is often compared to Cool Hand Luke, which has some similar themes.  That's also coming out on Blu-ray, though not till September.  The Amazon page for it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TYPIG">here</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>I've seen "One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest" (1975) as soon as it was released to theaters and was deeply affected by its dramatic force.<br />Just now I was able to see it again. It is greater than I recall it to be!<br /><br />IMHO this is director Milos Forman's best movie, better than his other two excellent opuses: "Amadeus" (1984) and "Rag Time" (1981).<br /><br />The outstanding strength of this drama is based on a strange confrontation. In one side stands the Rightful Nurse and in the other The Crook; she applies the Law to attain unlawful goals and exercise power; he evades the Law to attain justice and welfare for his impaired mates.<br />Both characters meet head-on with devastating results for them and the people surrounding them. The issue that shocks me most is to realize how an outsider may be able to asses which are the needs of internees where professionals fail.<br /><br />There are three major high points in this film: playacting, script and direction.<br />Jack Nicholson as The Crook delivers one of his best performances in a career that has many high quality characterizations. He is able to convey to the viewers the complex and contradictory personality of McMurphy and win the Oscar to Best Actor in Leading Role.<br />Louise Fletcher performs at the same height as Nicholson with more sober acting resources and also deservedly won the Oscar. Actually she never again reached that level of excellence.<br />In secondary roles Danny de Vito, Vincent Schiavelli, Will Sampson and specially Brad Dourif (Oscar nominee) are paramount.<br /><br />The script due to Bo Goldman & Lawrence Hauben makes the most of every scene and gives no respite.<br /><br />Finally Milos Forman's direction is impeccable extracting the best from each actress & actor and delivers an unforgettable film that will be remembered as one of the best of the '70s.<br /><br />This is a great movie for adult audience and deserves to be in any movie fan collection!<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>A landmark film of the '70s, Forman's "Nest" is the anti-establishment film par excellence--and perhaps the finest showcase ever for the blazing talent and wild-man antics of a certain Jack Nicholson. Organizing illegal card games, playing hoops with the nutters, sneaking whores into the lockdown ward, McMurphy represents the zeal and passion of a truly free spirit. His interactions with Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, and a young Danny DeVito are both hilarious and tragic, but it's his conflict with fellow Oscar winner Fletcher, as the hateful, repressed, order-obsessed Nurse Ratched, that ultimately seals his fate. Based on Ken Kesey's mordant novel, "Nest" is a grimly funny movie about madness and our irrepressible need to challenge authority.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>milos forman is a director i started to get into after watching amadeus and when i watched his crowning masterpiece, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, i felt breathless. the film tells of a convict sent to a mental instition so the people can figure out if he is insane. there he meets a colorful cast of people from a stuttering youth, a silent indian, and a unflinching nurse. nicholson and fletcher both won oscars for there roles and the film also helped launch the careers of danny da vito, christopher lloyd, and to my shock, an oscar nominated performance by brad doriff in pre-chucky days. the film has some genuinly funny moments and some serious moments to which forman easily balances out. i thought at first the music seemed out of place but once i got more into the movie i knew the music was right. definently a must for any movie buff, it will have you cheering for the insane people. if you also liked this film, see its female counterpart girl, interrupted.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>After 30 years since its release, this movie with Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Danny DeVito is still a classic! I liked everything about it, the story, the cast and even the Oscars to prove it! Even though the language is strong, I liked what the movie presented. A must watch film!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>In terms of movies that had deep, meaningful storylines, expert writing, great actors and great directors, no era can beat the 1970s'. One hardly can hardly argue with this assertion, since films like "The Godfather", "The Last Picture Show", "Nashville", "Taxi Driver", "The Godfather Part II" and this 1975 masterpiece based on Ken Kesey's novel all came from this era.<br /><br />In "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a slightly maniacal man who is placed in a state mental hospital for an evaluation. There he encounters a stunning group of social misfits, wackos and mentally challenged people (played adeptly by future stars Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito as well as renowned character actor Vincent Schiavelli). He also encounters Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a heartless woman whom McMurphy vows to drive crazy within one week. At first McMurphy is taken aback by his new surroundings. But as the film progresses, McMurphy developes a profound understanding for his fellow inmates, which ultimately helps him become a better man.<br /><br />This film is truly excellent. Although Nicholson had been making movies for quite some time and made some excellent films ("Easy Rider", "Five Easy Pieces", "Carnal Knowledge", "The Last Detail", "Chinatown"), this was the film that gave him his first of three Oscars and cemented him as the Brando-esque acting god he's considered as today. Louise Fletcher also won an Oscar for her fiery portrayal as Nurse Ratched. He plays the role with the kind of intensity possessed by classic movie villians like Norman Baits and even some of Nicholson's characters, but comes off as less of a pyschopath and more of a miserable wench, which is essentially what her character is. Fletcher captures the character to a tee and deserved the Oscar. Another actor who deserves mention is Danny DeVito. Even though he only has a small role as Martini, he imbues the character with genuine sincerity, and this is probably my second favorite performance by him (his portrayal of the Penguin in "Batman Returns" is my first).<br /><br />To put this in simple terms, this film is an absolute must have and one of the best films ever made. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>Milos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel is a powerful film touching on individuality, institutional oppression, and the phenomenon of group-think.  With a great cast of actors under Milos' experienced direction, the film is a classic sociological/psychological study of the human condition.<br /><br />Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks he has outsmarted the judicial system by pleading insanity as his defense to his criminal trial.  Although he feels he can easily keep his cool by spending his time in the looney farm instead of prison, Randle soon realizes that he's over his head in the cold and rigid order of psychiatric institutions. His antagonist is the cold and bureaucratic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher)who sees caring for the mentally ill as nothing more than dropping pills in patients' mouths and supervising frontal lobotomies; Randle's questioning of her authority and qualifications does nothing but ruffle her feathers and she's just waiting to put him in his place like all of her other little patients. Despite his rebellious spirit, this is a fight that Randall can't win as he is, after all, officially crazy and who would listen to the appeals of madman either inside or outside the walls of a sanitarium?<br /><br />This is an outstanding film where Milos Forman touches upon the subtle nuances of the human character and the strange wisdom fools often have despite their mental quirks.  It is not surprising that this film won multiple Academy Awards for 1976: it is simply a very touching film about the human spirit.  I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I watched this movie when I was a child.  All these years, I could still remember vividly the Chief (the Indian that was as big as a tree trunk)and the anti-establishment McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).  It's like walking down the memory lane when I gotten myself the DVD rendition of the movie.  With advent of digital and Dolby technologies, now I am able to appreciate this movie in its full glory.  This is one of those movies that typified the triumph of the human spirits, about those rare individuals who are courageous enough to go against the grain.  What made this offering special is that this new version contains more than ten deleted scenes; behind-the-scenes where the older Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Bo Goldman, Saul Zaents, Milos Forman, Michael Douglas, Christine Fletcher talked reflectively and candidly about their involvements.  It's rather intriguing to know the effort that they went into just to source the Indian; Milos Forman comparing this movie with his ex-country Czech where people lived under the repressive regime and thus, him being the right Director for the movie; the hardship in trying to find a backer to finance this movie; Burt Reynolds was in contention to play McMurphy's character and so forth.  Over the years, this movie hasn't aged a bit and it still manages to captivate this very humane story.  Now with all these additions, it makes it a more worthwhile investment to revisit our memory yet again.  At times, old wine does get better with age.  If not been preserved correctly, as you know better, wine would be transformed into vinegar. In this instance, it doesn't happen.  Highly recommended and salute to all of those involved for been brave enough to make a movie that they believe should get made at the first place.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>Go see this<br /><br />I was laughing so hard when I bought it on dvd<br /><br />Jack really cracked me up<br /><br />the ending is sad but understandable<br /><br />The movie is great<br /><br />a timeless gem when it comes to comedy<br /><br />Jack amazed me in this one as well<br /><br />He really stole the screen so to speak in this one<br /><br />I couldn't take my eyes off the screen<br /><br />go rent this<br /><br />I loved it<br /><br />The plot was not only clever but had me wondering how it would all end</p></br></body></html>

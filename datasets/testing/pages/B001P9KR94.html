He builds the plot around "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" using the questions to reveal Jamal's hard life, as the chaiwalla seems to know all the right answers much to the chagrin of the host, Prem Kumar.<br /><br />It takes a little while to get on track but Boyle and Loveleen Tandan never lose sight of their characters, charting a course that has a number of amazing twists and turns.  While Jamal never gives up his pursuit for the lovely Latika, his older brother Salim is the one who figures out how to get them out of one jam after another, but not always to Jamal's liking.  Some of the scenes are pretty harrowing, as one would expect from being forced to live on the street after Jamal's and Salim's mother is beaten to death in a race riot, but ultimately Boyle keeps to the spirit of Bollywood moreso than Dickens.<br /><br />The cast is an intriguing mix of first-time actors and Bollywood stars, as fantasy meets reality.  I can see why the movie is such a favorite among audiences. One would have to be pretty callous not to give into the kinetic energy of the movie, and let yourself be taken along on this wild ride.  The movie is loosely based on the bestselling book Q & A by Vikas Swarup.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, "the third musketeer", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material</p></br><a href="../users/A2D0PJFW2VY8G.html">A2D0PJFW2VY8G</a><br/><p>Director Danny Boyle got off to a flyer with his first two films, Shallow Grave (1994) and Trainspotting (1996), both being amongst the best British films I have ever seen. However, it was with Slumdog Millionaire that he received global recognition as the film scooped 8 of its 10 Oscar nominations including Best Film and Best Director. I heard a lot about the film when it was first released and Mrs B saw it at the cinema but it's only now that I have got round to watching it. As with many Oscar-winning films you assume they will be masterpieces but was that the case here?<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is the traditional rags to riches tale of eighteen year old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who is a contestant on the Indian equivalent of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and finds himself just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees. The show comes to a dramatic end with Jamal forced to wait till the next edition to face the last question but he is suddenly abducted and faces a brutal interrogation with accusations of cheating thrown in. Having grown up in the slums of Mumbai the authorities do not believe Jamal could possibly know all the answers to the quiz. During his interrogation Jamal reveals the story of his life and how separate incidents from his childhood to the present - growing up in the slums of Mumbai, being orphaned with his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) and meeting the most important girl in his life, Latika (Freida Pinto) - who he loves and loses - have all provided him with the answers to the quiz. As Jamal's story unfolds we are left speculating whether he is telling the truth or whether he has been cheating.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire begins with the brutality of Jamal's interrogation and provides a telling warning that this is going to be, at times, a gritty film. Having withstood some particularly unpleasant torture, Jamal is shown a recording of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire in which he featured and he has to explain his knowledge of each question in turn. The events described, which are conveniently chronological and fit the quiz questions, are extraordinary to say the least. Jamal and Salim's early life in the slums of Mumbai sees them earning a meagre living taking a toll for use of a latrine, the facility being a simple hole in a wooden walkway surrounded by a shack. The sight of young Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) covered in excrement after being locked in the latrine and wanting to escape quickly to get an autograph will make some queasy but it also raises a rare smile as the adoring crowd, surrounding a celebrity, creates a nice gap for Jamal to meet a famous Indian actor. The boys grow up in the 1990s where India is still revealed as having many poverty stricken areas and the brothers' plight isn't helped when their mother is murdered during the Bombay riots (Dec 1992 - Jan 1993). Living on the streets Jamal invites a girl, Latika, to join him and Salim beneath a shelter and she becomes the third musketeer, a reference to the Alexandre Dumas novel the boys were read at school and crucially the third musketeer, Aramis, is the one of the three that they always forget. The lives of the three remain connected throughout their childhoods and for Jamal in particular, Latika remains an important part of his life, even when they end up separated and in the present he still loves her just the same as when they first met. Jamal is torn between loyalty to his brother and wanting to be with Latika, and inevitably something has to give.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire continues to change between the past and present as Jamal withstands the accusations of cheating and professes sincerity in every statement he makes. It was fascinating to gain insight into India, seeing the rundown streets and heartbreaking poverty faced by the people even today. Inevitably, where poverty reigns there are opportunists out to make money and lure those in need to unpleasant acts, praying on their desperate desire to stay alive. The three children come into the care of a gang leader, Maman (Ankur Vikal), who sweetens children up with food and drink before having them compete to impress him with singing. Salim proves to be woeful at singing but Maman sees potential in the boy and begins paving the road for Salim's journey into crime. The children that thrive as singers face a sorry fate of being blinded and placed on the street as beggars with sympathetic singing voices. Jamal and Salim escape Maman's clutches but Salim purposefully leaves Latika behind to her fate. The two brothers continue on getting into many money-making ventures, most amusingly posing as tour guides at the 17th century building, Taj Mahal, and revealing the woman it was built for, Mumtaz Mahal, died in childbirth on her way to the hospital in a car! Eventually Jamal finds himself alone and brings us up to the present, revealing how and why he became a contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?<br /><br />When Jamal completes his incredible story we are left with the question of whether he'll get the chance to win the millions or be imprisoned for cheating. Having watched Jamal suffer so much in the film it is inevitable that there will be a happy ending of sorts. Slumdog Millionaire does have a feel-good conclusion but after the complex events that have led us to this point it all seems to be resolved a bit too easily. The ending is still enjoyable but there are bittersweet moments particularly the outcome of Jamal being reunited with his brother Salim. It's hard to resist a tale of someone born in poverty enjoying a lucky break and having their life changed forever and that outcome does make Slumdog Millionaire appealing to a wide audience. For me though the strength of the film is in Jamal's extraordinary story of his life, about the many individuals he meets, often those that help manifest the darkest side of Indian society. Through all his challenges Jamal remains firmly focussed on being reunited with the love of his life, Latika, but how does it all end? You should know by now it's not for me to tell.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is an absorbing drama from start to finish, offering an interesting insight into India and particular the criminal underworld which Jamal and, in particular, Salim become associated. The majority of people will be familiar with the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? format and it was amusing to see not much has changed from the English version. Jamal's rags to riches tale is one well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I enjoyed "Slumdog Millionaire," but I don't think it's the revolutionary film so many people make it out to be. The best thing about the movie is the unique way it tells the story. A young man named Jamal wins an insane amount of money on India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." He is accused of cheating and is taken into custody. The authorities grill him on how a boy from the slums was able to answer every question on the show. Jamal explains question by question how he knew the answers, and also giving away his life story. This is an amazing story of a young man's life, and I enjoyed the music and the performances by the talented cast of unknowns. However, there were some major holes in the plot, and occasionally the characters' accents were so thick that it was hard to understand them. My favorite part of the movie is probably the credits, which are a lot of fun to watch. I recommend seeing this film, but don't understand why people went so crazy over it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>First of all, the VERY first thing I need to say is this-<br /><br />Do NOT let the previews you've seen of Slumdog Millionaire fool you- this movie is much more than just a contestant appearing on a gameshow, winning money, and winning back his girlfriend for a happy conclusion.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is about MUCH more than that.<br /><br />It's about the contestant winning money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (the Mumbai version, which is the name of a city in India), but the storyline is more about how the contestant even GOT the opportunity to appear on the show, and the life long build-up of the contestants tragic and horrible past.<br /><br />It's a story that focuses on the contestants past, and the way he had to grow up in a poor, dangerous and just unsettling and unhealthy environment. He had to go through life basically looking out for himself, along with his small group of friends, just to survive.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, every time the contestant is about to answer a question on the gameshow, the story switches to something that happened in his past that enabled him to remember the answer to the questions he was being asked. Eventually there comes a point when the contestant answers so many questions correctly that he gets accused of cheating which leads to a little bit of violence.<br /><br />It might sound a bit tacky, and maybe to some it is tacky, but to me, it was a story told exceptionally well, and I highly recommend this movie. What will happen to the contestants group of friends as they grow up and grow apart? Well, you have to see it to believe it. I was totally attached to Slumdog Millionaire the entire time and I can NOW see why the film received so many awards. The presentation is just amazing.<br /><br />Great story, lots of tragic events and suspense, and just fantastic acting all around. Yup, it's one of those rare movies that does everything right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>I remember when the initial "...Millionaire" fever hit the U.S. back in 2000.  It struck a chord with us armchair dreamers that with a little incidental knowledge of the most arcane trivia we could be instantly rich.  Some nights without the pressure of the lights and the goading of Regis I knew all the answers and others I exhausted all my lifelines by the $1,000.00 question.  Director Danny Boyle and scenarist Simon Beaufoy ingeniously tap into this wish fullfillment and transplant it to India, a country that contains some of the most unimaginable poverty.  Reading some of the other reviews it appears that their film runs the gamut of love it or hate it.  Some feel that they are exploiting the suffering in India for commercial gain.  Others react to the plaudits the film received at the Oscars this year.  I don't have an answer to either criticism.  I can tell you I was engrossed throughout.  I think the critical and commercial success of the film is a response to the Cinderella aspects of the story which serve as an anecdote to our tough economic times.  History is the ultimate judge of a film's artistic worth.  Divorce yourself from the hype and appreciate the innate qualities of "Slumdog Millionaire".</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>I guess during hard economic times, people need to have any hope, so fairy tale(s) like the one told in this movie seems to be a good start.  Set in India, story covers the life of a young man of muslim descent who along with his older brother becomes an orphan at early age.  Without parents, they do whatever it takes to survive in a world.  Younger one, Jamal becomes a contestant on indian version of the show "Who wants to be a millionaire?".  Show seems to be the only way to conquer poverty an destitute for a young man with no education or any other prospects.<br /><br />When his answers lead him on top of the game, he arouses suspicions of the show host of being a cheat and impostor.  Jamal is kidnapped by a local police nad subjected to brutal interrogation in attempt to find out how he cheated,  It is during this interrogation that becomes obvious that events in this young man's life seem to have led to his knowledge on all answers to his questions.<br /><br />Good music, solid acting (Dev Patel is over the top, but Freida Pinto is natural), but not so convincing story. I still do not get it how this movie got all the Oscars this year.  It just was not all that good.  If you really want to see a touching movie about child exploitation, I recommend you see Emir Kusturica's "Time of the Gypsies" movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I can't give this movie enough praise. So much has been said by the other reviewers that I'm not going to bother with a tl;dr review. The acting and storytelling were superb, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.<br /><br />But it's also bleak and depressing, because this kind of thing - people living in these horrible slums, the blinding of children to increase their earning potential as beggars, the selling of girls, happens in real life.<br /><br />Mind you, these depressing parts don't make the movie worse or anything. They're a necessary part of the movie. If you want a good, serious, thought-provoking movie, pick this up! I'm glad I did!</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I thought the best part of this award-winning film was the photography, and this Blu-Ray disc makes this movie magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! This DVD transfer is very sharp and the colors are bold as can be. It makes me glad the film won the Oscar for cinematography.<br /><br />Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of "City Of God," about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.<br /><br />The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" quiz show. Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.<br /><br />Overall, it is entertaining and certainly a feast for the eyes on this Blu-Ray disc..</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>On the face of it, this British made film (winner of a best picture Oscar) sounds a terrible mixture of unbelievable melodrama, full of improbable coincidences, and western condescension. A teenage boy, raised on India's awful slums, manage to win millions in a tacky quiz show by answering all the questions, neither of them terrible hard. He knows the answers, not from having read about them, but from having learned in life about them (for example, he knows who invented the revolver from a shootout he was once involved). From the first scene, where the protagonist is tortured with electric wires to find out if he's a cheat, to the very end, when his lifelong female friend crosses a busy street to reach a cell phone in order to tell him in extremis the answer that will let him win the show, the whole film is ridiculous, sentimental, manipulative, condescending...and yet, this film is nowhere as bad as it sounds, and despite all its low punches, it is eminently watchable. Maybe this has to do with the actor's earnest performances, but this film ends up reaching a deeper emotional chord than it should have. Recommended with reservations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>I know it's been said a million times already and I hate to sound clich&eacute;, but it's a statement that rings true every time you say it. Who would have thought Danny Boyle, a man from Manchester could have created such an award winning phenomenon. Slumdog Millionaire is a film I tried to keep away from as long as possible as I didn't want to seem like a person who jumps on the bandwagon. I guess it was inevitable that I was to see it eventually and tonight was the night. It has remained in my memory for a few hours so far and that lump in my throat has yet to subside. From start to finish I was completely engrossed and I have decided that those saying negative things about this picture are ones trying a bit too hard to steer clear of that dreaded wagon.<br /><br />So the story itself is based around 3 main characters, 4 if you count the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" host. Jamal the main character starts off in a police station as he is accused of cheating to win the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" big 20 Rupees prize. Determined to prove his innocence to the Police, he starts telling them the stories of situations in his life which taught him the answers to the questions which he has inadvertently remembered for all that time. What we get to see as the game show progresses are a number of different defining events in Jamals childhood that are in one way heart breaking and in another heart warming.<br /><br />He and his brother Salim remained very close to one another from birth and stuck together after their mother was killed. One night after the murder of their mother, they were sleeping in a container as protection from the rain and they met a girl named Latika. Jamal took this companionship from one of his favourite books and labelled them the Three Musketeers, although they could never remember the name of the third after Athos and Porthos. Salim's relationship is never too favourable towards Latika until they get older and after being split up at the still very early age, they meet up many years later and events get worse and worse with Salim raping Latika.<br /><br />There are other events that take place which I will not spoil for the sake of your enjoyment, so I will now comment on the other amazing parts of the film. The acting was superb throughout and brought some genuinely surprising choices and showed us what they were capable of. Of course the young and teenage versions of Salim, Jamal and Latika were superb but unfortunately attracted accusations of these Indian child actors being taken advantage of. Whether they were or not doesn't take anything away from their fantastic performances. The adult versions of the three characters are played by the fantastically surprising Dev Patel (Jamal), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim). Each delivered an astonishing performance, especially from the wonderful Dev Patel known originally to myself as Anwar from Skins in the UK.<br /><br />The film was set mostly on location which allowed for the true tragedy of the Mumbai slums to be captured in all their glory. There have been things I've read that accuse Danny Boyle's picture of being demonising of the life in the slums. I don't know how you can demonise actual conditions being shown as they are, if anything I believe this is more complementary of the life in the slums. Although you could imagine it to be a very poor and dirty area, the slums are shot in a way that looks very artistic and in some senses quite beautiful. The soundtrack complements this immensely and I think without such spectacular music behind it, I think I would have had a whole different perspective on the film.<br /><br />To those steering clear of the film because of its massive award success, I have only one thing to say. You're idiots, the lot of you. This is a beautifully artistic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all film fans alike. I could talk for hours about the psychological implications of the life suffered by the children in this picture, but I have chosen not too. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Slumdog millonaire really shines on blu ray.  It has 12 deleted scenes and several other bonus features that some dvd pressings did not have evidently.  You have 156 people mostly telling you that this is a great movie, and are they all correct? Absolutely , this is a great movie that has strong characters and is easy enough to follow even though the story jumps from the police station to the game show and back into the past of the main character. This seems confusing but it's not at all. The story is a solid story of the terrible conditions the poor are facing in the hugely overpopulated democratic country of India.  The picture deeerved it's best picture oscar because it tells it's story well , and it is as well acted as any A budget movie made anywhere else in the world.  This isn't bollywood though; a type of movie which had musical numbers thrown into the middle of it and which has it's place in world cinema; this is straight forward filmaking with solid direction and a more western style of storytelling.  Which is why it holds up well against the many other great movies made in the last 100 years and rightly joins them as a top effort in film.  The story of a slumdog orphan escaping poverty and by strange coincidences having his life mirror the questions on the Indian version of "Who wants to be a millionaire!".  The actor who plays the host of the show also creates a  very engaging and interesting character. He is all about himself yet not a villian and he certainly doesn't like to be reminded that he was once himself a slumdog.  The blu ray looks great and the sound is excellent. This is the reason to buy a blu ray player so that you can see movies they way they looked largely at the movie theater and this disc comes close to that.  So go blu ray and you won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I love Danny Boyle to death, and nearly everything that he's done that's seen the light of day.  From Shallow Grave, to Trainspotting, to 28 Days Later, to Millions, to Sunshine; he's always managed to deliver visually striking, hypnotic, and intelligent films.  Slumdog Millionaire has proved to be Boyle's most celebrated film yet, as the Oscar darling has captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the globe.  As a fan of Boyle's work, I can honestly say that I'm not in love with it as much as everyone else seems to be, but that aside, Slumdog Millionaire remains a powerful film that should be seen whether you be a Boyle fan or not.  With all the attention it has received, going into the film's storyline would only seem redundant at this point, but what I will say is that Slumdog Millionaire finds Boyle at his technical best.  The editing, sound design, and music are beautifully done, and the film manages to keep a kinetic pace throughout its two hour running time as well.  All in all, while I don't think Slumdog Millionaire was quite the masterpiece that a majority of viewers do, it is a powerful, engaging, and incredibly compelling work that will stay with you after the credits roll, and is by all means definitely worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film but I did not feel it was as great as all the hype it has received.  The director uses flashbacks in a confusing manner starting with an adult Jamal being tortured in a Mumbai police station.  We are then treated to all kinds of flashbacks with an adult Jamal playing the India version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and a very poor kid Jamal being abused by his bully brother Salim.  Salim locks Jamal in an outhouse when the local celebrity comes to visit their villiage.  The only way Jamal can get out is to fall in the cesspool beneath the outhouse.  A Jamal covered with feces is able to get an autograph from the star.<br /><br />Jamal's misery is intensified as his brother sells his Jamal's autographed photo and then a bunch of rioters kill the boys' mother.  The two boys escape the rioters to be taken in by some criminals that are trafficing and exploiting young children.  The boys eventually escape but Salim twarts the escape of Jamal's female friend Latika.<br /><br />The movie follows them as they grow up and Jamal is constantly searching for his friend Latika.  The movie shifts constantly between the present day torture in the police station, Jamal answering questions on the TV game show and the boys story growing up.<br /><br />All through their life Salim is bad to Jamal and Jamal can never seem to find happiness without Latika.  I really liked most of the film but I found the constant flashbacks and time shifts to be annoying.  Also, the subtitles when needed were virtually impossible to read.  Jamal's game show experience did not seem believable except if the movie were to be labelled a fantasy.<br /><br />I did like the Bollywood number that the director threw in to the end.  I liked the Paper Planes song that is played in part of the movie.<br /><br />One of the better movies of 2008 but not the epic film that many make this movie out to be.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>This brilliant film directed by Danny Boyle manages to take the harsh reality of life for India's orphans and to create an uplifting film about overcoming the odds and holding on to true love.  Simon Beaufoy's screenplay, adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup, tells this story brilliantly through the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", where Jamal, an uneducated young man, manages to know the answers to some very difficult questions, leading him to the point where he has only one question to win the 20 million rupees.  Why he knows these particular answers and how he got to the game show unfolds through flashbacks, starting with the massacre of an entire village except for Jamal, his brother Samil, and a little girl named Latika. The violent street life that Jamal has known and the love he has lost have uniquely prepared him for this moment.<br /><br />Dev Patel as the adult Jamal and Freida Pinto as the adult Latika create their roles with passion and subtlety, giving the rest of the cast an opportunity to shine next to them.  The child actors are as natural and compelling as their adult counterparts.  Viewers will find themselves alternately looking away from the horrors and then cheering for the way destiny exerts its ironies.  This could have been an extremely disturbing movie -- and in parts, it is -- but the ultimate emotion is pure exhilaration.  Don't miss the cast's final dance number!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, "Slumdog Millionaire" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century.  The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India.  Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate.  In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.<br /><br />Based on the novel "Q & A" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up this much money as a contestant on "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating.  With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.<br /><br />Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle ("Trainspotting," "28 Days Later"), "Slumdog Millionaire" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next be indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition.  Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.<br /><br />The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset.  Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters.  And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>I watched the Oscars without having seen Slumdog Millionaires. I thought Hollywood was making too much out of the movie. However, after watching it for myself, I can honestly say this is the first fresh and innovative movie I have seen in at least a decade. It doesn't follow the well-worn Hollywood conventions and stereotypes. The acting is heartwarming, not mushy. The characters take interesting and unexpected twists.<br /><br />The movie also teaches Western audiences (most of whom have never been to the slums of a developing country) about the struggles of life as a "slumdog" without lecturing or moralizing. In fact, at times, the movie turns heartbreaking situations into heartwarming ones. For example, in one scene, a little boy wants to see a famous movie star but is locked in a run-down outhouse, so he runs out of the outhouse, through the waste, and asks for the movie star's autograph while he is covered in poop.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies of the past few years. I certainly hope Danny Boyle makes more great movies like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful little fairy tale about a boy who lives in the slums of Bombay and makes it to the top via Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

This is a type of Rocky where a slum boy makes good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Awesome. This is the best film I've seen in a long time. I really can't offer a single criticism of it and can't speak highly enough of it. I am always impressed with Boyle's films but Slumdog is just fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Movie goers love a film where the hero triumphs over the most adverse conditions to attain a goal. And this goes back further than the pinnacle of this genre, ROCKY. So what did the voters of the Academy do this year when it came to an Oscar winner for best film? They picked SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.<br /><br />This movie features the most improved character when it comes to tough times. The major plot of the film is actually quite simple. A young man goes on TV in India for a WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIR show. His goal is to make enough to find the girl of his dreams and settle down with her. That's it. And yet, that's not all there is to it.<br /><br />The film uses a combination of present day situations combined with well executed flashbacks to show just how fortunate he is on the show. Each and every question asked of him is something he has learned through the rough and tumble times of his life. And troubled times they were.<br /><br />As the film opens our hero, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the police. His suspected crime is cheating on the game show he is winning. How could someone of his background, a dweller from the poorest community in Mumbai (thus the Slumdog portion of the title), possible know the answers to these questions? As he is questioned, he provides the police chief as well as the viewers of the story of his life and how he came to know them.<br /><br />As a small child Jamal and his brother Salim play amid fields of garbage while living with their mother. A riot involving the Muslim and non-Muslim factions leads to their mother's murder and their quickly becoming orphans. Along with a young girl they meet named Latika, they live off the street until they are rescued by a missionary who collects young orphans.<br /><br />But this is no real missionary as it turns out he uses the small children to scam people on the street into giving them money. He collects it all. He even goes so far as to blind those that can sing so they will make more money. With a little luck, Salim, Jamal and Latika escape, only to have Latika captured before they can get away.<br /><br />Jamal is infatuated with Latika and his search for her spurs the romantic side of the story. He and his brother search for her until the day she is found. But this leads to more tragedy as Salim gets a gun and becomes a young gangster involved with crooks in town. A break between brothers results in Latika and Jamal parting ways once more.<br /><br />More and more happens to Jamal and each experience shows his determination to find a better life as well as Latika. And while Jamal works hard, attempting to rise above his circumstances, Salim dives into the worst the world has to offer, making a living for himself but at what cost?<br /><br />The end result is Jamal's appearance on the game show where he has the chance to make more than he could have ever dreamed of. And with the money he has the chance to rescue Latika from the fate that befell her not only at the hands of Salim but of the local gangster head who has chosen her for his own.<br /><br />There are more scenes and difficulties than I've listed here, but better to see them for yourself. And the best part of this film was the slow unspooling of the tale, as Jamal recounts his life and how each part of it provided the answers he needed to win, The world through his eyes is one of hope, the eyes of Salim a despair. How two brothers can see the world differently makes up a major portion of the tale.<br /><br />All of the acting in the film is impressive not only for the professionals but for the children who play them in their youth as well. Chosen to play these parts were actual children from the area, the real slumdog children. Dev Patel as the adult Jamal has a future ahead of him granted he gets parts as good as this one.<br /><br />So was this the best film that came out last year? Good enough that it deserved the Oscar for best film? Yes, it is an exceptional film. But I can think of others I enjoyed more. Then again I've rarely agreed with what the Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film. You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire has been dubbed the little film that could going from an almost direct to video film into an eight-time Academy Award winner including Best Picture.  The film has an incredibly interesting premises, detailing how an illiterate street kid could be one answer away from winning $20M rupees on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire by showing how he knew the answers through a series of flashbacks detailing where his knowledge of the answers came from.  Most of these flashbacks show the dangerous and hellacious aspects of life in the slums of India.  The way young children are used and abused by the Fagan like hustlers is disturbing.  Director Danny Boyle ultimately turns the movie into a love story, but he doesn't shy away from the gritty details of the life of the so-called slumdogs.  Griping, intense and ultimately heartwarming, Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of all the accolades it has garnered.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Slumdog Millionaire' is the story of a poor Indian man, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and who goes on to star in India's version of Who Want to be a Millionaire. It is told in flash backs, with each part of his life history linked to the question being asked on the gameshow. This is a novel way of progressing both stories and explained his motivation to be on the show in the first place. This film was marketed in the trailers as quite a light hearted affair, but in reality it is quite dark in places and very gritty. It shows the harsh life of those born into the slums of India and although it has the rags to riches element to it, you are also shown the more ugly side of a life of poverty. I thought the film was all the better for this and it made for a film with greater weight and depth. Everyone plays their roles very well and the acting is good from child and adult cast alike and the direction is as good as Boyle is renowned for. There is also an excellent Bollywood dance scene at the end credits which made for a delightful way to end the film. This is much better than I anticipated and the darker feel to some aspects lent it a gravitas that only increases it's appeal. This was highly commended and for good reason. This is one well worth watching.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>I liked most parts of "Slumdog Millionaire."  There were many standout moments, from the exceptional final twenty minutes, to Jamal's hilarious plunge into the feces, to pretty much any of the scenes on the set of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire."  The film's structure in non-linear, and it really works for the movie, allowing Jamal's answers to the "Millionaire" questions to be the catalyst for the film to flash back to the earlier days of his life, eventually blurring the line between the two stories as Jamal's past catches up to his present.<br /><br />At one hundred and twenty minutes, I did feel that the film was a bit bloated in parts.  The sections at the police station were clearly used to show how different the legal system works where Jamal lives, but too much time was spent there, and I did feel that it took away from the overall impact of the film.  There were parts that felt like they dragged on and on, and I think the film would have come closer to deserving the critical acclaim if it had been a bit more focused, especially in the middle.  The beginning was good, though, and the fantastic end was enough to get the movie back on track.  The only other thing I could fault the movie for is that the screenplay didn't really make the transition of Jamal's feelings about Latika feel organic.  Instead of assuming that the audience would buy Jamal's love for her developing from close friend/almost family to love of his life, I think a bit of time might have been spent on filling in that gap, so the story arc from beginning to end would flow a bit better.<br /><br />In the end, it's a good film that keeps you on your toes with its structure.  It might make you cry, it might make you laugh, it might make you cringe, and it will definitely make you think.  The relationship between Jamal and his brother Salim was developed so exceptionally, on both the writing and acting front.  It's a movie that has many great things about it, but I'm not sure that I found it as stunningly brilliant as a lot of other filmgoers did.  I think it's certainly the most overrated film of the year, but that's only because folks seem to think this movie is the second coming of film.  In the end, I found "Slumdog Millionaire" to be a good movie that had some problems along the way but rectified them with a superb end.<br /><br />7/10</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Superficially, this might have been a feelgood movie about a diligent boy rising from the ghetto, getting fabulously rich, and never forgetting the girl he left behind. That's not this movie.<br /><br />This takes any Dickensian poverty you might have imagined and brings it completely up to date. It starts with Jamal orphaned by lethal sectarian violence, his childhood friend turning to guns and violence, his cute little female friend turned into - well, you get the picture. Every event leaves its mark on him, and he learns from it. The odd smattering of stray facts earns him a place on a game show with multi-million rupee payoff. And, in a coincidence that stretches imagination, every one of the game's questions has answers in his haunted past. Almost every one ...<br /><br />I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, largely because of the child actors. The several girls playing Latika at different ages, especially, are heart-breakingly cute - and especially heart-breaking when seen in that cesspool of poverty. The way it documents the poverty of that underclass, the "slumdogs," will outrage any thinking, feeling viewer. In an ending that's really a beginning, Jamal rises above that poverty, and above the corrupt and vicious society at the top, too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters<br /><br />PS: Hang around through the closing credits - it offers one more light moment, as if to brighten the movie's darker imagery.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>I love Danny Boyle and I appreciate him as director and it's great he has got all the acclaim he deserves, but I'm going to go ahead and respectfully say that I didn't see what the big deal was with his latest, Slumdog Millionaire. Sure, it was a great effort; the photography was great, the music was also great, and the acting for the most part was good, but there were a few things that really turned me off when it came to Slumdog Millionaire. One of them being how the film presented itself in the form of a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? question and ended with the painfully predictable answer. This was just a way too pretentious and just flat out silly way to start a movie.  I also felt the hackneyed back-and-forth storytelling between Jamal being accused of cheating and the story of his life and how he came to know the answers was trite and very formulaic, especially for a Danny Boyle movie. Also, even though I did like the ending to the movie, it was the exact ending I saw coming within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There were literally no surprises in Slumdog. Just a rather stale connect-the-dots movie. I also felt the dance number at the end credits was horribly out of place and I had to remind myself that I didn't just watch a Step Up sequel, but a Danny Boyle film. Other than that, I would just like to say I really didn't hate the movie, as I gave it 3 stars, I was just hoping for a definite 5 out 5, and in that, I was extremely disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>"Slumdog Milionaire" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of "Namesake"], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.<br /><br />I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - "Nayagan" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>A mix of kinetic energy, an undertow of suspense, and a dash of Dicken's, Slumdog Millionare has become the breakout indie hit of the year. I was drawn to the film after its win at the Golden Globes and after viewing it, I can see why there is so much fuss over it.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, abliet with a refreshed, updated feel. Young Jamal has become an overnight sensation after his amazing streak on India's "Who Want To Be a Millionare?". With just one more question left to win big, the question on everyones mind is, how on earth did this kid from the slums, with no formal education, stable living conditions, and answering questions that have stumped dozens of contestents before. Slowly, we are taken back in time and shown Jamal's life, as each question he is asked pretains to a certain event in his life. All the while, he hopes to find the love he lost long ago, and maybe even come on top.<br /><br />The film literally crackles with intensity. The locations are awashed in a bright gold color, the camera is fast and moving (though no so much to make you dizzy), and the music is so lively and kinetic that it's almost like your actually in the movie with these characters, with Danny Boyle being the main person involved in this, injecting so much life and vibrancy that the film just pops off the screen. He also manages to equally balance the drama, humor, and tenderness of the screenplay without it coming off as to heavy handed.<br /><br />All the cast members do great, and while there is no particular standout, they all equally play of each other and hold their own scenes, with no one being overshadowed or underplayed.<br /><br />But what I really liked about the film was that (minor spoiler) unlike most other drama films, by the end of the film, you feel so happy and lifted that you just want to jump up and down as Jamal goes for the million dollars. I can't remember the last time a movie has actually made me grab my seat in suspense, baiting my breath, hoping and praying that Jamal actually wins it all and gets the girl. Plus, the Bollywood dance at the end was just so spectacular.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionare is definintly one of the best films of 2008, and whether your a Bollywood fan, drama person, awards seeker, this is the film that has everything for everyone. You do not want to miss it, Slumdog really is that one film you can't miss.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Jamal Malik (Patel) is a "slumdog" - a poor boy - from the streets of Mumbai.  And yet, when he ends up on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", he answers enough questions correctly to get to the final round.  He wins 10 million rupees before time runs out for the episode.  He will need to come back the next day for the final question, but as he is leaving the studio, the police take him in for questioning.  They are sure that he has cheated, given his roots.  After a torture session, he begins to recount how he has come to know the answers to the questions.  This involves a flashback tour of his life that includes two other significant players: his brother Salim (Mittal) and the girl he loves, Latika (Pinto).<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" is a well told story of a boy's attempt to make it from the slums of India and find the girl of his dreams.  Despite its early gloominess, it is surprisingly uplifting.  Crossing genres, this film is a romance, mystery, and thriller all at once.  The framing of the story around the questions of the game show adds to its uniqueness.  The actors, while not grizzled veterans, embody their characters and are thoroughly likeable.  "Slumdog Millionaire" is very much worth checking out.  It is the Oscar favorite for best picture, and I would not be surprised if it walks away with the trophy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionare is a good film, but it is also a very overrated film, and a rather simplistic one.  There are some amazing things in it, but there are some incredibly dull ones as well.<br /><br />Like all of Danny Boyle's films, there is some truly astonishing imagery in this film.  The shots of Mumbai's slums are brilliantly shot (the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, deservedly won an Oscar for his work).  Boyle and company deserve kudos for these scenes, as they are rarely seen in feature filmmaking, and are hardly ever seen in contemporary Bollywood films.  There is also a scene where the children go to an opera, and steal wallets and purses from under the bleachers.  This scene is achingly beautiful, and I wish it was longer.  There are many shots like that in this film.  Boyle has always had an amazing eye, especially in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.  But too often Boyle dazzles us with eye candy, and his films end up being unrelenting hollow, and Slumdog Millionare is no exception.<br /><br />The script of this film is predictable and, especially in the 2nd half of the film, surprisingly boring.  There is a love story at the heart of the film, and it feels forced, like it doesn't belong there, like the filmmakers insisted that it have some sort of love story in it, like typical Bollywood films do.  The dialogue is very forgettable, and the characters (except for Dev Patel's character) are cartoonish and very one note.  Boyle's array of dazzling images suddenly disappears in the 2nd half when he concentrates on the love story, and he's left with just the story, which is very uncompelling, even though it should be.  The motivation of the TV host is also strange, as it doesn't make any real sense other than to give the story an unnecessary twist.<br /><br />Most of the performances are adequate, but the best one is by Dev Patel.  While he has the classic Bollywood look, you do believe that his character was raised in the slums, and he has a certain anger and sadness that makes you feel for him.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the jarring (intentionally) juxaposition between Patel's interrogation (he's tortured by the police rather brutally), Patel's life in the slums (which is all done in flashback), and the slick, hollowness of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionare?.  It works very well, but it's predominantly in the first half, and the 2nd half is much more conventional and quite staid by comparison.<br /><br />The musical score is quite good, especially the end credits song/dance, which is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />I think this is another Best Picture Oscar winner that people will question in future years.  Too often the Oscars is not about which is really the best film of the year, but about politics (like great directors like Scorsese winning for mediocre films like The Departed instead of winning for Goodfellas, a true masterpiece), and/or momentum (Slumdog Millionare's wins were all about having momentum and riding a tide, so to speak).  It's not a bad movie at all, but it really is not a fantastic film by any stretch of the imagination.  I would say it's definitely worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>In such a terrible year of movies, it's no wonder an independent film got all the rave. Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.<br /><br />This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen. A good story is what will bring the crowds. I mean no offense to Heath Ledger, but when a role in a summer blockbuster based on a comic book is given an Oscar. It just shows you how the so called Oscar worthy movies has gone downhill.<br /><br />*To redeem myself I thought that Heath Ledger was great in The Dark Knight and truly deserved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>It seemed that about mid-year, 2008, the entire world (at least the cinematic world) caught a serious case of Slumdog Fever and soon the critics bodies and big prestigious awards bodies followed suit, handing over a near complete sweep of awards to a small yet bountiful film entitled `Slumdog Millionaire', a project that was probably on no ones radar and yet proved to be on everyone's minds.  Looking back on the film (and recently revisiting it) I have to say that I'm still somewhat baffled by the rapturous applause this film received.<br /><br />I said somewhat.<br /><br />Personally, I have never seen a film that was so over-thought and yet simultaneous so under-thought as `Slumdog Millionaire'.  For a film that prides itself in telling elaborate stories to add layers to a humble `slumdogs' apparent knowledge (a young boy actually wades through fecal mater for an autograph), this film all but seems to stop thinking completely in parts where it truly matters (like wrapping up a sloppy ending with a rather unlikely love story).  The film had a nice concept, but the script is poorly realized and comes off unnecessary and actually quite choppy in the end.<br /><br />Not for a lack of trying though.<br /><br />There are many elements in play here, but the film doesn't know how to tie them all together cohesively.  It is almost like the `gameshow' aspect of the film was an afterthought, something used to connect the dots when instead it actually serves as a distraction.  Yes, I know that this is adapted from a novel; I'm just stating how the tone of the film came across to me, especially in the end, as the film is tying up lose ends.<br /><br />I kind of have to applaud Danny Boyle here, and so I'll stop my critique to offer a slice of appreciation for the director behind this uneven offering.  Boyle is a director that I really admire and respect.  I have seen a number of his films, and what I love so much about him is that he is a director who will try anything and will adapt to any subject.  He is hard to pigeonhole because his vision is not tied down to one specific theme.  He has a masterful way of creating imagery that is honest and raw without losing a slice of humor that sets the tone of his films apart.  As a directorial effort, I can see a lot of thought in `Slumdog Millionaire'.  I don't think that his efforts were entirely successful (obviously) but I can see flourishes of greatness here.  I'm so elated that he has an Oscar, but I'm saddened at the same time because it came for (arguably) his weakest work.<br /><br />Where was Oscar in '03, when he delivered the brilliant '28 Days Later'?  Where were they in '05 when he stunned with his touching yet original `Millions'?  What about his shocking sophomore film in '96, `Trainspotting'?<br /><br />Alas...<br /><br />`Slumdog Millionaire' follows young Jamal as he nears the home stretch of India's version of `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'.  The film begins with an interrogation where he is being accused of cheating.  The film then jumps back and forth between his moments on the show, his interrogation and his childhood as he explains to the cops how he knows all the answers.  At times the films explanation of things can be pretty smart, other times they are fairly lazy.  That is what I mean by uneven; over-thought and under-thought.  The ending itself is shamefully under-thought.  The entire `Jamal/Latika' love story is seriously under-thought.  The character development feels like an afterthought.  The development of Salim alone is disgusting.  I have never really encountered a more vile character in recent cinema, and yet for some reason I'm not supposed to feel this way.  The film offers no real development to persuade me in the desired direction.  In fact, I can't decide if my smile at the films end had to do with what happened on the gameshow or in the bathtub.<br /><br />The acting was decent, but nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to write home about.  Dev Patel was bland beyond words, and Freida Pinto was barely used (but effective).  The real standout here was Anil Kapoor, who evoked more emotional commitment than any actor in the film.  The young actors were well used, especially Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, who played young Jamal.<br /><br />I won't lie; I enjoyed this film, I was just disappointed.  For a film with such promise, `Slumdog Millionaire' easily finds itself suffering from generic clich&eacute;s that haunt many films.  I expected more from Boyle.  I expected a film with this much praise to rise above those stereotypes and formulate something fresh and original.  The characters feel like skeletal variations (as in `lacking detail') of many other characters from many other movies.  In then end, I was smiling but when the confetti cleared I was left pondering just how much better this movie really could have been.<br /><br />And is it just me or was the ending credits nosedive into music video edited `You Got Served' territory totally fun yet tremendously cheap feeling?</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>This is the movie of the year?  There're dozens of foreign films out there with similar stories, and more beleivable.  Did the academy get all mushy and bleeding heart overnight?  First of all, the story lacks plausibility and very high on coincidence many times.  The back and forth between the game show and his dubious story is grating.  Secondly, the movie is terribly dark about India.  Supposedly everyone there is a con man, pedophile, or mafia thug.  The movie is more of a condemnation than glorification of India.  And how about the part where they fall off the train and land right in front of the Taj.  India's such a small country, I guess that happens all the time??  And the tourists give the kids a $100 note, what?  There are just way too many trite and serendipitous things that happen in this movie, and the ending obviously is way too strongly telegrahed.  It seems the credulous members of the academy don't get out much to the foreign cinemas and are entraced by negative stereotypes and fairytale story lines.

The story is about two brothers Jamal and Salim, and their friend Latika, who are played by three teams of actors, roughly aged five, 12 and 21. The film starts when Jamal is thrown into police interrogation, suspected of cheating on a 20,000,000 rupee quiz show. No one can understand how a street kid could get so many questions right, but somehow he does. Through flashback, we understand how he does it. And the police, never having encountered someone so truthful, cannot keep him in the cell any longer. And so he goes back to the TV studios to play the final round.<br /><br />Of course, the question of luck is a bit like the story of Chance the Gardener in "Being There" - he never did anything other than be himself, and was immensely successful at it - but the story of young people who fought their way out of poverty and bad luck to finally make something of their lives, and to win the support of the population in so doing, is simply a tale that is hard to beat.

Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an 18-year-old tea-server originally from the slums of Mumbai. In an attempt to reach the woman he loves (Freida Pinto), he becomes a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?". He gets so close to the grand prize of 20 million rupees that he is suspected of cheating and arrested. He tries to convince a jaded police inspector (Irfan Khan) that he really did know the answer to the questions by recounting the episodes in his life from which he learned them.<br /><br />This is an optimistic romance that is coy about being either of those things most of the time. It generates a lot of energy but has a startling edge. The audience is hit full force with Jamal's violent life as a street child. Shifts back and forth in time, between Jamal's interrogation, his appearance on the show, and his recollections of years past can be jarring at first. But the frenetic energy of it all matches that of the slums and of life on the run for Jamal and his brother Salim. Irfan Khan can play any role, and he is terrific here as a detective whose patience is wearing thin but whose curiosity gets the better of him, even though he's not such a nice guy.<br /><br />There have been a lot of sleazy characters in Jamal's life, and the film is populated with them. Jamal is the proverbial nice guy from the wrong side of the tracks who has been hindered by circumstances and unscrupulous people. Yet he is savvy and single-minded. His brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) is almost Jamal's alter-ego, a bully who chose a life of crime to get ahead. But he is equally savvy and single-minded, with a different value system. The love-hate relationship between the two men brings a lot of substance to the story. "Slumdog Millionaire"'s amalgamation of gritty reality, upbeat rhythms, and clich&eacute;d optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience.

Yes, I was uplifted, blah blah blah, but while I was watching the movie, I realized I was being manipulated, which bothered me. I'm used to needing to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but this one tosses belief right out the window from the first moment and never comes back to it. For all that I know that, however, it's an enjoyable enough movie.<br /><br />In case anyone actually managed to miss the plot of the 2008 Oscar winner for Best Picture, it involves a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.  As the host asks him questions, we see flashbacks to pieces of his life (amazingly, in chronological order!) that give him the answers. Boyle uses this to take us on a tour of Mumbai slum life, the state of gang warfare in India, a romantic subplot, and much much more.<br /><br />As long as you don't mind being herded into the pen like cattle, or don't notice, this is just about the perfect movie; it took home eight Oscars, and as I write this is sitting at #64 on IMDB's Top 250. Heady stuff indeed, but I still find myself unimpressed with the complete lack of subtlety to be found in the script. Granted, everyone involved did a bang-up job of bringing that script to life, but the script itself left a lot to be desired. It's shameless in everything it tries to do, but it garnered a whole lot of true believers, both behind and in front of the cameras. It had to, for the final product to be as technically fine as it is.<br /><br />Technically, a stunning achievement. Plotwise, not so much. See for yourself and judge. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A1ST1XBL6EQTBV.html">A1ST1XBL6EQTBV</a><br/><p>Even this film, like the amazingly uplifting story<br />contained within it, is a cinderella story that translates<br />across continents and socio-economic status!<br />In a world which is so cynical and jaded and has<br />seemingly lost it's capacity to be impressed by or moved<br />by anything that doesn't have a huge price tag or glamour<br />attached to it, here's a story that stimulates the human<br />spirit in a way that is very refreshing!<br />During the 2008/2009 awards season, I was like many people<br />who wondered just who and what in the hell was<br />a SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE!!

It puts the protagonists in various dangers, and has them escape in the nick of time, usually with some comeuppance being delivered to the antagonists. "Slumdog" offers a gritty portrayal of slum life in Mumbai, to the point where I was left wondering how accurate it really was. The relationship between the two brothers (Jamal and Salim) is relatively interesting. The central love story, between Jamal and Latika, strains credulity just a bit.<br /><br />The casting director did a very good job of matching child actors to their older counterparts, and it lends a nice continuity to the story.<br /><br />Overall, the ending is a bit too pat, much like many Hollywood stories. I also found the central conceit, that Jamal succeeds because "it is written" to be troublesome. Isn't this sort of reliance on destiny, social status conferred by birth, and prophecy, the kind of stuff that has held large portions of Indian society back by making them second-class citizens? I am by no means scholar of India's history or society - but I found this notion to be troubling.<br /><br />It's an entertaining movie, but in my opinion it never rises above its material. You can find the same type of story, conflict, and resolution in just about any Hollywood film. A young "nice guy" protagonist makes his way through a tough world, is rewarded by the universe for how swell he is, and gets a happy ending. This one just has "foreign" trappings. I found it to be a sort of poor man's "City of God," a much better film by Fernando Meirelles.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The image in this transfer is relatively detailed, but it suffers from a wildly fluctuating black level throughout. Some scenes have good contrast, while others (usually in dark locales) exist in a grayed-out fog. I get the impression that this movie was filmed on digital, which doesn't handle low light scenes as well as celluloid. Whatever the reason, it just doesn't look very good during these scenes, which I would say comprise about 30% of the film. In its defense, the Blu-Ray offers a very vibrant and colorful image when it is not subject to the hazy mosquito noise of the darker scenes. At its best, this disc looks very good. It's just not always at its best.<br /><br />The DTS audio mix is also seriously problematic. This film switches between very quiet dialogue scenes and EXTREMELY loud action so quickly, (such as trains, gunshots, car crashes, etc.) it threatens to blow out your speakers. Making things more irksome is the heavily accented English - you need to have the dialogue scenes cranked up to really make them out. Essentially, it is impossible to watch this film without subtitles at a lower volume, because of the drastic changes in volume. This plagues the movie throughout. The center channel dialogue never, ever, ever manages to win in any contest with the front and rear channels. I wish they would have just done the film in Hindi with English subtitles. Then I could turn it down and just read the dialogue. Instead, I am forced to fiddle with the volume control for 2 straight hours, trying to anticipate when the next sudden rushing train noise might occur.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the loud stuff is bad. The sound, especially the music, is very rich and has a lot of surround effects. This is nice. But its dynamic range is just too much for the quiet and tender dialogue scenes. They should have leveled it out better.<br /><br />Extras include some making-of material, two commentaries, a music video, and deleted scenes. It's all very nice, except for that fact that they are presented in 480p. Yawn.<br /><br />************<br /><br />If you've seen it already and you are a fan, the Blu-Ray is a worthy purchase. Its image certainly does things that DVD cannot do in terms of detail. If you have not yet seen it, I would recommend renting first. The image is not very impressive, the sound mix is annoying, and the film itself is pretty average.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire is a rags to riches saga, and it's also the oldest story in the world: Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy tries to get girl back...  But yet, in so many ways, it takes what could be such a dusty old story and makes it new again. Even the premise of a game show on first blush seems like it will yield little if anything of interest, but even though I am not a fan of these silly game shows (except of course Jeopardy, which challenges the mind) I was enthralled by this movie.<br /><br />And on top of the compelling story, you also get a most fascinating backdrop: India, and the City of Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. You get teeming slums filled with poor but resourceful people juxtaposed with the splendor of the Taj Mahal; you get an ancient culture making rapid fire changes to a modern one, transforming before your eyes. Slumdog Millionaire is quite an achievement, and one that seems to have come along at precisely the best time: Like the game show, it offers an escape in times of economic strife.<br /><br />The device of the game show is brilliant, as it allows the questions, and the subsequent interrogations, to each trigger a flashback, an episode in the past that will illuminate how Jamal Malik, the nominative Slumdog Millionaire, came to know the answer. Sure, there is some luck involved, but oftentimes a memorable event in Jamal's past will make the answers stick in his mind. As we discover how he knew the answers we also learn about how much he loves Latika, and how his brother Salim became a gangster. The performances of the three characters in that "bazaar" love triangle, as children, and then young adults, were brilliant. Kudos to Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, and the lovely Freida Pinto. Anil Kapoor was brilliant as the show host, Prem Kumar--a younger, Indian version of Regis, but with an edge.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Prem Kumar: So are you ready for the final question for 20 million rupees?<br />Jamal Malik: No, but maybe it's written, no?<br />Prem Kumar: Maybe...<br />=============================<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AOKTI4">The Darkest Light [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Great Britain </a>] (1999) (Simon Beaufoy, writer & director)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305622914">The Full Monty</a> (1997) (written by Simon Beaufoy)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439136653">Slumdog Millionaire: A Novel</a> Vikas Swarup<br /><br />DIRECTED BY DANNY BOYLE<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U98C">Sunshine</a> (2007)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04GK">Millions</a> (2004)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMA8">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2002)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWM3">The Beach</a> (2000)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305499144">A Life Less Ordinary</a> (1997)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304806442">Trainspotting</a> (1996)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079284405X">Shallow Grave</a> (1995)<br /><br />--------------<br />Middle Salim: Shut up!

It is the entertainment and commercial capital of India. It is home to Bollywood. But flip that coin over and you'll find the less glamourous side, that Mumbai also happens to be the site of some pretty deplorable living conditions. The poverty and squalor - and the quality of life attached to that - are horrific. And I guess it makes the ideal backdrop for SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, a film of seemingly relentless bleakness but a film which ultimately champions hope, love, destiny, and the tenacity of the human spirit.<br /><br />The plot is this: Improbably, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an uneducated young chai wallah (tea server) from the slums of Mumbai, is one correct answer away from winning it all on the Indian version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? But time runs out for that evening's episode and the flabbergasted audience must wait one more evening to see if Jamal can win the big prize. But Jamal is arrested and tortured, on the suspicion of cheating. Because how can a mere slumdog advance so far in the quiz show when even scholars before him have all failed ignominiously?<br /><br />The conceit of the movie lies in that each of Jamal's responses to the game show questions ties into a significant moment in his past. As Jamal reluctantly explains to the Mumbai police, the film flashes back to his painful childhood in the Mumbai slums. In the past, we meet his older brother Salim, a bully and avaricious and who soon becomes jealous of Jamal's close friendship with the young orphaned girl Latika. We see these three endure tragic life-changing experiences, as Jamal, Salim, and Latika claw out an existence by begging, stealing, and hustling naive tourists. Down the years, the three separate and reunite several times. Yet one thing never changes. Jamal keeps faith, believing that he and Latika are destined to be together. And that is the heart of the film.<br /><br />Based on Vikas Swarup's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743267486">Q & A: A Novel</a>, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is graced with dazzling technical mastery. Danny Boyle directs it and makes the thing accessible for western eyes. And, yet, the film does still feature a few of the core elements so favored by Indian cinema. Most notable is the gulf between classes, with the lead character so lowborn that when he achieves something seemingly beyond his capability, his integrity is promptly doubted and he is brutalized. Also regard the sweeping, star-crossed romance, that theme of love surmounting all odds, most definitely a staple of Bollywood's. And, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is by no means a musical, Danny Boyle couldn't resist putting in an exuberant dance number "Jai Ho," staged during the closing credits.<br /><br />The story is solid, the hook is good. The film looks visually charged. It's sharply edited, with awesome cinematography, with the cameras capturing the bustle and energy and vibrancy of Mumbai, whether the focus is on the slums or on the city's rapid phases of globalization. The pulsating soundtrack contributes to the emotional texture of the thing (although I laughed when "Aaj Ki Raat" from DON came out, since I just saw DON again very recently). The actors are marvelous, with Dev Patel strong as the central character. The film covers three stages in Jamal's life, when he was roughly 7, 13, and 18. The children who play Jamal, Salim, and Latika are terrific, particularly Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Rubina Ali, who are very moving as Jamal and Latika at seven years of age. There is one moment which crystallizes Jamal's personality to the audience and young Ayush pulls it off perfectly, this being the outhouse scene and what Jamal goes thru to nab an autograph from his Bollywood idol Amitabh Bachchan. Really, from that point on, you're totally on this kid's side. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is essentially a flashback film, with the game show sequences used as a framing device. And, ultimately, it's the honest performances of the children which hooks you in. Fair warning, there are some very disturbing scenes played out during these kids' time on screen.<br /><br />Two other actors make an impact. One is veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor and his trademark mustache. He plays the smug game show host, himself born out of the slums and who doesn't want Jamal to win the game and upstage him. Meanwhile, Freida Pinto makes an auspicious debut as the present-day Latika. She doesn't really have a lot of scenes or a lot of lines, compared to Dev Patel, but she makes them count. Freida Pinto is stunning. She has a presence and flashes such an utterly winning smile that the film flashes back to it several times. With her as Latika, I get how Jamal just never wavers in his efforts to reunite with her. Although, to be fair, Jamal fell in love with Latika before she grew up to look like Freida Pinto.<br /><br />What I have is the single disc version, with the following special features: the Making of the Film featurette (23 minutes long); 12 deleted scenes, all worth watching and key to filling in several gaps in the film - definitely check out "The Folder," which reveals why the Police Inspector dealt with Jamal in the way he did; two audio commentaries, one with Director Danny Byole & actor Dev Patel, the other with producer Christian Colson & screenplay writer Simon Beaufoy; and the "Slumdog Cutdown" segment, which basically is a series of scenes from the film serving as a synopsis and set to the exhilarating song "Jai Ho."<br /><br />As someone who's watched Indian cinema for a few years now, I'm so happy this film came out and I hope that it'll whet the appetites of more westerners, intrigue them enough so that they dip their toe into Bollywood films or Tamil films or Telugu. But if you're not sure yet and you're looking for a more accessible intro to Indian cinema, you should probably check out frothier films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094AS9U">Bride and Prejudice</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RP974C">Other End of the Line (Widescreen)</a>. Word to the wise, the Indian film industries tend to produce films which lean towards the more colorful, exuberant, and unabashedly over-the-top and sentimental, so prep yourself if you want to indulge in the real thing. I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00078JZ74">Swades</a>, an awesome film which attempts to make a telling statement about the state of poverty and the lack of education in India. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE ended up winning a busload of Oscar awards, and justifiably so. In this film's depiction of the state of things with the poorer masses, I quote from a slumdog in the film as he is about to get trounced by the Indian constabulary in front of American tourists: "You wanted to see a bit of the real India - here it is!" SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE shows not all, but only a bit of the real India. Still, it's become one of those films which should linger in the brain for some bit of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>One of the best of 2008, this fairytale of a movie is stunning from beginning to end!

Movies are an art form, and like any art form taste is a personal thing. I reluctantly watched Slumdog Millionaire, as my wife insisted due to the overwhelming high praise lavished on this film, and while it isn't the worst movie I've seen, it wasn't really my cup of cocoa.<br /><br />For me it had a few issues, for one thing for a movie about some Islamic characters, it was an ironically, Hindu tale in that it was heavy in Karma, but that may be quibbling. More to the point, it was so depressing and violent. Not action movie violent, but sadistic and disgustingly violent. As a movie about India, it is not much of a tourist invitation.<br /><br />What did work for me was the overall message about why would someone be murderous in the name of religion? That the events of your life for good or ill, make up who you are.<br />That true love should win in the end.<br /><br />As for the rest of it... The metaphors were largely lost on me, and the stupid American bit who buys away all trouble, was a bit ham fisted. The music video during the credits... I guess that's a cultural diversity educational bit.<br /><br />So were there things to admire about the film? Yes.<br />Was it the film of the year? Not for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>The plot of "Slumdog" has already been blabbed away. I enjoyed it a lot; life's lessons can teach a lot more than most schools.This is a finely crafted film, thanks to the always wonderful Danny Boyle; a whole bunch of wonderful kid-actors make the flash-back moments so hopefully  heartfelt.A wonderful cast. The amazing editing and brilliant photography add to the progression of the plot at large, showing past & present. I was impressed that this simple story, that almost didn't find a distributor, appeared to the public.  This is a feel-good film, but subtitles may keep some Oscar voters away. The Oscars have made lots of mistakes; the absence of Dev Patel as a nominee is just another Oscar travesty.  It's as earnest a performance as I've seen. "Crouching Tiger", Life is Beautiful", "Z", "The Emigrants", and other foreign language films have been darlings at the Oscars, all sub-titled. "Slumdog Millionaire" is a worthy film. Kids should see it to know the importance of "learned knowledge", though the subtitles may not make it as accessible to the general public (and kids). I was moved by this film, and the impeccable artistry for a "small" film. Bravo, Danny Boyle! UPDATE: Benjamin Button was a much better cinematic achievement. It should've won.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Believe the hype. Slumdog Millionaire, the latest film from Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, is every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's sweet, it's funny, it's tense, it's uplifting, it's spectacular!<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Jamal, a young Muslim boy (played at various stages by three different actors, but most notably by Dev Patel of Skins fame), who grows up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai. These slums are the sort of places governments ignore until either a: they catch on fire, b: there's some major world event, like the Commonwealth Games, on the way and they want to clean up the place, or c: the people who live there make them pay attention.<br /><br />Through a series of unlikely events, ends up on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he's about to win the highest jackpot ever. This, of course, leads to questions: is he cheating? How can he be doing this? He's just a boy from the slums, what does he know?<br /><br />As the movie unfolds, we see exactly how he answers the questions: he relates them to moments in his life. His knowledge of American currency, for example, comes up from a blind beggar boy who told him the name of the man whose face is on the $100 bill. There's another moment where he reads a person in a "The Lady or the Tiger" kind of way, trying to figure out if the answer the man fed him is real, or a bluff (for the record, I got the answer right before anything was fed. I have no idea why. It's not like I follow cricket, but at some point I must've picked up that bit of trivia and it stuck in my head, rather like with Jamal).<br /><br />The movie is as flawless as anything I've ever seen. Sure, it's unrealistic; a fairy-tale, basically, but who cares? It's beautifully told with some incredibly good acting and writing. The fact that Dev Patel is not up for an Oscar goes to prove that the Academy is pretty out-of-touch with the world. Well, that plus the fact that they give thirteen nominations to The Curious Case of Benjamin Boring. Even the music is noteworthy. I may well pick up the soundtrack.<br /><br />I cannot possibly praise this film high enough. It is a wonderful, delightful, uplifting movie. If you have a choice this weekend between seeing this and, say, My Bloody Valentine, see this. You can thank me later.<br /><br />One last side note: for reasons unclear to me the MPAA, that bastion of conservative nonsense, has rated this movie R. I have no idea why. Sure, there's a bit of language and you see some mild nudity, but so what? I'd feel quite comfortable taking children as young as eight or nine to this movie, provided they can read well enough to keep up with the occasional subtitles. The MPAA really just needs to be reformed or go away. We deserve better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Slumdog Millionaire" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...<br /><br />The cast led by Dev Patel (as Jamal) & Freida Pinto (as Latika) is excellent! The directing by Danny Boyle (Oscar-nominated) (who also directed "Sunshine" (2007), "Millions" (2004), "28 Days Later..." (2002), "The Beach" (2000), "A Life Less Ordinary" (1997), "Trainspotting" (1996), & "Shallow Grave" (1995) & Loveleen Tandan (co-director: India, also did the casting) is brilliant!

Rahman is brilliant! The (Oscar-nominated) cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle (who also did the cinematography to Boyle's "28 Days Later..." & "Millions") is excellent! The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Chris Dickens (who also did the film editing to "Shaun Of The Dead" (2004) & "Hot Fuzz" (2007) is brilliant! The casting by Gail Stevens (who also been doing the casting to Boyle's films since "Trainspotting", except "A Life Less Ordinary") & Loveleen Tandan is excellent!

The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of "Who wants to be a Millionaire". He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.<br /><br />The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.<br /><br />At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards).<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.<br /><br />Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.<br /><br />Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character--she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture. For all its shotcomings, it's still a solid piece of entertainment and will keep you riveted in your seat.</p></br><a href="../users/A36RS7KTNOBROF.html">A36RS7KTNOBROF</a><br/><p>This is the MOVIE everyone was talking about?This is the MOVIE that won all the Awards?The 2 young stars of the film are great,and the girl is BEUTIFULL,but thats it.The fast cut editing,the predictable story line just doesn't get it."Slumdog Millionaire is over 2 hours of pure hell,but at least PAY the kids that were in the film.The producers made millions,and  the young children who made this money for you are  starving .</p></br><a href="../users/A2LGRPM88JDWP6.html">A2LGRPM88JDWP6</a><br/><p>Amazon is becoming more and more incompetent. They only post my reviews when they feel like it.<br />Anyhow, Slumdog was better than I expected it to be and I liked it better than the Wrestler.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>To be honest, I never really cared too terribly for most of the films that have been awarded "best picture" by the Academy (there are some exceptions).<br /><br />While "Slumdog" does rate very high in my own personal "academy", I really don't feel that it deserved the best picture award. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I did find some of it's premises to be strectching it in terms of reality and believability.<br /><br />The acting, by all players young, old and not-so-old, is highly commendable, especially some of the younger talent, which I have learned had little to no acting experience. The story, although a little too unrealistic in some parts, is well-written and told with a sort-of "flashback" methodology which I found to be different and refreshing. The ending, although a bit sappy, is uplifting. I was sooooo thankful that they saved the big "dance number" for the credits (I know it's the "in" thing to do in Bollywood, but in this film it would have seemed completely silly and ruined the feel of the whole thing).<br /><br />All in all, a VERY good film, but to me, it shouldn't have been picture of the year. My personal vote was for "Gran Torino".<br /><br />There is a bit of violence (some graphic, some not so much) and just a smattering of foul language, but because of the overall adult theme of the show, I recommend you keep the kiddies away.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire is set in Mumbai (Bombay), India's slums focusing on a young boy Jamal Malik (Dev Patel)<br />He is a "slumdog", which is slang for street-kid.<br /><br />The first scene opens up on Jamal who has somehow been selected to appear on India's Version of the TV show, "Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"  Jamal is not expected to win because of his disadvantaged roots, but he has had some unique experiences as a kid that enable him to guess the answers correctly.  Many flashbacks are shown as he is interrogated by police on how he knows the correct answers to very difficult questions.<br /><br />The story flows and moves at a good pace.  The life experiences of terrible poverty and treatment of children in Mumbai are both sad and somewhat funny at times.  The children know no other life.  The movie is full of life experiences as we see Jamal growing up with constant challenges.  He falls in love, comes close to death and overcomes many hardships. Everything ends tied together in a neat little package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire" has been described as "Dickensian," and there may be no better description of this heartbreaking, funny, riveting tale of three young kids from the slums of Mumbai.<br /><br />Much of the story's strength comes from its willingness to throw the viewer into a world that is completely alien to most Americans - the slums of Mumbai.  These ramshackle tin roof warrens are home to hundreds of thousands of people, each with their own stories, tragedies, and triumphs.  Like "City of God," which ripped aside the veil to show the horrific slums just outside of the paradise of Rio, "Slumdog" shows the squalor that can be found side-by-side with such romantic icons as the Taj Mahal.<br /><br />I saw "Slumdog" after all the awards and accolades, and I was worried.  Could it possibly live up to the hype?  I knew that one of the characters, Jamal (played in teen version by Dev Patel, in youth by other actors) would end up on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," and that he had the hots for a gorgeous gal, Latika (teen version, Freida Pinto).  Would this movie strike me as flat as "Juno," another movie I didn't see until dozens of people had told me that "you have to see this" (turns out, no I didn't).  Or would this be like "Sideways," a movie that charmed me out of my socks even though everyone seemingly had raved about it?<br /><br />The great news is that "Slumdog" is another "Sideways" in that regard.<br /><br />Using the structure of the increasing dollar amounts of "Millionaire," "Slumdog" tells the story of three kids as they try to make their way in a harsh, bleak world that chews up and spits out kids like so many cherry pits.  No spoilers here - just prepare to be shocked at the horrors these kids face with so much aplomb as well as the snatches of beauty and humanity these kids find along the way.  Not as harsh as "City of God" by any means, "Slumdog" nevertheless contains more than its share of powerful scenes that will haunt you.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/APBB297H3ZA5E.html">APBB297H3ZA5E</a><br/><p>1.  After hearing the hype about this movie for quite some time, I finally watched this movie and... it did live up to the hype.<br /><br />2.  Whatever your preconceptions, this is a great movie:  well acted, a compelling story, cleverly written, a universal story surely to be enjoyed by most folks.<br /><br />3.  Bottomline:  I guess sometimes, a great movie actually wins the Oscar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Jamal is a teenager appearing on the Indian TV game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"  and he's doing so well that the host and the police think he's cheating.  When he's taken in for questioning (and torture), we learn that he answered the "Millionaire" questions correctly because of incidents in his childhood, when he was an orphan fending for himself in the teeming slums of Mumbai.<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie with a riveting script, outstanding acting, and cinematography that makes you feel like you're right there with Jamal.  The movie owes much of its success to the small children who play Jamal and his brother in flashbacks; they're wonderfully talented and believable in quite challenging roles.  However, I would recommend it only to those who know what to expect, because it was way too intense for me.  The scenes of the boys growing up in hopeless misery and squalor are so shocking I often had to look away.  Inhuman cruelty directed at young children drew audible gasps and groans from the theatre audience.<br /><br />The triumph of the human spirit at the end is heartening, but the pain and suffering of the slumdogs was so graphic, it was really painful to watch.  It's a well-made movie that I wouldn't want to see again.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE<br /><br />**** ? Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 12th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 121-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- Simon Beaufoy<br /><br />Director- Danny Boyle<br /><br />Starring- Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubiana Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, Madhur Mittal<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire took the film world by storm and won several Oscars, with major ones for best adapted screenplay, best director and the big one best picture. Slumdog Millionaire is the little movie that I'm sure not many expected to become the blockbuster hit it was and of course winning all the Oscars it did. There's a lot of hype on Slumdog and the good news is due to that people will see it; the downside is there's bound to be some backlash. What many people though are wondering does Slumdog Millionaire live up to all the hype? The answer is yes and no.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick for sure and I would rate the movie as one of my favorites of 2008, but personally I don't think Slumdog is best picture good. I thought the movie was good enough, but there were some other movies I thought were a bit better and some weren't nominated, but despite that Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick and worthy of the praise, but don't get caught up too much with the hype because than you'll be bound to be disappointed. A lot of people have compared Slumdog Millionaire to Rocky due to the underdog vibe both movies have and that's where the strength of Slumdog comes from. Everybody loves an underdog story and I'm sure that in part is what helped Slumdog dominate the Oscars.<br /><br />The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy is very well written and the characters are rock solid; the main character is Jamal and we follow him through his life played by three different actors and I really liked the concept of that and I think that's what makes this movie so likeable to you follow the character around and see the tough life he has and it brings sympathy to him. Slumdog is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.<br /><br />Danny Boyle has been a director who has had a nice following, but here with Slumdog Millionaire he's now a major player in Hollywood. Boyle does a great job with Slumdog and all the praise he's gotten for the movie is more than deserving; the pacing of Slumdog is excellent and the movie is always moving forward with the plot or characters. Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.<br /><br />The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out. Again Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of the praise it has gotten and worthy of it's best picture win even if it wouldn't be my top pick, but I highly recommend this movie. It's destined to become a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AJLYAY1G5Z8GE.html">AJLYAY1G5Z8GE</a><br/><p>Jamal Malik, an 18 year old orphan coming from the slums of Mumbai, is one question away from winning RS 20 million on the show "Who wants to be a millionaire", only to be arrested by the police before the night of the final part of the show on suspecion of cheating.

Unless I can directly do something about it I'd rather not watch it. Children have and always will be abused - as will adults - until the end of time.<br />The acting was not particularly impressive and over-all this movie just reminded me once again of how we treat each other.<br />If a human being of any age is abused in any way, by any one, does it make any difference where it is happening, particularly if nothing is done to keep it from happening again!?</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?<br /><br />Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?<br /><br />Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India.  Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives.  And, incidentally, by the way things are going, there is an enormous mountain of poverty to come worldwide, degrading much of humanity.<br /><br />(But, hey, I just got the DVD to be entertained.  I don't need to hear about the troubles of the world.)</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>This is a silly film that does not deserve the plaudits it has been given. It plays to the current western ideology that the glorification of the self is the paramount aim in life, and money and celebrity are the great goals to pursue. The end is seamed predictably into the first scene, and the movie simply unraps its layers towards the inevitable conclusion. The tension built into the narrative is Disney schmaltz - that is, we are happy to follow the characters through their mistakes and hardships because we know all will come out right in the end.<br /><br />This is not how life, let alone life in slum communities in India works. If such a film was made about American society it would be pilloried as a piece of Hollywood feelgood pap, profiting out of the naive chimera of the American Dream, as experienced by the poor. Set in India, it offers only a few colourful set pieces that show the hardships of slum life, rather than doing much to intelligently challenge and educate our perceptions of such societies.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>Well, I resisted seeing this movie but finally I caved in, and I had no idea of just how bad it is.  After about 20 minutes I turned to the other patrons of the theater and cried out like Augustus O'Reilly in A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, "Can no one deliver me from such pap?!<br /><br />I had the chance to see this on a double bill with Liam Neeson in TAKEN, and it so happens that they are exactly the same movie, presented in exactly the same way.  Both films depend on the continually postponed deflowering of an underage girl, and the plot of each revolved around the efforts of the hero to prevent this from happening.  So both stories becomes one man against the underworld of the gang, gangs grown rich by preying on the need of sinister, jaded men for the flesh of the young girl.  Life is a crusade against sexual sin led by Dev Patel on the one hand, Liam Neeson on the other.  This crusade allows and encourages violence of all sorts, in the name of protecting the girl.  I expect this feeds into real life violence perpetuating purity.  I enjoyed TAKEN though, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is unredeemable and condescending filmmaking which even AR Rahman's energetic score can't pretty up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TUVJBY0X4M5O.html">A1TUVJBY0X4M5O</a><br/><p>The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.<br /><br />But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.<br /><br />Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.<br /><br />It really is the worst Oscars ever.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>OK, it's a good movie. Maybe not quite as fabulously great as the hype about it, but it's good.<br /><br />Jamal is a Mumbai street kid along with his brother Salim. Although Salim is reluctant, they rescue a little girl named Latika. The ways in which they get used, abused and exploited are depressing, but they are smart, resourceful and courageous. They get separated, for which Jamal blames Salim (justifiably), and Latika is taken over by a brutal SOB who just happens to be Salim's employer.<br /><br />But Jamal never gave up on finding her. In fact, he says at one point that he went on the TV show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" mostly because he figured she would be watching. He knows the answers to the questions, much to everyone's surprise because he is supposedly uneducated and ignorant. But he has a superb memory, and in a series of flashbacks, he explains to a policeman who is trying to charge him with cheating how he knew the answer to each question. Does he know the answer to the last one, for a prize of 20 million rupees? Is Latika watching? Will they get back together at last?<br /><br />It is written.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The script is absolutely original to me. My family members and I were puzzled for the first 15 minutes of the screen. We were glued to the screen in order to find out why a non-educated orphan could answer correctly all the questions in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show.<br /><br />The scenes of the answers to the last 2 questions are full of twists and suspense. One example is the moment when Jamal phoned his brother for the answer of the last question.<br /><br />The movie graphically and convincingly shows how determined Jamal was in order to get what he wanted. For example, he jumped into a pile of human waste that was higher than he in order to see his movie star in person.<br /><br />The scene where the bad guys scooped out the eye of the street kid had some truth in it. Some of my friends from a third world country said something like that did happen in their homeland. There were some gangs that kidnapped children. Then they twisted their arms to make them disabled. Then they forced those kids to beg for money from spectators.<br /><br />Besides all the reasons above, this movie makes people happy and hopeful with its happy ending. I believe that's one of the reasons why many people love it. No wonder it won 6 Oscar prizes in 2009. They included best picture, best adapted screenplay, best directing, best editing, best sound mixing, and best original score (According to Oscars dot org site.)<br /><br />Freida Pinto is not convincing in her role as Latika, the love of Jamal but no movie is perfect.

It looks like one of those put out quickly to cash in on the Oscar buzz. There are zero extras on this. That's right--no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no making of's, etc.<br /><br />Come on! There is a huge goldmine of stuff they could have done as to how this movie even got made, a look at the actors who we know little of and a look at Mumbai itself.<br /><br />Shameful release really that shows almost no understanding of the DVD market.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle is a director whose films nearly burst with energy, and his latest, Slumdog Millionaire, has a kinetic vitality -- and an infectious sweetness - that's difficult to resist. Slumdog tells the story of a street kid named Jamal Malik, who makes a splash on an Indian game show, prompting officials to question whether he's cheating. Slumdog is a marvel, a heartfelt film shot with panache and featuring excellent performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that we unfortunately seem to be seeing less and less of. It's exciting and uplifting with a storyline that has you ready to stand up and cheer at the end. It shows how one person can rise out of poverty and live the life he dreamed of. Nothing is guaranteed, but you only have a chance if you're willing to try.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the fact that the story took place in India. I find the location and people fascinating and tend to gravitate towards anything and everything dealing with the Indian landscape, both physical, cultural and spiritual. Obviously this was a film I was destined to appreciate.<br /><br />I was impressed by the performances delivered by newcomers and stars; Dev Patel and the lovely Freida Pinto. However there were also a number of excellent though minor performances by actors who are all but unknown in American but actually quite famous and popular in India. The two I'm thinking about in this category are Anil Kapoor who played the part of Prem, the dishonest game show host and Irfan Khan the police inspector. I thought Anil Kapoor was amazing, in my opinion delivering the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Recommended viewing!</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>I really liked this movie.  It was interesting and kept me captivated on what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Jamal (Dev Patel among other actors), a young boy from the slums of India and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal among other actors) sadly lose their mother early to a violent death.  While most of the movie starts from when they are very young, the different scenes show them growing up and fending for themselves on the streets.<br /><br />More of the plot however, centers around Jamal being on the show of India's version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire."  One question away from winning the grand prize, he is forced into police custody and tortured to see how he is winning (they believe he is cheating).  Instead, he tells them how he knows the answers and in doing so, gives them the story of his life.  Prominently featured in these stories is Latika (Freida Pinto among others) who is a young girl who joins them in their travails after their mother's death.<br /><br />Each question a new part of Jamal's life is uncovered.  Most of it is very brutal; to be sure there are not many happy parts in this movie.  Now as a contestant on this show, his only thought is to get Latika back, which could prove very dangerous.<br /><br />For warning, this movie is very graphic.  It features beatings, murders, and other acts of violence.  Definitely not a good movie for the younger crowd.  It is realistically done though so I could imagine things like this happening.<br /><br />The characters were well played I thought.  Dev Patel especially as Jamal did great at portraying his worry over Latika and his quest to find her.  For some reason the actor who played his brother reminded me of Michael Jackson in his younger years, but it was only mildly distracting from the movie.  All the other characters seemed authentic enough as well.  The only character that wasn't truly amazing to me was the older Latika, while she was quite beautiful, there wasn't a lot of depth that went into her character like there was for the rest of them.<br /><br />The music in this movie was fantastic.  It was a mix of Indian/English so while a non-Indian dialect speaker might not be able to understand some of the lyrics, there were some that could be understood.  They had great rhythm and fit the flow of the story nicely.<br /><br />Overall a great movie.  There was a lot of action but enough story to keep you engaged in the characters.  I truly cared about how the ending would turn out and was pleasantly surprised and equally as shocked at the results.  I can see why it won so many awards.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />It's easy to get holier-than-thou about this appealingly-old fashioned film (at its core it's a very common star-crossed-lovers-who-won't-get-together-until-Act 3 type of film) but it's directed with verve, acted with intensity, set up with an incredibly interesting gimmick that holds the film together; you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be impressed with the kinetic style and undeniable charm of this deserved (or at least not undeserved) Best Picture winner.<br /><br />3.5/4</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>Although desperately poor, Jamal has something most of us don't.  He knows exactly what and who he wants.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latika is adorable as a child and breathtakingly beautiful as an adult but this just the way Hollywood used to do it.  The plot may be the oldest in the world but the use of the Millionaire show makes it fresh.<br /><br />On top of this, the movie is extraordinarily well put together.  An entire story, told in flashbacks yet not at all confusing.  Perfectly paced too, with the suspense building to that final cell phone call.<br /><br />Was it the best movie of the year? Not really.  But perhaps, just as the stars aligned for Jamal, audiences were ready for a break from the mostly vulgar chick flicks, prequels, comic books and Armageddon that Hollywood shovels at us.<br /><br />I'd almost go for 5 stars but for one misstep.  Everyone I talk to remarks about the children being tortured.  Of course one can't overcome evil if there is no evil, but this is not the thing people should take away from this uplifting film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>Charles Dickens' novel "Oliver Twist," with its child protagonist and portrayal of criminals - their sordid lives in London's Victorian slums, and their exploitation of children, was made into a very successful musical motion picture, "Oliver." Slumdog Millionaire" reminds me of a British-Bollywood version of "Oliver." Like "Oliver" it romanticizes the terrible poverty of children who are left alone to live and die by their wits. Just as "Oliver" had more than a few extremely dramatic moments, some difficult to watch, "Slumdog" follows suit. Primarily, however, both films are made to be more entertainment than social commentary.<br /><br />Eighteen year-old Jamal Malik, (Dev Patel), is a "chai wallah,"  who serves tea to employees at a Bombay call center. Unbelievably, he manages to get himself on the popular game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," as a contestant. Although literate, Jamal has no formal education. However he mysteriously manages to answer all the difficult questions put to him by the show's egocentric host, Prem Kumar, (Anil Kapoor). It seems like all of India is watching to see if the young man, originally from the slums of Darvi, will answer the final question correctly, an answer which would net him 20 million rupees. The show ends with the promise of an even greater audience and more tension the following evening, when Jamal makes his final, and hopefully winning, appearance.<br /><br />The film begins with a scene of a Mumbai policeman torturing Jamal. The young man is beaten, waterboarded, shocked with electricity, you name it. Superimposed on the screen is a multiple choice question with four possible answers. "Jamal Malik is one question away from winning the jackpot. How did he do it? (A) He cheated, (B) He's lucky, (C) He's a genius, (D) It is written." This is the same format as the "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" questions. Mr. Kumar reported Jamal to the police on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could a slumdog know the answers to questions which have stumped doctors, lawyers, even Ph.Ds?  Finally, after an exhaustive interrogation, the police chief believes that Jamal may be legit, and asks him to tell how he acquired his knowledge.<br /><br />Thus, Jamal takes the viewer on an adventure...on many, many exhilarating, terrifying adventures. For every question asked on the show, Jamal has experienced a life event which gives him the wisdom needed to respond correctly. There are frequent flashbacks to his childhood, and these flashbacks are what I most enjoyed about the film. These scenes include the vast, colorful, impoverished hell of the Darvi slums, where he and his older brother, Salim, were born and try to survive. Adorable scamps, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, as young Jamal, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, as older brother Salim, run with a crowd of children who inflict mayhem on their surroundings. Their energy is so contagious, that one focuses more on the baby hooligans' activities, mostly illegal,  than on their terrible way of life. In one instance, the camera pans out, and from high above the filthy slums look like a colorful patchwork quilt.<br /><br />The boys witness their mother's murder by a group of marauding, anti-Muslim hating fanatics. Left on their own, they meet another orphan in similar straights, Latika, a shy and lovely girl. (Rubina Ali plays the child, Freida Pinto the teenager). They call themselves the "Three Musketeers." Together they hitch a ride on a train and are thrown off in Agra India, the home of the Taj Mahal. The boys, after a few days listening to guides, improvise an improbable history of the fabulous monument, and show gullible European tourists around, earning enough money to live on.<br /><br />The three children are eventually discovered by a Fagin-like character, the brutal gangster Maman, (Ankur Vikal). He and his cronies tell Jamal, Salim and Latika that they run a comfortable orphanage  and convince the kids to go with them. In fact, Maman collects street children and trains them to beg for money. He cruelly has some of them blinded and crippled so they can earn more money on the streets. Salim, who is being groomed for bigger things, sees one of the children being deformed and he and Jamal escape before Jamal can be treated in a similar manner. Through an "accident," as Jamal is led to believe, Latika is left behind. Jamal never forgets her. He loved her as a child and will continue to love her as a man. His obsession is to find her. It is his destiny. Salim's destiny is quite different.<br /><br />To avoid spoilers, I won't continue to summarize the plot. I will say that I loved the extraordinary energy of the film and the wonderfully lavish colors, of the clothing, landscapes and characters. There are so many rags to riches fairytales out there, but this one is special. The last musical number, "Jai Ho" is outstanding - a great song and memorable choreography! The acting, by a relatively unknown cast, is usually excellent and the pace is fast.<br /><br />Screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy adapted the story from the novel "Q & A," (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Beaufoy has expressed his joy at developing and introducing so many different genres and mini-tales within the overall story. Director Danny Boyle earned himself a 2008 Academy Award for Best Director and "Slumdog Millionaire" won for best picture.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the adult characters of Jamal and Latika seem flat and detached. I also think the movie could be improved upon by eliminating the romance, which I felt was a bit cliched and confused. Underdog, slumdog, Jamal is a BIG winner & that is so upbeat...but does he need to be a millionaire to finally win the girl?<br />Jana Perskie</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I was very surprised by this movie.  I merely rented it because my wife wanted to see it.  But from the first moment on I was entranced.  The story is of a slumdog who is on India's "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" and manages to get the questions right.  He is picked up by the police who doubt an uneducated child of the streets could know the answer, therefore he must be cheating.  Through flashbacks that cut back and forth between then and current time on the show, the viewer is shown how he knows each answer and why.  It is both an uplifting story, and a tragic one.  I wish that is was completely fiction, and not based on the real sad lives of the children on India's streets.  Very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This film is amazing. The acting. The direction. Everything is perfect! The story reminded me of "Oliver Twist". You all know the story by now, so I will not go into the details. I'll just tell you that if you have not seen it, do so, as soon as possible! The acting is top-notch, all around. The characters really come to life, and you want to see them succeed! Yes, there is a Hollywood ending. The good thing about this one is that it does not feel forced. The story ends perfectly.<br /><br />It's also a much needed dose of reality. The rough depiction of life in the slums is unforgettable. Danny Boyle has always been an amazing director, and I love his work. This film is no exception! This film does have it's critics, but I'd advise you to see the film and judge for yourself! Don't let anyone stop you from seeing it.<br /><br />Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing! Stay for the end credits.<br /><br />SEE IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>This movie bowled me over.  A visual feast and extremely engaging story thrown into the bargain. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita is stolen from Rama by the great demon king and the story that follows is the quest to get her back.  Amazing how the classic love story still works so well in a modern context.  I had picked up the book and skimmed a few parts, didn't buy it.  I've read a lot of Indian authors and what I'd read of Slumdog Millionare (the novel) hadn't done much for me - it had seemed somewhat contrived, though to be fair, I didn't read the whole book.  Anyway, it was with some curiousity (and doubt) that I put this film on tonight with a friend.  Wow!  What an exciting movie! Danny Boyle has created a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>I just recently finished watching the film sensation of 2008-2009, Slumdog Millionaire, and I wanted to share with you my initial reaction: It was a good film, with a few touching moments, but nothing that will really stick with me long after viewing.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure why I'm not caught up in the hype surrounding this film (plus its selection for Best Picture at the '09 Academy Awards), but I just don't consider it to be in any way groundbreaking or special.  I don't want to steal a thread that has been circulating around the reviews for this product, but it does seem to be a bit contrived in its storytelling method, where a poor contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" wows the entire nation with his knowledge of matters that should be beyond him.  Over the course of the movie, though, viewers are shown exactly how he came to know the answers to those questions through a series of flashbacks.<br /><br />The film did a good enough job of building suspense that I could give it four stars over three, but I think its biggest downfall was that the central romance of the film was not a little more fleshed out.  The romantic angle is supposed to provide the great drama at the end of the film, but instead (at least to me) it fell a bit flat in the notion that there wasn't enough romantic chemistry built up along the way.<br /><br />Thus, while I loved the "Millionaire" segments and the ensuing drama that this film created, I felt that the background stories weren't quite compelling enough to turn this film into a classic.  However, it is one of those unique movies that a person must see for themselves to make an accurate judgment on, so I would urge you to check it out.  You may not LOVE it, but you will almost certainly LIKE it.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>Whew!  I just finished watching "Slumdog Millionaire" for the first time.  I'd hedged at watching it because I haven't had great luck with Indian films (though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U2U0E4">The Namesake</a> is pretty good).<br /><br />What should you know if you haven't seen this film yet, and you are trying to decide whether you should see it?  Here are a few thoughts:<br /><br />1) The film is set in Mombai, India<br />2) There are images of extreme poverty, including use and implied abuse of children, especially of orphans<br />3) There is portrayal of religious-based violence<br />4) There is street violence<br />5) The storyline is compelling, and you find it difficult to look away<br />6) The characters seem genuine, and the acting is good overall<br />7) You will find the cinematography and the casting to be outstanding<br /><br />To be frank, I didn't know what to expect when we started watching this film.  Just a few minutes into the film we sent our 10-yr old to another room to do something else while we watched this DVD.  This is NOT a film for children.  The violence and apparent hopeless situation of the children living in Mombai's slums was simultaneously heart-wrenching and exciting.<br /><br />A solid show through and through.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>First the Good: Acting and character selection as well as the choice of the music tracks. The three main characters (Jamal, Salim and Latika) are each portrayed by three different actors. The transitions are smooth, and they resemble quite a bit, so it makes it believable.<br />The storyline is made up of a series of back flashes that give you the background story of Jamal. A key element that ties the story together is Jamal's undying love for Latika, who he eventually wins over.<br /><br />The Bad: Latika becomes the servant of a gangster, and when she tries to run away, her face is scarred. Women are undermined in this film and treated more like property to be used and abused at will, rather than equal human beings. (Maybe this has to do with the Indian culture).<br /><br />The Ugly: What I found quite disturbing about this film is the over-emphasis on the cruelty shown to children. Displayed is the deliberate blinding of children so that when they go begging they would get twice as much. Additionally young Jamal is shown jumping into a sewerage pit and is totally covered in filth. In another scene, while Salim is sleeping naked, minced hot peppers are poured unto his private parts.<br />The elements of this film are tightly intertwined, but you may find that some of the images in this film can leave you disturbed.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Slumdog Millionaire" portrays the India that we were always told about as kids in the US - crowded and chaotic beyond belief, chock full of nothing but poverty and violence, filthy and disease-ridden, and full of people who wanted nothing more than to steal everything you had if you looked away for even a moment.  This is a portrayal of India at odds with the modern image in every way.  Having never visited, I couldn't tell you which is correct.  But it sure puts you off of any thoughts you ever had about going to the Taj Majal or anywhere else in the country.<br /><br />The majority of this movie is a oft-distressing downer, unrelenting in its grimness.  Nevertheless, the first part of the film starts to become unintentionally funny after a while.  As in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," whatever our hero does, things always get worse for him, and you can count on a calamity whenever he starts to become comfortable or happy.  The ending is indeed uplifting and a Triumph of the Human Spirit, but it's ultimately too little, too late.<br /><br />So what's good about the film?  The performances are fantastic across the board, and we really buy into the characters.  The cinematography is colorful and spectacular.  You can always count on Boyle for great photography, whether in his best films like "28 Days Later" or his worst, "Sunshine."  And, "Slumdog Millionaire" is interesting, even if depressing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-time Friday night movie, this is not what you want, despite how it was marketed.  Nevertheless, it's at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Whenever I watch Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire, I always hope for questions from the following categories: computers, Chicago Bears, The Karate Kid, internet videos, Yo Momma jokes, and famous midgets.  I'm sure I'd win it all.  It never happens, of course, and there ends up being questions about Zoroastrianism, famous European architecture, or Finnish lakes.  For one Indian slumdog, however, the stars align.<br /><br />A young man, Jamal, is a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire", and he's quickly turning into an improbable Ken Jennings-like participant with a nation of cheering .  He simply cannot lose, and none of the game-show or police officials, who torture him, believe he's doing it legitimately; they're willing to beat him in order to prove that he's cheating.  Time and time again, however, Jamal unfolds exhilarating tales of how he has answered the seemingly impossible questions, and proves through flashbacks that his difficult, poverty-stricken life filled with the pressure of both the impossible rags-to-riches life of urban Mumbai, India, but also a criminal element constantly grasping at his shoestrings, has provided him with a lot more knowledge than anyone could believe.<br /><br />Together with his brother Salim - who drifts towards the criminal element rather than living a more difficult ethical life - and the only woman he has ever loved, Latika, the three form as children their own version of the Three Musketeers.  When hardship causes them to separate multiple times in life, it's love that eventually brings Jamal back to his brother, and eventually Latika.  When he improbably ends up on the game-show, he realizes it is his best, and possibly last, chance at a dream life with Latika.<br /><br />Very rarely does a highly touted film actually deserve the praise Hollywood bestows upon it.  In the case of Slumdog Millionaire, I'd say that for a welcome change, the praise is warranted.  The story itself is enthralling; there is intense drama, excellent acting, and a total package that brings about heartbreaking emotion.  Comparable to several movies, I'd say this most closely resembles an Indian Romeo and Juliet, but with a less tragic ending.  Amidst the squalor of the Indian slums, this fast-paced gem shines right through the fast-rising garbage typical of Hollywood, as well as the garbage piling up in the Mumbai slums.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>I, like the rest of the world, heard about the Film of the Year; "Slumdog Millionaire".  However, I never overheard a clear explanation of the plot and what I did hear was more confusing than helpful; a dramatic story built around a gameshow.  In addition, I read where 2009 was such a mediocre year that a movie like "Slumdog Millionaire" might end up as Best Picture come Oscar time.<br /><br />"Slumdog Millionaire" IS a very good movie.  As it began, I thought that I was finding out too much too soon.  With all this information up front, how would the rest of the movie keep my attention.  Before long I realized the brilliance of its' cinematic concept; the answer to each question on the game show was learned in the school of Hard Knocks by our improbable hero, Jamal Malik.  Jamal has lived a tough life and every tragedy and misfortune was etched in his memory.  His seemimgly emotionless reaction to each correct answer on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" was a testimony to the suffering the answer brought to mind.  Naturally, the movie lets us in on the "stories behind the answers".  Along the way, we meet other characters important in Jamal's life as they weave in and out of his story.  The ending is somewhat predictable but we would be greatly disappointed otherwise.<br /><br />I guess "Slumdog Millionaire" IS a dramatic story built around a game show.  However, it didn't take a mediocre year to give it a chance to win Best Picture.  It would have competed in any other year as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>This was a good, heart-wrenching movie with a cliched ending, and good music score.  But best picture?  Wow.  Must have been a bad crop this year.  I enjoyed the film, its depiction of Jamal and his brother growing up as slum dogs, but there was something contrived about it as well.  Still, it was above average and kept me interested.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Jamal, his brother Silam, and Latika. All three children are orphaned in an attack on the Mumbai slum in which they live. They join forces to lead an adventurous, poverty-stricken life. Jamal and Silam become separated from Lakita in the midst of a daring escape from a gangster. For years thereafter, Jamal searches for Lakita. He finds her years later, only to be separated from her again.<br /><br />In desperation, Jamal manages to land a spot as a contestant on the Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", hoping aginst hope that Latika will be watching so they can be reunited. In a twist of destiny, Jamal discovers that, due to the unique experiences growing up in the slums, he knows the answer to question after question.<br /><br />Though there are definitely some very difficult parts of this movie to watch (especially at the beginning, when the primary characters are helpless children, prey to the unsavory environments that surround them), the film is ultimately uplifting. A marvel of casting, to boot, as a gifted actor portrays each of the princpal characters in different stages of life.<br /><br />Sooooo worth seeing. I really loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Slumdog Millionaire brings to life a most unusual but plausible story of a young man who had to raise himself with his brother on the streets of Mumbai and deal with his affection and ever increasing love for a young woman who seems to be pitifully elusive. In addition, he must fight against the thugs and street gangs, one of which his brother eventually joins for excitement and money. Yes, on the surface it's about a young man who is so good at the Indian TV version of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" that the police torture him to make him reveal "his way of cheating" on the quiz show. However, this film goes so much deeper; we see his life in a series of flashbacks as he explains to the police just how he was actually able to know all the answers to the questions on the quiz show. In addition, the cinematography and the choreography lack nothing; I couldn't ask for better. The casting was wonderfully done with great care and the acting is extremely convincing--wow, what a group of actors they had in this movie! The musical score enhances the movie as well.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet two young boys who are brothers, the very young Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar). After they witness their mother being brutally killed by an angry mob, the two young boys are defenseless and they toughen up pretty quickly to adapt to being on their own, although Salim seems to do a little bit better at it. Salim is not afraid of much and he even sells his brother's prized celebrity autograph merely because he wants the money for himself; when Jamal is upset about it Salim just smiles and says he got good money for it and so that makes it right. Already we are seeing Salim going to the wrong side of the tracks. Salim and Jamal also meet another orphaned child, Latika (Rubina Ali) and Jamal takes a liking to Latika almost immediately, he even feels that with a third kid they can be just like "The Three Musketeers!"<br /><br />As time goes by we see the boys grow and develop; but Latika is sadly left behind when the boys climb aboard a moving train to escape the evil operator of an "orphanage" who likes to maim the youngsters who he forces to beg for money in the streets. Jamal misses Latika very, very badly but Salim just makes light of it; Jamal however is determined to find Latika and ultimately make her his own no matter low long his search for her takes. Eventually they do find Latika but Salim and Latika mysteriously spurn Jamal; and then it takes Jamal several years more to find Latika again. As adults, we see the grown Jamal (Dev Patel), Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto) coping with life and trying to work on relationships as best they can under horrible circumstances that I will not reveal here; I don't want to give you any spoilers. Of course, what you do know is that Jamal makes it onto the quiz show and he is well on his way to winning a lot of money; he even gets around the game show host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who tries to throw Jamal off with a phony tip on the answer to the next question on the quiz show.<br /><br />The rest is left for you to discover; but I shall say you won't be bored. This is an excellent, poignant film that will leave you with quite a lasting impression. The extras on the DVD are quite well done, too. I especially liked the featurette entitled "Slumdog Dreams: Danny Boyle & The Making of Slumdog Millionaire." There are optional audio commentaries by director Danny Boyle and Dev Patel and producer Christian Colson and writer Simon Beaufoy. We get deleted scenes, too.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire makes a great addition to your DVD collection; it did win eight Academy Awards including the Oscar for Best Picture and that alone proves this movie is very, very special. There is a modicum of violence so if you're turned off by that you may wish to reconsider; but the way this plays out is so artistic that you might just want to get this and enjoy it anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IKBHODOTYYHM.html">A3IKBHODOTYYHM</a><br/><p>Jamal sits in a room, encountering an intense police investigation, as they try to figure out how a young, uneducated kid from the slums could possibly have known all the answers during his appearance on India's "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" We are taken through a series of flashbacks as he is questioned, and we learn about young Jamal's life with his brother, the difficulties and tragedies he's faced (such as the murder of his mother), the places he's been, and his initial meeting with childhood friend and eventual love, Latika. As perplexing as it seems, his ability to answer is based on some amazing coincidences, and he's also been able to find Latika several times and once even saves her from the clutches of a gangster. It seems that every time he catches up with her, fate intervenes and it is a short lived moment. The film moves back to the present, and the officers who interrogate the young man come to understand who he is. The two major conflicts within the story are: will Jamal be able to finally see Latika, his true love, and will he be the next millionaire. Certainly the love story takes precedent over his appearance on the show.<br /><br />There's a certain Dickens-like quality to the film, as it has amazing coincidences and a "rags-to-riches" feel to it. From the depths of poverty, the protagonist experiences pain in life but rebounds, and is given the chance of a lifetime.  There's also an aspect to the production where we cannot expect to take things at face value; things have a fantasy element to them, and the story can be likened to a parable about love or overcoming one's roadblocks in life.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire presents the often done "rags to riches" story in a unique manner and setting, and the film is worthy of its best picture status for 2008 (an award that has become a sham of late). Still, I felt that at some points the film dragged on a bit, and began to lose steam, and took some of the film's power with it. There is some violence, and some language, and the "feel good" label attached to Slumdog could be misleading without the resolution at the end.<br /><br />Over all, though, this is a film with heart, and its story was presented effectively. I'm glad I finally had the chance to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this movie but it runs the gamut of emotions.

It ultimately paints a strong autobiographical portrait.  For anybody who has the patience and tolerance, it is quite worthwhile, and the disc is excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JV4QKTEB7QBL.html">A1JV4QKTEB7QBL</a><br/><p>The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.<br /><br />In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film "Slumdog Millionaire" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.<br /><br />Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, "Slumdog Millionaire" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine. Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate. On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.<br /><br />Bottom Line? "Slumdog Millionaire" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit. Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign. No one need `ask the audience' for the final answer on this flick--it surely entertains on a variety of levels despite its predictability and almost ruthless exploitation of the viewer's emotions. Recommended especially for young adults.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></br></body></html>

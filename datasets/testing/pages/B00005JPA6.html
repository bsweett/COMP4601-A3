The plot of the movie is in way about the imagination and how it is in some cases a salvation from the extremes that existence can put one through (particularly in times of war).. but it is also about much more. this combination of fantasy and reality is familiar to all of the director work thus far.. he is clearly one of the most talented artists working today.. The cinematographic elements in this movie are very fine tuned - it is gorgeous to look at.. I am deeply impressed with the artistic nature of this work and have high hopes for subsequent projects del toro might endeavor... I do not understand the impatience that most americans have for watching subtitled films.. about half the movies i watch are foreign language films.. If we truly live in a global community then why don't we act like it?</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Mexican born director, Guillermo del Toro's magnificently crafted fantasy "Pan's Labyrinth" is a film geared toward an adult audience. Filmed in Spain, it is set in the post Spanish Civil War countryside in 1944.  A young girl Ofelia played superbly by Ivana Baquero is being transported along with her mother to an uncertain future in a rural province.<br /><br />Her widowed mother Carmen played by Ariadna Gil has remarried and is joining her new husband Captain Vidal played by Sergi Lopez.  The captain is a grotesque sadistic martinet who cares only for the baby carried by the pregnant Carmen.  The draconian circumstances of her surroundings pushes Ofelia into a fantasy world populated by fairies and a faun like creature presumably Pan.<br /><br />The fantasy world is based in a stone labyrinth adjacent to the mill in which the captain and his troops are headquartered.  She is convinced that she is Princess Moana, daughter of the king of the underworld.  She must perform some tasks designated by the faun to re-enter this magical land.<br /><br />del Toro finds a proper balance between fantasy and reality to tell this touching story in which a young child must navigate herself through a series of dire incidents which will delineate her future.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E3F04ZK7FG66.html">A2E3F04ZK7FG66</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a film about the role choice and blind obedience has in shaping the destinies of the individual as well as society. The film consists of two tales that are skillfully interwoven with the same twelve year old girl, Ofelia, at the center of each. One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each. However, as the film progresses, the magical world crosses over more and more into the real world. For example, the key, the dagger, and the monsters encountered in the magical world have definite analogs in the earthly realm.<br /><br />There is much that is left open for interpretation in this film. For example, until the end you are not sure if Pan is even telling the girl the truth. Is he actually leading her to a higher destiny, or does he just need someone to perform the three tasks in order to get something for himself? Why does Pan get younger and younger as the film progresses? Since Ofelia has a love of magical stories and nobody else actually sees any of the magical occurrences, are they real or just ways for the girl to escape her increasingly sad situation and environment? Most of the characters in the "real world" part of the film, however, are completely unambiguous. Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal, is the most shining example. From the beginning he plays a man devoted to detail, to the extinction of the rebels, and to his own legacy. He seems to have no human feelings and is as made of stone as the labyrinth that inhabits his property. This is made clear early in the film by a violent scene in which two villagers that claim to be hunting rabbits are killed by Vidal as suspected rebels. When he later finds a rabbit in the mens' belongings that seems to confirm their story, his only reaction is that of irritation at his men for not more thoroughly searching the villagers before bothering him with the matter.<br /><br />If you enjoy tales of magic and fantasy in which everything is not sewed up into a tidy happy ending, and you appreciate how the visual aspect of film can contribute to the mood of various scenes, I strongly advise you check this movie out. It is far more original and interesting than anything I saw Hollywood come up with last year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever...<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>A few reviewers previous to mine have stated that this isn't as good as many have insisted that it is.  On one level I agree:  it is even better than the large host of avid reviewers have said.  One has to go all the way back to 1946 and Jean Cocteau's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST to find a grown up fantasy film of such power and beauty.  To call this a masterpiece in reality is to engage in banalities.  It is more than that:  it is the touchstone for all future efforts at grown up fantasy.  I don't want to demean THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but that was at its heart a film more for kids than adults.  I fully endorse showing it to all but the most sensitive young children.  But PAN'S LABYRINTH should be restricted to adults only.<br /><br />The film is set around the time of the allied invasion of Normandy, several years after the victory of the fascists over the leftists in the Spanish Civil War.  Ofelia is a young girl whose mother is traveling to a remote area of Spain where her husband, the brutal military leader Capit&aacute;n Vidal is engaged in his task of suppressing the resistance that has refused to acknowledge the fascist regime in Spain.  He is on every level a wretched man, focused entirely on appearance and on producing a male heir and otherwise oblivious of the needs of Ofelia's mother, who is suffering a difficult pregnancy.<br /><br />Ofelia is a reader of books, many of them fairy or folk tales.  Very early in the film she finds herself entering a fairy tale of her own when she sees a praying mantis that she imagines is a fairy and which turns out to be, in fact, a fairy tale.  The fairy leads her through a nearby maze to an entrance to an underground staircase at the bottom of which she encounters a rather gruesome fawn who informs her that she is in fact the daughter of an underground king and is in fact immortal.  He gives her a book of blank pages that he tells her will show her what tasks she must complete in order to return to her parents and her kingdom.<br /><br />The most interesting thing to me about Ofelia's story is that while one is tempted to read this as an attempt to escape from the hellishness of her life under Capit&aacute;n Vidal, nowhere is there a hint that her adventures occur merely in her head.  The closest one comes to anything like this is the very end, where Capit&aacute;n Vidal sees Ofelia, whom we have seen talking to the fawn.  While we can see the fawn, Vidal cannot.  But it is surely not a stretch to imagine that she could see it while he could not, especially given the fact that she was able to enter the entrance to the stairway via a route not accessible to Vidal.  In other words, we are not supposed to be reading her descendence to her previous home as metaphorically escapist, even if it literally is so.<br /><br />This is a gruesome film.  It is an interesting combination of horribly realistic events combined with nightmarish fantasy scenes.  Vidal is far more monstrous than any of the fantasy creatures Ofelia encounters.  He has a tendency towards violence and cruelty.  He shoots people with only the slightest provocation and does not hesitate to torture suspects with his bare hands.  The tasks that Ofelia are asked to complete are hardly more terrible than what she has to endure living under Vidal's roof.  Despite all the horrors, however, despite all the tragic events in the film, the movie has a wonderfully happy ending that does not feel tacked on.  Rather, it feels like just compensation for all the wretched events in the film.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful though with one exception I do not think I've seen any of the performers in any previous film.  Ivana Baquero is extraordinary as Ofelia.  She has a magnificent presence throughout the film and recalls some of the finest child actresses of the past few decades, including Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Anna Paquin.  Sergi L&oacute;pez is oppressively dominating as Vidal.  He easily goes down as one of the most evil characters I've ever witnessed on film and his final moment, in which the worst vengeance is brought upon him, seems completely just.  Maribel Verd&uacute; plays Mercedes, the head housekeeper who befriends Ofelia and who is an informant to the resistence in the mountains.  I mentioned above that I had seen only one performer before.  That is Doug Jones, who has carved an interesting niche in film.  Initially a professional mime, Jones gradually has taken a number of fascinating roles requiring unusual degrees of physical expression.  I first became aware of him in the famous Emmy-nominated episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER entitled "Hush, where he played one of the Gentlemen.  But Jones will be familiar to most film fans from his role of Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro's film HELLBOY, a role he is reprising for HELLBOY 2.  In PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones plays two roles, the fawn and the pale monster whose eyes are in his hands.  Both characters are unforgettable (much like the Gentlemen in BUFFY), once seen never to be forgotten.<br /><br />A couple of reviewers have stated that this film is "boring."  I have absolutely no idea what they were talking about or what their film going background is.  I will state in no qualified terms that I can't imagine any sophisticated film viewer not being completely astonished by this film.  I can state in complete honesty that this is the finest film of any kind that I have seen in many years.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>This is a movie that will surprise you(for starters, it's much more brutal than most expect...not that I had a problem w/this, but some have been surprised and turned off by it's harsh violence). Yes, the fantasy stuff is beautifully done, but it is the intense drama and branching conflicts within these storylines that will have you captivated. The other worldy elements combine with the the melodrama perfectly here, each playing an important part in the slow unraveling of a far more intricate tale than I expected. This is one of those movies where you know within the first five minutes you are onto something special; It's nice to actually see a film that lives up to it's critical praise, and in this case, even surpass it. Not to be missed!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her very pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariana Gil) to their new home in the countryside. Civil War rages in Spain, so Ofelia's mother has decided to marry Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who will be able to protect them and care for them. Vidal is leading an assault against the revolutionaries and wants to protect his new wife, who is pregnant, but more importantly, his new son, who will carry on his name. Carmen is having a difficult pregnancy and her doctor confines her to her bed immediately upon arrival. Ofelia meets Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), the housekeeper, who watches the new family with interest. One day, Ofelia is playing outside when she comes across a strange bug, leading her to an overgrown hedge maze and a strange world where she meets Pan (Doug Jones), a sort of emissary for another world inhabited by fairies, fawns and other strange creatures. He sets Ofelia a challenge and if she successfully completes it, she will take her place alongside the king as his princess.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a beautifully realized, very violent, sometimes scary, sometimes politically charged adult fairy tale. I can't say the word "adult" enough. If you take small children to see this, be prepared to pay for some therapy.<br /><br />That said, "Pan's" is a strange and somewhat wonderful film.<br /><br />Del Toro, who has had better success working in his native tongue ("The Devil's Backbone") but has also directed "Mimic", "Hellboy" and "Blade 2" in the United States, combines elements of fantasy, horror and fairy tales with actual historical events to create a lively, beautiful world. The elements and influences of historical events help to make the overall film more powerful; we have all seen films filled with wonderful CGI creations, but they don't seem real. In these cases, the filmmaker wants to show off their tools, everything they can imagine. But when they spend so much time on the effects, they have little time or talent to develop characters or narrative. Del Toro achieves this delicate balance by rooting the story in the real world.<br /><br />Some of the characters or events may have been changed, or fictionalized, but the action is rooted in real history, grounding the fantasy elements in reality. Another factor helping all of these items blend together is the historical setting. Because the story is set over sixty years ago, during the Spanish Civil War in the 1940s, it also lends itself to a more fairy tale quality. Colors are a little more saturated, everything is a little old fashioned looking and it becomes more real. As we come to accept the environment, we become more willing to accept the creatures living in this world.<br /><br />Del Toro waits for the story to get going before delving into this other fantasy world. And once he does, we have to specifically enter this world, meet these creatures along with Ofelia. She is our guide, our escort. Also, the film alternates between these two worlds, reminding us of Ofelia's real life circumstances. All of these choices help to make the film real.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is an adult fairy tale and you should pay special attention to the word "adult". If you take a child to this film expecting to see a live action version of "Alice in Wonderland" you should also arranged for some ongoing therapy. This is a beautiful film, but it is also a violent and bloody film. But in a way, this makes it all the more wonderful.<br /><br />Ofelia has misgivings about going to live with her mother's new husband, Captain Vidal. And we quickly learn her initial feelings are justified. Vidal is a mean, cruel and sadistic man. Charged with squashing the revolutionaries, he will stop at nothing to accomplish this. If he catches one, he gets the information he needs and kills them. His men are instructed to be just as merciless.<br /><br />This violence is mirrored in the fantasy world Ofelia enters. All of the best fantasy films and fairy tales use elements from the "real world" in the fantasy realm and "Pan's" follows this tradition. Not only is Ofelia's quest tied to her real world, but she encounters challenges and violence in this place she so desperately seeks for escape.<br /><br />Ivana Baquero is very good as Ofelia, the young girl thrust into two new and very different worlds. Following in the footsteps of other good child actors, she brings an innocence to the role making the character all the more memorable. She seems vulnerable, but shows some strength as she begins to enter this other fantasy world. Like Cinderella, Wendy and other fairy tale heroines, Ofelia has both a natural curiosity and fearlessness that suits her well. Baquero shows how much Ofelia cares for her sick mother, how much she is willing to go through, and the various aspects of her character.<br /><br />As mentioned, Captain Vidal is a mean, intense man and Sergi Lopez makes him even more memorable. The role is a bit stereotypical; a few too many explosive moments, but when Vidal is quiet, he is more effective and more menacing. There are scenes in which Sergi Lopez demonstrates both of Vidal's methods of intimidation; in some, the Captain merely speaks, saying things that turn his victim's hearts cold. These are by far the better, scarier moments. When he screams and shouts, he appears far too stereotypical and villainish.<br /><br />Maribel Verdu plays Mercedes, the Captain's housekeeper. She stands by and watches as Vidal takes out his frustrations on her people, the local townspeople who are also revolutionaries, but she says nothing to protect her position. As soon as Ofelia and her mother arrive, she senses Ofelia may be something special and looks out for her, in a way, without jeopardizing her position. Soon, she can't stand it anymore and exacts her revenge on the sadistic Captain in a very memorable way.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a real find and instantly brought to mind the same feeling I had after I discovered the work of Peter Jackson or Jean Pierre Jeunet. Their films are similar in tone, style and look. If there is a difference, it is that Del Toro's films are more violent. People will be harmed and some will die. But that doesn't detract from the beauty of the characters, story, events he depicts in this very special "Labyrinth".</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>A few weeks ago, as I was wrapping up 2006, I looked back on the films that I had seen and proclaimed "United 93" as my personal choice for best film of the year.  While that film's message resonates on a primal and emotional level for most viewers, I think it's easy to forget that it is also great filmmaking.  The choices Paul Greenglass makes, the lack of "character" development, the mundane real-time documentary feel--these unconventional technical elements combine to form a powerful and relevant film (even without the political undertones of the actual event).  Another film that capaitalizes on its technical merits and combines them (albeit in a very different way) with politics and a heartrending story is "Pan's Labyrinth."  A film that impressed me on every level, involved me, and moved me in surprising ways--I now have to admit that I was premature with my "best film" choice.  So let me revise.  "Pan's Labyrinth" now stands side by side with "United 93" as my personal favorite for 2006.<br /><br />The beauty of Guillermo del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" can be defined in many ways.  First and foremost, though, I'd have to single out the complexity of the storytelling.  This Spanish film can be appreciated as a child's fantasy, or a look at fascism and rebellion, or an intense and harrowing family drama, or a horror movie, or a study of the nature of violence.  Interweaving different components that should not work together, del Toro has crafted a singularly unique film that takes risks.  This adult fable expertly combines vicious and graphic brutality with the wonderment and fantasy of childhood.  Like nothing you've seen before, "Pan's Labyrinth" is an artistic marvel.  The narrative is enhanced by a beautiful score, tremendous effects, wonderful art direction and cinematography.<br /><br />The plot of "Pan's Labyrinth" follows 12 year old Ofelia, who relocates with her pregnant mother to the home of her new stepfather in the Spanish countryside.  A Fascist officer near the end of World War II, the stepfather is on assignment to oust the rebels from the hills surrounding the estate.  Ofelia, obsessed with fairy tales, becomes caught up in a fantastical underground world where she is a princess and must undertake various missions to help reclaim the kingdom.  The story of the Officer's indifference and contempt for Ofelia while her mother endures a difficult pregnancy provides strong domestic drama, scenes of the Officer's confrontations and torture of the rebels provides harrowing intrigue and action, and Ofelia's underground caverns provides horror and wonder and one of the most expertly crafted "fantasy" worlds depicted on film.<br /><br />All of the actors are wonderful, and their contributions should not be overlooked.  The actress who portrays Ofelia, in particular, carries a heavy burden--but pulls off the complexity of the varying storylines.  Amazingly, any of the individual story threads would make a great film on its own--each is developed and has real emotional consequence.  But by putting them together with such effectiveness, del Toro has created his masterpiece--bold, unconventional, thrillingly different.  "Pan's Labyrinth" is nominated for screenplay and 4 technical Oscars and is the likely winner of Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.  But winning awards is nothing new for this incredible film.  Already recognized internationally by many, many countries--"Pan's" was also this country's National Society Of Film Critics choice for Best Picture of the Year.<br /><br />I was thrilled by "Pan's" filmmaking, but more importantly I was moved by its story and performances.  My highest recommendation, "Pan's Labyrinth" is a film I will cherish and remember.  KGHarris, 01/07.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>With 6 Oscar nominations, this beautifully crafted film by Guillermo del Toro is worthy of every one,and more. The brutality of war as seen through the eyes of a child, and that child's escape to her labyrinth world (which is, in some ways, almost as brutal) is the center of the film, and no one is spared. Brilliantly photographed and designed, Ofelia's fantasy world seems to be her only escape. Of course, things are deeper and more complicated than that, but I won't blab anything away.As Ofelia, young Ivana Baquero makes an auspicious film debut. Her understanding of the material is so natural; Sergi Lopez is a nasty villain, who really believes that his mindless, evil behavior is his only recourse. Most of all, Maribel Verdu, as Mercedes, the housekeeper, is absolutely brilliant. At just under 2 hours, there is never a slow moment, and the subtitles are rarely a distraction; the story-line flows as easily as a babbling brook. This is certainly an original take on the fantasy films that have inundated the screens of late, but few are as compelling and thought-provokng. Though a little too violent and gory for kids, this is highly recommended for all discerning film-goers. Bravo, Senor del Toro!  UPDATE: The 2-disc DVD is outstanding; loaded with smart extras, and a pristine widescreen print of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>Pan's labyrinth is a magical film that will keep you engrossed and delighted the whole way through. The film is set in wartime Spain and is in Spanish with subtitles. The direction is superb and the story kept me gripped the whole time, I didn't check my watch once. It is based around a Spanish regiment fighting the guerrillas and follows the step-daughter of the captain and how she cares for her pregnant mother and immerses herself in fairy tales and magic. It is wonderfully fantastical and just surreal enough to lend it an edge. All the actors play their roles brilliantly and the effects are out of this world. I guess you can tell from my already gushing review that I loved this film. It is different from the usual films churned out these days and I loved every minute. Some scenes are quite graphic in places and the violence can make you wince, but none of it is particularly gratuitous and it all plays a part in the overall story. This is well worth a view, I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated I would and it comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This is one of the most imaginative and unique films I have seen in years. It is a dark fairy tale for adults and is not a children's movie. The film is a mixture of fairy tale and dark realism since it combines images from the Mediterranean's pre-Christian mythologies with the horror of Fascism in Franco's Spain. The overlap between these two concepts, classical mythology and fascism, is violence and threat as well as unreasonable power over the powerless. Myths often involve heroic action, often taken by an innocent person or child, that helps overcome the forces of evil. The film is very skillful in combining these concepts where they are verbalized by the mythical creatures but we see a parallel world in reality as the rustic peasants develop resistance to the forces of fascism.<br />The transitional character between the fantasy world of mythology and the harsh world of fascist reality is a little girl, the daughter of the new wife of a Fascist officer. She travels between these world through an ancient labyrinth hidden in the woods outside the fascist compound. Here she meets mischievous fairies but also a somewhat threatening and mysterious faun who is ambiguous as to his full intentions. The faun is identified as Pan, the child of the god Hermes, who was the god of transitions and doorways. She is told she is the Princess Moana and must undertake 3 tasks to gain her rightful throne. As in many myths, this child is given three tasks to claim their rightful position with the gods. This puts our young heroine into danger not only when she is in the labyrinth performing tasks but also when she is with her mother and step-father among the fascist and hidden resistance fighters. The adventures within the mythological world with a giant toad full of slime to an amazing monster who is awakened when someone eats from his table and who sees through eyeballs in the palms of his hands.<br />To achieve the tasks prescribed by the gods and to overcome the evils of fascism, resilience and creativity are required and so once again we see overlap between the two worlds. Monstrosity can be reflected in the world of imaginary monsters but also in the acts of the fascists as they torture and kill innocent villagers as well as resistance fighters.  The young female protagonist is not fully protected from the evil of her step-father by her weak mother, suffering with a difficult pregnancy and childbirth. She does not feel fully protected and she is indeed vulnerable to the dark gaze of her dark murderous step-father. She is most protected by the housekeeper who plays many roles in this complex film. Children may retreat into fantasy when threatened but this poor little girl finds a fantasy world that demand much of her and a real world full of real dark threats. This film has some of the best integration of fantasy and reality since A.S. Byatt's the Dijin in the Nightingale's Eye or the works of Borges.<br /> This film has a different feel to it from a Hollywood production, since it has some ragged ends and images that are more European than North American. This is part of the film's strength. The Pan creature for example would have probably been more of a Santa Claus with goat legs if the film had been made in Hollywood. Instead, he is mysterious and ambiguous in a world with little clarity.<br /><br />The child actress Ivana Baquero plays the child Ofelia. She does a super job. Sergi Lopez plays her evil, cruel, fascist step-father Captain Vidal. He is an excellent actor and he has the ability to radiate threat on the screen. All scripts, sets, costumes, special effects, and cinematography were excellent. It all comes together into a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>Stunning visuals like stepping into the 'virtual world' of Hieronymus Bosch!  That the tale is told in Spanish only adds to the mystique.  Seriously trippy - and violent too.  Watch a large preying mantis-like wood bug change into a fairy and lead you into the dark woods and 'the labyrinth'.  Yes, it could almost be a fairy tale - in the modern sense of the word - but for the violence, which is quite severe in places.  In that regard, it is more like the original faery tales long before they were Disnified, and which could also be somewhat gruesome. Set in Franco's Spain at the end of world war II, the story follows a young girl's entrance into a magical world as a cruel dictator, her would-be step-father, wages war against rebels in the forest outside.  Not for the kiddies.  There is a heavy kind of menace and violence that helps convince and adds weight to the story in the right places.  Bloody yet swift-moving, it is a tale cloaked in layers of art, symbolism, spirituality and * magic *.  What a rich tone this movie has - so full of dark and light, a masterpiece of color.  The fact that it is in Spanish (English subtitles) really does enhance its mystique and somehow gives greater authenticity to its magic.  A very potent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Most of you who read my reviews know I don't watch many films that are subtitled. I know, I know, I'm lazy, but it's really not that I'm lazy, it's that I find it a bit distracting. Fortunately this film is well worth reading subtitles for. For those of you not aware of this<br /><br />*** THIS FILM IS IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES!***<br /><br />This is a very well made film and beautifully told story. It has a nightmarish quality that will stick with you long after watching it. The film is nothing like I thought It would be and that is one of the reasons I put off watching this for so long. It's really a fantastic film and should not be missed by movie lovers.<br /><br />The film is definitely not for children as it has some graphic violence and it can be scary at times.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Director Guillermo del Toro out did himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the results of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is really one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.<br /><br />It is 1944 Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, is the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze or are they figments?<br /><br />You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog.

Ofelia discovers that she has a powerful connection to a grotesque, wonder-filled world of magic and fantasy and undergoes great drama as events come to a head in both the realms of magic and reality.<br /><br />Director / writer Guillermo del Toro has established himself as one of the premier fantasists of cinema.  His distinctive visual sense is used to great advantage here.  This fairy tale is not so much for children as for adults who may have forgotten the horror at the root of all fairy tales in this Disneyfied era, as well as their mythic connections to real world events.  Del Toro remembers and incorporates this understanding in his powerful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film.  It is also a very disturbing and violent fairytale.  Think back to the original dark Grimm fairytales that give children nightmares (NOT the prettied up Disney versions), and you will be getting close.<br /><br />This movie is an adult fantasy, and absolutely not recommended for children under 18.  It is extremely intense, quite violent, and deals with very mature topics: death, war, poverty, fascism, and human brutality.  Conversely, this film also takes us into a fantasy world that helps a small child escape from her horrific reality.  This bizarre combination ignites the viewer's imagination. It is emotionally gripping; we become wholly invested in this young girl's tragic life.<br /><br />This unusual story is filled with some remarkable acting.  The cinematography is graphic and stunning.  The film has an almost dream-like quality to it, which serves to enhance the brutality of the "real world" scenes.  We ache to see this girl escape - to be safe - yet, we know that she cannot.  At least not in the real world.  But, just perhaps we hope, the fantasy world can help her.<br /><br />Although very disturbing, Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing and unexpected triumph.  I give it my highest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" works on two levels; one is a fantasy world populated by faeries and fantastical creatures, many of whom are brought to heel or outwitted by a little girl, Ophelia.  The other is a grim tale from Franco's Spain in 1944 and the struggle between the reigning forces and the opposition.  Parallel worlds intersect and clash, reaching a bittersweet ending where good triumphs over evil.<br /><br />The movie is filed with arresting images: the chattering mantis-like stick insect, wood nymphs, the horned faun and the cannibalistic Pale Man.<br /><br />Superb!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>The magic of storytelling is alive and well in Pan's Labyrinth.

With the brutality of war all around her and a mother who seems destined to not survive her pregnancy, Ofelia's escape from the horrors of the world are in her collection of fairy tales, including one that seems to come alive in an ancient labyrinth.<br /><br />In one of Ofelia's books, she learns of Princess Moanna, the daughter of an underworld King, who is believed to live in the mortal world, but will someday return to rule alongside her father.  One night in the labyrinth, Ofelia meets a faun who tells her she is the lost Princess and will be able to return home if she completes three tasks.  I say she "meets" a faun, others may say she "imagines" meeting a faun.  The film is open to interpretation, as those who believe in fairy tales see the entire action of the film as true, while others see her supernatural adventures as a young child's imaginative way of dealing with war and death.<br /><br />Ofelia's quest to complete the faun's tasks makes up much of the plot of Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth.  Almost oblivious to the war around her, Ofelia battles giant toads and child-eating monsters, scenes presented in brilliant colors that juxtapose the dark bluish-grey scenes of war.  Countering her story is the Captain's brutal dictatorship over the mountain, as he kills without cause and tortures to both get answers and satisfy urges within.  Although a film advertised as a "fairy tale", the true-to-life violence in the Captain's scenes rivals anything released since The Passion of the Christ.  Del Toro unapologetically displays the real consequences of meeting flesh to a blade or the butt of a gun.<br /><br />That the director doesn't distinguish between his two stories, that he doesn't favor one over the other is the magic of Pan's Labyrinth.  Viewers who believe are just as convinced as to the existence of the fawn as they are of the guerillas.  And to those of us who have never known war, we can relate just as much to the enchantment of Ofelia's dreams as we can to the barbarity of Spain's nightmare.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>The Labyrinth of the Faun--Pan's Labyrinth--surprised me on a few fronts: It was R-rated; it was in Spanish; and it was a very very good movie...one of the best that I've seen this year.<br /><br />But then my expectations were set to excellence knowing that Pan's Labyrinth is a Guillermo del Toro film. Del Toro first caught my attention back in 1997 with Mimic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558908323">Mimic</a> , a fair attempt at Sci-fi/Horror. After Del Toro did the second installation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKWJ">Blade II (New Line Platinum Series)</a> of The Blade Series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007WFX62">The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity)</a> in 2002, he went right onto my watch list of directors whose next movie that I don't want to miss (and he has not disappointed).<br /><br />Other than seeing the trailer and identifying Pan's Labyrinth as a Del Toro film, I'm glad that I didn't bother to read anything else about the movie prior to seeing it (which I always avoid as much as possible in order to keep the element of surprise in play), because I might have been discouraged by a lot of the "Spanish fairy tale with English subtitles" comments.<br /><br />Forget fairy tale, folks. Did I mention R-rating? Very rarely do you see any movie described as a fairy tale with an R-rating. And the R-rating is really too bad here, because it definitely cost Del Toro some box office bucks. But you have to hand it to the guy for keeping the integrity of the film intact. There's one scene (okay...maybe two) that sealed the R-rating and could easily have been lightened up involving a local farmer and his son confronting the fascist Capit&aacute;n Vidal assigned search out and crush anti-fascist rebels in post Civil War Spain.<br /><br />The star of this movie is young Ivana Baquero in the role of Ofelia. While the idea of this tween venturing so bravely into such a dark fantasy is a bit stretched, Baquero really makes you believe that she believes it. The movie starts with Ofelia and her Mom en route to their new accommodations at the camp of Capit&aacute;n Vidal and his troops circa 1944.<br /><br />Upon arrival at the camp, Ofilia is shown a Labyrinth where she meets one UMF (ugly male faun) named Pan who gives Ofelia a Book of Crossroads, which explains tasks that she must complete in order to escape her new living arrangement and take her place as Princess of the Underworld.<br /><br />Doug Jones is Pan and also the eerie Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth, and this guy plays a great monster. Del Toro used him in 2004's HellBoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008EY65">Hellboy (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> as the aquatic Abe Sapien, and you can see him as The Silver Surfer Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer out in theaters this month.<br /><br />I'm pretty liberal when it comes to what I'll let my kids watch, but Pan's Labyrinth is out of reach (mainly due to the brutalities of Capit&aacute;n Vidal as opposed to the nightmarish images). For adults...fans of Horror/Sci-fi/Fantasy shouldn't miss this genre gem.<br /><br />P.S.--There's often an aversion by some to watch a movie with subtitles, but I'd highly suggest resisting the English audio track and going with the natural Spanish audio track with English subtitles to add that extra element of reality to this well done fantasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Very compelling tale of a young girl who is forced with her sickly and ready to conceive mother, to live with her cruel father in the 1930's war torn Spanish countryside.  Her father is El Capitan of a military force seeking out rebels against the government.  He loves to torture and brutally murder anybody he catches, whether they are rebels or not (warning: some of the scenes are so graphic that they are difficult to watch if you have a weak stomach).  The girl's means of blocking out all this cruelty are the fairy tales her mother tells her.  Suddenly those fairy tales seem to come to life as the girl meets a fairy that takes her to see Faun in the area near the house called the Labyrinth (it is like a large maze).  The Faun tells her that she is a princess from another land and the only way for her to open the portal to get back is to perform three brave tasks.

This film has some very graphic and intense scenes in it,certainly too much for most children and possibly a plot a little too sophistocated for most kids as well. Pan's Labyrinth follows our main character Ofilia who endulges in books of fairy tales and fantsy set against a historical background of civil war in Spain of 1944.Her expecting mother and her step father "El Capitan" as she refers to him and one of the servants Mercedes.Ofilia's mother is having a difficult pregnency and is driven out to the coutry to have her child in the presence and insistnce of her new husband.Ofilia discovers a Labyrinth on the property,and is later visited by a fairy that night who leads her through the Labyrinth where she meets Pan,or more commonly known as "the faun".There she learns(as told by Pan) that she is the living soul of a princess from a far away land that thrived long ago in an alternate universe.They have been waiting for her return since her leaving for earth and passing so long ago.There,Pan gives Ofilia three tasks to proove her returning and that she has not been corrupted, each task more dangerous and risky than the next. Her first is to retreive a special key, the next...an artifact guarded by a slumbering demon which she just barely escapes with her life from and the last is the sacrifice of an innocent,all to be done before the approaching full moon.Through all the twisits and turns of Pan's world intermingling with the struggles of reality,is Ofilia really the decendent of royality from a far away land,is Pan real or imaginary?If so...is what he is asking her to do for good or evil intentions?Ofilia's world clashes with the very real world of war and a very cruel and sadistic step father.Pan's Labryinth is a fairy tale as told in stories long ago from authors like "The Brother's Grimm". Three tasks, causes and consequences for being defiant, it all comes full circle. This is a fantastic film, excellent art and design,beautifully photograhed,told and directed to perfection by director Guliermo Del Torro.True this film is subtitled in Spanish, but it is done well. I struggle with subtitiles myself, but I could understand a good portion of this film even when I wasn't focussing on reading subtitiles so much.A dubbed version of this film would be horrifically insulting and really "take away" the magic of this film.So "suck it up" and deal with the Spanish subtitles.Good fantasy films are hard to come by, and there are really only an elite few out there that pass as good ones.Pan's Labyrinth however will go down as a classic in my opinion.Multiple nominations were given and awarded to this film,and for good reason and adding it to a DVD collection will only enrich it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RDR5G65D9H84.html">A2RDR5G65D9H84</a><br/><p>Every once in a while, we get the opportunity to watch a film that shows what can be done when artistry is used in the way it is intended to be used. In this uncompromising movie, Guillermo del Toro goes all out to deliver a fairy tale that grabs the viewer's emotions and takes them on a rollercoaster ride. The R rating already indicates that this is not your typical fairy tale, but instead it is more in line with the more classic fairy tales of the past, like the uncensored tales by the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />Our main character, Ofelia, is a girl in her early teens who loves to read fairy tales and has a most vivid imagination. At the beginning of the story, she is traveling with her pregnant mother, Carmen, to meet with Captain Vidal in an encampment in the Spanish countryside. The Civil War has ended, but there are still guerrillas fighting for the Republic, and Vidal's task is to help annihilate them. He has forced Carmen to come join him because he is the father of the unborn child and wants the birth to occur in his presence; he completely disregards the dangers of the journey for Carmen in such a late stage of her pregnancy. This is just a glimpse into the Captain's personality, which will be revealed as the movie progresses.<br /><br />Ofelia lost her father in the Civil War, and now uses her fantasy world to endure the situation in which she is in, a mother debilitated by the pregnancy, and a stepfather that is an ogre. She creates an imaginary world based on a book she read and on a stone labyrinth by the military camp. In her fantasy, she meets a faun, who gives her three tasks to carry before the full moon. By completing these, she will become a princess. During these tasks, Ofelia faces monsters that she does not dare face in the real world, and we are exposed to a plot full of cleverly created metaphors.<br /><br />As the fantasy progresses, the clear line between good and bad in the real versus the fantasy world, starts to blur. The story gets darker and there is a fair amount of violence involved. I do not think that the use of this violence is excessive though, since it helps communicate the full extent of the evil behind some of the characters.<br /><br />Besides the great story and masterful direction, this film presents us with enchanting music and neat make-up and wardrobe displays. On top of that, the actors perform their roles convincingly, especially in the cases of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Baquero's performance is on par with some other great performances by kids in the past, such as Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Wood. Lopez is so good in his role that you feel like grabbing him out of the screen and beating him senseless. I highly recommend this movie, it is a masterpiece!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is a fantay for adults featuring the character of Greek mythology -- Pan -- that appears under its other name, Faunus, and its relationship with a young girl to whom it promises eternity if she fulfills certain fantiastic and difficult requirements. The film was made in Spain and is in Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />Set in fascist Spain during late World War II, a girl goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather, a ruthless and vile Army captain. She meets a fairy -- a Peter Pan butterfly type fluttering around on wings of gossamer -- that takes her to the labyrinth where she meets Pan, whom the film calls faun. Pan explains to the girl the terms of her involvement and, should she fulfill these duties, she will become a princess for life. Or something like that.<br /><br />She takes steps to fulfill her duty, only to regularly run into problems with hobgoblins, bizarre creatures without eyes, lots more fairies floating around, and other distractions. Fortunately, Pan provides her with magic chalk with which she can create her own door whenever she needs to escape one of these moments.<br /><br />In the denouement she must take her new baby brother to the labyrinth and do something really bad with him. When she refues, the story peaks. In the meantime, bad guy stepdad and his army buddies have pretty much worn her down, offed her mom, and sent everyone she knows packing. It wasn't clear at the end of the film whether or not she had fulfilled her duty and achieved her salvation.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is, in my opinion, a high class chick flick. It is full of magic, fantastic scenes and creatures, events that transcend reality, and its heroes are all women and the young girl that stars. The men are almost all bad guys and stepdad is the second coming of Darth Vadar.<br /><br />This movie will interest a lot of people because of its fantastic and lyrical storyline and its marvelous effects. Parents of minor children should be warned there is a lot of violence in the film, much that is graphic in nature, making this far more an adult fairy tale than one for kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of "Pan's Labyrinth," however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.<br /><br />The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.<br /><br />There's no denying that "Pan's Labyrinth" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in "The Wizard of Oz," the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of "Das Boot."<br /><br />Yet, for all its good points, "Pan's Labyrinth" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in "Pan's Labyrinth" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the "Lord of the Rings" saga or "The Wizard of Oz." We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.<br /><br />Thus, although the parts in "Pan's Labyrinth" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>When I think theoretically about some films of mixed genres I can't come up with any excuses for them to exist, because - again theoretically - the idea itself seems absurd. But on the other hand when I try to recall some and primarily From Dusk Till Dawn comes to mind, I start thinking it's not a bad idea after all. So although you can call Pan's Labyrinth whatever you want - a fairy tale, a war drama, a fantasy or a Harry Potter for adults - it's neither of the above. This movie exists out of any genre and that's almost always a sign of a good picture.<br /><br />Ofelia comes along with her mother to a remote mountain village in the Northern Spain where mother's new husband is waiting for them - a sadistic captain Vidal who, after general Franco had taken over Spain, was directed to the rural fort to fight guerillas. In one of the nights Ofelia, who lives in her own imaginary world, meets Pan from a fairy tale who tells her she must accomplish three tasks so that the fairy tale kingdom he's from can go on.<br /><br />And so the action begins. Half of the film looks like real life where captain and his soldiers are tracking down guerillas in the woods and fighting them. Another half is Ofelia's adventures in the world that looks not so real. But who knows - you'll be waiting till the very end of the film to discover whether it was real or just a creation of Ofelia's imagination. So you have a salad of fantastic creatures, hidden underground world a la Alice in Wonderland, and cruel fights between captain's soldiers and partisans. But it only looks like salad from the first glance. When you take a closer look everything becomes pretty plain and clear with no fairy tale nonsense.<br /><br />The fairy tale part is rather dark and frightening. Ofelia comes across not very pleasant creatures and finds herself in places that are not very sweet. The episode with a child-eater who has eyes in his palms is pretty creepy and disturbing especially for a small girl to bear. But at certain point you start wondering: what is scarier - this fantastic stuff or events that surround Ofelia in "real" life? People are being tortured and killed around her, she has to see all kinds of atrocities that her stepfather commits and she has to live in this atmosphere of suffering and madness all the time. No surprise she choses a fairy tale evil. Here Guillermo Del Toro compares and shows us the difference between these two evils and comes to a conclusion that even the most intricate and sophisticated mind can't invent things that happen in real life. Real life evil, real life vice are more dreadful and more abysmal than anything we can ever imagine. Child's mind of Ofelia tries to escape the things she sees around, she seeks shelter in a fairy tale, but it turns out you can't run far...<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is utterly violent and what's most disturbing all the violence is shown through the child's eyes - it's not shaded, not sugar-coated, it's the way it is - simple and cold-blooded. The way soldiers are being finished off with a shot in the head after a fight, the way people are tortured (no hard feelings - just to get information) makes you shiver, and I wonder what a child must feel observing all this. Pan and fairies are only an excuse here, this ain't no fairy tale. Pan's Labyrinth is a thoughtful and serious story of growing up and trying to stay sane in the madness of the world. It's one of the most interesting, bizarre, sad and magical pictures I've seen lately. Surely not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198O25QYUPXE.html">A2198O25QYUPXE</a><br/><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is a dark-fantasy genre film set in 1944 during the latter stages of World War II in Spain.<br /><br />The blend of reality and fantasy presents the viewer with a unique narrative from the perspective of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who is the protagonist. The world she lives in is extremely harsh with senseless violence all around her, yet it is the vision of an underworld that provides a concurrent existence for her, which highly values her as a princess.<br /><br />The movie does present a few scenes of rancorous violence and this may not sit well with some viewers.

Aside from these squirm-inducing moments, this Spanish film lingers longer in WW2 reality than in fantasy. I wished for more interludes in the underground world, and fewer in the present when we must watch sadistic Fascist soldiers killing and torturing Spanish rebels. There's a lot of blood here, and this is certainly not a great movie for kids. Still, worth a watch if you enjoy a slight departure from Hollywood's inanities.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>This is the way fairy tales used to be -- before they got bleached, pressed, and de-linted by half-wits trying to protect tender ears. Before they got Disney-fied. Sure, there's violence here, some of it shocking, but none of it gratuitous. Could it give a kid nightmares? Maybe. But given today's pablum stories, maybe it's about time.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth takes us directly into the subconscious, and into the storyforms that infuse all of the great myths, fairy tales, and religions. It's a rich and satisfying stew of symbolism, mystery, and redemption. Multilayered and inspiring, it's a film you'll want to see again. It's hard not to gush, but it's been so long since a movie this good has made it into the quasi-mainstream.<br /><br />What makes Pan's Labyrinth most effective is it's juxtaposition of harsh "reality" and the mysterious world that lives side by side with it. The heroine, a young girl who may carry a magical seed of immortality (the soul of god's only child who once ventured into the world of men, suffered, and died long ago), is contacted by shapeshifting fairies who lead her to a faun (much like the mythological Pan) who says she may reclaim her throne and escape the mortal world by performing three tasks. The faun in Pan's Labyrinth is every bit as complex as the mythological Pan, a creature perhaps older than the gods themselves. There's something sly, and perhaps even sexual about this elegant and almost alien faun, as he represents the forces at play inside this sensitive young girl. In fact, like every good fairy tale, all of the strange, wondrous, and chilling creatures represent facets of the subconscious, including baby-eating ghouls, flitting fairies, and gluttonous toads.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is a commentary on the resiliency and power of the human imagination, and takes us to the place where dreams are spun and the great heroic tale of overcoming (of the self and the world) takes root. That spark of the divine in all of us -- or at least the hope of it -- powers the great story of our lives, and we need tales like this to remind of us of the magic and transformative power of story telling. In the flickering light of the theater, like some great hearth around which we've gathered, Pan's Labyrinth took me back to my childhood, and made me think of so many of the great stories I'd read over the years -- of demonic dogs with saucer-sized eyes, of child-stealing trolls, and evil stepmothers. And, finally, of the champions who venture down into those great cracks in the Earth, where the roots of mythic trees twist and wind and the greatest treasure of all can be found: the noble, heroic, and undying spirit that lies within us.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>Everybody's seen it. There are 650 reviews already. I don't need to recount the plot, do I?<br /><br />My take on this film is colored by my years of visiting and living in Spain, from the first time in 1965 until spring of 2007. The content of a film is what the viewer thinks when she/he watches it. I thought of Franco and of Franco's special church-haunted fascism. Does Franco rhyme with macho? Close enough. Franquismo was about masculine honor, including the very masculine honor of God the Father as conceived by the Franquistas. I carry a fairly passionate hatred for Franquismo in my conscience, as passionate as that of most Spaniards today. That emotion certainly colored my experience of Pan's Labyrinth.<br /><br />It's a film about the cost of heroism in terms of humanism. The two women characters are heroic in their loyalties and in their acceptance of suffering. The Communist guerillas are heroic in their stubborn and futile resistance to tyranny and brutality, but they are mere stock figures, scarcely individuals, scarcely at risk of self-doubt, mor eprops than characters. The doctor is a reluctant but unwavering hero, but he's a minor character. That leaves the girl Ofelia and the sadistic beast of fascist officer, Captain Vidal. The girl fantasizes heroism, and her fantasy is a story of its own. But the Captain is a flesh-and-blood human, the very worst exemplar of humanity at its most inhumane. Sergi Lopez is the star of this film, in my eyes, the masterfully acted embodiment of fascism in all its hatefulness. His concept of heroic honor, of the "real man's" heroic death, is the backdrop for every other character's actions, including the girl's fantasies. You out there in the audience? You want to understand fascism? Study Captain Vidal.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>It is 1944, and 12-year old Ofelia and her mother are going to a military outpost in the Spanish countryside to live with her new stepfather, a sadistic army captain.  There, Ofelia discovers an old stone maze that leads to an underground world of fairies and adventures while above ground, the captain is closing in on a rag-tag band of insurgents.<br /><br />This remarkable movie is alternately beautiful and grotesque, cruel and fantastic.  Ofelia's fairyland is not a cute Disney version of make-believe, but a dark and scary place and this movie is definitely not for children.  The story, in Spanish with English subtitles, is intense and exciting and held my interest every moment, blending the harsh realities of war with a child's boundless imagination. Several scenes of violence were too hard to watch, but it is nonetheless an unforgettable movie.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is not for kids.  I cannot repeat this enough: it is a fairy tale, it features children, it features children overcoming grotesque challenges to emerge triumphant, but it is NOT. FOR. CHILDREN.<br /><br />And that's a shame, because the fairy tales in Pan's Labyrinth once were told to children.  Beware the Poisonous Toad, whose selfish gluttony killed off a magical tree.  Beware the Pale Man, who consumed children that succumbed to their own hunger.  And most importantly, beware Fauns who give orders, for they are tricksters never to be fully trusted.<br /><br />Poor Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is caught in a power struggle between her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) pregnant with ruthless captain Vidal's (Sergi Lopez) child.  It's clear that Vidal could care less for Ofelia, who is not of his blood.  His only concern is that Carmen bear him a son; the birth of her brother will most certainly send Ofelia to her doom. Caught between these two worlds of war and magic, Ofelia's salvation lies in the rebellious servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and an ancient faun (Doug Jones).<br /><br />In the end, Ofelia has no choice.  There are monsters everywhere: lurking in her home, in the forest, and in the labyrinth. Caught between faerie and famine, she can only choose her final home. Depending on your perspective, the ending is a triumph of the human spirit or the sad conclusion to a military conflict. In the end, we discover that little girls are made of sterner stuff than boys: Toads and snails and fairy tales.</p></br><a href="../users/A18BD98SU49UB7.html">A18BD98SU49UB7</a><br/><p>After leaving the theater I reviewed and purchased the soundtrack. In the past year and a half I have watched Pan's Labyrinth a dozen times. There are too many great things about this film to catch in one viewing. Original! Rewatch Factor: 5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>It's taken me some time to actually get around to seeing this film.  I've wanted to for a while now but haven't had the opportunity.  The other night I found the opportunity and took advantage of it; thankfully.  Now that I have finally seen this film (often rendered a masterpiece) I feel slightly more complete now.  No, `El Laberinto del Fauno' is not the most amazing film to have ever been released, but it does deserve a lot of the praise it has received for it is truly an astonishing work of art that is honest, personal and rich with humanity.<br /><br />I'm going to go ahead and yell SPOILERS right now so that no one can yell at me later for ruining the movie for them.  I often try to stay away from any plot points that `give away too much' but for me to commit to writing a review about this amazing film without touching upon the fundamental reasoning for my five stars would be a waste of time for me.  So; if you have seen this movie then by all means continue reading but if you have not consider yourself warned, for I am going to discuss the ending.<br /><br />The film follows a young girl named Ofelia.  Her mother is heavy with child and recently married to an army captain in Spain, circa 1944.  Ofelia possesses a quiet maturity that doesn't always serve her best interest, especially when relating to her new step-father Vidal.  Vidal is cruel and indifferent and repels Ofelia to the point where she finds herself immersed in a world not unlike the one she lives in yet with a magical new meaning.  Approached by the illusive Faun, Ofelia is given an opportunity to live forever if she completes three tasks, tasks that prove to be more tempting and dangerous than she expected.  The events taking place within Ofelia's new world (the labyrinth) parallel those taking place in the real world as her family life comes crashing to a turbulent end.<br /><br />With all its talk of immortality I found that the films primary focus was that of death.  When all is said and done Ofelia receives her reward in her own demise, finally leaving the violent world that has enslaved her to fear and being whisked away to a world anew (inside the afterlife) with her mother and father.  This to me is what makes the film so brilliant, for it wasn't until the films end where the pieces came together and the elaborate story became so much richer and rewarding.<br /><br />My only complaint about the film is that the dark and mysterious world of Pan's Labyrinth is no where near as engrossing as the real world in which Ofelia lives.  I really wanted del Toro's visionary world to be more intriguing but I found my interest fully invested in the real world surrounding Ofelia's fantasy.  That is really my only complaint, and it is a small one at that, for the film is never boring or uninteresting, I just expected my interest to be invested in another facet of the film.<br /><br />The acting is superb on all fronts, especially with regard to Ivana Baquero who delivers what may be the most richly fulfilling child performance in recent memory.  She captures the unbridled curiosity of a child while balancing her characters unfathomable maturity.  She delivers a splendid performance filled with honest emotion and believable innocence.  Sergi Lopez is flawlessly ruthless as Captain Vidal, a performance that is memorable in its brutality.  Maribel Verdu is also memorable, and I don't normally like her (at least I haven't taken to her as others have).  Doug Jones also deserves some recognition for his dynamic undertaking as both the Faun and the Pale Man.  He truly gets under the skin of these two creatures, bringing the brilliant costume and makeup work to life before our very eyes.  Ariadna Gil is effective as Ofelia's mother, but the other performances overshadow her for the most part.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `El Laberinto del Fauno' moved me.  It managed to reach into the pit of me and draw out raw emotion and contemplation I feel more complete now that I've released.  There is beauty within the tragedy of this story, a beauty that helps answer the questions we often ponder about life, death and the here-in-between.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>The year, 2006, was the year of the Mexican director with 3 of the most prominent films directed by Guillermo Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) & Alejandro Gonzalez Inirritu (Babel). Of the 3, Del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" stands out as a skillful blending of fantasy & reality.  It's no surprise to me after seeing his previous films like "Mimic", "Devil's Backbone", "Blade 2" & "Hellboy" that this film would be a skillful brew. Like "Backbone", it is set against a civil war and we are shown how a child copes with this horror. The colorful photography and special effects especially shine in Hi-def (I have this in HD DVD) and you won't be disappointed. For further proof, check out Stephen King's review of this film also.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>I had to purchase this.  I did not bother renting it, first.  After an interview with the director (on NPR), I was hooked, already.  I study Spanish and History (and many other subjects), so the premise of the film sparked my interest on collegiate levels as well as peaking my Fantasy interests.<br /><br />The author discussed his childhood, Mexico, studies of Spanish history during the Fascist era, then he explained how he infused all of this into the film.  When I purchased the movie, I was not disappointed!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a> lives up to the previews, interviews, and expectations created before its release.<br /><br />This film is a Dark fantasy, and I doubt that some children could handle the content but this is a wonderful tale.  The movie is very intense, and deals with Real World issues; death, female subservience, war, poverty, fascism, and a host of negative human emotions and actions.  Simultaneously, the Fantasy aspects of this great film give us a window into Other Worlds, and give the little girl an escape from harsh reality.<br /><br />Though I would not recommend this movie for most children (below the age of 11-13, depending upon their maturity), I certainly recommend this film for everyone else (especially adults).  Few people remember or care about history, therfore history is repeating itself.  This film could be set in the near future, just as easily as it seems to be set in the past.  This film will be eternal: a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>A beautiful and poignant film which starts at the outset as a children's fairy tale but it is a fairy tale for adults. This is the story about a girl named Ofelia who we are shown lives in 2 world's: 1) The Anti franco post civil war regime where the spanish Maquis guerrillas are fighting a resistance against the Hitler like ruthless captain Vidal and his army men and 2) her own fairy tale fantasy land in a neverland filled with menacing and magical creatures and healing living plants. The main repeating character world from this fantasy world is an enigmatic faun. What is a faun, you ask ?. I looked up wikipedia "fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland.....have horns and both resemble goats below the waist, humans above". Something like a hybrid unicorn I would guess. Incidentally a faun is used in  C. S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. That faun is possibly a classic faun, the one used by the director in this film is more of a menacing creature which is like cross between the alien and some ostrich. This faun is real creepy, freaked me out.  This is the first movie of it's kind that I have seen where a fantasy movie plays as a parallel thread to a real world movie. The movie is poignant,tragic and enchanting in its score, visual style and essense which is a very tough feat to put off all at once, credit to the director, production designer, and screenplay writer. So in that sense it's not really a fairy tale for kids. Ofelia has to block out the brutal aspects of the violence she is seeing all around her. Further the physical pain endured by her mother during late stages of pregnancy bearing captain Vidal's child (She is not fond of captain Vidal, she senses him as a ruthless and uncaring man, which is what he is when he tell his doctor "if a choice has to made between the mother and the child, save the baby"), adds to her sense of loss and despair which she compensates by creating this fantasy world that she indulges in from time to time. The real world story has a momentum of it's which could have served as one whole film, a story of Mercedes, the lady cook who in the pantry of captain Vidal. Mercedes is secretly helping her husband and the resitance. Her Husband is part of the guerrillas. Comming back to the mystical Faun from this mystical land, gives Ofelia three tasks. Completion of all three tasks is suppossed to reinstate Ofelia has the princess of this fairy land, a throne that has been waiting for centuries waiting for her re-incarnation. And now her time has finally come. This is not like the Harry potter goblet of fire tasks. The task here serve to immerse us into the believability of this world. The creatures are other worldly, kind of out of place for childeren's fairy tale. The monster in the second task has eyes on his hands and he gets activated when she picks the ripe fruits of the monster's dinner table. It is an amazing escapist movie but which has this beautiful poignant movie score, a great directorial vision and an ambience of a different kind of fairy tale interspersed with the horror of the real world. What a joy of a film to watch. I recommend one and all to see this film. This is a spanish movie by the mexican director Guillermo del Toro, the guy who made blade2, hellboy, and hellboy2: The golden army. In the end we get the subtle idea of the whole film of Ofelia. But I won't everything way lest I rob you of the joy of watching this movie.<br /><br />regards, VIkram</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>In 2001, Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro used the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop for his ghost story "The Devil's Backbone". Six years later, del Toro has returned to the tumultuous Franco era, this time with a twist of dark fantasy in his Spanish-language film,"Pan's Labyrinth".<br /><br />12-year old newcomer Ivana Bacquero delivers an impressive, nuanced performance as the film's central character Ofelia, an intelligent,introverted girl on the verge of puberty who still clings to her childhood fascination with fairy tales. She and her very pregnant mother have just set up quarters with her new stepfather(the always brilliant Sergi Lopez), the brutal, sadistic Captain Vidal,a Fascist officer charged with mopping up rebel forces entrenched in the Spanish countryside.<br /><br />With nothing resembling love or affection forthcoming from the black-hearted Vidal, and with her mother becoming increasingly bedridden due to a difficult pregnancy, Ofelia finds an escape valve by retreating ever deeper into a personal fantasy world, which she enters through a gate in a nearby garden. This is not necessarily Alice through the looking glass, as you might think; this is a much darker world of personified demons and monsters borne from Ofelia's subconscious take on the real-life horrors being perpetrated by her truly monstrous stepfather and his Fascist henchmen.<br /><br />In certain respects, the film reminded me of 1973's (much more subtle) "Spirit of the Beehive", also set in Franco's Spain, and likewise depicting a lonely young girl retreating into a private fantasy world in response to feelings of estrangement from her family.<br /><br />While there are also some parallels here to the likes of "Alice In Wonderland", "Spirited Away", and "The Secret Garden", be advised that this is not your garden variety feel-good fairy tale with a warm and fuzzy ending that you want to watch with the kids. The fantasy sequences are closer in tone to Grimm morbidity than to Tolkien whimsy; and del Toro pulls no punches depicting the real horror and suffering that takes place during wartime.<br /><br />In the visual department, the director once again displays an admirable talent for seamlessly blending wildly imaginative production design and prosthetics to create a vivid fantasy world (del Toro's resume includes Mimic, Blade II and Hellboy.)<br /><br />I have a caveat: if you find depictions of soldiers being tortured and malevolent violence directed against women and children upsetting,proceed with caution. (I am aware that no decent human being in their right mind finds that kind of thing much fun to watch in the first place, but I see the potential for more sensitive viewers to become quite distressed).</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>If there ever was a movie that made me cry, this is the one.  This is how fairy tales are supposed to be told.  They teach us many lessons, on many different levels, and unlike Disney movies they do not always have a happy ending.  Perhaps that is the reason why many critics have labeled this film as "fairy tale for adults" - I guess those same critics assume that children are to be sheltered from tales of loss and death.  Well - I disagree with that but then again, I grew up reading brother Grimms' fairy tales too.  Beautiful movie with beautiful special effects and story about hope lost in search of eternal (parental) love.  Set in Franco's Spain film also addresses the horror of fasicm and inability of a yound girl to supress the misery that comes with it.  Film shows us that evil affects all of us, but children have a special way of dealing with it - their imagination transcends the harsh reality and guides them to the world of magic full with most astonishing secrets only child can embrace with no reservations.  Absolutely beautiful -- and heartbreaking!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XXV9HF169LCF.html">A2XXV9HF169LCF</a><br/><p>If you watch this movie and do not sniffle, you might not be human. It's not a happy movie. As a friend said, it can be a bit brutal. But it is also graceful, full of wonder and strangeness. It's sad and lovely and creepy.<br /><br />Don't worry; there are no spoilers here. You learn almost all these facts in the first few minutes of the film.<br /><br />This is the story. It's about a little girl.<br /><br />This is the other story. It's also about a little girl.<br /><br />In the first story, the little girl is the daughter of a tailor. He father is dead and her mother has remaried, and they are going to live with the new husband in his home in the woods.<br /><br />In the other story, the little girl is a princess, daughter of a king who rules below the ground. She envies sunlight and flowers, and runs away to the mortal realm above her head.<br /><br />In the first story, it is World War 2 and the little girl's new father is a Captain in Nazi Spain. Her mother is pregnant with his child, a son. He guards the valley through which the trains run from his headquarters at the old mill.<br /><br />In the second story, the princess dies above ground, old and cold and far from home. And her father says: her soul will come back to us in some other way, and we will wait until the end of time for her.<br /><br />In the first and second stories, there is a dark old labyrinth in the woods, near the old mill....<br /><br />In this story the fair realm the tailor's daughter wanders upon is as dangerous, as strange and difficult to navigate as the real world; there are monsters a plenty, and the fairies are not sweet children with wings. Trust is as strange and thorny there as anywhere, and promises have weight and texture.  Even the tales she tells in the real world for her own comfort, her fairy tales, have no happy endings; just prickly questions and loose ends that sit inside your mind and make you a little uncomfortable. Her fairyland is the fairyland that folks once knew, where punishment for laziness and pride lurked around every corner and stupidity would definitely get you eaten.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>Spain. 1944.

The scenes are beautiful especially and at times quite chilling for different reasons at different times of the film. For a good portion of the time this movie is a fascinating adult fantasy, and the rest of the time it is a bleak world set in Spain following the civil war and they mixed both parts so well together- I am amazed honestly.<br /><br />Because honestly if not done right this movie could have been a complete mess- it instead though is a great success.

A strikingly mature fantasy fused with fervid violence, staggering visuals and ingenious creations, this macabre fairy tale is the most innovative and beautiful film of the year.<br /><br />Dreamy little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is taken to an army stronghold with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) to live with her stepfather, the merciless Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). It is 1944 in the aftermath of the Spanish Revolution, where Vidal is anxious to destroy a remnant rebel group hiding in the surrounding forest. Alone and powerless, immersed in violence and cruelty, Ofelia explores a stone labyrinth that houses the magical faun Pan. As he bestows upon her several daunting tasks, Ofelia lives out her own dark fable as she confronts monsters both hellishly alien and all too human.<br /><br />The character and creature designs are simply phenomenal. The human characters are excellently depicted, allowing the audience to truly despise the villains and root for the heroes. There's nothing worse than feeling sorry for the bad guy when he gets it in the end. This film ensures that you don't. It is the fantastical monstrosities however, that are the true visual feast, such as Pan himself, a minotaur-like faun covered with scaly skin and fleshy branches and leaves, and crowned with enormous diabolic horns. The Pale Man is also a prime example of wicked genius; he is pasty white with thick, sagging flesh and bleeding red eyeballs affixed in the palms of his hands, and must thrust them in front of him to guide his twitching stride. Both characters employ brilliant prosthetics and makeup, magnificently brought to life by actor Doug Jones. To further mystify the viewer, the full body designs include fragile stilt-like legs that couldn't possibly house a man in a rubber suit.<br /><br />As we all know, special effects don't make the movie, and exemplarily Pan's Labyrinth uses such effects to perfectly compliment an inspired story full of imaginative originality. Including predefined mythological concoctions such as the faun, fairies and a mandrake, Pan's Labyrinth beautifully melds familiar fantasy myths with its abundance of unique and devilish creations. The central motif is a brilliant parallel to those creatures, and fuses themes of fervid imagination and brutal reality, love, innocence, bravery and sacrifice. Contrasting against the gritty background of the Spanish Revolution, Pan's world is both a dreamy escape and a nightmarish prison.<br /><br />The acting too is commendable, most notably with Ivana Baquero, who evokes an exquisite blend of compassion and emotion. Del Toro favorite Doug Jones gets us so immersed in Pan's fantasy world that perhaps the only fault with the film is the relatively short amount of screen time the elusive faun receives. Acting aside, this likely nominee for the Best Cinematography Oscar features ominous structures, old creaking buildings, and winding stone labyrinths that mark the forested landscape...</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>this is everything the devils backbone wanted to be.while that movie had the feel of that period,it wasnt a horror movie at all.what it was was a look at a great director,storyteller in the making.<br /><br />the departed won the big awards but it wasnt the best movie.i cant see giving a redo (as great as the departed was/is) such high acclaim when theres such an original movie just as good.del toro got robbed.case closed.<br /><br />we all know what the story is about and its a hard sell in hollywood in the sense of it being accepted (not the most child-friendly telling of a childs fantasy,is it) so i wont rehash.<br /><br />del toro or his reps....GET IN THE DIRECTORS CHAIR SOON !!!!!<br /><br />(no more ''backbone's'' though,ok?????)</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I knew what I was getting into before watching PAN'S LABYRINTH. After all, it is rated R, and billed as an ADULT fantasy / thriller. Consequently, I realized that I wasn't going to see THE NEVERENDING STORY 3 or FREE WILLY 10. What I wasn't prepared for was just how wonderful this movie actually is. Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) takes us into a real, living nightmare, in the form of war and the evil men who profit by it. Within this hellish world, a girl named Ofelia (along w/ her ailing, pregnant mother) is forced to live w/ her stepfather, a spanish captain in Franco's fascist army. Ofelia's mind splits off into the safety of her imagination, allowing her to live her life as a girl on a mystical quest, rather than as a prisoner. She enters a stone labyrinth on the captain's property, leading to a spiral staircase, taking her down into the bowels of the earth below. Ofelia meets a faun (a goat-headed chap) who tells her of her past and her destiny. He also gives her a magical book and three tasks to accomplish. Reality and fantasy smear together as Ofelia's adventure becomes increasingly horrific. While Ofelia's stepfather murders the leftists he detests, and her mother grows weaker, Ofelia must accept greater challenges in her dreamworld, including the amazingly terrifying "baby-eater" monster! This thing is one of the best critters I've seen since HELLRAISER! Very disturbing to look at! I wouldn't want it coming after me! Ofelia draws on strengths she is unaware of, and overcomes ordeals that would cause most adults to wilt. I found PAN'S LABYRINTH thoroughly engrossing in it's use of imagery and symbolism to bring reality and nightmare together. I was afraid for Ofelia both in this world and the netherworld. Still, I found the ultimate message of life after death / good overcoming evil to be uplifting. Nope, this isn't G-rated family fare. However, it is a tremendous morality tale for grown-ups...  P.S.- I recommend watching THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE first, to get an idea of del Toro's style and use of dark fantasy...</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>It's difficult to juxtapose two different stories filmed in different styles peopled by different actors into a cohesive whole. Guillermo Del Toro ("Devil's Backbone," "Cronos") attempts to do just that with his concurrent stories of Franco Spain, 1944 and a child's dream world, fable mirroring the realistic part of the film in the fairy tale form though Del Toro never makes it explicitly clear if Ofelia's world is only in her mind or if her world has a place alongside the real.<br />Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a bookish young 10 year old. Her vibrant eyes are full of wonder as she accompanies her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the Pyrenees to meet her Mother's new husband (the multi-lingual Sergi Lopez as a nasty, despotic Captain Vidal in Franco's army) and to wait for the birth of her mother and Vidal's child.<br />Vidal has been sent to this remote place to put an end to a small army of freedom fighters/rebels who oppose Franco. Lopez's Vidal is so vile and cruel that we are made to wonder how beautiful, kind, loving Carmen would have married him much less deigned to have his child but this is never explained. When Carmen goes into labor, Vidal tells the doctor that if a life or death choice is to be made, the doctor is to choose the child over Carmen. Vidal also proves to be the only one who goes over to the other fairy tale side of this film. And as such he arrogantly stains and mutilates Ofelia's world of Fauns and Fairies.<br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is very dark, both production-wise and thematically. When Ofelia descends into the Labyrinth she is not going to a better, kinder, light-filled place but a place fraught with mystery and reeking of the dark. In essence then she goes from the darkness into a darker place which turns the mood of the film topsy turvy particularly if you think about other similarly themed films: "The Wizard of Oz'" going from black and white Kansas to full Technicolor Oz and Alice's descent into the wonder of "Wonderland." And this is key as you try to unlock some of the mysteries of this dazzling film: in order to know the light you must know the dark is how "it" usually goes...but not here.<br />Though seemingly simple on the surface, "Pan's Labyrinth" is anything but.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>There are many words one can use to describe Guillermo Del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno" in the native Spanish): imaginative; dark; disturbing; heartfelt; violent; mature; intriguing. The one word I prefer is "original." This has to be one of the most amazing films I've seen this year; it's a well-crafted sight and sound fantasy that keeps a firm grip on the audience (despite having to read English subtitles). The characters are emotionally connective. The settings are a mixture of the mysterious, the drab, and the vibrant. The story is engaging. The makeup and special effects are creative. Everything about this film is indicative of an active imagination, which is a nice departure from the slew of unimaginative rehashes that have recently been released.<br /><br />The ads for this film have one critic saying that it's a fairy tale for grownups. I definitely agree with that; to say that this story isn't for children would be a massive understatement. This is not a sugarcoated fable of handsome princes, beautiful princesses, and happily ever afters, nor will true love's kiss awaken a fair maiden. This is a heavy-handed tale of discovery, and it includes a number of moments that some may find difficult to watch, such as shootings, torture, a near miscarriage, and needless deaths. While such material may turn some viewers off, I still think it's worth seeing. It was quite a refreshing experience, especially since a number of cliched fairy tale elements are put aside. Del Toro succeeded in creating his own fairy tale, one that's incredibly dark yet undeniably effective.<br /><br />The plot is actually a meshing of two distinct stories, both of which are connected by Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an adolescent girl of surprising character. Taking place in 1944 Spain, the first story tells of how post-war fascism is at its height, and how a repressive military faction led by Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) threatens to destroy a group of rebels hiding within the mountains. Vidal is a cold, ruthless individual who demands loyalty and has absolutely no patience for those who oppose him. He'll gladly kill innocent people if it gets him one step further to victory. No one dares second-guess his methods, not his officers, and definitely not his servants.<br /><br />Moving from the city to join Vidal at his rural estate are Ofelia and her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), who has recently wed Vidal and is pregnant with his child. Ofelia is clearly not ready to adapt to her new life, despite her mother's continuous pleas for cooperation. When she first meets her stepfather, she offers him to shake her left hand. He callously grabs it and says, "It's the other hand, Ofelia." Within the scope of the narrative, the film's main villain is established right then and there; it's obvious from such a tense introduction that their relationship will only go downhill, especially since she's aware of how distant he is towards her mother. It doesn't help that Carmen's pregnancy is getting increasingly difficult; she's frequently in pain, making her too weak to fully engage in her new life. Vidal's doctor, Ferreiro (Alex Angulo), warned him about moving his wife during such a delicate time, but Vidal insists that his son (somehow everyone knows that Carmen is having a boy) should be born near his father. He makes it very clear that his baby comes first, not his wife.<br /><br />Ofelia soon befriends Vidal's maid, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), who's secretly helping the rebels by giving them rations of food. Her brother, Pedro (Roger Casamajor), is among them, and they both understand that their chances of overthrowing Vidal's reign are slim. But they continue to fight, even when one of them is captured and subjected to torture.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ofelia is having some interesting experiences, which brings me to the second story that's being told. When she first arrives at Vidal's estate, she finds a stone with an engraving of an eye. She sees that it's the missing piece of an engraved statue; upon reinserting the piece, a mysterious cricket hybrid emerges from its mouth. It continuously reappears throughout the film, and it eventually morphs itself into a fairy-like creature. It also serves as Ofelia's guide, leading her to a stone labyrinth at the back of the estate. In the center is a staircase leading to an underground lair. There she meets a faun (Doug Jones), a tall, fantastical creature with branch-like legs and a quasi-elfin face. He tells her that she's actually the mortal reincarnation of Princess Moanna, who was drawn to the sunlight and born as a human. In order for her to return to her own kingdom, she must complete three tasks, all of which are outlined in a special book provided by the faun.<br /><br />Thus begins Ofelia's quest for her true identity, highlighted by journeys into otherworldly realms. Her first task takes her to the roots of a dying fig tree, where a gigantic toad resides. She must retrieve a golden key from its belly. Her second task takes her into a room with a sumptuous feast, none of which she's allowed to eat. If she takes so much as a bite, a monstrous creature with eyes in its hands will awaken. She must also complete the task in a given length of time. Her third task I won't mention; it comes late in the film, and describing it will give too much away. Let's just say that she must make a decision, one that will affect her chances of returning to her kingdom.<br /><br />I was initially puzzled as to how these two separate narratives would be able to work together. One is very much rooted in reality, and it deals with difficult issues. The other is rooted in fantasy, relying on imaginary circumstances in order to exist. But as the film progressed, I came to see that the first story serves as a backdrop for Ofelia's journey. She repeatedly says that she's unhappy in Vidal's home; that she wants to go away and never return. Only a world filled with anger, hatred, and repression--a world Ofelia lives in--would instill such feelings. It is said that Princess Moanna's kingdom is one with no pain or sadness, qualities which are clearly preferable to the hardships of a mortal existence.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" doesn't use the fantasy genre as a way to reinforce the classic Hero's Journey, nor is it used to tell a simple Good vs. Evil fable; rather, it's used to provide an escape for a lonely young girl who longs for a place to call her own. Despite the fact that Ofelia loves her mother, despite finding a friend in Mercedes, it's obvious that she's not meant to be among the world of mortals. Her soul is free. Her mind is expansive. Her heart is light. I loved these aspects of "Pan's Labyrinth" as much as I loved del Toro's sense of creativity. This is a truly original film, and I hope future fantasy films will be made just as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>For me, this film sort of came out of nowhere.  It's not often that a Spanish film (with subtitles, at that) becomes all the rage in America, but I just kept seeing references to this thing all over the place.  Having watched it, I can see why - it really is a wondrous, compelling, emotional cinematic experience.  Many have dubbed Pan's Labyrinth a fairy tale for adults, and I think that designation is pretty apt.  A lot of people aren't aware of the fact that many fairy tales were, in their infancy, pretty dark little stories.  As often as not, fairy tale characters did not live happily ever after at all - in some cases, they didn't even live through the stories.  This particular film features pain and anguish alongside some fairly jarring and brutal moments.  Certainly, it's not a film for the vast majority of children out there, but I see no reason in the world for it receiving an R rather than a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />The central character of the story is a twelve-year-old girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an imaginative child accompanying her very pregnant mother to the military post run by her step-father.  The year is 1944, and Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is there to take out the remaining anti-Franco rebels hiding out in the woodlands.  He is an exceedingly cruel and ruthless man, as the audience learns fairly early on.  With her mother bedridden, Ofelia wanders outside to follow a fairy through the ancient stone structure called Pan's Labyrinth, eventually entering a circular underground structure.  It is there that she meets an otherworldly faun (Doug Jones) and learns that she is actually a fairy princess who lost all of her old memories when she ran off to the world of humans years ago.  Before she can return to her fairy kingdom, however, she must complete three tasks to prove that she is the rightful princess.  The tasks are not easy - but, on the other hand, Ofelia's human life is not easy either.  Her step-father cares only about the impending birth of his child (which he assumes will be a son), her mother (Ariadna Gil) is basically unavailable because her pregnancy has turned into a dangerous one, and she has no one else apart from a servant named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) who cares one iota about her.  It is not hard to see why she becomes increasingly enchanted with the idea of exchanging the miseries of human life for the joys of the fairy realm.<br /><br />Running alongside Ofelia's story is that of the anti-government rebels trying to survive out in the woods, despite Capitan Vidal's attempts to horde all available sources of food and medicine.  What Vidal does not know is that rebel sympathizers are hidden amongst his own personal staff - two individuals who will emerge as the two unquestioned heroes of this entire story.  Both of these worlds eventually smash together by the end of the film, setting the stage for a bittersweet ending that leaves much to the viewer's imagination.<br /><br />There's an amazing pathos to this film that might take you unawares, particularly if you are used to a steady diet of Hollywood throw-away scripts.  Pan's Labyrinth galvanizes your emotions and compels you to look beneath the surface of the mundane.  It may even rekindle that sense of wonder that you seemingly lost all those years ago.  It is truly a most glorious film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow that her "real life" is full of. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>In war torn Spain there lived a young girl named Ofelia, who loved to read fairy tales.  She moves to the country with her pregnant mother, to live with her stepfather Captain Vidal.  The Captain is not a nice man, in fact he is evil, spending his time torturing captives and waiting for his son to be born.<br /><br />Ofelia has a secret world, a world of fairies and fauns.  When a faun appears to her inside the labyrinth, which is part of the grounds of the mill she has come to live in, he informs her that she is a lost princess, and must perform three tasks to prove she is not a mere mortal.  Ofelia readily accepts the tasks, and the Book Of The Crossroads that the faun gives her.  From the book she learns her tasks to be filled before the next full moon.<br /><br />'Pans Labyrinth' is a dark fairy tale, not one for the kiddies.  I finished the movie and immediately watched it again.  The faun FX was extremely well done.  The thing at the banquet table was sumptuously disgusting, creepy as all get-up.  I think I'm in love with it.<br /><br />The war story and the bad captain left me feeling shades of 'Shindler's List' inside the story, and I remembered the warm-up of David Bowie's 'Labyrinth', now all grown up into a big-boy movie.  It brought to mind the McFarlane Twisted Fairy Tales figures that sit on my shelf watching me as I write this.  It also smelled faintly of 'City Of Lost Children' but perhaps that's simply because it was twisted and subtitled.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, the photography stunning, and the dream breathes the fetid breath of imagination.  Del Toro leaves it up to the viewer whether or not Ofelia's world was real or in her head.  And what was that thing that came out of the toad's mouth?<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie would be that it needed more Labyrinth and less war.  This is a superb movie for the horror or dark fantasy lover, worthy of a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro knew there is a huge audience for movies that emphasize flash-bang wizardry over substance. He knew he was making a fantasy film with fauns and fairies and secret underground kingdoms, featuring a twelve year old girl as the central character. He knew lots of Americans hate reading so much they wouldn't think about going to a film with subtitles, even though he directed the well-made English language "Hellboy". He knew the amount and intensity of the violence of this film would make it unsuitable for children. Yet he made the film anyway - and thank goodness he did.<br /><br />I see many reviews here complaining that this absolute fantastic movie is "boring" and they had to "read for two hours". Oh my! Pity the poor audience, forced against their will to, dare I say it? Read. So - if you aren't a Spanish speaker and don't want to "read" for two hours, keep on moving.<br /><br />In fact - if you don't want to see a movie filled with thrilling adventure, stunning visuals, evil fascist villains, brave female heroines and beautiful photography with sharp editing - stay far, far away.<br /><br />You still there? Maybe El Laberinto del Fauno is for you. I join the large number of positive reviewers standing in line to sing this film's praises. Yes, Ivana Baquero is an amazing child actor. Not yet a teenager, she reminds me of the sixteen year old Jennifer Connelly in "Labyrinth" twenty years ago. The resemblance of the two young actresses and the name "Labyrinth" aren't the only similarities. Both films are fantasies featuring young women who must complete a "quest" to save their baby brother. But the newer film is superior in every way, for the appropriate audience. Where Labyrinth featured Connelly interacting with David Bowie and an army of Muppets, El Laberinto has young Ivana moving back and forth between an underworld of fairies and fauns and her "real world" of Spanish Fascists. The real world elements of the story make you care very deeply about what happens to young Ofelia and her mother and baby brother.<br /><br />Ofelia's father has been killed in the Spanish Civil War and her desperate mother marries the cruel Vidal, played by Sergi L&oacute;pez, one of Franco's captains, who (as has been written repeatedly) joins the screen's pre-eminent villains. He is cold and cruel to his own family and soldiers. To his enemies, he is far worse. Maribel Verd&uacute;, previously wonderful in "Y Tu Mama Tambien", is strong and compassionate as Mercedes, a servant of the cruel Vidal, but also the sister of one of the Republican Spanish freedom fighters the Captain has been dispatched to snuff out. Ariadna Gil is tragically noble as Ofelia's mother, Carmen. She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to "work out" between the Captain and the rest of the family. Gil's work here reminds me of Allison Janney's in "American Beauty" as a wife beaten down by life with a domineering military man. &Aacute;lex Angulo reminds me of a Spanish Paul Giamatti as a kind Doctor who has been conscripted onto the evil Captain's staff, but like Mercedes, is secretly helping the freedom fighters with his life continuously at risk. Doug Jones gives two of the most memorable performances in the film under heavy makeup as the titular Faun Pan and as the horrible "Pale Man" a flesh-eating beast that Ofelia must retrieve a magic dagger from.<br /><br />My only regret watching this film is my own limitation at not understanding Espanol. I would imagine that this fantastically rich film is even more delicious in its native language.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Prepare to be immersed in PAN'S LABYRINTH, the excellent adult fantasy film by Guillermo del Torro. Note the words "adult" here, because this is not something parents should take their little ones to see. Although stunningly beautiful in presentation, it holds back absolutely nothing when focusing on the barbarism of mankind. This includes gunshot wounds to the face, the sawing off of infected limbs, or the torturing of one's enemies.<br /><br />Set against the backdrop of 1944 Spain, Generalissimo Francisco Franco has his forces set to squash any rebels prepared to inflame Spain into civil war. Into the woodland areas of Spain's countryside is sent Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), a commander so selfish and heartless as to kill anyone or anything that gets in his way. This is immediately noticeable when his unhealthy and pregnant wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) is sent to live with him at this distant wooded post. Vidal cares not that she's ill and shouldn't be traveling in the late stages of pregnancy, but only wants his son born where his father can see him. With Carmen comes her preteen daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the daughter from a previous marriage in which the father died at war.<br /><br />The unabashed horrors of war are close to Ofelia and her mother's new war post home. Ofelia, feeling helpless and frightened, goes off into the woods and discovers strange runes and eventually an old stone labyrinth of indeterminate age. Soon a faun appears and discloses some interesting information to Ofelia: she is the princess of a lost underworld, a world of immortals where her father-king awaits her return. But in order to find her way back to this wonderland, she must accomplish three tasks in short order.<br /><br />But as the battle with the independent fighters draws near to the human world, the tasks set for her in the magical become nearly insurmountable ...and more dangerous.<br /><br />The question as to if Ofelia is truly a princess or not is completely left up to the viewer to decide. Whether all of the fantastical elements in the film were solely a part of Ofelia's imagination -- and a way to get away from the horrors of the war -- or were real are never given over to the audience. A definite high point for the movie.<br /><br />Pulling from Greek mythology, the faun (played by Doug Jones) is Pan, a half-goat, half-human, better known as a caretaker of woods and shepherds, and also a bit of a trickster. When we first meet Pan we're told that fauns "aren't to be trusted." Usually a wise thing when dealing with the unknown. Added to this problem is the dark nature in which we find Pan. He's in a tomb-like structure, full of shadows and decay. It's also noteworthy to mention that Doug Jones plays a double-role in the movie, as both Pan and Pale Man, a freakishly dangerous creature with eyes in its hands.<br /><br />Spinning the audience between the brutality of war and the beautifully surreal world Ofelia explores, the merging of the two comes to a close in a most satisfying way. But it's an adult way, not a fairytale one. Pan's Labyrinth isn't designed to be a feel-good flick. It's a historical recounting of the Spanish Civil War and what one young girl's reaction to it might've been.<br /><br />The film is a foreign language flick (Spanish) and subtitled, forcing those of us who aren't Spanish speakers to pull our eyes away from the sumptuous sets and down to the bottom of the screen; a necessity but still bothersome considering the extreme high quality of the sets.<br /><br />Young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia deserves all the award nods she's sure to get. Her performance was truly outstanding, making movie watchers cringe whenever she's in danger and applaud when she succeeds with one of her tasks. Her tough choices are felt more than seen, making us care about her all the more as she wanders into unfamiliar and potentially dangerous terrain. That she has to make tough decisions for such a little girl will cause many-a-viewer to reach for the Kleenex box.<br /><br />Because of these terrible decisions forced upon Ofelia, the audience is left to ponder one important thought: Caught between the stark beauty of a (possible) magical world and the brutality of human warmongering, which would you choose?</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth. having missed the movie in the theatre, I waited (and waited...) for the DVD release. Yesterday it came to my door, and I was satisfied.<br /><br />While the movie is enjoyable, and a must see, it was not nearly as violent as many reviews stated that it would be. Most prolific movie watchers will find little to wince at. Pan's Labyrinth was also not very scary, nor a thriller.<br /><br />I found the movie to be a bit slow, and thin when it came to the fantasy elements. Trailers make us think that "Pan" is a movie that is 90% fantasy scenes. In reality, fantasy elements eat up only about 5-10% of the runtime. Lastly, I found it hard to connect with the characters.<br /><br />Now, with all this said, I still liked the movie very much. the acting was top notch, and the film making wonderful. The score was a great addition as well. The subtitles can be tricky, especially if you are trying to munch on a movie snack, but halfway through the flick you forget they are there.<br /><br />I recommend seeing Pan's Lanyrinth, but not buying it until you watch it first. It is not a movie I can see myself purchasing, nor really passionately remembering 5 years down the road.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>This movie is hands down one of the best movies I've seen in years.

This is one of those movies where you go into the theater thinking it's about one thing and it winds up suprising you totally.  Definitely not for the kiddies although I would show i to my 16-year old daughter.  I think she'll get a kick out of it.  Great moviemaking!

The national sport, bullfighting, is performance art and death. Surrealism is as Spanish as Salvador Dali. Here, there is art, death, and surrealism, set in the war that begat Picasso's Guernica (surrealism, art, and death again).<br /><br />This is a fairy tale of the old kind, the ones that Lang's colored fairy tale books wouldn't tell, at least not in the original form. Everyone has death in them, or murder. "I've gutted pigs before" isn't a threat, so much as a daily fact of life. Even a little girl, all knees and elbows, makes her own choice about who will die, or maybe just a choice about who won't.<br /><br />Behind the horrors of war, though, there's another world. Beings of vast power populate it, and bestow bits of their power where they will. Every action in that world beyond has some special portent. Somehow, though, the menace of that other-world is always something that little Ofelia can manage, even master. The real horrors are out here.<br /><br />It would have been too easy to turn this into a flat out effects-fest. Effects in this movie are good, but subordinate to the story in "Labyrinth of the Faun" (the Spanish title). Instead it's the actors, and especially the actresses behind Ofelia and Mercedes that really carry this movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This film won 3 Oscars (Art Direction, Cinematography, Makeup) and richly deserved all three.  The set designs are ingenious and supremely creative, the photography is lush and gorgeous to behold, and the makeup is simply genius.  This is a tale of a little girl who attempts to escape the horrors of the real world exploding around her during wartime.  She enters into a realm that at first seems benign and safe until her subconscious fears rise to the surface and her fantasies overlap her reality until she is unable to distinguish between the two.  "Pan's Labyrinth" is a genuine masterpiece of adult fantasy.  There is a lot of gore in this film, so parents should beware.  While viewing this film in the theater there were plenty of moments that had the audience gasping and wincing at how much pain the characters must be enduring.  For parents who remain unconvinced I have only one thing to say, "bone-saw".  Cringe.  But far beyond the gory makeup, the creature effects are marvelous and completely wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that a minimum of computer effects are used in this film and the creatures are actually there moving, blinking, scheming.  The computer effects that are incorporated are blended seemlessly and add polish to the overall imagination of the film.  "Pan's Labyrinth" slides easily into my top ten list of foreign films where it now holds company with greats like Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" and Zhang Yimou's "To Live".  Beautiful!</p></br><a href="../users/A1POFVVXUZR3IQ.html">A1POFVVXUZR3IQ</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale for grown-ups, and what a beautiful movie...it follows the life of a young girl, Ofelia [played by a talented young actress, Ivana Baquero] who is forced to leave the city and move to the Spanish countryside together with her expectant mother on the orders of her stepfather, Captain Vidal, a monstrous brute with no human compassion whatsoever. Ofelia's feelings of alienation provides the setting for her entry into the magical underworld of the labyrinth, where she meets a faun who reveals her 'true' identity, an ancient princess of the underworld who needs to complete three tasks in order to reclaim her position. So we have Ofelia coping with the demands set upon her by the faun, and in the real world, we witness Spain's Civil War, with the Captain ruthlessly hunting down dissidents. There are great supporting roles here played by the housekeeper Mercedes who is also helping the rebels, the doctor who treats Ofelia's mother [also aids the rebels], and of course the magical beings that inhabit Ofelia's alternate world. Some of these beings are scary [the baby eating monster for example], but nothing is as scary as the real world inhabited by cruel humans...the Captain's predilection for torture makes for wince-inducing viewing. The cinematography evokes a magical world a la Alice in Wonderland, whilst also showing the stark realities of war. Unlike some of the other reviews, I actually thought the fantasy and real elements merged together quite well...especially where it concerned Ofelia's attempts to help her ill, expectant mother. I did wish that more time had been spent on developing the fantasy element in the story...it just felt like there was a lot more to be said concerning Ofelia's exploration of the 'other' world. As for the score, it is simply haunting. This is definitely an adult movie because of the excessive and graphic violence, and also the frightening images both in the real and imaginary realm. Del Toro has directed a masterpiece that bears repeated viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults. It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape: one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy.  Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting, mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged.<br /><br />Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen (Adriana Gil) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband, Falangist Capit&aacute;n Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;). Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth.  Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground, a world run by the Faun (Doug Jones) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place. Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth: the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy.<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors, extraordinary visual effects technicians, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale. The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting. It is bound to become a classic.

Although it wasn't exactly what I had anticipated, I found it intriguing. 1940's post-war Spain as a backdrop for a fairly tale...interesting concept indeed. Overall I think del Toro handled the story quite well, using various atmospheric techniques such as having the "real world" parts of the movie take place at dusk or night, creating a parallel between the fantasy world that Ofelia discovers (also dark and gloomy at all times). However, the transitions from this fantasy world to the real world and vice versa were awkward and didn't quite "fit" in my opinion. Also, I wish the movie spent more time in this fantasy world, as these scenes were simply brilliant in their own surreal way. I do think that del Toro could have exchanged some of the violence for more of the fantasy element.<br /><br />Also impressive are the performances by the entire cast, but especially Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia. I found myself rooting for her, and genuinely heartbroken at the end (won't spoil the ending). There is definitely a lot going on underneath the surface of this film, which makes it demand repeated viewings.<br /><br />Although I see that other reviewers have already mentioned this, I'll repeat that this is NOT a children's movie. There is quite a lot of aforementioned violence, a scene of implicit torture, and the f-word a few times. Any parent expecting to see a "Harry Potter"-like film is in for a rude awakening, as will any child who sees this. Then again, the "R" rating should already raise a red flag for any parent in the first place.<br /><br />But all in all, definitely recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever... and being offered a terrible choice if she wants to get in.<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow that her "real life" is full of. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>This movie was so wonderful, and probably the best I have ever seen.<br />It starts out in war torn spain, and is of a lonely young girl of about 12.<br />Freshly arriving in Spain with her Mother, to meet her new sadistic "stepdad", she comes across a fairy and a fawn, who tell her that she is really a princess from long ago. There have been portals open for years to bring her back to her kingdom, but before this happens, she must perform 3 tasks, to prove her immortality.<br /><br />Without making this too long and giving the whole storyline away, I will say that her quest leads her to the most visually stimulating scenes I have ever seen onscreen.<br />They are terrible and wonderful all at the same time.There are creatures that eat fairies and babies...creatures who have eyes in thier hands, and places so over the top, I can't even imagine how the scenes were created...<br />Beyond all the beautiful visuals though, there lies a very sad story of a lonely innocent girl that is quite touching...<br />This is how Fairytales USED to be at the turn of the century,how  they SHOULD be..until Hollywood RUINED them, just like Alice in Wonderland was ruined, and "Disney-fied" as one reviewer put it.<br /><br />I purchased this DVD when it first came out, and have watched it many times since, and will watch it many more.It is a stunning masterpiece that will leave you in tears.<br />Highly reccomended for adults and older children...NOT for smaller children !!</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Firstly, and most importantly, everyone must know that this film is Spanish language with English subtitles.  Quick, before you go and vote this review unhelpful for stating the obvious, let me tell you this; most people don't READ Amazon's product info.  They skip right to the reviews.  The thing I first came here to look for is if the fact that it's in a different language take away from the film.<br /><br />After seeing the entirety of "Pan's Labyrinth", the answer is quite simply 'no.'<br /><br />What we've got here is a visual and graphic masterpiece of a story.  The fantasy elements mingle seamlessly with the real-life portions, bringing up questions that will leave you thinking about the movie for hours.  Is the fantasy aspect of the story really happening, or is it all in Ofelia's mind?  What does it mean when the fantasy monsters (which are quite horrifying) not even a fraction as frightening as the evil of the human characters?  This isn't just one of those films you can watch.  It's bloody violent, while also managing to be visually astounding.  The deepness and the heart of the story leaves such an emotional impact, which is only expanded by the simple yet effective use of music.<br /><br />This is a movie one can truly get involved in; you root for the characters, you relate to and cry with them, and--from the way the film is shot--you go on the fantastic journey with them.  There is nothing negative to say about this film at all, except for the fact that even the least squeamish of viewers may wince at some of the most violent scenes.  This is no child's fairy tale.<br /><br />10/10 Classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>There are some films that film makers are born to make.  For Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is that film.  Taking place in 1944 Spain, Pan's Labyrinth revolves around young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who seeks to escape the horrifying world she lives in.  Her tender mother (Ariadna Gil) is newly married and carrying the son of the cruel and blood thirsty Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who enjoyes torturing the prisoners he captures.  Ofelia however gets a surprise upon discovering the labyrinth in the woods, which is populated by the Faun (Doug Jones, better known as the guy in the Ape Sapien suit in Del Toro's adaptation of Hellboy) who informs her that she is the re-incarnated daughter of the King of the underworld.  She is given three tasks to perform, each the more dire, until the film reaches it's startling and heart wrenching conclusion.  Despite some of the film's incredibly bloody and violent scenes, Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifuly realized film.  Del Toro's inventive direction combined with the gloomy atmosphere and brilliant make up effects are a sight to behold, and that's saying it lightly.  Be warned though that Pan's Labyrinth is not a film for all tastes, and those who don't like fairy tale elements that aren't kid tested and Disney approved will certainly not enjoy this film to say the least.  That being said though, films like Pan's Labyrinth come along all so rarely, which makes it all the more enjoyable.  The New Line Platinum Series DVD edition features a host of extras as well, and is definitely the version of the film to get.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>Wow, what can I say? I don't think I have ever felt the emotions I did during this movie then anything I have ever watched before. Especially for a film not in English.<br /><br />I'm sure the plot has been explaining in most of the other 600 reviews for it here.<br /><br />Never had I felt so much hate for a fictional character before. Sergi L&oacute;pez playing the Captain had me begging for someone to put an end to his monstrous cold-heartedness. To try and explain such a movie to someone as being something like Alice In Wonderland in Nazi Germany can easily be dismissed as a brain dead idea, but I am glad to have seen the movie now and seen one of the best movies of the new millennium.<br /><br />Never have I felt absolute hate; and wanting a character to get it in the end so badly, then I did with Sergi L&oacute;pez character. So I guess my hat has to go off for his performance creating such a powerful and villainy of a fictional entity.</p></br><a href="../users/A25KKXUQQ0OLWB.html">A25KKXUQQ0OLWB</a><br/><p>This is a wonderful film that includes magic, mysticism, and terror of a war.  A girl whose mother marries a Spanish fascist tries to cope with her stepfather's brutal personality, a servant's assistance to the resistance and her mother's poor health.  The magic helps project a world that is much safer and comforting than the real world.  A very moving movie and I just love it.  The extended DVD provides much more than the film and the extras are good.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>Since I am 1/2 German, this reminded me of the fairy tales by Grimm, with which I grew up. Although there are many sweet and innocent parts in this film, overall, it appears cruel, sad and jarring, which is different than most fantasy type films. The power of the child's imagination is juxtaposed very effectively against her ultimate defeat in the end, but the metaphor of her death and the rejoining of her parents resonates with many fantasies we have with the afterlife experiences in many culture. This film does an excellent job of blending several genres together. Visually the film is startlingly beautiful, the PQ is absolutely amazing on the HD DVD. The characters are believable and invoked a significant amount of emotion, a fantastic accommplishment, and in the often time "cookie cutter" hollywood arena. Great film, highly recommended and a "different" kind of intense film experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is a superb film from director Guillermo del Toro. Set in 1944 when a last band of rebels are still holding out after the Spanish Civil war has long since finished. Ofelia is a young girl who brought by her mother to see her stepfather a Captain in the army with a sadistic streak. He is leading the fight against the rebels.<br /><br />All this is interesting and mapped out from the start. However within a short space of time the film takes a huge turn into the world of fantasy. Ofelia is taken by a fairy to a fantasy world under the maze of the films title. On a simple level this is just a young girls escape from the nightmare happening around her, and if you just accept it as that you will still see a great movie.<br /><br />However Toro uses the fantasy world as a chance to make a movie that works on another level. There are clear references to the holocaust in the film (piles of shoes for one) and the Captain/Stepfather is remarkably similiar to the camp commandant in Schindlers List, both because of his brutal actions, and even visually Toro has picked an actor who looks like Ralph Fiennes. This may be pure coincidence...<br /><br />This isn't a film I could recommend for small children. Firstly it has some quite unpleasant violence, which in context is completly justified. Secondly some of the imagery is a little too disturbing for youngsters in my view. But at the right age (and I wouldn't like to say what age that should be) its a film for everyone.<br /><br />Unlike many Hollywood films this resolved without the need for tons of overt sentimentality, people cheering etc. Indeed I thought the ending got the balance just about right. Its a film I shall be watching again. Hopefully next time in HiDef as I imagine this would be a stunning film to see in that format.</p></br><a href="../users/A328547P5BGZC.html">A328547P5BGZC</a><br/><p>A masterpiece!

It's a thematically complex fairy tale for adults. And it may be the most profound and personal film of the Mexican director's career.<br /><br />The story is set in 1944, in Spain where the fascists still hold sway over the people. Amidst this turmoil a young girl and her pregnant mother are leaving behind their home, their former lives and going to live with the mother's new husband, the fascist El Capitan. The girl finds that she can only survive through the use of her imagination, but the fairy tale world to which she escapes turn out to be more real than the world in which she is trapped. She stumbles onto an ancient ruinous labyrinth and in its center is a pit that serves as a doorway between the "real" world and the "fantasy" world. Living deep within this pit is the faun, an ambiguous and immortal creature. He tells the girl that she is a princess and a goddess, that she does not belong to our cruel and violent world, and that if she is to return her own she must first complete three extraordinary tasks. Meanwhile her mother suffers from complications of her pregnancy, and the Captain's command is under threat by the Socialist resistance, whose band is camped in the surrounding forests. Soon all of these elements collide and destinies are revealed.<br /><br />Guillermo's film is easily the most visually spectacular film of 2006 and is rich in detail. He brilliantly uses the screen as a painter would use a canvas and every color that he chooses has particular meaning, every shadow hides within it a mystery, and every light serves as beacon for hope. The visual effects and the cinematography are amazing. The world of magic is vividly brought to life in gold, red, yellow and orange. The other world, our world, is disturbingly cold in black, gray, blue and green. But as the two worlds affect each other the color palettes begin to mix. As director he also references other works of fantasy, both in literature and in film, and uses thematic components of countless fairy tales. The film could almost be seen as one part Anne Frank and one part Alice in Wonderland. The themes that are dealt with are truly universal: the importance of innocence, the power of sacrifice, the perils of ambition, the corrupting qualities of obsession, betrayal and doubt, but most prominently transcendence through selflessness. The characters are simple archetypes but the performances are complex and multi-faceted. The story is timeless, a truly modern fairy tale.<br />Although a fairy tale it's definitely not for children. It deals with the darker aspects of humanity and the loss of childhood innocence. There are numerous scenes of graphic violence and most of the fantastical creatures would give children nightmares. It's quite obvious that this film is for adults once you've seen a man's face crushed with a bottle. This is an R-rated fantasy film; it's not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4B8NC">Harry Potter</a> or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings</a>. It's Pan's Labyrinth.<br />So if you aren't easily frightened maybe you might just take a journey through its winding passages, discover its mysteries, breathe in its poetry and find yourself lost in its vision.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">2-disc Platinum Series Edition</a> has some amazing special features that will be sure to intrigue and enlighten those interested in the film.

I knew this was going to be a rough film when I saw how graphic the first murder was. This is a fairy tale and a brutal war film rolled into one. I wasn't ready for the violence factor at all, but ultimately I was glad to see that this isn't some fluffy film about dreams coming true. While the dreams do come true, it is by death that they are realized. The special effects are amazing. The monsters were freaky, especially this one dude who has eyes in his hands. This film exceeds expectations in the fairy tale department and that part of the story is simply amazing. However, the "war" part of the story is just above par and while it is very good, it doesn't feel great because it is up against the fairy tale part of the movie that is just impossible to compete with. The acting is outstanding from the main characters to the bit parts. There were parts of this movie that did feel a little slow and I kept wishing they would get back to the monsters. But the movie on a whole really does capture your attention and imagination. It is different than anything I have ever seen. Not for kids... I repeat, NOT FOR KIDS! Go into this film expecting to shut your eyes from time to time if on screen violence and gore bothers you. I loved this movie, but I can only give it 4 stars because it felt unbalanced and slow at times. Otherwise, you really should see this movie and worth buying because it demands repeated viewings. Oh, you gotta see this!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing film directed by Guillermo Del Toro.  It manages to capture the essence of being a child appropriately enough to serve as nostalgia for its adult audience.  In other words, you really don't have to be a fantasy geek to appreciate this.  It is smaller than many of the larger epic fantasies we have grown accustomed to seeing on the big screen over the last few years (i.e. Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter movies) but in many ways it is more lucid, and it is certainly less diluted by oceans of CGI. There are great effects though; puppets, CGI, makeup, set design and costumes.  However, I would say that more effort than money was put into these elements and creating a pure vision was certainly the priority, as opposed to creating a large box-office draw. Del Toro also has the advantage of placing the fantasy into the eyes of a child, while the rest of story is told in the miserable reality of 1944 post civil war Spain.  That dichotomy alone makes the film both remarkably authentic and the fantasy elements that much more rewarding.  What child wouldn't want to escape that existence?<br /><br />As the film opens we are introduced to a fairy tale about Princess Moanna from the underworld.  The Princess decides to see the world above her and when she does she forgets about her royal existence and eventually becomes mortal and dies.  Her father, the king, believes her spirit will return.  After this we go to 1944 Spain after the Francoists have taken power.  We are introduced to Ofelia (Ivan Baquero), a young girl whose pregnant mother has brought Ofelia to meet her new stepfather (Sergi L&oacute;pez), a fascist captain assigned to control and destroy the Spanish Maquis in that region.  He is also the father to Ofelia's unborn brother.  Ofelia meets an insect who she feels represents a fairy.  The insect leads Ofelia to the labyrinth.  This spirals into Ofelia's eventual interaction with a faun who declares that Ofelia is Princess Moanna and in order to ensure that her essence as princess of the underworld is intact, she must accomplish three specific tasks.  The story goes from there with astounding visuals and sequences that range from shocking and suspenseful, to beautiful and beaming with hope.<br /><br />In a year of mediocre cinema, Pan's Labyrinth was one of the few stand-out productions for me.  Obviously it was heavily acclaimed and rewarded for its visuals, but the writing and direction deserve accolades as well.  This is one of best original screenplays to come along in the last few years.<br /><br />The acting was also great. Ivana Baquero is a wonderful new find and Maribel Verd&uacute; (Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n) was also fantastic as one of the captain's maids and a rebel mole.  I also believe that Captain Vidal was probably the best villain of the year.  Part of it was Sergi L&oacute;pez's performance but it was also the way his actions shocked us.  Without his violent outbursts and constant cutthroat disposition I think this would've been a lesser movie, but it also may have received a more profitable PG-13 rating.  In other words, it took some courage and sacrifice in making this villain as brutal as he was and I salute Del Toro for not even giving that perspective consideration.  Again, it's artistic substance as the priority.<br /><br />Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is the kind of effort that reminds me of why I love cinema, and I have no doubt that Del Toro and his crew feel that a story like this is the very reason they make movies in the first place.  Obviously, I highly recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that starts so well that you hope it will stay that good but which actually surprises you and constantly improves. It's a remarkably layered work about the importance of choice even in an emotional and political dictatorship and about the fictions and fantasies that sustain people through the worst circumstances. On the surface this appears to be little more than a more fantastic spin on The Spirit of the Beehive, sharing its post-Spanish Civil War setting as well as the broken family setting, but this is a far superior film in every way. Although marketed largely as a fantasy, its real power lies in the scenes set in the real world where Sergi Lopez's all too believable Fascist monster is mopping up the few remaining communist guerrillas in the hills while waiting for his sick wife to give birth to his son while her daughter from her first marriage tries to reassert her own identity rather than submit to the Captain's idea of family.<br /><br />The challenges of the mythical world are far less disturbing - or violent - than the real one, and it's all too easy to see why she wants to escape into the darkness of the labyrinth where at least the hope of something better exists. But then she's not the only one escaping into the imagination, as her mother sustains herself with a romanticised view of her meeting the captain that he has no interest in whatsoever. To him stories - even a part of his family history that has passed into local legend - exist only to be denied. Lopez's greatest sin isn't the pride that he admits to, or even that he is so pitiless, it's that he chooses to obey without question: the girl's small triumph is that she does not. And the triumphs in the film are generally small, quiet ones, where courage and fear go hand in hand, making the few acts of decency all the more important when they occur. There is one "saved by the cavalry" moment that at first doesn't convince but does prove to be there for a definite purpose that makes the ending all the more powerful.<br /><br />But while there's a lot going on underneath the surface of the film, it doesn't crush it with the weight of its ideas. It's directed with a visual assurance and, at times, playfulness that sweeps you along, sometimes with delight, sometimes with apprehension, but never simply for the sake of a nice shot or a neat special effect (most of which are incredibly well integrated for such a low budget feature). The performances are superb, with Lopez somehow managing to avoid turning his irredeemable character into a caricature: this is an evil without conscience that is all too recognisable. Javier Navarette's beautiful score is also adept at walking the fine line between magic and emotion without crossing the line into schmaltz.<br /><br />It's a remarkable film, the only new one that I saw last year that I'd genuinely say is one of the greatest of all time. Practically perfect and definitely one to add to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>You know you just have to watch a movie when you're absolutely enthralled by the cover.

His new wife is heavily pregnant and suffering, and Ofelia instantly spots what she calls a fairy and chases after it.<br /><br />She comes across the Labyrinth of Fauno, where the fairy leads her, turning into a green goblin creature, which speaks like Tinkerbell. She meets Fauno inside, who's hiding from the rest of the world, and is a mix of so many different animals, it's hard to describe. She then discovers she's actually a princess, and the princess's soul has been brought back through her. But she has to complete three challenges, in order to see if she belongs with the mortals or not.<br /><br />Outside the labyrinth, the rebels are attacking, and Ofelia's stepfather is trying to discover who the link to the rebels is in his house. The mother is still suffering with the baby boy inside her. Ofelia is desperate to stay and help her mother, but also desperate discover the whole new world that is awaiting her.<br /><br />She meets a new interesting characters along the way, including Pale Man, a strange looking creature, with no eyes in his (its?) face, but in the palms of his hands instead. You've seen the stills from the movie, the mad creature who puts his hands up to his face in order to see. Nightmares, hello! He appears in an almost Adam & Eve-esque scenario. Very interesting, and chases Ofelia.<br /><br />From the same director who did Hellboy, the magic is here, which was touched upon in Hellboy. The scenes are well done, and really stunning, all the little faun symbols you can't help but notice throughout the film. It at times reminded me of my own childhood fairytales, Narnia and Alice for example, but so much more darker. Actually Guillermo Del Toro needs to direct a Narnia movie, that would be amazing!!! He could make the films so good. He shows what he can do in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy. At times, the movie can be almost dreamlike, and the 118 minute running time flies by, and I was shocked when it was finished.<br /><br />The score is amazing, particularly the lullaby theme, which appears frequently throughout the movie, and has been going through my head on and off since watching it.<br /><br />If you've seen this DVD in a shop, and wondered what it was about, buy it. It's one of those magical movies that are one of a kind, and there will never be anything like it ever again. I have recommended it to a couple of people since seeing it, and will keep recommending it. It's more than words can say.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>This is on my top ten for all time faves.  I love the story and the acting is brilliant.  My favourite scenes are those with the faun and the little girl and the "enchanting" secret world only she can see.  I don't mind the subtitles, I've gotten good at reading them considering alot of the great films nowadays are foreign films.  This is a fantastic film, it should have won the oscar for best picture.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>While this film is spoken in Spanish (with English subtitles available), the Director gives his commentary in perfect English. And his commentary is very worthwhile, so be sure to get a DVD that includes it as bonus material.<br /><br />Guillermo Del Toro's remarks add to the understanding and enjoyment of the film. It's like attending a lively filmmaker's master class. Even if you aren't interested in the art of projecting story and emotion on a screen, you'll still undoubtedly find the talk-over interesting.<br /><br />I had missed so many cinematic nuances the first time through. Del Toro says he conceived the movie as a sort of poem, full of visual rhymes, reflections, and symbols. As he points out his interplay of imagery, the viewer sees deeper into the method and meaning of every scene. While the movie itself involves a fantastical labyrinth, the Director's commentary is a lucid look to the bottom of an enchanted pool.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Some day, the sad day will come when Guillermo Del Toro will stop making movies.  No matter what happens between today and that date with destiny, he will be able to look back to "Pan's Labyrinth" and say with confidence that he made one of the Great Movies.<br /><br />"PL" tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a twelve-year old girl condemned to live during the final years of the Spanish civil war.  Her father is dead, and her mother is pregnant by the dastardly Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  Vidal commands that Ofelia and her mother come to live with him at his Fascist outpost in the Navarre mountains as he attempts to wipe out the local rebels.<br /><br />Ofelia has retreated from the horrors of the world to become lost in the world of fairy tales, and so she is better equipped than most when a fairy visits her one night.  The fairy leads her to a labyrinth in the garden behind the country house, where Ofelia learns that she is the daughter of the king of the Underworld.  In order to reclaim her immortality, she must perform three specific tasks, each of which will test her courage to the utmost.<br /><br />All the while, Vidal carries out a brutal campaign against the rebels.  Guillermo stresses the barbarity of the war without overdoing it . . . almost.  Further straining the nerves of the audience, there are more than a few spies working within the walls of Vidal's outpost, including the gorgeous kitchen maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" fame) and the noble Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo).<br /><br />Del Toro has created a movie of visual splendor, even though much of the movie shows the horrors of war.  You have all seen the spectacular monster with eyeballs in his hands, but there are plenty of other visual delights.  I had thought that I would never see as beautiful a movie about war as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's "A Very Long Engagement," but "PL" gives that movie a run for its money.<br /><br />But more than visual delights, "PL" is a serious movie about courage in the face of the darkest adversity.  Even though this is fantasy, Ofelia faces perils in both the real world and the fantastic that far exceed anything Harry Potter ever faces.  Indeed, the risks Ofelia runs in real life make the fantastic threats to her life that much more dire.  Do not be misled by the youthful leading lady to think that just any child can watch "PL" and not have nightmares.  Children should see this movie, but only when they are mature enough - I strongly recommend watching this before you let your kids see it.<br /><br />Congratulations to the entire team for making such a wonderful movie.  It's rare that the fantasy genre gets such mature treatment - if more stories like "PL" saw the light of day (and fewer Tolkien clones), the fantasy genre would not be shunted off to one side and would be considered serious fare.

In fact, this may be a first for me. Guillermo Del Toro's fairy tale for adults, Pan's Labyrinth, is quite possibly the best film that I've seen in a number of years.<br /><br />The film has the ability to challenge the viewer to think about the choices he or she makes in daily life and to confront the results of those choices. The film deals with the idea that magic is a way to escape the brutal reality of daily life.<br /><br />At its simplest this is the story of a young girl, Ofelia who has to invent a fairy tale land of her own as she is confronted with the barbarism of post WWII Spain. The movie reveals itself in fairy tale fashion. Characters are either all good or all evil there is no middle ground.<br /><br />Forced to live witha sadistic Captain who has married her mother, the child escapes to magical realms and performs tasks in order to claim her rightful place as a princess. To offer more would be to give away a story that you need to become lost in.<br /><br />I viewed the two disc Platinum Edition whic features the commentary of the director and many production featurettes.

A little bit in feel of, I'm sorry but I have to say it, Alice in Wonderland. Those are a few of the feelings that I felt while watching this film. I was so drawn into the duality of the story of this film, that it really didn't bother me that it was in Spanish. The story was just so fantastic that I got lost in it. I am torn on the dubbing idea, on one side I hope to be able to enjoy the more visual aspect of the film sets and the characters expressions, etc, instead of reading subtitles; on the other hand there was a certain mystique in that the film was in Spanish. Perhaps to dub it would be like ruining a masterpiece. This movie is not for kids and a lot of reviews have blasted the film for the violence in it. I can accept that there is a story that needs to be told here, and that we can't reduce the horrors of war, or the monstrosities of evil people, just to make ourselves feel safe. I highly recommend this film; it is a story of a fight for freedom in the mind and the fight for freedom in the world.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever...<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made. Definitely a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Pan's Labyrinth' is a powerful movie voyage that juxtaposes the horrors of war with an enchanting world of the imagination.  Set in Francisco Franco's Spain as his infant Fascist government comes to power,  the film takes place in 1944, while the Allies are defeating the Axis, and Franco is fighting guerrillas in exile.  Ofelia has felt the grip of both worlds.  A near adolescent, she is torn between the reality of war that has taken her father, and the portals of imagination that help her flee from harm. She has a brutal step-father, Captain Vidal, who has impregnated her mother, Mercedes, and displaced them from her familiar surroundings to a military stronghold in the country.  As complications come upon Mercedes' pregnancy, Ofelia is horrified to see her mother hemorrhaging.  An avid reader, her books start to come to life as the details of her new arrangement become more menacing.  Characters from an underground world, such as a faun, offer her adventure and  solutions to key problems above.  They are often linked to the world of reality with tangible portals, such as chalk, a book, and keys.  Walking sticks become fairies, and so forth.  In the meantime, the audience is given the full force of truth from which Ofelia is partly spared.  There's the business of war:  espionage, fighting, and torture.  'Pan's Labyrinth' effectively blends together a tale of innocence and cruelty where both worlds meet and have meaning.<br /><br /> I couldn't help but think that this movie is an artful leap from the old `Calvin and Hobbes' comic strip with, obviously, more weighty subject matter.  I also am reminded of  PC adventure games like 'Myst' that propel players to different realms.  (Any of these comparisons are merely meant to be hints or suggestions.  The genius of this movie comes to fruition on its own terms.)  Pan's Labyrinth' has fine special effects, but don't expect to have a myriad of creatures jumping out at you on the screen like blockbuster films. This movie, rather, tells its story well and explores the worlds of reality and imagination in a special way that reflects upon both.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War.

Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen onscreen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.<br /><br />Set around D-Day in 1944 as the Allies are turning the tide of the war, the film takes place in a remote area of northern Spain where ten-year old Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen come to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal, the deceptive and sadistic commander of the local outpost. Steeped in her fantasy books, Ofelia is a child often lost in her imagination, and she is drawn to a mysterious stone labyrinth on the property. It is here that she meets the Pale Man, a pedantic faun who assigns three onerous tasks which she must complete by the next full moon in order for her to realize her throne as a princess of the underworld. While this sounds like the trappings of an optimistic fairy tale in "The Wizard of Oz" mode, it turns out to be far from it, as del Toro creates a purely gothic world of eye-wincing creatures and actions not far removed from those found in mainstream American sci-fi horror movies. The genuine power of the film comes from the way he juxtaposes this fanciful, scarifying world with the persecution of the resistance fighters and the absolutist, ego-driven domain Vidal has established at the outpost. Each distinctive piece of the movie brings resonance to the other, all the way to the climactic point where they collide in an inevitable way at the end.<br /><br />Looking a bit like the pre-adolescent Natalie Portman, Ivana Baquero brings a plaintive, yearning quality to Ofelia that is thankfully free of precociousness. As Vidal, Sergi L&oacute;pez effectively brings steely resolve to his role while hinting at the paternal approval his character never received. Maribel Verd&uacute;, memorable as the older woman in Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's "Y tu mam&aacute; tambi&eacute;n", brings coiled power to the pivotal role of Vidal's house servant Mercedes. Also solid are Ariadna Gil as the frail Carmen who acquiesced to Vidal's need for a son, &Aacute;lex Angulo as a kindly doctor, and Doug Jones as the special effects-laden Pale Man. Special kudos need to go to Guillermo Navarro's striking, moody cinematography; Eugenio Caballero's imaginative set designs; and the special visual and sound effects crucial in creating such an otherworldly mood. Unafraid to show scenes of unrelenting horror, Del Toro has created what ultimately is a magical film so audacious in execution that it defies description. Along with Cuar&oacute;n's "Children of Men" and Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's "Babel", this film shows a true renaissance among Mexican filmmakers on a global landscape.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie is not at all for children or those who dislike major violence. Of all the movies that Guillermo del Toro has made I'm guessing this is the personal one for him. I heard him saying on TV that when he was a kid he'd imagine the floor to his bedroom opening up and a creature coming out and having a conversation with him. That's pretty much what Ofelia goes through in this movie as she resorts to a fantasy world where strange creatures send her on a magical journey to regain her royal title. A very simple fairy tale told by one of our greatest filmmakers.<br /><br />While the movie closely follows Ofelia's tasks, spoken to her by a magic book from Pan, it is mostly about the war, double agents (Maribel Verd&uacute; and &Aacute;lex Angulo), and the Captain's near-obsession with his expected son. The battles are extremely brutal and made me queazy a couple of times. So brutal are these deaths, in fact, that you'll be relieved to see a simple shot to the head or back.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch, and I like to say that young Ivana Baquero has a huge and brilliant future ahead of her. Plus one of the greatest aspects to this movie is how much scarier the people in the real world are than any strange creature from another fantasy world and none do it better than Sergi Lopez who plays the evil Capitan. He does a great job of playing in a suave sophisticated way that rivals that great job that Ralph Fiennes did with his character in "Schindler's List". He's pure evil packaged in clean cut way and doesn't have the slightest hesitation to killing anyone. It's really interesting that in a movie filled with strange creatures like a giant toad and a pale man with no eyes, the most frightening person would be a regular man with no conscious. The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just takes all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. The "pale man" (also played by Doug Jones), is by far the most terrifying creature in the movie, most-likely to give even the most mature and grown-up adults shivers. Faun (Doug Jones) who is the creature that gives Ofelia all her assignments is also great with his goat looking self. I really wish there were more scenes with him in the movie but I guess the budget wouldn't allow for that.<br /><br />Yes, this movie does have sub-titles, but it's hardly noticeable at first, so much so that you forget about them by the end of the movie. "Pan's Labyrinth" is frightening and sad to the extreme, but it also gives you a sense of hope that magic does, in fact, exist. This is one of the most astonishing adult fairy tales I've seen in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Easily the most depressing film of last year.

Remarkable acting from young Ivana Baquero as a girl who must contend with her pregnant mother's illness, her military stepfather's cruelty  towards the peasant revolutionaries, and her own interior world of magic realism/fantasy, involving creatures who send her on increasingly dangerous missions to perform certain tasks before the moon is full.

Her father has been waiting for her to be reborn but to prove that she is indeed a princess she must accomplish three tasks before the next full moon so she can be reunited with her father and mother.<br /><br />Del Toro's film isn't perfect nor is it as good as some of his other efforts but it is a worthwhile film from this very talented director. It won't appeal to everyone (and it isn't meant to). The performances from all the actors are quite good particularly the little girl playing Ofelia who gives a natural performance without overplaying her role. The production design is, as with all Del Toro's films, exceptional (in fact there are other visual motifs that refer to "Hellboy" one of Del Toro's most successful mainstream projects).<br /><br />Like Del Toro's other films "The Devil's Backbone" and "Cronos", "El Laberinto del Fauno" is a powerful occasionally gruesome sad fantasy film. This isn't fantasy as in "The Wizard of Oz" but darker much closer in tone to the original colorful (and equally gruesome)Grimm Brothers fairytales. Del Toro's film shares a sensibility with some of Terry Gilliam's darker films. If you didn't enjoy "The Devil's Backbone" or any of Del Toro's other films, then you won't enjoy this often visually stunning sad tale.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth (as it is known by its English title)is shown with subtitles in Spanish. It won't be for everyone there are a number of brutal, gruesome scenes but these are balanced out by Del Toro's arresting visual imagery.</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>This is one of the most amazing and magic movies i ever seem...I really recommend PAN'S LABYRINTH to everyone...the story of this film is BRILLIANT!!!The effects are totally amazing, and the end makes me wanna cry...but cry for such a beautiful film...AMAZING!!!

That clip left with the impression that this was a fantasy film largely oriented to a youthful audience.  I saw it on the IFC Channel's schedule and made a point to watch it since I knew it was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.<br /><br />I was immediately impressed with the movie when I understood that it focussed on Spain in the aftermath of its' Civil War.  I have been a student of that conflict over the years and it helped me appreciate the film.  I was very much aware of the extreme passions that emerged during that war.  As the evil persona of the Captain unfolded, I found it to be quite credible.  My next impression was, What happened to the fantasy film I thought I was going to see?  Well, it also emerged but while it was an intregal part of the film, it was far more understated that I had thought it would be.  That was OK by me (I was particularly concerned that this movie might be a cartoon).<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a movie that becomes increasingly tense and that, to me, is the key to its' success.  I was engrossed in the movie throughout and I liked the mixture of reality and fantasy.  The mixture of the two led all the way up to the conclusion of the movie and left each of us the option of interpreting its' ending as we chose to.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>Billed as a "fairy tale for adults," del Toro's brilliant depiction of the brutal aftermath of the Spanish Civil War through a fantastical tale of fauns, quests, and a lost princess is far more moving than a straightforward account could ever be.  Bookish, creative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) finds herself at a remote military outpost when her pregnant mother marries the cruel commander, Captain Vidal.  Ofelia finds herself amidst men who don't hesitate to torture and kill and rebels who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for freedom.  The Captain sees Ofelia as a disposable appendage of her mother, and her mother, suffering from pregnancy complications, cannot care for her.  As Ofelia meets a insect-like fairy and a faun (Pan, in the English translation), she descends into a fantastical world that is every bit as dark as the one in the outpost.<br /><br />Through these two parallel worlds, del Toro manages to offer hope where there is none, and freedom in an unescapable situation. The relationship between the Captain's servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL57">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>) and Ofelia is poignant as the two find refuge in a surrogate mother/daughter bond.  The chemistry between the two actresses is palpable and believable; without it, the connection between the real and the fantasy worlds would not have succeeded.<br /><br />Viewers who like more traditional methods of storytelling will likely be disappointed, as this film is darkly bizarre, with much ambiguity.  Those who like unusual foreign films (and don't mind reading subtitles) will embrace this twisted tale of a child abandoned in an unforgiving world.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>In your hands is your destiny<br /><br />Director Guillermo del Toro out did himself and created a film beyond any previous presentation. Although he purposely applied many layers both technologically and psychologically, the actual finished product is deeper and has many more facets. This could be the results of leaving loose ends and just implications. What looks like two stories is really one story where one reality intertwines with another reality until they both merge.<br /><br />It is 1944 Spain, five years after the Civil War, ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going to meet her new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez.) Vidal is a fascist pro-Franco officer. She is about to meet more than that as she encounters possible friends from another world. We also see how touchier and fantasy are juxtaposed. One of the major questions to answer is, is the magical creatures real and can only be seen because you have to have the right gaze or are they figments?<br /><br />You will need to watch the movie several times to get the nuances and see the surrounding environments that you miss when concentrating on the dialog. See how the two world parallels in furniture. See out the two works hold similar tasks as both containing a key and a knife. In addition, there are always more surprises waiting.<br /><br />The acting is superb especially Ofelia's death scene. Ivana Baquero Won, Imagen Award Best Actress, Premio ACE Best New Actress, Newcomer Award Female (Categor&iacute;a Femenina), Turia Award New Best Actress, and Nominated, Young Artist Award Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Leading Young Actor or Actress.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version I watched had English subtitles as option but I found them to be a tad inaccurate and wanting of some of the background conversations. However, the director's voice over option helped point out the obvious that was not obvious until he pointed it out. As pointed out by the director, the violence was not for violence sake in the story and they did not have cowboy type breakable props.<br /><br />This is one of the films that take good advantage of Blu-ray resolution and intensity.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P6R5Y8">Bridge to Terabithia [Blu-ray</a>]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780658418">Pan's Labyrinth</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001URA5XY">Phoebe in Wonderland</a></p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>I will start by saying that, technically, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time. Set during the Spanish Civil War, "Pan's Labyrinth" tells two stories, one of the fight between the Fascists and the rebels at the end of the war, and a fairy tale centred around the painfully lonely step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. The production values of this film are very high, evidently much effort has been put into making the historical elements of this story as realistic as possible, and I was very impressed by the way in which the director interwove the fantasy elements with historical facts. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the swag of awards that it won. However, after marvelling at the technical brilliance of this film, I did find myself wondering about the message that it was trying to send.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a very dark movie, both with respect to lighting and plot. Although the main character, Ofelia, is a child, this film is very violent and probably shouldn't be shown to young children. Captain Vidal, Ofelia's step-father, is a sadistic man who is shown torturing his enemies on several occasions. That aside, however, I found the whole film to be lacking in hope. As a child, Ofelia has no choice in where she lives and throughout the film, Ofelia is shown on numerous occasions to have little choice in what she does. All of the adults around her either want to harm her or use her. No one really seems to care about her well-being at all in either this world or Ofelia's fantasy world. Even the historical fact that the Fascists did win the Spanish Civil War, adds to the general hopelessness of this film. I just don't understand why the writer/director decided to make a film that is this bleak. In a way, I see this film as being "Don Juan DeMarco"'s dark counterpart. Both films deal with people moving in to a fantasy world to escape an unpleasant reality (or are these fantasy world's real?), but whereas "Don Juan DeMarco" uplifts the audience, "Pan's Labyrinth" doesn't.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am glad I have seen this film. As an aspiring writer, I feel that there is much that can be learnt from this film, with regard to how to write a very good story, and up until the end, I did enjoy the film. I just wouldn't recommend this film to someone who needed cheering up.</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I confess that I thought the real world storyline set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War was actually more interesting then the visually-spectacular but lightly plotted fairy tale segments, though these were impressively imaginative and at times beautiful to behold, just not long enough or very well explained. The actors all did excellent jobs in this violent cinematic outing, and the placing of the story in a dense, dark forest worked very well too. The main reason I am going out on a wobbly limb and giving this movie four stars instead of five is that to be brutally honest, I think Pan's Labyrinth left a lot needing to be explained. It has one of those plots that simply hands out what there is and leaves you no choice to but to take what you're given, sans much background or annotation of the mythology of its inner soul. It should have been a little bit longer and taken more time to make us feel more aware of what was at stake in Ofelia's quest. After the movie was done I felt like a huge chapter was missing. But did I like Pan's Labyrinth? Very much so. It had an originality that is sadly rare in the motion picture industry. It's also a movie that deserves to be watched in high definition, if you can.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who arrives in the Spanish countryside with her pregnant, sick mother (Ariadna Gil); they intend to live with the girl's profoundly evil and cruel stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez) who is in the Spanish army. Despite the fact that the Spanish Civil War is over, rebels still fight in the countryside against the Fascists and Captain Vidal runs a military outpost to eliminate his enemies.<br /><br />The stress of this remarkably brutal and hostile world proves too much for young Ofelia; and she eventually escapes into a world of fantasy. In this world, based partly on a real live labyrinth near the military camp, Ofelia pretends (or believes) that a faun (Doug Jones) will give her three increasingly dangerous tasks to perform. If she succeeds, she will be rewarded by the faun: She will return to her rightful place as a princess in an underground world where she will be loved by her people and life is much more pleasant, to say the least.<br /><br />The plot progresses at a good pace. As real life becomes more and more challenging and stressful, so do the imaginary tasks Ofelia must perform in order to become worthy of entering the world of paradise where she will live forever as a princess.<br /><br />There won't be any plot spoilers here; but I must warn you of this: Pan's Labyrinth is no movie for squeamish people. The events and scenes are quite candid and the spoken lines are as honest and direct as people would have spoken them at the time these real life events occurred. We see many murders and there are several particularly grisly scenes with more blood in them than my community hospital keeps in storage! I briefly closed my eyes once or twice, admittedly, but I kept watching because the film proves itself to be nothing less than a masterful tour de force by all involved and a true work of fine art. The actors portray their characters very convincingly; and the choreography shines in the battle scenes in particular. Look also for a fine performance by Ofelia's only friend besides her mother, the sweet housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;).<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras including a commentary with the director (Guillermo del Toro) and an interactive feature that sheds extra light on the making of this fine motion picture.<br /><br />In short, Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent work of fine art that we should watch and watch again for the pleasure of seeing a film that is truly top quality art. I highly recommend Pans Labyrinth for adults--and the children within us--who want to experience a film of grand proportions. Pans Labyrinth takes a serious subject and does it justice with painstaking work on the part of all who worked on it. Don't pass by this superlative motion picture--Pan's Labyrinth is more than worth its weight in gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>"This movie almost destroyed me, almost killed me," the director Guillermo del Toro says in a video introduction to his dark fairy tale "Pan's Labyrinth" (El Laberinto del fauno). "I hope you enjoy it and get lost in it." Viewers have little choice -- the brutality of the Spanish Civil War jackbooters and the Jungian terrors of olde fairy tale monsters conspire to give "Labyrinth" a fierce primal pull.<br /><br />New Line's DVD looks and sounds outstanding, as you'd expect. Audio options include ES and EX (New Line is one of the few remaining DVD makers to pony up for these high-end audio formats.) Del Toro does his usual thoughtful and detailed work in the commentary. The director also anchors a featurette in which he expounds on his theories about monsters, the power in the number 3 and how Hollywood ruined every fairy tale it touched.<br /><br />Another solid extra features Doug Jones -- the skinny actor costumed up to become the Faun and the Pale Man -- as he goes about his rubbery routines. Then there's an interactive look inside del Toro's sketch books for the project, dating back a decade -- fascinating to see how much of this came straight from the Mexican director's imagination.<br /><br />Another classy DVD from New Line, which nonetheless needs to get the lead out and bring the high-definition versions to market.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>This remarkable film about the power of imagination to transcend the arbitrary cruelties and injustices of the "real" world is itself a powerful and wonderous expression of Guillermo Del Toro's considerable imagination and creativity.  Having no preconceptions, I was drawn into this beautiful and dark vision of the intersection of reality with myth much as a child tentatively enters the brooding and foreboding forests of the Brothers Grimm.  I was surprised at the courageousness and honesty of the story's unflinching depiction of the cruel Captain and the frightening places the young heroine goes in her imaginative quest.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film to behold, with a wonderful use of color amid evocative production design with just the right touch of CGI.  A savagely lush tale frought with tension and ultimate tragedy.  I had no idea where it was going and was greatly touched by, to me, an unexpected resolution.  A thoroughly original and brilliant conception, delivered with great care and intelligence.  I first noticed Del Toro with the film Mimic, and thought the guy has some good chops.  I had no idea that the man would be capable of such a strangely beautiful mythic tale, a fairy tale of monsters, human and other worldly, transcended.  A one of a kind film, well worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro has made an unusual adult film about a child's fantasy world in "Pan's Labyrinth", which juxtaposes magic and violence in World War II-era Spain. In 1944, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her mother (Adriadna Gil) from a war-torn city to the mountains to meet her new stepfather. Ofelia is an imaginative girl often engrossed in her fairy tale books. Her mother is expecting a child, and her new husband, the fastidious fascist Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), has insisted that she join him. Ofelia and Vidal take an immediate dislike to one another, but the country fires Ofelia's imagination. She is led to an ancient portal guarded by a faun named Pan (Doug Jones). Pan assumes Ofelia is the Princess Moanna, who left the underworld long ago to live among humans, but who is prophesied to return. Ofelia must complete 3 tasks in order to be readmitted to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Captain Vidal ruthlessly and indiscriminately battles Republican rebels, who find sympathy among the locals.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" alludes to various other works of fantasy, and its symbolism isn't slight. But Ofelia is engaging and her fantasies so vivid that the film never seems to be going over old territory. This may be due to the story's immersion in the real, intensely violent and unjust world of civil conflict in Spain. A child's fantasies take on greater meaning in contrast to and as commentary on the turbulent and dangerous world around her. The fantasy world is not safe or forthright but presents the kind of choices that the adults around her make. Perhaps it's unusual to make a fantasy film exclusively for older viewers, but the real-world violence in "Pan's Labyrinth" is too graphic and sadistic for young children and may unsettle some adults. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful film that engrosses the viewer in the fight to determine Spain's future and a child's conception of a fantastic world in which she too battles for what she holds dear -enabled in no small part by Guillermo Navarro continually gliding camera. In Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (New Line 2007 single disc): There is an unnecessary "Director's Prologue" (24 sec) in which the director introduces the film. Under "Marketing Campaign", there is Poster Art (7), a teaser trailer (1 min), a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min), and 7 short TV spots (4 min). There is a good audio commentary in English by director Guillermo del Toro. He discusses this film as a companion piece to "The Devil's Backbone" (2001), the themes of choice and disobedience, magic and violence, the role of violence in the film, symbolism, staging the real vs fantasy worlds, sources for some of the material, camera work, color palette, and blending reality and fantasy. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>El Laberinto del Fauno (Gullermo del Toro, 2006)<br /><br />The last time I openly wept in a movie theater before last night was during the last half hour of Julian Schabel's awe-inspiring Before Night Falls (2000), a movie I still consider to be the best ever made. Guillermo del Toro has done it to me for the first time in six years (almost to the day) with the final ten minutes of El Laberinto del Fauno.<br /><br />Del Toro is the epitome of the Curse of Hollywood; when he is imported and works under the Hollywood machine, he makes execrable movies like Mimic and Blade II (though I have to admit I did enjoy Hellboy). When left to his native country, however, he makes movies like Cronos and El Espinazo del Diablo. Now he goes back to Espinazo's alternate-reality Spanish Civil War for what looks to be the second in what will inevitably come to be called a trilogy of Spanish Civil War ghost stories (3663, the third, is tentatively slated for release in 2009 as I write this). And once again: if you bring him to Hollywood, he makes Blade II. If you leave him in Mexico, he makes a movie nominated for six Academy Awards. Can you name the last film whose dialogue was entirely in another language to be nominated for six Academy Awards? (Let me give you a hint: the answer is "none." The record, which was held jointly by Fanny and Alexander (1983) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), was four.)<br /><br />El Laberinto del Fauno is the story of Ofelia (Rottweiler's Ivana Baquero), a young girl in Spain at the tail end of the Spanish Civil War. Her mother Carmen (Welcome Home's Ariadna Gil) has been recently wed to the Captain (Some Kind of Blue's Sergi Lopez, doing his best Ralph Fiennes impersonation) of a detachment in a remote area, hunting down an enclave of rebels. Carmen is pregnant and the baby has made her quite ill. Ofelia, who has no liking for the captain, withdraws into the twin defenses of her only friend, Mercedes (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Maribel Verdu) and her own fantasies, in which she is the unknowing princess of an underground kingdom; she can only be restored to her place on the throne by performing three tasks for Pan (Hellboy's Doug Jones), a faun who lives in the buried heart of a labyrinth that's been behind the mill where they live since, Mercedes tells Ofelia, long before the mill itself was built. As the real world gets more and more unimaginably brutal, with the Captain, already a vicious sadist, slowly losing his grip on reality himself, Ofelia retreats farther and farther into the dream-world she's created. The question that serves as the film's constant undercurrent is whether Pan is, truly, the product of Ofelia's fantasies, and by extension which of the two worlds is the real one.<br /><br />There is a great deal to be written about fantastic archetypes here, and how well del Toro conforms to them (and the ways in which he plays with them to suit his own ends); I am certainly not the person to write it, as my days of studying mythology were long ago and, at best, incomplete. Those with a more comprehensive understanding of myth would be better qualified to do so; all I can say is that Ofelia's fantasies (assuming that's what they are) are almost universal; ruling over a kingdom, the quest, the heroic sacrifice, it's all there. (I'm sure someone could put out a dissertation comparing Ofelia to Beowulf, or maybe even Gilgamesh.) I'm more interested in the idea that, perhaps, it's the "real world" that's the fantasy here, and the way the Captain's character plays into that interpretation over time. It's easy to imagine the Captain as "the bad guy" from the very beginning here (and there is also a good deal to be written comparing the Captain and the creature known in the credits as The Pale Man, seen in almost every publicity still for the film), and to be sure he's never exactly a good guy. But he is certainly not the monster at the beginning of the film that he is by its end. While whatever it is that drives his degeneration is never fully revealed to us-- one is tempted to say it is the impending birth of his child, for lack of a more explicit mechanism-- that he degenerates is obvious. The Captain's increasing agitation runs in parallel to the escalation of danger in Ofelia's world, but which one drives the other? There are a lot of layers to be peeled back here to get at the heart of this story-- assuming it has a heart, and is not just an infinite number of layers of interpretation.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the movie is not without its flaws, however minor they may be. None of these flaws is technical, as the movie is gorgeous in every capacity (and of its six Academy Award nominations, three are technical-- Cinematography, Art Direction, and Makeup, all of which it should be a shoo-in to take). Nor are there any flaws in the acting; all of the principals do a fine job with their roles. Ivana Baquero will not be playing minor roles in low-budget Brian Yuzna horror films any more after this, I'd warrant. I'm almost willing to go out on a limb and tentatively blame an editor for this, as del Toro seems, especially in light of meditation on this film, to have wanted to spend equal amounts of time exploring the "real world" and Ofelia's fantasy world; the finished product spends a lot more time in the real world, something for which, given the reviews, trailers, etc., I was entirely unprepared. I'm guessing there's a lot of fantasy-world material that for some reason ended up on the cutting room floor. More's the pity. Couldn't the extraneous mill-mole subplot have been axed instead?<br /><br />Still, the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or (and got a twenty-two minute standing ovation at Cannes on its first screening), seems a no-brainer to net Mexico it's first Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award, sits at #88 on IMDB's Top 250 Films as I write this, and has so much about it to recommend that any flaw in its makeup seems minor in comparison. It is far too early to proclaim El Laberinto del Fauno one of the world's finest movies, but I can say with great authority that, love it or hate it, this is a movie from which you cannot emerge unaffected. That is his job as a filmmaker, and he has performed it better than he has in his estimable career to date. See this movie and be amazed. **** ?<br /><br />(Oh, and since I didn't mention them: the film's other two nominations are for Best Original Score and Best Original Screenplay.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"El Laberinto del Fauno" ("Pan's Labyrinth") is most decidedly not a children's film.  My wife chose it for our viewing pleasure this afternoon thinking it was some sort of special effects spectacular, comparable to "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" or "La cite des enfants perdus" ("The City of Lost Children"), but this film from writer-director Guillermo del Toro ("El Espinazo del Diablo," "Hellboy") is not for children, even if at its heart it is a story about a young girl.  The time is 1944 and the setting is Franco's Spain, where 10-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is traveling with her very pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) into the forest to a camp where her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) is hunting down resistance fighters and passing out Franco's daily bread.  Vidal is an authoritarian sadist more in keeping with our ideas about Nazi thugs than what little we know about Fascist Spain beyond the toxic effects of machismo, so it is little wonder that Ofelia is so willing to embrace the fantasy world that opens up to her.<br /><br />On the road to her new life, Ofelia discovers a strangely carved rock and sees an odd insect that she thinks if a fairy.  This turns out to be the case and leads her to the decaying labyrinth and an ancient faun (Doug Jones), who reveals to the young girl both her past and her possible destiny (the faun never says his name is Pan or is called Pan in the film, but a literal translation of the film's title as "The Labyrinth of the Faun" would clearly have confused too many potential viewers).  Meanwhile, Vidal is continuing his pursuit of the resistance fighters, oblivious to the fact that he has an informer in his camp, setting up a fatal confrontation between the young girl and the man she keeps insisting is not her father.<br /><br />It is astounding to me that del Toro is able to entwine the fantasy and fascist plotlines like this, and the biggest compliment I can pay to his efforts is that each thread is capable of standing on its own.  I never found myself wanting to get back to the other half of the story and I was so engrossed in the film (and not just because I had to read the subtitles) that I completely forgot about the opening shot of the film when we came back around to it at the end.  My one complaint with the film is with regards to the character of Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), because I thought it was way too obvious what she was really doing and because she was a couple of minutes late coming up with the idea of using a knife to cut somebody's throat.  But there actually was an explanation as to why she would get away with it ("Pride" would be something of an understatement), and del Toro comes up with a totally fitting final punishment for the villain just as the heroine finds her own grace note.<br /><br />It is because of the graphic violence associated with Vidal's killing and torturing of resistance fighters that movie theaters in Mexico were putting up signs warning parents who were taking their small children to watch what they assumed was a fantasy film.  My wife says it is the worse stuff she has ever seen, but she has not seen the end of "Odishon" ("Audition"), and I can understand how people would show up to see this film without ever notice it was rated R, but now that I have seen it I can only repeat the warning that "El Laberinto del Fauno" is not for the kidlets.  This 2006 film is up for a half-dozen Oscars for Art Direction (Eugenio Caballero and Pilar Revuelta), Cinematography (Guillermo Navarro), Makeup (David Marti and Montse Ribe), Original Score (Javier Navarrete), and Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Guillermo del Toro), which is why it has to be the favorite to win Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.  I am surprised it actually came to the Zenith City, but even without seeing the competition I have to believe that all of those Academy Award nominations make this another category where the winner is a foregone conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>IN 1944 Spain during the Spanish civil war, a young girl named Ofelia has always been a daydreamer and obsessed with fairy tales for has to live in the countryside with her pregnant mother at a farmhouse.

Not since "The Wizard of Oz" or "Lord of the Ring" has there ever been an imaginative fairy tale that captures the audiences imagination. Guillermo Del Toro (Director of "Hellboy", "Devil's Backbone", "Cronos" and "Blade 2") brings a thrilling, powerful and sometimes macabre story that blends the horrors of war with the fantasy innocence of youth.

But, dagnabit, it left me wanting more.  Ofelia, the girl in this story, journeys only to the border of this "other land".  I thought that this movie would delve deeper into this strange land and its inhabitants.<br /><br />Ofelia and her widowed pregnant mother move to an abandoned mill to be with the new stepfather/husband.  The stepfather is a military captain who is fighting against guerilla army that seems to be invisible.  However, the captain is a cruel man.  He is just harsh to everyone.<br /><br />Upon arrival at the mill, Ofelia discovers a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her to a world underground.  From there, she meets an ancient faun.  The faun tells her that she of a royal lineage.  But, before she can return to the royal lineage, she must do 3 tasks that comes with explicit instructions.<br /><br />I just love the everything about this movie.  However, it just left me wishing for more of this other world.  It was such a big tease to get a "taste" of this world.  My favorite was this episode where Ofelia was given a magic chalk to retrieve an object.  In this room was a creature who use its hand to see.  You just got to see the movie to see what I'm talking about.  I thought that was such an original idea.<br /><br />I love how this fairy tale wasn't always so gleefully bright.  I love how suspense were used.  I loved how it left you uncertain if the faun was "good guy" or a "bad guy" with its own agenda.  *Pan's Labyrinth* was a refreshing break from these predictable films.<br /><br />I certainly hope that del Toro will direct something like thing very soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>A friend of mine recommended this film to me and I'm so glad he did.  What an amazing film!<br /><br />The director Quillermo del Toro deserves all the acolades he is receiving for this beautiful piece of work.  Set in the early fourties during the facists and bloody Franco regime, the story follows a young girl named Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother, arrives to live with her cold and sadistic step father, an army captain.  As an escape from the harsh surroundings and her mother's ill health, Ofelia begins to slip into her imagination (or is it?) to visit the labrinth of a Satyr who promises to return a kingdom in which she is a princess.  Once she has completed three tasks assigned by the satyr (and with the aid of his pets--faeries) she is told she will be returned to her royal family.<br /><br />Along side the story of Ofelia, we see the rebels fighting the facists and the troubles they face against a heartless and violent government. Though it is considered a fairy tale (for adults) this is not a Disney produced "happily-ever-after".  Then again, life is very rarely happily-ever-after.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, with great effects and solid acting, "Pan's Labrinth" is a gem in a year that was pretty lack luster in the good film department.  I recommend this film and look forward to its release on dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is just an amazing film to look at. It's hard to believe it was made for around 20 million dollars. All the fantastic sets and CGI are top notch, as are all the actors. The Captain in this film is the meanest dude put on film in years. He is in my opinion the scariest monster in the movie (sorry Pale Man). This film is very dark, gruesome, and even hard to watch at times, but if you are in the mood for a fairy tale told like the old Grimm stories your in for a treat.<br /><br />This is truly one of the best films I have seen in some time. Oh, by the way, this film is in spanish and you will have to read. Some people in my theater didn't know this and complained for the first five minutes of the movie. This film could have been in english because all the actors speak it very good (I watched the HBO special). I sometimes felt I was missing the visuals because my eyes were focused on all the written dialogue. Anyways, I was lucky my theater got this movie so soon. Keep an eye out for it in your neck of the woods.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>In the opening scene of the film (that is, after the initial explanation of the fairy tale we are about to be involved in) we see Ofelia with her mother, heading toward the camp of her mother's new husband, the Captain. Ofelia is carrying some books close to her chest, bundled in twine. Her mother inquires as to what they are, and upon seeing that the books are fairy tales, admonishes Ofelia, telling her that she is too old for such fancies.<br /><br />My immediate reaction was: nobody is too old for fairy tales. That this is true is inescapable. The writers of fairy tales are largely adults.<br /><br />Ofelia's life at the Captain's camp is a terrible one. The Captain cares nothing for anyone but himself, and has passion only for defending Spain against rebel forces (Star Wars anyone? - j/k). Only one thing separates him from being the embodiment of evil: his love for the son (so he believes with certainty) his wife is carrying. One could question the validity of that love, and say it is more pride than anything, but I'll leave that alone.<br /><br />He certainly does not love his new wife, nor his step-daughter. Upon Carmen's arrival (Ofelia's mother), she is put in a wheelchair and confined to bed, in a room the Captain enters only if there is an emergency.<br /><br />Without a mother (for the pregnancy is a difficult one), without a father, and without any friends, Ofelia begins to have adventures. She is told by a mysterious (and quite evil looking) faun that she is a princess, heir to a great kingdom where sickness and death will never visit her. For a girl so alone, and so in love with or enamored by fairies, she is easily led into the faun's "game". He has assignments for her, things she must complete before the next full moon, when the portal will be open and she will return to the kingdom forever.<br /><br />For her second assignment, she visits what is surely one of the most horrid creatures - a killer, and eater, of children. The creature itself is stunningly original and terrifying.<br /><br />The faun offers Ofelia a mandrake root for her assistance (she is rooting out evil, in a sense), and the mandrake root is to be placed in a bowl of milk under her mother's bed, fed with two drops of blood a day. Ofelia receives the mandrake, follows the instructions, and her mother immediately improves. It is revealing (I won't say why) that when the mandrake is thrown into the fire he/it screams. If you haven't seen it, think on that scene when you do. If you already have - reconsider it, and its placement. I believe that scene alone holds the most important truth in the film.<br /><br />It's difficult, to say the least, to tell a "two-pronged" story, one set firmly in realism, the other in a questionable fantasy. These could not be more different. But Guillermo del Toro manages it with seamless finesse. I never felt manipulated or jolted moving from one realm to the other. That is testimony to a great film - and a great filmmaker.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>Despite not exactly being what a friend of mine and me had hoped on our girl's night out, we still enjoyed this screenplay. It has powerful messages about courage and ethics.<br /><br />Ofelia (Ivana Baquero)'s world is really glum in 1944 Spain. Her pregnant mother is sickly and she doesn't really get along with her new stepfather either. Naturally then, when she discovers an alternate world, she finds solace in escaping to it--despite it also being filled with danger.<br /><br />She retreats even further when this family mocks her for believing in fairy tales. Anybody who's ever lived in a dysfunctional family of any kind can strongly identify with this theme of the film despite the subtitling--being the family outsider (i.e. black sheep) is not a fun position for a person to be in.<br /><br />Ofelia intentionally is supposed to be the character audiences identify with throughout the story, she is an outcast but is constantly on a mission to do the right thing for herself and others.  She attempts to help her mother through a diffcult pregnancy and then rescues her brother.<br /><br />This screenplay is one of the most realistic I have ever seen--not because of the violence (which admittedly there is lots) but because she is a multi-dimensional character.<br /><br />She is young and innocent, but also disobeys both her family and the magical creatures in her alternate universe. She deliberately samples fruit off of a table despite previously having been told not to eat anything and then has the nerve to beg (whine?) that she deserves another chance to receive her gift.<br /><br />People expecting the prototypical happy ending which is usually featured in fare featuring children as a lead need to be advised that like the rest of this screen play, this one is interesting but dark and quirky.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Pan's Labyrinth is the most beautiful and exquisite film I have seen in the last few years. Guillermo Del Toro has crafted a masterpiece of cinema that slowly bends reality into fantasy. The film is about a young girl named Ofelia who is living in post-war Spain. Her father has died and now she and her pregnant mother are traveling into the country to live with the prestigious Captain Vidal, whom her mother has now remarried with. Captain Vidal is introduced in an early scene as a barbaric murderer who is only interested in Ofelia's mother to bear his child so that his son can grow up with his name. Ofelia escapes into a world of fantasy and horror that is equally as disturbing as the real life events going on around her with the war. There are two parallel storylines in the film. The one that deals with Ofelia in the world of the labyrinth and the storyline with Vidal dealing with revolutionaries who live in the mountains.<br /><br />The brilliant part of the film is that Del Toro juxtaposes Ofelia's world with the real world. For example, in one part of the film Ofelia must encounter a creature who has eyes in his hands, and even though he sits in front of long table of food he still craves innocent children and innocent creatures. Directly before this scene we see Captain Vidal hosting a giant dinner party where he sits at the head of the table. It's symbolism at its finest. Credit also has to go the superb art direction, make up and visual effects that transport the audience into Ofelia's world. The make up on the faun that instructs Ofelia to complete the tasks is unbelievable. The film takes us deep into the darkest part of the human realm and sends us on an unforgettable journey. Javier Naverette's beautiful score plays a huge role in creating the world of Pan's Labyrinth. I honestly believe it would be a crime if he does not win at the Oscars. He is the only composer nominated worthy of the statue.<br /><br />ACTING: Ivana Baquero is absolutely stunning in this film as Ofelia. She plays the character beautifully and makes the audience care for her every step of the way. The supporting cast is just as good. Sergi Lopez makes a very convincing and evil Captain Vidal. I think Vidal should be considered as one of the better screen villains in last decade. Credit also should be given to Doug Jones who plays the faun also known as Pan. Jones is one of the better known costume actors in Hollywood and previously worked with Del Toro on Hellboy. He even learned a little Spanish for the role.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film medium was created specifically for films like this. Pan's Labyrinth is a rare masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Nothing about the film is unoriginal, it stands on its own as one of the most original pieces of filmmaking in recent memory. I know the film isn't playing at every theater, but every effort should be made to go out of your way to see it. A film that will stay with you long after you see it, it truly must be experienced.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>It's amazing have blue edition.

The horrors of war are, in fact, horrible.<br /><br />This is not a fairy tale with a happy ending.  The heroes don't live happily ever after.<br /><br />But a child's imagination always exists, even under the cruelest of circumstances.<br /><br />A brutal officer brings his pregnant wife and his stepdaughter to his garrison for the birth of their son.  In Spain, a civil war is raging in the aftermath of WWII.  The daughter discovers a fairy, and is lead to a faun, who tells here that her real father is a fairyland king, and that she is a princess.  She only need to complete three tasks to rediscover her heritage.  These actions are set among the battles between the soldiers and the rebels, and the poor men and women caught in between.  Will completion of these tasks deliver the stepdaughter from these horrors of war?<br /><br />How will you feel after viewing this haunting movie?  Three unique viewpoints:<br /><br />- "I am saddened about the realities of war, but hopeful and intrigued about the escape through fantasy."<br /><br />- "I got a little teary eyed toward the end, which was hard.  The musical score was really in sync with the mood of the film.<br /><br />- "War is bad.  War is BAD."<br /><br />The dialogue is in Spanish.  We viewed it with English subtitles.  The computer-generated animations are agonizingly realistic.<br /><br />Don't confuse this movie with those fantasies like Stardust (which is a great movie) that have you feeling uplifted by the finale.  This is a boo-hoo movie.  Haunting.  I'm listening to songs by Enya as I write this.  Very appropriate.

And if you think it carefully, it just could not be other way: Mexico, the land which was witness of years of legends and ancestral myths, of first rate poets and outstanding thinkers, the same nation from whose entrails emerged Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz; who gave shelter to several exiled personalities Trotsky, Eisentein and Bu&ntilde;uel).<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is the embodiment of a long expected project that nestled under the mythical imagination of countless generations; an epic fable against the intolerance; a powerful warning about what's right and what's wrong.<br /><br />Like the primordial seeds of the mythical essence, a generation must die and that baby will represent, the seed of hope and the final outcome of so many shred blood, but enrooted and narrated with such conviction and expressive force that literally will capture our senses and unconsciousness with all the possible vigor.<br /><br />A real triumph of what cinema can do; and an additional evidence about Jean Epstein's statement: the core of all movie has a basic psychic nature.<br /><br />Don' t let this movie pass in front of you; leave your rational world and drive yourself in this hallucinating and superb visual spectacle.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This movie is visually stunning, and i found the story to be unique and more than a little bit disturbing.  Be forewarned, it is shockingly violent.  I liked to way the screenplay occilates between fantasy and reality, it gives the movie a real edge.  The movie sort of reminded me of the Tom Cruise film, Legend, though this film is much better.  This film has gotten fantastic reviews, which in some ways is well deserved, but i was not blown away, I just thought, wow, what an origial idea and i appreciated the execution.  I do recommend it, but do prepare yourself for some graphic violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is quite different from what the trailer makes it out to be. Most of the film is occupied by a war theme while the fantasy remains somewhat back-story. It is also incredibly more violent than one might have expected.<br /><br />The story revolves around a young girl who is living on a farm with her mother and stepfather in law from hell who commands a squadron that is under siege by a small band of rebel militia. The girl, torn between the domineering male parent and the war, discovers a world where a fawn asks her to complete a set of tasks so that she can inherit a magical kingdom.<br /><br />While the film probably contains the most memorable bad guy of all time, it still comes across as deficient in its promise of beyond the imagination worlds. However they are done above par. Viewers can expect a war drama more than anything else. The film's underlying morals about questioning authority are worth learning; however they do conflict somewhat with its Christian underpinnings. Pan's Labyrinth is essentially C.S Lewis but is rendered in buckets of blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>This movie visually, is astounding.

I love the dark quality of the film though, it dares to go down the most evil and dreaded path and it succeeds in that at least. But when it was over and done, I just sort of shrugged and thought, OK. That was nice. Is it worth a viewing. Yes, certainly. Visually its stunning and engrossing to a point. But I'm not sure I could muster up a 2nd viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>For an intense experience that is beyond easy categorization, there are few films that equal the extraordinary experience that is "Pan's Labyrinth."<br /><br />Set in post-civil war Spain, in 1944, the film focuses on a small outpost of Franco's army stalking remnants of rebel groups operating in the hills. The leader of the government force is Captain Vidal, and the film begins with the arrival in camp of his pregnant wife. His wife is accompanied by Ofelia, her daughter by another man, now deceased, by what manner is not told. The girl is a bookworm and fond of fairy stories. After finding an odd stone in the road, she activates a magical process that awakens the interest of a curious, clicking insect, which she regards as a fairy and follows her to camp. The camp itself is a cauldron of intrigue, with suspicious soldiers rounding up and intimidating peasants and locals seemingly in cahoots with the rebels. Ofelia's mother is soon sidelined with complications of the pregnancy, and Ofelia becomes more and more entangled  in a mysterious and fantastic underground world. She meets a faun, a sort of goat-horned semi-deity, who takes Ofelia for the daughter of a king. The faun gives Ofelia a book and a series of tasks that she must perform to demonstrate her royal credentials.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth is frightening and violent -- on both sides of the magical divide. The major question running through the film is the relation of the realms to one another. Is the fairy realm real? Or is it a figment of Ofelia's fragile imagination? It's not giving much away to suggest that this question will not bee resolved by the end of the film. Arguing against the idea that Ofelia seeks refuge in fairyland is that the creatures she meets there are as ugly, murderous and demanding as the ones in her real life. If anything, the creatures offer nightmarish parallels to the characters above ground. What differentiates the two realms is that ultimately, the fairy world, though subject to harsh and uncompromising laws, is ultimately benign and intends only good on those who abide by its rules. The world above is harsh too, but wishes only to dominate and terrorize its subjects, not to rule them justly.<br /><br />The film is a luscious feast of images from beginning to end. The Captain, a malevolent and dictatorial man, is seen gently oiling a watch that may have been his father's. The faun, wise and kind in the moonlight, gently brushes Ofelia's face with his long, twiglike fingers. An underground ogre, with eyes in the palms of his hands, holds his eyes up to his face, fingers spread into a frightening fringe. The films' effects are mostly well-handled, with fairies flitting noisily about and graphic violence and torture convincingly portrayed.<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth does not offer up an easy solution for the problems it poses. It offers up a complex and many-layered ending that is hard to comprehend as a clear-cut victory for any side. If anything, it parallels the world wee all live in, in which victory is a distant goal, even an illusion, that empowers and propels action, and in which the events of any single day cannot always be seen as trending to our good or our ill. Pan's Labyrinth is about one girl's determined desire to respond with openness to her world, with all of its ugliness and beauty, come what may.<br /><br />Despite its fairytale subject matter, the movie is not for kids. It well ddesserves its R rating for graphic violence, including an amputation, executions and field surgery.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Bravo!! A well done movie! This is an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it.... Although, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. It is for ADULTS ONLY due to the content of the film.<br /><br />You can read the description of this movie's storyline above, so won't rehash it here. I will however share my impressions of the movie below: The cinematography is brilliant & so was the computer graphics in this movie. I also enjoyed the acting and storyline of this movie as well. It was all so captivating. I found myself wanting to know how the story was going to unfold/end. No Hollywood ending here. This movie is anything but predictable, which is quite refreshing!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a combination of fantasy, drama, and tragedy.  Young Ofelia is a daughter of a widow, Carmen, who has remarried to a brutal Franco supporter in WWII Spain, Captain Vidal.  Daughter and mother go to live in the countryside headquarters of the captain, who with his soldiers, is fighting local rebels.  Unknown to them, the local villagers working at the soldier's camp contains a doctor and a servant loyal to the rebels.  Ofelia is unwittingly placed into this cat-and-mouse game of ruthless personal violence.  She escapes into a fantasy world, a stone labyrinth situated behind the soldier's camp with origins unknown to all.  There, Ofelia meets Pan, a faun, who tells her that she is a princess disguised in human form.  Pan sets her to three duties in order for her to re-enter the world below as the princess of old.<br /><br />Produced with a Spanish cast and spoken entirely in Spanish, this movie explores many themes unknown to many American viewers.  First of, the movie is set in Spain during the reign of the fascists, an event in history unknown to pop culture since the book "For Whom the Bells Toll".  The resulting interpersonal violence and cruelty is frankly portrayed without any cutaway shots, hence giving the movie a deserved R rating.  Second, the dangers of pregnancy childbirth is also explored, as Carmen dies in the middle of the movie.  As a corollary, we see how Vidal values his unborn child over that of his wife; a trait barely mentioned but still common in some places.  Third, the contrast between Ofelia and Vidal is probably the heart of the movie.  The girl is young and innocent, unable to spare a drop of blood of an innocent to save her own life.  Vidal is all to willing to kill and maim others, and risk his own life in order to attain whatever end he chooses.  Every other character in the movie lies in the spectrum between them.  The servant Mercedes, the village doctor, and the rebels lie closer to Ofelia.  Carmen lies in the middle between Ofelia and Vidal, and the other soldiers are noticeably less reluctant in their cruelty than Vidal.<br /><br />The parallel story of Pan is quite good, original by Western standards.  This fairy tale side of the movie rings true to fairy tales from old; horrific and full of dangerous creatures, with tasks to accomplish and a context of a different world.  The final scene of Ofelia rejoining her true parents is probably the most beautiful in the movie.<br /><br />As a movie, it did OK at the US box office but quite well at various awards ceremonies.  The former was due in part to the Spanish language, and more importantly, the amount of graphic violence.  A reduction in the graphicness of the violence would have brought this movie a PG-13 rating, and probably much larger audiences.  On technical terms, the music was slow, haunting but not great.  The special effects were quite believable.  Overall, a good movie to watch, though adults only.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>It is not very often that one gets to see a filmmaker blossom into greatness.  Scorsese has his "Taxi Driver," Spielberg has his "Jaws" and "Close Encounters of Third Kind," Coppala has "The Godfather" and Nolan has "Memento."  Now director Guillermo Del Toro, who before was one of the most promising talents in the world, has his "Pan's Labyrinth," an achingly and grimly beautiful film.  This is one of those stories where every detail, from the slightest glance, facial twitch and camera move, feels right.  Nothing is forced and setting, character and themes are fully, richly realized.  Set amid the communist insurgency that irritated Franco's fascist government in the aftermath of his victory in the Spanish Civil War, "Pan's" opens in 1944 with young Ofelia (a luminous Ivana Baquero) and her sickened mother (Ariadna Gil, whose eyes haunt with ease) traveling to a Fascist outpost in the Spanish woods, where the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, quietly and unforgettably menacing) labors to expunge the last of the rebels from the countryside.  Ofelia's mother is very weak from carrying the Captain's baby boy, a burden she takes on to give her daughter and her unborn son the protection that the Captain can offer, although she is not blind to the Captain's special brand of vicious and inhuman violence against opposing communist guerillas.<br /><br />To escape from her new and frightful place alongside the Captain and her emaciated mother, Ofelia retreats into her fairy tales, places of innocence and peace.  But one night, a fairy visits her in her room, leading her to a labyrinth in the woods where an old Faun (Doug Jones) resides and waits.  Jones is a revelation, breathing enormous life into his costumed characters, especially his brief but terrifying turn as the Pale Man, a child-devouring monster who pursues Ofelia in the film's most harrowing scene.  The Faun announces to Ofelia that she is a long lost princess of the underground realm, a place that revels in the magic and power of an earlier age when nature and the spirit were one.  But, to prove that Ofelia still possesses the immortal princess' essence, the Faun lays out three tasks for her that, if completed, will earn her a place beside her ancient father in the underworld.  But the tasks are dangerous and, as they escalate, so does the battle between Vidal and the guerillas and the deterioration of Ofelia's mother.  Fantasy, once Ofelia's refuge, is now as uncertain as the world that surrounds her.<br /><br />At first glance, a film that combines earthy fairy tales a la the Brothers Grimm and period war piece might seem jarring, but Del Toro makes the combination feel effortless.  The two parallel each other perfectly, complementing each other on themes such as Fascist thought and the universal struggle between good and evil.  The rest is just gravy, absolutely, jaw-droppingly gorgeous gravy.  Guillermo Navarro's vivid and fluid cinematography methodically hovers and swirls around searing battle scenes and otherworldly locales with smooth confidence; also, the production design exudes a worn, lived in feel.  But the greatest triumph of the film (other than the stellar writing, acting and directing) is the downright stunning creature designs.  The Faun and the Pale Man are unlike anything that has been seen before, completely original and organic figures seemingly plucked from the realm of dreams and nightmares.  One step on his spindly legs and one flick of his wrist and the Faun has become helplessly endearing.  One frightening upward move of his palms, and the Pale Man becomes one of the most nightmarish figures in cinema history.<br /><br />Put simply, "Pan's Labyrinth" is a masterpiece.  Del Toro has done something that very few filmmakers before him have done, and it demands to be seen and cherished as an example of the best cinema has to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A24KZBAAUTC83R.html">A24KZBAAUTC83R</a><br/><p>Guillermo Deltoro can be a hit and/or miss director.<br /><br />We liked his Blade 2 movie, but found his Hellboy somewhat lacking in certain areas. Good production and special effects, but overall storyline was lacking. I guess you have to be a fan of the comic. We're not.<br /><br />But Pan's Labyrinth is a true classic original in all ways. Not for the tender-hearted children under the age of 13. Both beautiful, surreal and imaginative, as well as horrific and edgy in its stylistic approach, Deltoro's Pan's Labyrinth is a truly one-of-a-kind movie experience.<br /><br />His best movie is yet to be made. Look for his rendition of Tarzan of the Apes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth<br /><br />By Guillermo Del Toro<br /><br />Pan's Labyrinth, or El Labyrinth del Fauno, is so calm in the beginning that it draws you into thinking that perhaps you have awoken to some chimera, some angelic mistep into a dream. But only in reality is there the aweful possiblity that even this child can be slaughtered. The misery unfolds as the blood creeping from a little girls nose, that it's artistic, and you think how beautiful it is, serves as a dose of reality, cold reality.<br /><br />There is aweful violence in Pan's Labyrinth, and you should be aware of that. Seeing that beautiful girls face is not a sign of things to come, it serves as a counter to deaths disgusting face. And never before have I seen death walk hand in hand with fantasy. We have had bed time stories told to us when we were little. Little red riding hood was close to being killed, but she got away. There was always some danger to those tales. And other tales, such as the ginger bread man, hint at something more brutal, lying on that border of childhood and adulthood.<br /><br />This film follows the Gestalt principle that the sum of its parts is greater than its whole. You analyze the acting down to the maids, and it is all working. Ivanka Baquero is a child that expresses sorrow and a yearning for life. She feels the weight of a world at war, yet the child nature in her blooms before us as she follows her instincts to solve questions that may be of her own sanity.<br /><br />This movie draws you into it, and you want to discover the details, and you pray that they don't let you down. And Guillermo Del Toro does not. The phases of the moon, can play behind the gripping story, yet it has its own part of the story to tell as well. It is incredible to me, that after owning this movie for so long, that the beauty of the film and wonder has not been lost to me. Pan's Labyrinth is as cherished as those old stories my parents use to read to me before sleep.<br /><br />Del Toro, trust me, you'll hear more about him in the future, also gave some shockingly brutal kills that were down right frightening to watch. I felt mystefied. I was confused by the styles of the film. They were deliberately fairy tale like, yet, meshed with gritty war and horrendous violence. It's subtitles pulled you away from creatures that were dreamlike so unrealy fascinating that I must have had the captured look of an astonished child while in my seat. Nothing compares to this film that comes to mind. It's original and compelling: I'm so glad to be saying so about a film. It's been a depressing year for me. I'm nearly numb to the effects of cliche movie making.</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>The first of two times I saw writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's Oscar-winning PAN'S LABYRINTH on DVD, it disappointed me because it wasn't at all what the critics led me to expect.  With its echoes of THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, I thought the whole movie would take place in a dark and scary fantasy world with a young girl.  Actually, only half of the movie is dark fantasy.  The other half is real world Spain in 1944 with a sick mother named Carmen (Ariadne Gil) and a brutal Army Captain named Vidal (Sergi Lopez).  With the fabulous young Ivana Baquero as 12 year old heroine Ofelia, this film comes alive on a mandatory second viewing as a dark fantasy masterpiece, especially with immeasurable help from Del Toro's audio commentary on the Spanish Civil War and his film intentions.<br /><br />We have two worlds in PAN'S LABYRINTH:  the real world of Vidal and Carmen and a housekeeper named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) in a house.  And a scary fantasy world ruled over by the sympathetic Faun (Doug Jones and elaborate visual effects).  Linking the two worlds are Ofelia, a deep green forest with mossy trees, and an old mill with a whole fantasy universe beneath it.  But only Ofelia can see the fantasy world.  So the movie exists on parallel tracks with careful use of color in both worlds (blues-greens and oranges-browns--the movie won Oscars for Cinematography and Production Design and Makeup).  Faun promises to help Carmen get well if Ofelia will do three tasks (the concept of threes throughout is definitely deliberate).  The Brothers Grimm and Del Toro's own 2001 movie THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (which Leonard Maltin loved) are also sources as we start to wonder whether the fantasy world really exists, or is all a product of Ofelia's vivid imagination.<br /><br />Rent or buy the double disk of PAN'S LABYRINTH.  Besides a widescreen transfer and very insightful commentary on disk one with the movie, disk two has a Charlie Rose Show interview with Del Toro and two other great Mexican filmmakers, "The Power of Myth" featurette, prosthetic and visual effects, and the careful use of color and the concept of three objects/people throughout.  Disk two also has a Director's Notebook and storyboards and animated comic book plates for the fantasy characters.<br /><br />The film's ending is controversial; I find it quite haunting.  What if Ofelia herself does not exist or was swallowed up by fantasy creatures--a giant toad, fairies, a man with no face, the grotesque but sympathetic Faun--and can only be seen by people with vivid imaginations?  Del Toro also cites LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD as a filmic source and constantly mentions his own THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, which I guess I have to rent.  But give PAN'S LABYRINTH two viewings before you throw the DVD box across the room in frustration.  This is a filmmaker to study in depth.  And his newest film is a fascinating and wondrous--and sometimes very brutal--adult fairy tale fantasy that was also an Oscar nominee for Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />PAN'S LABYRINTH has been rated "R" for graphic violence and strong language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TPW86OHXTXFC.html">A1TPW86OHXTXFC</a><br/><p>"The Mexican-born writer-director Guillermo del Toro is the most accomplished fantasist in contemporary cinema, a master creator of images, atmosphere and mood who uses his visionary's gifts to do what others cannot: make imaginary worlds seem more real than reality itself."

Ofelia  is her mother's best friend, and loves her very much.  Her mother has married a man who isn't just wicked, he is the personification of evil. He is  a Captain in Franco's army after the right-wing has seized Spain, The best fantasy takes place in a world between good and evil, desire and sacrifice, cruelty and mercy, freedom and slavery. This fantasy resembles the real world, and is an adult fantasy film. When Ofelia finds a  kingdom in the labyrinth  near her new home, it's a  place full of unreal creatures and a smiling-scary satyr , protrayed disarmingly by Doug Jones.  Ofelia's stepfather is dedicated to wiping out the republican holdouts and local partisans by any means necessary. The satyr explains to Ophelia that she is a lost princess, and she can return to where she belongs if she carries out the three tasks he gives her, without fail and without question.<br /><br />Ariadna Gil is Ofelia's pregnant mother  and Maribel Verd&uacute; , Mercedes is a woman on the side of the resistance, and are the two women in the film who bring love to life and who portray the loving side of life.<br /><br />The  fantasy sequences mix practical effects and computer animation have a terrible, beautiful quality to them. The scenes in the real world contrast the peace and beauty of nature with the brutality of war. Pan's Labyrinth is  bloody and disturbing, but adult fantasy fans will find it a glorious, gripping feast for the eyes.<br /><br />"Del Toro never coddles the audience. He means for us to leave Pan's Labyrinth shaken to our souls. He succeeds triumphantly. " Peter Travers<br /><br />This is a tale within a tale, a creation in which the actual and the symbolic are so intertwined that we are happy to rid ourselves of logic.  The movie's lingering seven-note musical theme by Javier Navarrete's is so haunting when hummed and that tune will not leave my mind.  The movie is a masterpiece, and I had to sit and ponder for awhile before I was brought back to reality. Well worth the Oscars and prizes it has won,  The addition of the second disc is enteratianing and informative. The use of fairy tale mythology in the film is well worth the view.<br /><br />Beautifully, marvelously,highly recommended for adults.  prisrob 5-17-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000274TLW">The Devil's Backbone (Special Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>for some time, i have been looking for the next fantasy film that will move me and astonish me like the LOTR's trilogy did. sure, Narnia and HP are good films to but they still didn't hit that cord with me. then, that all changed with Pan's Labyrinth. in this film, we are transported into the mountains of Spain were young Ofelia and her pregnant mother are sent to live with the cold and mercelous Cpatain Vidal in the midst of WW2. it is here that Ofelia stumbles upon a wonderous Labyrinth presided over a strange faun. belived to be the long lost princess of the faun's Underworld, she is set with three tasks that she must complete before the full moon to take her place as queen. what follows is a mind bending and wonderous adventure into the mind. what Del Torro does is he takes us back to the original roots of fairy tales were things never always got there happily ever after and that fantasy can be used to buffer the harsh reality our heroine faces. first of, i have to say the effects are simply astounding and the acting at its finest with Sergi Lopez giving a chilling performance as the mercilous captian. now don't be fooled kiddies, this ain't some PG rated fantasy film, there are some pretty violent scenes in this film but luckily at least they aren't so in your face and frequent. it still baffels me how this film lost the Forigen Picture award but then again i ain't a member of the academy. so if you all are pretty tired of all the regular fantasy's out there and just want to enjoy a back to basics fairy tale then Pan's Labyrinth is the one for you. it will fry your imagination and leave you in its grasps long after it ends.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth in many ways is like the answer to the Chronicles of Narnia or Bridge to Terabithia. If you weren't fond of the kiddyness of those movies, a more adult fairy tale came your way in 2006 done by Guillermo Del Toro, director of Hellboy and Blade II. The problem with the latter 2 films was that they were alright films for what they were but they never really transcended the genre it was in. Hellboy was a well-made comic book film but it didn't reach the status that X-Men 2 or the 1978 Superman film got to that makes it a great film period, whether it was comic book or not. Pan's Labyrinth however is not only a worthy addition to the fantasy genre but it's one of the better films found within it.<br /><br />Set in Spain 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen is travelling the countryside to be with Captain Vidal, Carmen's new husband in the Spanish army. Vidal is certainly not the most sympathetic to say the least so Ofelia's fascination with stories and fairy tales useful. However she realizes in the woods outside the house lies an ancient cave and a magical faun who tells her she's Princess Moanna, princess of the underworld. But in order to prove her worth, she has to complete 3 tasks which are particularly dangerous and finds herself trapped between the violent real world and a magical fantasy world that may or may not exist.<br /><br />I should get something out of the way since people might have a misconception about the film. When I say this is a fairytale for the more adult set, I mean it. There's some violent, bloody acts (you should see what Vidal does with a beer bottle) and one particular unnerving scene involving a creature known as the Pale Man is evidence this is not for the youngsters. But in a way it's nice to have an film like this where the more harsh realities of life can co-exist with the more fantastic elements that are possibly out there. If there's one thing that can potentially turn people off is that the more fantasy elements are not that numerous with many scenes devoted to Vidal and his battle with fighters in the mountains. But it's also a healthy balance with one side not overpowering the other side and making it too cheesy or too serious.<br /><br />No fairytale would be complete without a main character to lead us through their journey and I can't imagine anyone better than Ivana Baquero who is very believable as Ofelia and is quite a performance beyond her age. And Sergi Lopez plays probably the nastiest, brutal character to come around in awhile. He's downright vicious and he's one character you wouldn't want to cross. There's also some good performances from Maribel Verdu and Ariadna Gil as Mercedes, the house's caretaker and Carmen respectively. Also special attention should be made for Doug Jones playing the faun Pan as well as the Pale Man (that eyes-in-palms dude in the the trailers) who always manages to pull off convincing performances under heavy makeup.<br /><br />The special features on Del Toro movies tend to be quite plentiful and this is no different. Disc 1 houses a director's prologue (essentially one of those "I hope you enjoy this movie" things lasting 30 seconds or so) as well as an excellent audio commentary Del Toro does solo. Disc 2 has the bulk of it with looks into the set designs and the looks of things to the music as well as a good Charlie Rose interview which features Del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron (director of the excellent Children of Men) and Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu (director of the average-except-for-the-Japanese-storyline Babel).<br /><br />Released the same day as this was the Fountain, which was one of those fantasy films that tried to hit you in different places yet came across feeling calculated and cold. Pan's Labyrinth on the other hand felt like a labor of love and for once, a passion that actually makes a good film in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>In the civil war Spain of the 1940's, Ofelia (Baquero) has lost her father, a casualty of the war.  Her mother (Gil) has been forced to marry Captain Vidal (Lopez), an evil man who fights the rebels around his home with a singleminded viciousness.  Her mom is pregnant, and the pregnancy is killing her.  On the grounds of Vidal's estate is a labyrinth, and upon entering it, Ofelia meets many creatures including fairies and fauns.  She learns that she is the long-lost princess and daughter of the King of the Underworld.  To show herself worthy of this title, the faun Pan (Jones) lays out three tasks for her to perform.  Completion before the next full moon will mean she can enter the kingdom and escape the war torn world around her.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" is a movie like no other.  Director Guillermo del Toro has crafted a modern fairy tale.  The two stories entertwine perfectly and complement each other.  The special effects are hi quality, and the direction is excellent.  Young Adriana Gil is excellent as poor Ofelia, a girl fleeing the horrors of the world around her.  "Pan's Labyrinth" is an excellent movie that is just different enough to make it fresh.  I highly recommend this adult fairy tale.

But for all its fantasy and fairy tale elements, it might just as well be set in Neverland, where all stories begin with "Once upon a time..."<br /><br />&iexcl;Vamanos! Our story begins as 11-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to meet her new husband, El Capit&aacute;n Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). El Capit&aacute;n is stationed in a lonely outpost in the wild country, quelling a rebellion. Carmen is with his child, and is in no condition for such an arduous journey. Nevertheless, he insists that his son should be born where his father is. Ofelia is skeptical of her new step father. Her real father was a tailor.<br /><br />-------------<br />Carmen: The captain has been so good to us... Please, Ofelia, call him father. It's just a word, Ofelia, just a word.<br />========<br /><br />Vidal is a heartless fascist, and Ofelia senses that immediately. She seeks to escape the harsh regime of El Capit&aacute;n through stories and fantasies. The lines of demarcation between what seems real and what seems fantastic start to blur. She discovers an ancient stone labyrinth, and her journey has begun.<br /><br />-------------<br />Ofelia: My name is Ofelia. Who are you?<br />Pan: Me? I've had so many names. Old names that only the wind and the trees can pronounce. I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. I am... I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness.<br />========<br /><br />There is a tradition in South American Literature known as Magical Realism, or lo real maravilloso. Though the term was first coined by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925, it was Alejo Carpentier who gave the term its current definition. The Venezuelan essayist and fiction writer Arturo Uslar Pietri was also eager to promote this literary mixture as an exceptional feature of Latin American literature. Magic realist authors include Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende, and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. "My most important problem was destroying the lines of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic" said Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.<br /><br />------------<br />Mercedes: My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.<br />========<br /><br />Guillermo del Toro has written a story that falls within the realm of Magical Realism. On a side note, he quotes S?ren Kierkegaard when explaining the ending, but I can't reveal the quote without spoiling the ending.<br /><br />This story was very close to Guillermo's coraz&oacute;n, and legend has it that he turned down an offer to direct The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to do this film instead. He gave up his entire salary, including back-end points, to see this film realized. He was offered double the budget by Hollywood producers provided the film was made in English, but he turned them all down, unwilling to compromise. He even wrote all the English subtitles himself, to ensure that they were true to his original vision.<br /><br />For years he kept a sketch book where he would draw pictures and scribble notes about his ideas for the film, until one day he left it in a taxi. He was going to give up on the project, but the cab driver, realizing the importance of the notes, tracked him down and returned them. He took this as a sign that he should continue his quixotic quest.<br /><br />--------------<br />Capit&aacute;n Vidal: I choose to be here because I want my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.<br />=========<br /><br />The bottom line is that Guillermo del Toro's film is a masterpiece like Jean Cocteau's La belle et la b?te or Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. It's a film that creates a fable, which is much harder to do than it looks. Guillermo speaks the language not only of films, but also of dreams, of myths, and of fairy tales. His notes and sketches for this film remind me of the recently discovered Red Book by Carl Jung, where Jung also attempted to capture the ephemeral dreams and notions of his subconscious and divine their meaning.<br /><br />--------------<br />Carmen: You're getting older, and you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.<br />[throws the mandrake onto the fire]<br />Ofelia: No! No!<br />Carmen: Ofelia! Magic does not exist. Not for you, me or anyone else.<br />=========<br /><br />Though the film does have elements of the fairy tale it is not for young children, because the world's more full of weeping than they can understand. There are some quite disturbing moments of violence that are only too real. One character, the Pale Man, played by Doug Jones (who also portrayed El Fauno), was so unsettling that he even made Stephen King squirm. Del Toro was seated next to King at a screening and he compared seeing the horror king's reaction to winning three Oscars. Besides the three Oscars and three other Oscar nominations, his film also received a 22 minute standing ovation at Cannes.<br /><br />--------<br />Ofelia: Mercedes, do you believe in fairies?<br />Mercedes: No. But when I was a little girl, I did.

One is about a detachment of Civil Guards in Franco's Spain in 1944 at a campsite fighting the remnants of rebels from the Civil War. The cruel and nasty Captain Vidal heading the detachment is well played by Sergei Lopez. He has married and impregnated a woman who brings her ten-year old daughter to meet the wicked step father.<br />The picture's other level involves magic, fantasy, sprites and the labyrinth of a faun (called Pan in the English title). The girl, Ofelia, finds the labyrinth where she becomes entranced, and it may well be a dream world that she has conjured up. She is counseled by the faun-satyr.<br />The rebels versus the Civil Guards is standard stuff, but it was the fantasy element that gave the picture its three Oscars. Director Guillermo del Toro's blending of the realistic and fantasy worlds makes the film arresting.<br />The movie is worth seeing, but don't expect this to all to end like a fairy tale. The movie has a sad and downbeat conclusion to a brilliantly conceived project.  From the beginning with the stick that becomes like Tinkerbell, you get drawn into this labyrinth and become engrossed in the film's dual level structure.

Some of the visual imagery does look computer generated, but by that time you are paying so much attention to the story that you hardly notice. A sad, but real movie with incredible flair.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth (more properly The Labyrinth of the Faun) is the most imaginative film that I have seen for a long time.  The story is a beautiful mix of reality and fantasy - the reality being the grim Spanish Civil War that was grinding on in the remote areas of Spain in 1944 and the secret world of fairies and the faun inhabited by Ofeila.  The story of the film has been well told by other reviewers so let me say how remarkable the performance of Ivana Baquero as Ofeila is.  She was described in an article about the film as being 10 going in 40 (she is 12) and her maturity comes through in her remarkable performance of a demanding role.  Doug Jones (Abe Sapiens in Hellboy) is spectacular as the faun and the menacing pale man who sees with his hands.  Mr. Jones has a remarkable ability to play creatures and imbue them with life; he was completely believable as a faun from the first moment.  Sergi Lopez makes an effective Capitan Vidal, the true monster of the story and Maribel Verdu makes a great heroine as Mercedes. The casting of the supporting roles was impeccably done with Alex Angulo (just to name one performance) especially good as Dr. Ferreiro.<br /><br />In the end, one is not sure whether to be full of joy or cry; the audience is allowed to decide if Ofelia has fulfilled her destiny and become a princess or if she has been senselessly murdered. Guillermo Del Toro has once again shown that is a great storyteller, and this is a story that can be explored at many levels.  Pan's Labyrinth is a feast for the eyes and a thought provoking story that will stay with you and one that I am looking forward to seeing again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, "The Devil's Backbone" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.<br /><br />I hoped and expected "Pan's Labyrinth" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as "The Devil's Backbone" was. I finally saw "Pan's Labyrinth" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as "Forbidden Games", "Spirits of the Beehive" (which "Pan's Labyrinth" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as "Wizard of Oz", "Alice in Wonderland", "Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece".<br /><br />One movie that "Pan's Labyrinth" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's "Tideland", his fairy tale for adults, his "Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. "Tideland" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with "Tideland" but I found it much more interesting that "Pan's Labyrinth" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in "Pan Labyrinth".<br /><br />I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's "Tideland" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than "Pan's Labyrinth".<br /><br />I should admit that at least one scene in "Labyrinth" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, "Saturn Devouring His Children" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling "Pan's Labyrinth" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, "The Devil's Backbone" is much more deserving than "Pan's Labyrinth" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Where do I start with this movie?  Pan's Labyrinth is a marvel of modern filmmaking.  From the enchanting story to the beautiful visuals, Guillermo del Toro's latest film is a modern masterpiece.  Set against the backdrop of post-civil war Spain, a fascist regime has come to power.  Those who don't obey the law are subjected to terrible punishment.<br /><br />Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is a girl who likes to get wrapped up in fairy tales.  They serve not only as a form of entertainment, but more and more, she uses them as an escape from the harsh realities of what has become of her home.  The film begins as Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the Spanish countryside to reunite with Carmen's second husband and Ofelia's step-father Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez).  Vidal is a firm believer in the fascist government; he follows orders without question and expects those below him to obey him.  When Ofelia arrives, she finds a rock with a design of a king carved into it.  When she examines it, a large dragonfly emerges.  Later, Mercedes (Maribel Verd&uacute;), one of the house-maids at Vidal's cottage, points out an old labyrinth on the edges of the estate.<br /><br />After settling in, Ofelia sees the dragonfly again, and learns that it is in fact a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her through the labyrinth where she meets the Faun (Doug Jones), who tells her that she is a reincarnated princess of the Underworld.  The Faun gives Ofelia a magic book that will reveal three tasks she must complete in order to return to her kingdom.<br /><br />As she goes about trying to accomplish her tasks, Vidal and his soldiers attempt to stamp out the local resistance movement, which is the reason they are stationed in the cottage.  His preoccupation with erradicating his enemies overshadows Carmen, who is getting sick from the pregnancy.  In a moment of sheer vileness, he calmly tells the doctor attending to her to save the baby if he must choose between the two.  Vidal's cruelty is sickening; he brutally killed a father and son he believed were part of the resistance, only to find out moments after they were dead that their stories explaining why they had guns was in fact true.  During a torture sequence with a stuttering guerrilla, he mockingly told the man that he would be set free if he could count to three without stuttering.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ofelia's tasks take her to fantastic places filled with dangerous and terryifying beasts including the Pale Man (Doug Jones), a cannibalistic humanoid with eyes in his hands.  Her interactions with the Faun are both beautiful and creepy; the Faun is terrifying yet gentle and Ofelia's lack of fear around him is interesting in that she is petrified of her step-father, Captain Vidal.  As the movie continues, the real world and the Labyrinth begin to come together, ending with a wonderful climax.<br /><br />In addition to the great story, the visuals and sound are phenominal.  The creature effects, especially regarding the Faun and the Pale Man, are incredible, and the costumes and set designs are beautiful.  The sound usage is incredible.  Most sounds are accentuated, from the squeeking of the leather in Vidal's uniform to the opening of umbrellas, seemingly trivial sounds break the silence of the times without any dialogue, of which there are many.  However, the scenes without dialogue add just as much to the story as even the most verbose sections of the film.  The characters' varoius motions and mannerisms speak volumes about them.  But possibly the most essential use of sound in the film is the haunting lullaby Mercedes hums to Ofelia.  There are no words to it, and the melody, which is supposed to help people sleep, is beautiful and haunting.<br /><br />If there is anything I would change about the film, I would add more scenes in the Labyrinth.  Every scene in the film is essential, thus no scene can go.  I would gladly sit through another 30 minutes of film to see more gorgeous scenes of the fantasy world.  If a film's only problem is that it wasn't long enough, that is an amazing compliment.<br /><br />This is one of the best films of 2006 (it was released in the US in 2007, but will be counted for the 2006 Oscars), and deserves every Oscar it is nominated for.  This film is a modern classic and a perfect fairly tale for adults.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I like when a movie is advertised for what it is actually about. I don't like gory war movies made to look like they are a fantasy movie. Although this movie is good, the ads made it look like another fantasy movie. I am giving it three stars because of the poor job of promoting the movie. Be warned it is more like "Photographing Fairies" than a childrens movie. I happen to like this type of movie, but I felt this was a touch more brutal than necessary. I like the Grimm fairy tales, but that doesn't mean I need to see the gore in my face to enjoy movies of them. This is rated R so that should be your first clue. The fantasy story sprinkled in amongst the horror did not appeal to the side of me that enjoys movies like "Princess Bride" and "Labyrinth". Although the story is good I don't think you need to slice someones mouth with a razor blade and brutally beat people to make it's point.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>If you have seen any Guillermo del Toro film before (that he wrote and directed), you know three things are likely to happen.<br /><br />#1. Anyone, including main protagonists, are a possible death candidates by the time the film ends.<br /><br />#2. At least half the characters will die by the time the film ends.<br /><br />#3. The story will be so remarkable that it will linger with you for days.<br /><br />In Pan's Labyrinth, we see del Toro using the same conventional (for him, not for others) format that he used in The Devil's Backbone. Great isolated ambience; plenty of violence; and a plot so delightful (with cinematography that makes you feel like you're in another realm) that it borders on genius.<br /><br />As for plot, we meet a very dreamy Spanish girl named Ofelia who, along with her pregnant mother, travel to a remote mill where Spanish troops (then working with the Axis powers to make a "clean Spain" in 1944) are under the command of Ofelia's new stepfather, Captain Vidal. Vidal is, as it turns out, like del Toro's other infamous villain, Jacinto from The Devil's Backbone, in that he possesses neither the ability to feel or deliver compassion. Vidal's two main aspirations are #1. to rid the surrounding woodlands of the rebels who are working with the allied powers and #2. to make sure his son is born safely, even at the expense of his wife, Ofelia's mother.<br /><br />And then there is the Labyrinth. Much has been said about the lack of time spent within the Labyrinth but let me admit one truth: enough time is spent there for the viewer to imagine what else might lurk there, and that is what makes this story truly unique. In other fantasy films, it seems that too much time is spent in the alternate world (David Bowie's Labyrinth and The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe both come to mind) and the viewer sometimes can become numb to any scenic trickery or imagination the director might try to instill. In del Toro's vision, we get just enough to know this is a new place, distant from any that we'd read about before. We get a few glimpses of the beauty of horror that reside in the "Kingdom beneath the ground", like a horrifying creature who enjoys sucking the brains from small infants, and believe me, it's enough to leave you talking with friends after the final scene concludes.<br /><br />A very worthwhile film that I highly recommend. It should come without warning that the film possesses much gore, considering it's R-Rated label. Most of the violence, however, is within the world of men (some very World War 2 scenes that you might come to expect in a film like Saving Private Ryan).</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I grew up reading fairy tales that were laced with death and violent imagery. The Little Mermaid, the Little Match Girl, the Red Shoes, the Snow Queen, the Steadfast Tin Soldier, the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, and the Fir Tree. All of those and many more had such sadness, and loss, and they were meant to stir up the imagination as well as teach us a lesson. Pan's Labyrinth is supposed to be one of those tales, and it almost reaches the goals it sets but not quite. I allowed myself some time, between watching it and writing a review to let it all sink in, because right after you watch it you have a lot of emotional conflictions.<br /><br />I love foreign films, because usually they tend to give me another view of society, and cultures I am unfamiliar with. Different locations in this world have different tales to tell, and most are influenced by the history of that land. I always watch them in the original language, with subtitles, because you cannot get the message when it's dubbed.<br /><br />This movie started out well, its promise was apparent, but it soon went downhill for me. It had beautiful imagery, costumes, and the effects were both awesome and mediocre. They dropped the ball when it came to the real life drama, the gore and bloody scenes. While they were horrifying, I could tell what CGI was and what wasn't. The fantasy effects were amazing, especially with the Faun and the Baby eating demon. They were full and lush and inspiring. However they totally dropped the ball in the end, when Ofelia gets to the underworld it was the hugest most disappointing ending I have ever seen, worst even than Jodie Fosters "Contact".<br /><br />The story brought us through the hope of the princess returning, her heartache at losing her family, her love of her brother, her journey through the relentless tasks the Faun gave her and the peril she faced with her stepfather...and than in the end , after all that buildup, we get gypped. Her walking into that bright room, three thrones and a standing ovation by whomever...was in Eric Cartman's great words...."Lame". I got no feeling of joy; I felt no awe over her return. Here they showed us this superb creature, the Faun, and really they just dumped all their eggs in that effect basket and ignored everything else.<br /><br />I would say watch it, for the Faun and for the almost awesomeness of it all, its worth a look, but don't expect to come away satisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>After all the rave reviews I expected this movie to be really extraordinary, and I was disappointed. I'm not saying that it's a BAD movie - it isn't - only that it fell short of my expectations. Why? For several reasons. First, the story was intentionally derivative of many other myths and movies.The idea of juxtaposing the ugly reality of Fascist Spain with a fantasy world was somewhat original, but overall the movie had a "been there, seen that" feel to it.  The acting is excellent, but production values verge on cheesy: grainy, dark, day-for-night shots, etc. A lot like the cheap movies Elvira used to host on the midnight movies of long ago.  And the first half of the movie moves VERY slowly. So, while I found "Pan's Labyrinth" interesting, I'd rank it as only slightly above average overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I do NOT recommend children watch this movie.  What starts off as innocent fun quickly turns into extreme violence and severe swearing.  They say the F word a couple times, and there was one violent moment in particular that made me sick showing a soldier bashing a guys face in (including close-up shots of blood pouring from his face).  It was the biggest surprise of the plot, and I mean that in a BAD way.<br /><br />It's supposed to be a film about fairy tales.  The war storyline is what I originally thought to be a creation as a way for children to look away from the real-life nonstop violence and find a happy place in the land of fairy tales.  Unfortunately the fantasy land the little girl in this movie explores is filled with lots of blood and a twisted, disgusting atmosphere. The war story may be unrelated to the fantasy segments, but both stories are really violent and inappropriate for children.<br /><br />Some of the monsters in this game reminded me of those in video games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2.  Probably a coincidence.  Especially that one monster sitting at a dinner table who didn't like it when the girl ate some grapes off the table and then proceeded to run after her.  He had eyes in his hands, just like that big monster in Resident Evil 2 had eyes in his arms.<br /><br />Adults who like war movies won't find enough detail to keep them interested, and children who like fantasy elements will probably be too disgusted to really find the courage to watch Pan's Labyrinth all the way through without getting nightmares.  I have no idea what kind of person this movie was intended for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>1944. Spain has just come out of the civil war, and the fascist Franco regime is in power. A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in "reality" and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too "arty" for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely. And in light of history, what does the republicans victory means at the end (unless Del Toro just wanted to please the crowds?).</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is not a children's movie, even though it looks like it belongs to the same genre as The Chronicles of Narnia. It's a Civil war drama combining elements of fairytale as subplot. The film features very good performances and high quality production. While there is characters and story is well developed, I feel that there was not enough fairy activity or special effects. There was really just the Faun, his miniature fairies and that canibalistic monster. I just thought that there is not enough coverage of world of the fairies when the little's girl Ofelia/fairy princess returned to eventually. It might have a been a budget limitation, since there would have to been all these elaborate sets and creatures...This film could've been perfect if they had a much bigger budget so it would have a more visual feast impact.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>Pan's Labyrinth is a marvelous, serious movie full of allegory, the easiest being fascism and freedom, nightmares and dreams. This is a film that people who like movies about ideas and implications will chew over and come back to. And I hope Sergi Lopez is doing things other than bad guys. He's a first-class actor. Those who've seen Dirty Pretty Things will recall him. As Harry in the French psycho movie, With a Friend Like Harry, he's exactly not the kind of friend to have.<br /><br />I have one caveat. I wish first-class directors (and second-class directors, too) could resist indulging in the brutality "wow" factor some of their fans seem to love so much. I could see no purpose except to have the audience go "yuck" when the Captain's cheek is slit, when he sews it up himself and when he uses a bottle to smash in a captive's face. All are shown in close-up and in loving detail. Pan's Labyrinth is so good a movie that the three yuck moments aren't needed, in my view, except for pandering to a segment of the audience.<br /><br />But doesn't the face-smashing truly and quickly establish the really brutal and vicious nature of the man, particularly as an allegory for fascism? Perhaps, but did it need to be shown in close-up? The whole scene was threatening because of the way Lopez played it. His brutal character, for me, was quickly set through Lopez' performance and the fright of the two peasants...there was no doubt, from my point of view, about the Captain's character. That was established to my satisfaction by the Captain matter-of-factly personally shooting the father more than once, then turning to put bullets into the son...more bullets than were needed, and by doing it himself. Then following that by the discovery of the rabbits in the knapsack and the...what? just irritation toward his subordinate for not thoroughly searching the two peasants.<br /><br />I'll offer this as something to think about: If the three incidents I mentioned 1) had not been shot in close-up, but had been shown in medium shots or 2) with the bottle scene, the Captain starts to smash the bottle into the face but there was a cut-away so the direct smashing impacts weren't seen, and 3) if the cheek slitting had been shown in a different angle and the sewing had been seen from a different, non-close-up angle...would the impact of the story or the film be significantly changed in any important emotional or visual way? For me, the answer is "no." The cheek sewing, for me, established that the Captain really was an evil not of this world, worse than anything Ofelia had encountered in her world...but the director, from a practical, visual, emotional level, did not have to use close-ups of the needle going in and out of the flesh to establish that point. When I saw the movie the theater was packed. Believe me, when those three scenes came up all I could hear was "Yuck" from the audience with undertones of either delight or revulsion. It seemed to me people were caught up in the bloody close-up moment, just as they would be in some gory teen horror flick, and not in any expanded meaning about the characters or the story.<br /><br />The movie, itself, despite this directorial indulgence, remains a fascinating and thoughtful film that will most likely be remembered and watched years from now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>I was really expecting to love this move. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a> is my favorite film, so when everyone started calling this the "best film since the Lord of the Rings" I had to see it. It didn't air in the local theaters so I had to wait until it came out on video. There isn't nearly enough fantasy in a movie advertised to be a fantasy book. This is NOT a fantasy, it's a drama.<br /><br />this movie is was a HUGE let down. I mean, the movie was okay I guess, but to compare it to the LOTR is just wrong. These two movies have almost nothing in common, LOTR beats Pans Labyrinth in every movie category there is. The only category that Labyrinth comes even remotely close to the LOTR is in emotional impact, but even then everything was done so matter of fact in this movie I could only feel really bad at the very end. Normally if you throw a suffering little girl into a movie you automatically have me depressed (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00070Q84U">Grave of the Fireflies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063K2C">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056H26">All Dogs Go to Heaven</a>) but here it didn't. Why is easy to see. The girl in this movie is so amazedly stupid, which is made clear when she eats from a feast after being warned that doing so would result in her death. Even with fairies buzzing around her head and trying to take the good away from her, even which a creepy monster thing at the end of the table, even with pictures of that same monster thing killing hundreds of little babies, SHE STILL EATS THE STUPID FOOD!!! And its not just her, the house maid is such a bad spy that I'm surprised she lasted this long, and the doctor is extremely careless. They just don't act like real people would act, and in a movie that's character driven that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Then there's the meany step dad. Although he is one bad dude, and deserves to be hated, I've seen too many villains who are MUCH worse than him. Sure this guy is bad, but he could have been a lot worse. Until the end (when he was drugged up) the worse thing he did was torture a stutterer with his little hammer and pliers. Don't get me wrong now, he's a really bad guy, but he pretty much leaves people alone who don't do anything to him. It's not like he's going out murdering random people. By everything I was hearing, I expected him to be the worst thing since Hitler, but this guy is no where NEAR that bad. Come on now.<br /><br />just one question before I stop writing a review that I know won't get many helpful votes, do all Spanish people fight this bad? I know this isn't a war movie, but the fighting was so unrealistic it was laughable. The soldiers run around in the open missing each other at point blank range, and yet the main villain is able to pick people off at fifty yards with his pistol.<br /><br />Maybe I could have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't been expecting another LOTR, but that's the way it was advertised. Don't blame me for that. The acting was good, the special effects were good (but once again I was comparing them to the LOTR, in which case they came up short) and the script was great. Don't watch this movie expecting fantasy, because that's not what you'll get. if you read this review (whether you agree with me or not) please leave a comment.<br /><br />Replay value; moderate.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.  Not the great movie everyone kept on about.  I was expecting something more, but it's still a good tale.  The strongest performance came from Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal.  I was more into the drama unfolding between the grown ups than what Ofelia was going through.  CGI and special effects are really good.  The Brothers Grimm influence is very obvious and nicely done.  Overall, it's pretty good, just not the best film of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>if you gave this film one star, it only means that you don't have the stomach for cruelty that only human being could have achieved; and it also means that you often watching movies with your own moral standard and values. watching movies doesn't need you to take them too personal. you just have to know how we human beings are capable of doing evil and good things. either way is by your own choice, just like to eat or not to eat the grapes, it's your own choice and decision, and you have to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />i don't know how to categorize this movie, but i could still appreciate it in certain ways about its seriousness, sincerity and profoundness. it's only for the open-minded adult viewers, allowing them an opportunity to remember their own childhood, their imagination, their fears of the unknown future, ghost, death, poverty, sometimes even loneliness.<br /><br />the creation of that captain in this movie is one of the most fearsome heartless stone-cold killers, using cruelty and brutality to show their bravery.<br /><br />i can't say this movie is visually stunning or beautiful, because most of the time it's too graphically and unnecessarily dark, gruesome and gross. but if judge with the standard of good or bad movie, it's definitely a good one. screenplay, acting, directing all very good.</p></br><a href="../users/A31JRSZQ76YA1N.html">A31JRSZQ76YA1N</a><br/><p>A companion piece to "Spirit of the Beehive" ~ this is way up there with "Wizard Of Oz" and 'Wicked' .......

Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, a 12-year old caught up in Franco's war, is superb ( as is the rest of the cast ). This marvelous film may lack the humor of films like Caro and Jeunet's equally wonderful, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, or Peter Jackson's epic THE LORD OF THE RINGS, but it is every bit as moving. It's a bit violent for children, but this is high fantasy at it's very best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"Pan's Labyrinth" is the story of a little girl in the middle of the Spanish civil war, whose mother has recently married a military officer whose brutal nature is soon to be revealed to mother and daughter when they movie into the military garrison the officer commands.  As the war between the garrison and the hill-based rebels rages, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is free during the calm periods to explore the dark woods, where she discovers a mysterious labyrinth....<br /><br />  The first thing that needs to be said is that the movie isn't as open-and-closed as its advertising makes it seem.  In the ads it talks about a little girl escaping into a world of her own imagination, to escape a brutal reality.  In my mind, it's not a given that what happens in the labyrinth and during other strange events, is just Ofelia's imagination.  Not to give anything away regarding the ending, but throughout "Pan's Labyrinth" you can find plenty of clues that would lead to either outcome - that it's an imagined world, or that it's really happening.  As for the events whose reality is in question, Ofelia discovers a Faun inside the labyrinth who tells her that she's really the daughter of the moon, and requests her assistance in certain tasks.  Accompanied by strange, insectoid-fairies, Ofelia returns to the more familiar human world, although at times she wonders if the Faun has revealed the full truth....<br /><br />  In that human world, the officer, Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez), rules the garrison, its soldiers, its staff of servants, the nearby village, and his own family (including his new child by Ofelia's mother) with an iron fist, and is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the rebels.  Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the man behind "The Devil's Backbone", "Pan's Labyrinth" walks a lot of thematically similar territory to "Backbone" - innocents caught in a vicious world not of their own making, the desperation of the powerless against the powerful, and the strong connection of a child with a kind of otherworld.  The themes tie together intricately, and one of the tag lines to the movie - 'Innocence Has A Power Evil Can't Imagine' - gives a tantalizing hint to what may be going on inside some of the movie's mysteries.<br /><br />  On the techinal side, the movie is perfect - outstanding acting, special effects that are alternately beautiful and horrifying (including one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history), a great musical score, perfect suspense.  This is a must for fans of edgy fantasy, horror, and even war movies and intense dramas.  A++</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>A lush and viciously visceral film, "Pan's Labyrinth" twists together the brutal realities of post-war Spain with a vibrant and equally frightening fairy tale land, filled with dangerous quests, helpful faeries, and one questionable, bark-skinned faun.  The end result is as visually decadent as it is emotionally compelling, a harsh but gorgeous and richly-filmed fable.<br /><br />Most of Guillermo del Toro's (Hellboy) story centers around the young Ofelia, a tender-spirited girl who spends much of her time with her nose in a book.  Her mother -- who has recently wed (and carries the unborn child of) the heartless Capitan Vidal -- remarks that it isn't healthy for a girl to read so many fairy tales.  It doesn't seem to occur to her that it is far more unhealthy to move that child to a sawmill-cum-Fascist military compound, especially when that compound is filled with spies, surrounded by rebels, and commanded by a cold, paranoid power-monger.<br /><br />The tension between the light of childish innonce and the dark dredge of men at war is what the movie balances on, like a colorfully creepy Cirque de Soleil performer executing gorgeous cartwheels on a tightrope of razor wire.  Ofelia's fantasy world (real or not, who's to say?) offers some kind of escape, but it's not necessarily the comforting kind.  Perhaps she is reacting to a normal child's helplessness (her pregnant mother grows sicker as the Capitan's struggle with the rebels grows more out of control), perhaps she is just embracing a world with contours that are easier to read, where good and evil are not so hazy or hard to confront.<br /><br />Whatever the case, it makes for entrancing viewing.  The parallel stories turn around each other, unfolding against the drama of righteous resistance, unflagging faith, and hope in the tenuous strength of truth.  A soldier on the verge of death has a gun thrust in his face, and he weakly but defiantly slaps the barrel away several times, knowing that his is a largely symbolic act.  Death isn't the point.  The freedom to fight is.<br /><br />Ofelia fights with equal measure, and to many viewers, it may be hard to watch.  Like the old fairy tales of yore (before Disney cut out the spiny parts and added childish treacle), this is a story that is as creative, imaginative, and weird as it is horrifying and gut-wrenching.  At one point, Ofelia tells a story to her unborn brother about a special flower that, if it is plucked, will give eternal life.  The catch?  Its thorns contain a poison that will kill you instantly.  Because of this risk, the flower remains forever untaken and unused, its potential eternally lost.<br /><br />Ofelia takes risks and so does this movie.  Some may find it hard to stomach, but others, wading through its crisp, uncompromising imagery and its tragic but redemptive telling, might find something to hold onto and remember.  This movie is a gorgeous flower, one worth plucking and saving, but just like Ofelia's fairy tale rose, this is one blossom with bite.<br /><br />(Note: this is a Spanish film with English subtitles.)</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Guillermo del Toro's "Pan's Labyrinth"<br />`El Laberinto del Fauno'<br />[The Labyrinth Of The Faun]<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail about the films storyline for I myself like to go into a movie not knowing to much. I'd rather read reviews on how a film such as this affected the reviewer while and/or after they viewed it.<br />So fellow film fans this is what I think of "Pan's Labyrinth" after viewing it yesterday afternoon at a somewhat crowded 1pm sunday matinee. First off you could've heard a pin drop throughout(or maybe those were movie patrons chin bones hitting the floor?)anyway I had been waiting to see this film for a little over a year now ever since I first read a small article on it in Fangoria. I didn't know much about it(nor did I want too) all I knew was that one of my very favorite Director's in Guillermo del Toro was the meastro behind it,it had fantasy elements to it and that it had been getting alot of praise from critics throughout the film festival circuit. Now that I have finally seen the film it has by far surpassed my expectations wich were already of the highest standards. This film is an extraorinary work of cinema story telling art. It is truly a perfect balance of Drama,horror and philosophical depth. Guillermo del Toro not only masterfully makes a nightmarish reality run paralel with a colorfully dark yet truly hopeful fantasy world but he somehow manages to intertwine them in a way as to leave the individual viewer to take away from it whatever they may & for me that's finding  true limitless hope in the core of magic amidst a world of brutal reality(as we know it) that seem's to have lost both. This is a timeless film that is so complete in every sense of the word that in the end may very well stand head and shoulder's above all philosophical fantasy movies from 'The Wizard Of OZ' until now.<br />I'm shocked that it has limited play in theatres,but then again when I look at the lost world that surrounds me I guess I'm not so shocked,wich gives this movie that much more meaning(for me).<br />I know that saying this may affect my credibility as an armcheer movie critic(lol!) but I'm willing to take that chance and go out on a limb and say that to date this is not only one my personal favorite movies but with all it's film making elements perfectly placed & balanced just right it may very well be technically the greatest film ever made!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JXAQ92WYPAAR.html">A2JXAQ92WYPAAR</a><br/><p>Good and evil work in fairy tales but fail in historical dramas. This film mixes the two, with great success in certain departments, but in others, it disappoints. Clearly, the Spanish Civil War will live in the hearts of liberals to the end of time, always depicted in the same way , with virtuous liberals fighting depraved fascists. It is easy to turn the audience against the fascists; they commit terrible crimes like being mean to children, and even meaner to the cute children's lovely mommies. But how can you get the audience to love a cipher? For myself, I couldn't have cared less about the heroes in the woods, and of course I hated with snarling father in his Darth Vadar uniform. Instead, I grew intrigued by the goofy fairy tale animals which resembled the kind of weird creatures in Star Wars, only here they live underground and are menacing. Still, I loved the monster guarding the banquet table and thought his hand-embedded eye balls a real treat. Over all, though, I hated the Spanish resistance members for their goodness as much as I hated the fascists for their cruelty. The whole lot were losers. The story was numbingly predictable and unenlightening. Like the Cold War struggles in America between the evil McCarthyites and the virtuous Hollywood liberals, this tale will continue to be told as long as intellectual go into the arts, but for God sake won't somebody finally realize that the audience has moved on?</p></br><a href="../users/APW72P4COWTBK.html">APW72P4COWTBK</a><br/><p>MAN This movie is SPECTACULAR!!!!!<br /><br />First class special effects, GREAT story and storyline (just like the anime films by Miyazaki), VERY good acting, SUPERB cinematography and BLOOD AND GORE!!!!!!!!

I was not expecting LOTR or Harry Potter here, I know there were more dramatic elements involved. But still, this movie did astound me on various levels. Is it a good movie? Absolutely. Is it great, Oscar-worthy material? I certainly don't think so.<br /><br />Ophelia travels to the countryside of somewhere in Spain with her mother, to join her stepfather, a foul man called Captain Vidal. Her mother is pregnant with Vidal's son, so naturally Vidal is very protective of the mother, or more aptly his baby son. There are some rebel militants in the countryside that threatens Vidal's military power. So, every so often we are treated to some gory albeit graphic scenes showcasing Vidal's evil/narcissistic behavior. Ophelia, a great fan of fantasy novels starts dreaming, meeting a faun (whose name is unknown but we assume it's Pan), he then tells her that she is the Princess reborn of the Underground Realm. To rightfully claim the title, she needs to complete 3 tasks. Upon completion, she will join the King and Queen, and live happily ever after. She enthusiastically accepts the challenges and her journey begins. Is it a dream, or is it real? I mean, this is after all a movie from the director of Hellboy, so nothing is far-fetched.<br /><br />To be honest, I was really absorbed in the story. No doubt, it's a very sad movie. The uniqueness of the movie is that it is told from the eyes of a little girl. Everything that happens, more or less revolves around her and her ideas or perception. This girl is living in a terrible place, she fears her stepfather, her mother is ill carrying her baby brother and she has no friends. She conjures this fantasy world to get away from all these. Her fantasy co-exists with reality. We, the audience at times never know where the fantasy ends and where reality begins. The storytelling is superb in that sense. Other than that, the cinematography is exceptionally good. There are traces of what we saw in Hellboy, but it seems more polished now. The acting is decent, but I was especially impressed with Ivana Baquero, who played Ophelia really well. Definitely a young actress to watch out for in the future. Another thing I loved about the movie was its haunting score, from Javier Navarrete. It really set the dark and bleak tone for the movie.<br /><br />As you can see, there are many things to like about the movie, but why I feel it is over-rated is because, it is not groundbreaking. The evil stepfather, the kind-hearted but ill-fated mother, the abused child are all quite clich&eacute;. Done quite well here, but still has a sense of repetition when watching the movie. Furthermore, the idea of escaping the harsh reality of war has been done before. Just watch Life Is Beautiful, where the father goes through so much to convince the young son that everything is just peachy although they are held prisoners in a freakin' military camp. Even Harry Potter toys with this idea, Harry is living in what seems like Hell with his Uncle and Aunty, until he found out he was a powerful wizard. I am sure there are many more examples.<br /><br />Also, there are some minor plot holes that didn't sit well with me. Unlike some people here, the graphic scenes did not disturb me but something I was eager to know, is what drives Captain Vidal to act the way he does? Does someone just wake up one day, and say "Hey, I'm gonna be an evil son of b*tch today"? Why does Ophelia just follow the faun's instructions without thinking twice about it? I mean, to be honest that dude who looks like a rejected character from Hellboy, doesn't exactly seem like the most trustworthy guy around. Has Ophelia seen the Underground Realm? I really think if the faun had offered Ophelia a glimpse of this mysterious realm, of how beautiful it is, that would make more sense. She would seem like she wants something better than what she is currently experiencing. Unfortunately, without knowing anything about the realm and the kingdom, she jumps at every command. Being the smart, grounded girl she is portrayed to be, I found this to be a little weird. The story was also not as emotionally charged as I hoped for, and this plays a big part in pushing a movie from good to great. Yes, there is a very heavy sorrow/sadness throughout the movie but it lacks moments of emotional brilliance that some classic movies have, where usually at a singular, pivotal point, it provokes certain feelings from audiences.<br /><br />I know those are minor gripes, which I usually don't even highlight when I am reviewing movies. But I just felt I had to mention those things because I really believe this movie is over hyped. It is good, especially for a foreign movie with a team of Mexican/Spanish people behind it, but to say that this is THE best movie of 2006, that it should win a Best Picture Oscar is something I strongly disagree. Buy this DVD for its storytelling and cinematography; I just hope you don't go in expecting one of the best movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>WOW! Where to start....I was well aware of the subject matter of PAN'S LABYRINTH and the R rating( graphic violence) when a group of us saw it last night.What the oft-seen trailers and critics in the major city papers DID NOT tell me,though,was just HOW violent/gory/gruesome AND graphic this film was going to be.I truly have no problem with depiction of violence when it furthers the plot to clarify the points in the story,but I truly felt that much of the violence was gratuitous and unnecessary.We already had so many scenes of Captain Vidal's violent nature.How much is necessary to make a point and how much is TOO much?We artists are always balancing that one!!!Writer/Director Del Toro chose IMO the "over-the-top" route much like what many folks remarked vociferously about Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.Some may feel that ALL of the horror that is dealt to us in this film is necessary and essential.I do not.Sometimes what is NOT shown to us can be MORE LASTING than what is laid bare (REPEATEDLY) all the time.After so much gore, I actually "numbed out" and just wanted to get to the end of the film.<br /><br />NOW ON THE LIGHTER SIDE:(1) Javier Navarrete's soundtrack score is sublime and captures every moment of Ofelia's adventure without bringing attention to itself.This is the hallmark of a great soundtrack very much along the lines of Alexandre Desplats or Hans Zimmer where the viewer is AWARE of music,but overwhelmed by it.<br /><br />(2) Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is a marvel to behold.I was so atuned to her rapid breathing that it put me in mind of Poe's TELLTALE HEART.This child will hopefully grow into a great actress.<br /><br />(3) Maribel Verdu playing the Resistance-informer Mercedes was able to control so much of the horror she saw and yet remain cool enough to think ahead and not crumble under pressure.A GREAT ROLE and A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE.<br /><br />(4) Two of guys that were in our group noticed several shot/continuity problems ( because that is what they are PAID to do!) If they want to write reviews they can!<br /><br />Honestly, I have always said and practiced "To each their own!".This film could have been my cup of tea,but really just ended up,for me, a cup of blood.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>There are 2 films within this movie :<br /><br />1. Reality through a young girls' eyes - Set in war-torn Europe, the young girl from a dysfunctional family is distracted by an alternative universe of magical beings, where she is told she is a princess of an Underworld Kingdom, and has to perform certain tasks to attain the title. These `magical tasks' (which are the centerpiece of the movie) are by far the most visually arresting I've seen in a while - it reminded me a lot of Tarsem's "The Cell" (the underrated masterpiece starring Jennifer Lopez) both visually and metaphorically.<br /><br />2. Reality as it is - The film also parallelly follows the reality of the girls' family and how the world views her - which means there is nothing magical going on, just a lot of violence and sadness, as to be expected from the dreariness of the era. Throw in an abusive father, a spineless mother, and inhospitable living conditions, and you can imagine why the girl is so desperate to block this reality out.<br /><br />The interesting thing is, the viewer is not told which reality is true. In the end, when realities converge, it is left very vague as to whose world is real. On one hand, it is suggested that the girls' elaborate fantasy (and in fact the entire film, thereby) is just an illusion. On the other hand, it is suggested that all the story was is one girls' attempt to escape the harshness of the world by creating an imaginary world that only she could see and understand. I prefer to think it's the former, but either way, this is a beautiful film that makes you think. The cinematography is brilliant, and the special effects are truly exemplary.<br /><br />However, even though I do adore this film, I can see why some people would find it pretentious and meaningless. I mean, those are cruel words for a film of this beauty, but the end of the film can leave you very cold and un-moved, even if you did enjoy everything that came before it. I saw this with someone who felt the same way but was left down by the end, which was more of an anti-climax, in the worst sort of way.<br /><br />The highlight of the film is definitely the young actress. She is not very talented as an `actress' per se, and if you know a little about film-making you can see that the performance she gave is definitely because of the efforts of her director to make her `look better' as an actress.<br /><br />That said, this is a glorious film that you should watch with someone who appreciates foreign film as much as you do. It is by no means a perfect movie, but as films of 2006 go, this was pretty much the cream of the crop.</p></br><a href="../users/A2O97GKCSISM3F.html">A2O97GKCSISM3F</a><br/><p>I must be in the minority of not caring much for this film. Don't get me wrong:I like horror films, and fairy tale adaptations-Snow White:Tale of<br />Terror, included. But this film just did not sit well w/me, it wasn't the director or the actors, it was the story itself. The ending was a major letdown for me, because it wasn't very good. The best aspect were the effects.I'm not sure what else to say.<br /><br />Jan. 24, 2011)Well, now I realize I was wrong to criticize this movie the way I did, I just watched it for a second time and overall liked it. This time around, the story made alot more sense. I've always liked Good vs. Evil stories, I'm not sure how the director came up with this, but he's got one hell of an imagination. When I can afford it, I will own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>As you probably know, this movie is like 2 movie, a kinda dark fairy tale, and<br /><br />a very dark war story, with its dark characters..  The darkness and violence<br /><br />from one destroys the other.  i viewed this movie, i admired the very nice<br /><br />photography and effects of the fairy tale portion, which was slowly destroyed<br /><br />by the other story.  Even if everyone loves this movie, i shall never view it<br /><br />again,and shall not buy it....why...the world is dark enough, and i dont feel<br /><br />i have to be reminded with dark war characters, the world has enough of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>I am sorry for those of you who really liked this film, but I did not find any of this very astounding.  It played like all other highly computer driven films.  The story is of war torn Spain around WWII, and a little girl who has to move in with her new stepfather, a colonel in the army.  They move to the countryside so he can be near the front line of a gorilla faction.  Amongst this chaos, a girl finds an escape into a fantasy world, where she finds out she was supposed to be all along.  Now whether this was supposed to be a War movie or a Fairy Tale, it's hard to tell.  They needed to split the two apart because I found the one storyline got in the way of the other.  The gruesomeness of the war scenes did not mix well with the discovery and the imagery of the "underworld" fantasy.  Definitely not a family movie, never meant to be, so do not let your kids watch this, but I would not recommend adults watch this either.  Spend your rental money elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>Let me start by offering my motivation for writing this review.  I recently purchased this movie on my brother's recommendation.  I like fantasy movies.  I heard this was "not for kids" (a very dark film).  As an artist, I can appreciate the artistic density of this movie (I'm thinking).  None of this posed a problem for me. I was sold.  I read the synopsis.  I'm still good with buying this film.  No problems.  Then I watched it.<br /><br />D@MN YOU BOB!!!  I should have known better.  You see, I also purchased "Brazil" on my brother's recommendation.  I don't think I'll ever watch that DVD again either.  Not surprisingly, though very different in context, these two films are very much the same in political leaning and emotional slather.  In fact, both films have nearly identical endings.<br /><br />Since I am exceedingly lazy and have limited time, I will resort to my habit of using bullet statements to convey to you why I don't like this kind of movie.  I will also avoid trying to write the names of people involved in making this film because I don't care (it's the film that matters);<br />( I'll try to point out spoilers with these ***)<br /><br />-This film, like "Brazil" leans hard left.  Personally, I don't care how it leans.  It does have a clear agenda outside of entertaining us with a "fantasy" story and that gives it a deceptive smell.  I wanted the fantasy, not the political statement.<br /><br />-Unlike Brazil, this film actually has historical precedence.  This is probably the only movie about 1944 Franco Spain that I have ever seen.  In retrospect, I really don't care what happened in 1944 Franco Spain.  I think bigger world changing events occurred at that time (or is it just me?).  Even though I have plenty of war movies and if this were not sold as a fantasy movie, I still would not have seen a film about life in Franco's Spain.<br /><br />-Like Brazil, this movie takes sides.  It's so easy to get the viewer to side with the poor downtrodden "rebels" especially here in the U.S...  But when I step back, I ask myself "What are the rebels rebelling against?"  In both films it's the established and accepted government.  Though imperfect or highly flawed, these governments provide infrastructure, economic stability and security (for a price).  The rebels usually kill perfectly happy innocent people too.  Making the rebels seam noble is a very cheap trick and I am not impressed.  Did you ever here of the ETA. They are the same people we are talking about here and they are considred terrorists in Spain today.  WHERE'S MY FANTASY?<br /><br />-In the commentary, the Director claims the fantasy is real.  I watched the movie and I have to disagree.  I know this is completely irrational, after all; he's the Director. However, other than a scene with mandrake root, everything points to the fantasy being an escape into one persons mind.  Escaping Franco's Spain.  Therefore this is not a fantasy movie, but a historical war movie.  What one person uses to escape the ugly horrors of Franco's Spain matters little to me since in my mind it is just a diversion.<br /><br />-Both films are undeniably artistic achievements.  If "Pan's Labyrinth" had no fantasy elements at all, it would be a very powerful film about life in the mountains of Franco's Spain (I really am tired of writing that).  Again, I did not really want to see a movie about "Franco's Spain".  I was deceived into watching a movie about you-know-where.<br /><br />-***Unlike Brazil, PL was very realistic.  In fact, this film was so realistic I could almost feel the blood splattering on my face as bullets whistle through men's bodies.  I could almost feel the bottle smashing my face in.  I could almost feel the knife ripping my cheek.  This begs the question.  What is this movie about?<br /><br />-***Oh yea, the fantasy.  If you separate the fantasy elements from the historical drama, you get a very short, scary, horrifying fantasy film.  Let's see, we get clawed baby eating monster with eyes in his hands.  We get said monster graphically chewing pixies in half. We get giant frogs that regurgitate themselves out of their skins.  We get a very creepy pan with a very irritating and creepy voice.  We get mandrake roots (very much like the "Harry Potter" mandrake roots) that require the little girl to bite herself to bleeding on it.  Wait, I just described a HORROR MOVIE!!!<br /><br />-I know many people just love to watch subtitles to preserve the integrity of the film.  What a load of tripe that is.  I had to watch one scene three times to catch all the overlapping dialogue.  Give me dubbing any day.  Done right, you can actually see the movie undistracted by words on the picture.<br /><br />-The villain in this film is such an evil SOB hating him becomes easy.  This begs the question; why did the mother remarry to such a jerk?  Of course, this just adds to the emotional slather I previously eluded too.  Why don't we ever get to meet the rebels torture meister?  I'm sure they would have had one.<br /><br />What's the point of all this?  What exactly am I getting at?  Pan's Labyrinth is sold as a fantasy film when it clearly is not.  You do get images from a fantasy world, true.  You even get grotesque fantasy creatures.  However, it's all rendered moot when the film is actually about the horrors of life during 1944 Franco Spain being so disturbing as to cause a little girl to take refuge in the fantasies of her mind (I don't believe the director for one second).  This is not what I wanted to see.  So I've written this review to give ample warning to those who DO NOT WANT TO SEE A FILM ABOUT LIFE DURING 1944 FRANCO SPAIN, artistic masterpiece or otherwise.  If you want to believe this is a fantasy film with Franco Spain as a backdrop, go for it.  That's not how I see it.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>Wow...and not in a good sense. This movie was fkn boring as hell to me. I really dont see what the big hoopla is about this movie. Yes it did have some good parts in it, but damn it seemed like there was so much senseless c**p in it also. I was expecting to watch some fantasy movie, but instead I get some crap about a girl who imagines way to much. The setting with the military guys against some geurilla warfare dudes set back in some old time was annoying. I could care less about it. Everything since the beginning of the movie was just emotionally sad. I thought their would be an uplifting in the movie, something to hold on to, something to make you have hope, but there really wasnt any of that.<br /><br />Artistically, the movie was very pretty in the special effects category. The 'faun' the little girl talks to was VERY well done and looked like a cross between CG and cosmetics (I'm not watching the specials, so I dont know for sure). The monster with eyeballs on its hands, was wickedly freaky.<br /><br />The acting wasnt to bad, but most of it was just annoying. The only good actors was the Captain (who sometimes was a little to annoying with his evilness) and the little girl.<br /><br />Seriously though...did I miss something in this movie? Why is it getting so much praise when it was mediocre at best? 'The Little Princess' is a much better movie when it comes to a girl who is in a rut pretending about fairy tales to make her life better. 'Bridge to Taribithia' was also a better movie about a kid(s) having a make believe area to better their lives... and I didnt even care for that movie that much.<br /><br />Sorry, but this just did not do it for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Talk about a misleading preview!!  I was excited to see a young girl's journey into a mystical world where she would have to survive her way through; however, the mystical world is seen only a short time during the movie.  Is the fantasy world real or not?  What is really going on?</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>Despite assured direction, solid acting, and seamless special effects, I would account this movie a failure.<br /><br />It's simply way too bloody to be a children's movie, and too childish to be a good adult's movie.<br /><br />There's really only one good scene, the one with the eyeless guy, but even that, I imagine, would be pretty traumatic for a child to watch.<br /><br />Don't sit down to watch this thinking it's some sort of magical children's movie: you'll be sorry.<br /><br />A guaranteed retort to this review is:  "Who told you it's a kid's movie?  They never said it's a kid's movie!"<br /><br />Fine.  So let's evaluate this as an adult's movie:<br /><br />1.  Pointlessly overviolent.  Really the violence is so graphic that whatever other message the director would like to convey gets lost in the shock.<br />2.  The two plots cohere only superficially.<br />3.  The mythical elements seem random, as if somebody had just read a copy of Joseph Campbell and decided to toss a whole bunch of random ideas into the soup.  What was the point of the eyeless guy and eating the grapes, for example?<br /><br />Lemme guess:  you're thinking, "You're being too literal!  Why can't you enjoy the childish wonder and mystery of it?"<br /><br />But wait.  I thought it wasn't a kid's movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A82R4WKX62LEK.html">A82R4WKX62LEK</a><br/><p>THE MOVIE HAS A COUPLE GOOD SCENES. 95% OF THE MOVIE IS CORNY AND BORING AND A WASTE OF TIME.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>No other words for this movie other than awful!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>After the movie was over I felt outraged and shocked. The violence in this film is so morbid and intense it was overwhelming.  In this movie you will literally learn the how to torture someone with the correct tools. You will see so many people have their brains blown out, most at point blank range, you will lose count. You will see the brutal murder of a father & son, a kindly teenage girl, a benevolent doctor, a man with a handicap, not to mention numerous young men. We get to see a rivers of blood while a women bleeds to death from childbirth.  A man have his leg amputated due to gangrene. Another man (who is merely human, in case your wondering)  is brutally stabed in the back, heart and face, and he gets up a few minutes later as if he just stepped on a tack. (Some guys have all the luck!) We even get to see him stitch his face back together again in graphic detail. (Sorry, I can't tell you more, at this point I was looking away).<br /><br />The world of "fantasy", on the otherhand, is virtually devoid of all violence. This ancient Pagan world is, for the most part, quite loving and sane. A very sad commentary on Franco Spain during the early the 1940's. Unfortunately this magnificent "fantasy" world makes up less than a 1/4 of the movie, while the constant brutal violence and turmoil of the "real"  world makes up the rest.<br /><br />Here are some of my conclusions: If you bring a child or an emotionally fragile person to this particular movie they may end up needing the services of a psychiatrist. THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR A GOOD REASON - EXTREME VIOLENCE! The critics who raved about how great this movie is should be on the front line covering the war in Iraq. Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic example of lazy filmmaking. It's cheaper to show flying brain goo than it is to create a maginificent fantasy world in all its complex beauty. Many of today's filmmakers and screenwriters think the general movie going public are idiots - nothing can possibly be left to the imagination. We need to be shown everything like a five year old child. The general public is divided in two very broad groups:  One that either enjoys and/or could care less about watching intense violence and suffering - and those who find it troubling or annoying and do not enjoy watching people being maimed and murdered.<br /><br />The movie ratings system in this country is a joke, and an extreme example of hypocracy. When Al Gore's brilliant documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," recieved an "R" rating for an under five-second scene of a Katrina victim's corpse floating on his stomach,  and a movie like Pan's Labyrinth gets the same exact rating - then it's time to radically change the movie rating system in the USA, pronto!! Perhaps, instead of  an "R"  rating we could have two new ratings:  XV for extreme violence and XN for extreme nudity & sexual situations. P13 would become MV for moderate violence & MS for modest nudity and sexual situations. Meaningless PG would become G. Then those of us who don't want to read opinionated and biased reviews picking apart a film before watching it could get an honest indication of  how much sex & violence one could expect. ( By the way, there is absolutely ZERO nudity or sexual situations in Pan's Labyrinth! I guess sickening violence is more profitable!)<br /><br />I know we don't live in enlightened times, and  present day filmmaking is a graphic indicator of this unfortunate fact of life! But I have learned a valuable lesson - Expect an "R" to mean gruesome violence except if you are doing a documentary on Global Warming!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609606131">Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill : A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence</a></p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is one of those films that you either love or hate:  its themes and vision are so strong that if you can't identify with the story or don't want a brutal journey, it will not be your bag.  This is not Disney fare, but a look into horror and the power of a child's imagination to cope with it.  The details contain such naked pain and the stark reality of human depravity, yet juxtaposed against an imaginative child's world that runs from, yet is coming to understand, it all.<br /><br />The child is taken to the home - besieged in the hills of Franquist Spain during WWII - of her step father.  He is a fascist and sociopath, with no love to give, and on a mission to crush the local resistance by any means necessary - and I mean any means.  She sees him for what he is, and as yet is as uncorrupted as her very sick mother is co-opted.  They are brought into this environment in order for the step father to witness the birth of his son, in spite of all the dangers.  The child translates this reality into a parallel fairy tale, but it is less an escape than a recognition of the full situation.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, she is called to accomplish a number of tasks to reclaim her place in a magical world.  As reviewers have noted, the juxtaposition is brilliantly executed.  Indeed, the characters from both worlds are so vivid that this may be one of the best fantasy films I have ever seen.<br /><br />The story is moving in its realism, with unbearable glimpses of physical and emotional pain, graphically displayed and extremely sad, with all the wonder that lovers of history and human potential can feel.  I was stunned and riveted  to the point of weeping.<br /><br />This is not for children, but a truly dark exploration of who we are and what we are capable of.  Recommended - it is the most vivid fantasy, anchored in an utterly un-hollywood reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>If anyone wants to know where the dark, creepy fairy tales of old went, here's a hint: Guillermo del Toro is doing a pretty good job with the fairy tales for adults.<br /><br />"Pan's Labyrinth" ("El Laberinto del Fauno") is a sequel of sorts to "The Devil's Backbone," a magical realism film about the Spanish Civil War. But this movie takes us deeper into a world that is half real, half ominous fairy tale, with a unique and imaginative story and some really excellent acting -- in short, a triumph.<br /><br />Time and place: 1944, Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her very pregnant mother travel to meet her new stepfather, the brutal and murderous Captain Vidal (Sergi L&oacute;pez). Ofelia loathes her new stepfather, but is transfixed by the eerie forests around them -- and one night she is visited by a fairy, and encounters a giant faun who tells her that she is Princess Moanna of the netherworld, and must return there.<br /><br />To do so, he tells her that she must do three things, and gives her a strange book. Ofelia menages first task, but is frightened out of her wits by the second task, which involves a hideous monster with eyes in its hands. Even worse, her mother's pregnancy is getting more dangerous. As the guerillas and the fascists clash, Ofelia faces being trapped outside the netherworld forever...<br /><br />Fairy tales have become cleaned-up and cutesy over time, so that children can read them without nightmares. But del Toro knows that the best fairy tales are the eerie, bizarre ones for adults, that are connected somehow to the real world. That is what makes "Pan's Labyrinth" so brilliantly dark and heartfelt.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously crafted this with care, directing it in a dreamlike style and brilliant visuals. The eerie atmosphere of Ofelia's wanderings -- the delicate yet menacing faun, the chalk doors, the monuments, and the pasty nightmare with eyes in its palms -- is both a contrast and a parallel with the everyday world, which Ofelia hopes to escape.<br /><br />At first, it seems like the post-Civil War and fairy tale stories don't mesh, until you see that the "real world" story is Ofelia's motivation to escape from all the fear, pain and sorrow. But Del Toro's biggest triumph is an ending that is beautifully bittersweet, and which turns out to hinge on Ofelia's newborn brother.<br /><br />But del Toro's biggest triumph is in the instant connection we feel to Ofelia, with her love of the fantastical and her desire to go somewhere "safe." Baquero is absolutely wonderful in this, as a girl who isn't entirely of this world -- in her heart, she belongs somewhere beyond. And L&oacute;pez is the ideal villain -- you spend the whole movie wanting to see him gruesomely killed.<br /><br />Half "Mirrormask" and half gritty war story, "Pan's Labyrinth" is one of the best fantasy stories in years -- dark, passionate and beautifully made.

In my 40 years of movie-going, few films have ever managed to dig themselves deep into my subconscious, let alone stay there for months.  This is one of those inspired movies that will be acclaimed a classic by generations to come.  Unlike last year's uber-movies (The Departed, Dreamgirls) or sweet-n-sappy-love-fests (Little Miss Sunshine), Pan's Labyrinth is a mystical tour-de-force that combines pure escapism with raw emotional intensity to create an indelible story of loss and redemption.  Ivana Baquero deserved an Academy Award nomination for her amazing and inspired performance, and the film certainly deserved the Oscar as Foreign Language Film - it was do good, I dare say even Scorcese should have lost the award to the non-nominee Del Toro, and it stands heads and shoulders above "The Departed" as a pure movie experience you will never forget.  See it in a theater for maximum impact; and if you dare to buy the dvd, be prepared for PAN to become one of your finest movie watching experiences ever.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>This is a beautifully photographed film with outstanding technical support, but this is not a film for the young or sensitive adults for that matter.  There are other films that are more violent than this one but the violence here stands out, because like the film Psycho, the violence is extreme and unexpected, which lends major shock value to it. I cannot emphasize this enough, because the violence is both shocking and difficult to watch.<br /><br />The film is two parallel story lines that intersect only at the end of the film. Captain Vidal reflects the legendary pride of the upper class Spaniard.  He views all others as essentially inhuman and acts accordingly.  Even he acknowledges his weakness is pride but that pride has poisoned him leaving him devoid of humanity.  Ofelia (a good symbolic name), the young girl is offered as a counterpoint to the Captain.  While the Captain lives in a brutal world of reality Ofelia lives in a world of escapism.  However, her fantasy world is not a pleasant place but is more like the original Grimm Fairy Tales, filled with violence and threatening characters.  The faun (Pan) she encounters in the labyrinth (of her mind) is very complex and whose motives are never overly clear.  Ofelia doesn't like the Captain and fears him but she doesn't trust the Faun and is uncertain if he is acting in her best interest or not.  She disobeys her mother and the Captain, just as she disobeys the Faun, which illustrates the parallelism.  Ultimately she defies the Captain and the Faun, which leads to the ultimate destruction of them all.  But the actual instrument of that destruction is the Captains pride.  He neglects his duty through his drive for a son, he destroys his wife through his pride, he destroys everything through his pride.  The Gods raise up those whom they wish to destroy.<br /><br />Did I enjoy this film?  I'm not sure. It is a riveting film and compels your interest even at it's most violent.  It certainly is a film that requires some thought once you have seen it.  It is beautifully photographed with an excellent albeit somewhat flawed screen play. It is filled with symbolisms and we know almost from the outset (the Captains watch) that time is running out for the Captain.  The acting is superb, but did I enjoy it?  I really don't know - - yet.  I do know that I only saw Psycho once and never saw it again -- even though it was an excellent movie.  I suspect this film will be like that as well.  If you like films and see them as an art form, this is one to see, if you think of films simply as entertainment, you may want to skip this one because it requires thought and reflection to fully understand.</p></br></body></html>

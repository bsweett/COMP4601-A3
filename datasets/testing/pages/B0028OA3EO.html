But this belated movie is actually more of a sequel to the first two Superman films, the second released a quarter century ago in 1981.<br /><br />Director Richard Donner, novelist Mario Puzo, and uncredited screenwriter Tom Manckiewicz (listed as "creative consultant" in credits) conceived the initial outing, Superman: The Movie (1978), as a legendary epic of almost Shakespearian dimensions, a saga pitting good versus evil. Unfortunately, their lofty vision was not shared by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Uncomfortable with a serious treatment of the Superman story, they brought in the husband/wife screenwriting team David and Leslie Newman to make the script more "campy," &agrave; la the 1960s "Batman" TV series.<br /><br />As a result of creative differences, and the Salkinds' refusal to pay Marlon Brando's steep royalties, Donner was replaced with director Richard Lester on the next installment, Superman II, and much of Donner's original footage was left on the proverbial cutting room floor. Fortunately, cinematic history has been kind to Richard Donner. On November 28, Warner Home Video finally releases his authorized version of Superman II, not only restoring scenes with Brando back into the film, but also restoring Donner to his rightful place as director.<br /><br />To understand the downward spiral of the Superman franchise, consider 1983's Superman III, written solely by the Newmans and directed by Lester. An appalling collection of poorly timed slapstick gags, it has earned the dubious distinction of being the only movie in which comedian Richard Pryor can't buy a laugh. Superman IV in 1987 was even more unwatchable, suffering from bargain-basement production values and a PC script that reduced Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic superhero to a "No Nukes," Bleeding-Heart of Steel.<br /><br />Now, years after lesser filmmakers left the Man of Steel in rust, director Bryan Singer finally restores the untarnished, larger-than-life superhero to his pedestal.<br /><br />Comparisons between Superman Returns and Superman: The Movie are inevitable, especially because Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris consciously planned this film to have the same look, feel, and sound of the original. The most obvious similarity is in casting relative newcomer Brandon Routh in the role of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. Routh bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Christopher Reeve; indeed, he looks as though he could be Reeve's younger brother.<br /><br />Superman Returns builds upon the plot of the first Reeve movie, and part of the second. To explain Superman's absence from the screen during the past nineteen years, Singer brings him back to Earth after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which time he trekked among the stars searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton.<br /><br />The movie opens with an amazing special-effects sequence as Superman's spaceborne ship hurtles through the galaxies back to Earth, returning to his family farm outside Smallville, USA. Voiceover monologue from his father, Jor-El--taken from Marlon Brando's unused footage for Superman II--sets the tone for the drama that follows. "Because of their [Earthlings'] capacity for good, I send them you, my only son." Using Christ-like visual imagery, Superman is cast as Earth's savior, rescuing the planet time and again from those who wield the capacity for evil.<br /><br />After a brief reunion with earthly mother Martha Kent, played by Eva Marie Saint, Superman reclaims his alter ego, Clark Kent, and his job in Metropolis as reporter for the Daily Planet. Things haven't changed much at the paper, except that cell phones have replaced desk sets and typewriters have been retired in favor of personal computers. Otherwise, editor Perry White (Frank Langella) is just as gruff as ever. Shutterbug Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is still the same earnest greenhorn, and the only reporter in the MSM, aside from Tucker Carlson, still sporting a tacky bow tie.<br /><br />But one important thing has changed. When Superman left on his intergalactic quest for his roots, former lover Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the Planet's ace reporter, believed she'd been ditched. Feeling betrayed, Lois won a Pulitzer Prize for an article, "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman." "The world doesn't need a savior," she tells Clark, "and neither do I." He is devastated to learn that, on the rebound, she has given her heart to Richard White (James Marsden), the boss's nephew. What's worse, Lois and Richard now have a son, Jason.<br /><br />Meanwhile, having discovered Superman's secret hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude, arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) launches a diabolical scheme using crystals laced with Kryptonite--the radioactive remains of Superman's planet that render him powerless. Placed in the Atlantic Ocean, the crystals multiply, creating a huge, artificial island that displaces enough ocean water to threaten much of North America with flooding. It's an ecological disaster right out of Al Gore's most fanciful nightmares, one that will force millions to turn to Luthor if they want to stay dry. Cha-ching!<br /><br />Brandon Routh more than fills Chris Reeve's boots, and also those of George Reeves, the square-jawed actor who portrayed Superman in serial movies and on television during the 1950s. Like Reeve, Routh convincingly projects the superheroic qualities of Herculean strength and speed, as well as honor, chivalry, and courage. However, this loner-hero is cast in a more human, vulnerable light, though without ever mocking his dignity and heroic stature. This is a nobler Superman: all the annoying touches that in previous movies were meant to undermine the character are absent here.<br /><br />Every superhero needs a supervillain in order to bring out his best virtues, and the movie delivers by casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Although Gene Hackman is a great actor, he underplayed in the Luthor role a generation ago, almost to the point of nonchalance. Part of his failure to portray a true supervillain was due to his goofy wardrobe and even goofier sidekick (Ned Beatty). The sheer silliness undercut his credibility as a viable threat to Superman.<br /><br />By contrast, Spacey's Luthor is a plausible adversary for the Man of Steel. "Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their powers with anyone else," Luthor snarls. Spacey's characterization conveys that, for little men with big ambitions, envy of the good can be the most corrupting motive. When I first saw Spacey in American Beauty (1999), his smarminess as anti-hero Lester Burnham really rubbed me the wrong way. But after seeing him as Jack Lemmon's duplicitous boss in Glengarry Glen Ross and as the deliciously sociopathic Luthor here, I find him uniquely suited to playing cads and villains--not unlike George Sanders (Rebecca, All About Eve) a couple generations ago.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is somewhat less successful as Lois Lane. Undoubtedly a better actress than the previous Lois (Margot Kidder), Bosworth's waifish looks and spiral curls aren't what come to mind when you think of the spunky journalist from the DC comic books. A stronger, more alluring actress, such as Hilary Swank, would have been perfect to play the female lead in Superman's life.<br /><br />All in all, however, Superman Returns is a widescreen extravaganza with something for everyone.<br /><br />For the guys, it has street cred as an action flick, with its shoot-'em-up pyrotechnics and computer-generated images. These are truly spectacular, because they don't look so much like special effects as like natural camerawork. In fact, this film comes off as even more realistic than another visually impressive superhero flick, Spiderman II.<br /><br />For the women in the audience, the movie offers a heart-rending story of unrequited love, though hinting at the possible reconciliation of the (literally) star-crossed lovers in the next film in the franchise, planned for release in 2009.<br /><br />For fans of John Williams's soaring score in the 1978 film, there is composer John Ottman's skillful weaving of Williams's brassy fanfare into the new soundtrack, and conductor Damon Intrabartolo's lush interpretation.<br /><br />For older movie buffs, Superman Returns also boasts the first reunion (in dialogue, thanks to the sound editors) of the late Marlon Brando and actress Eva Marie Saint since they appeared as working-class lovers in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, On the Waterfront.<br /><br />And for the kids, the picture provides not just grand entertainment but also some wonderful lessons. Its themes of gallantry, honor, and bravery will cause even many adults to revert to the child's uncorrupted and innocent point of view. In fact, when we saw this movie at an advance critics' screening--in midtown Manhattan, no less--that was exactly how that normally blas&eacute; audience reacted.<br /><br />If a bunch of aging, cynical critics can "Wow!" aloud at the implausible actions of their childhood hero, boo and jeer at the soulless villain, and rise to a raucous standing ovation at the end, then Superman Returns may just be the savior that Hollywood has needed during all the years that he's been gone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.<br /><br />The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.<br /><br />The Plot, in Short:<br />Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.<br /><br />Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.<br /><br />Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.<br /><br />However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as "love to hate." It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series "Smallville," and not the traditional Superman I remember.<br /><br />Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.<br /><br />Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for "Why the World No Longer Needs Superman." She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.<br /><br />Perry White isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.<br /><br />A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Superman Returns."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Being shelved, fought over, re-written and passed on by three CEOs, over 20 producers and countless writers, the wait was finally over when Brian Singer decided to take the reins on rebooting the Superman franchise.  The only person to survive the whole process was Jon `former hairstylist to Barbara Streisand-the movie must have a giant spider' Peters, whose heavy handed and outlandish approach to the character was probably one of the main reasons the movie never got made in the 90s.  Look him up, check out Kevin Smith's `An Evening With...' and you'll understand what I mean.  He represents the worst of Hollywood's worst producers who think they know what people want in doing massive re-imaging of classic characters.  He would make remake John Wayne into a Lawyer and Marilyn Monroe into `Barb Wire' if he had his way.<br /><br />But I digress.  His name is most likely on this movie simply because he has been involved from the beginning.  Thankfully Brian Singer, who proved his worth with the first two X-Men films, brings high end quality to the film and the story.<br /><br />Five years have past since the story of Superman 2 (Superman 3 & 4 thankfully have been graciously and shamelessly ignored/forgotten) and the Man of Steel returns to Earth after searching for remains of his home world.  At his return he find things have moved forward without him.  Not all in a good way either.  He finds the world has changed quite a bit, most due to 9/11 as he flips through channels and sees the news reports.  He also finds that Lois has moved on, having a child and a fianc&eacute;.  This lends to a great human element of Superman; did he ever think about how the people of Earth would move on while he was gone?  Did it occur to him that Lois wouldn't wait forever?  The humanistic aspect of this discovery lends to good dramatic elements.  Superman doesn't give up so easily on Lois and she obviously still harbors feelings for him.  Although she's deeply ticked at him for leaving without saying goodbye, so she keeps her distance.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Lex Luthor is released from prison, ironically because of Superman not showing up for the Appeals hearing.  He immediately begins planning his next scheme.  Kevin Spacey is on the money as Lex, giving an efficient performance.  Lex is determined to be the mastermind he is and he doesn't waste time talking about out loud or gloating when he could be furthering his goals.  He is intelligent, vicious and surprisingly likable.<br /><br />To further comment on the casting, I have to say I have mixed feeling about Brandon Routh.  Generally I think he's excellent.  He plays both sides of the character as well as Christopher Reeve did.  As Clark Kent his goofy antics to cover suspicion are actually even more subtle and more endearing.  As Superman, he's a little less convincing.  He doesn't have the presence that Christopher Reeve did, but you want so much to believe he is Superman that any doubts you have are just washed away with his likeability.  His Midwestern values ooze from his persona, just like Reeve.  The few doubts I have may be there only because that was the Superman I grew up with.  Newcomers won't make those comparisons.  Even so, no one can deny that Reeve had a greater physical presence and his eyes had a piercing quality that just can't be duplicated.  I was more impressed with Kate Bosworth.  Going in, I knew nothing about her, but once I first saw her on the screen I wasn't impressed.  But as the movie went on, I realized she had the grit and venom spitting down.  She was a tough woman reporter who had been scorned, and despite her finding love again with someone else, the moment Superman shows up, she kicks up the venom spewing a notch.  By the end, you're opinions of her have changed, but she really hasn't.  She (Lois) is still a bit bitchy and not totally over the whole being scorned thing.  However, Kate is a bit young to have gone through everything they talked about AND have a kid AND be as world weary as she is.  These are all just nit picks though, I still enjoyed watching them both.  Routh and Bosworth have good chemistry, which is important considering the chemistry between Reeve and Margot Kidder was so great.<br /><br />The plot line is not too far off from the first, but still original.  There is no doubt that so many aspects of the movie are an homage to the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve films made over twenty five years ago.  Singer throws in just enough of the back story of those films to continue on here.  Composer John Ottman certainly ignores his own pride and integrates the popular John Williams theme into his own score, stitching together the past movies with this one even more.<br /><br />The action scenes are great in this one although I would have loved to have seen more super-feats (rescues, stopping criminals, etc.), there was an entire montage of those in the first movie and with so many similarities why not do that too.  There is a great shot that is a tribute to Action Comics #1 where he is putting the car on the ground.  Fans will see it.  Overall it was an incredible movie with great heart and soul being used to revive one of the worlds greatest heroes.  Welcome back Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Look, up in the sky!  It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's... well you know the rest.  As most people have no doubt heard, this year was the year that the hero who sets the standard for other heroes, the man known as 'The Last Son of Krypton', returned to theaters after an almost 20 year absence.  After allowing the franchise to die at the hands of "Superman 4: The Quest For Peace" (a movie that has long been rumored to have suffered due to too much studio tampering), Warner Brothers decided the moment was finally right to bring the Man of Steel back from his Hollywood grave.  For almost a decade the WB tried very hard to get a new Superman movie off the ground, using various writers, directors, and actors, ranging from Tim Burton and Brett Ratner as directors to Nicolas Cage and Brendan Fraser as stars, and even Kevin Smith as a writer at one point.  Finally, Warner Brothers enticed director Bryan Singer (director of "X-Men" and "X2: X-Men United") to leave the series he started at Fox only months before preparing to work on the final chapter in his 'X-Men' trilogy, and join them on bringing Superman back to the big screen in a way befitting the greatest superhero of all time.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" begins with a recently parolled Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) swindling a rich, old woman out of her fortune just before she dies, in hopes of using her money and resources to accomplish his greatest scheme ever, to use Kryptonian technology to take over the world, reshaping it any way he pleases.  How does Lex plan on succeeding with his mission of world domination with Superman being able to stop him.  Well, Superman (Brandon Routh) has been on a self-imposed exile to discover if Krypton may still exist somewhere in space, but after 5 years of searching he finally returns to Earth with the knowledge that he is indeed the last surviving member of the long dead planet.  However, upon Superman's return to Earth, he finds that his adopted planet has moved on, and figured out how to survive without him, including Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).  Now Superman must come to grips with the fact that the people he cared about have moved on, and hope that he can be welcomed back into their lives as both Clark Kent and Superman.  Of course, if he is to be accepted on Earth again, there has to be an Earth to live on, so now Superman must find a way to stop Lex and advanced technology from his own world, before all hope is lost.<br /><br />After a nearly 20 year absence from the movie screen, was Bryan Singer's epic adventure worth the wait?  In a word, absolutely!  Bryan Singer and his writers Mike Daugherty and Dan Harris (writers of "X2: X-Men United") have brilliantly captured the spirit of Superman and continued on with the stories started in the previous 4 movies.  Although, if viewed in the proper context as intended by Singer, "Superman Returns" actually falls after "Superman 2", which is why many references are made to events from the first 2 movies via Jor-El (using Marlon Brando footage shot for "Superman" and "Superman 2") voiceovers.  In my opinion you can view this new installment after the fourth film that way you can fully enjoy the entire 'Superman' saga as originally intended.  The casting for "Superman Returns" is excellent all across the board.  Relative newcomer Brandon Routh does an excellent job of bringing Superman/Clark Kent to life, evoking the many emotions our hero goes through as he tries to redefine his place in our world.  The supporting actors each make their characters their own by taking what had previously been done with the characters throughout all their different incarnations and tweaking them for the modern day.  Kevin Spacey truly shines as Lex Luthor, though I enjoyed Gene Hackman's Lex, I feel that Kevin did a much better job of bringing the evil and duplicitous nature of Lex to life, while still holding on to some of his dark wit.  Kevin's wit actually resembles Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal on the hit TV show, "Smallville".  Kate Bosworth is perfect as Lois Lane, providing a much better interpretation of the character than Margot Kidder did in the Christopher Reeve movies, plus Kate is much easier on the eyes than Kidder ever was.  The rest of the cast with lesser parts were equally impressive from James Marsden's portrayal of Richard White, to Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen, and Frank Langella as Perry White, every actor truly shines in this movie.  The special effects for this movie are truly top-notch, the scenes with Superman flying are so incredible and awe-inspiring that you truly, honestly believe that you are actually witnessing a man flying.  The excellence that this movie achieves is so vast, that I truly could go on and on about what I think of this film, but I'll spare you having to sit here reading that, so bear with me for just one more moment as I sum up this movie.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" brings the Man of Steel back to life in such a magnificent way that you leave the theater wishing there were truly heroes like him in this world and wanting to see more of Earth's greatest protector in action.  If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly recommend that you rush out and rent it the moment it hits DVD shelves.  Before viewing this movie you may want to give yourself a refresher course on what has occurred in the previous 4 movies, or at least the first 2.  So, with all that being said, sit back, relax, and remember what it's like to believe that a man can fly.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A26A64X86VL1R4.html">A26A64X86VL1R4</a><br/><p>Superman is, indeed, always around in different forms.  Some of us who loved the Christopher Reeves' Superman expressed reservations about this latest version.  There is no need to be concerned.  Brandon Routh takes a few scenes to get used to but ultimately was quite good and fits well into the mythic pantheon of Superman.  He is a young Superman and though very handsome his appearance is not perfect.  In some shots his nose looks a bit large for his face and his eyebrows distractingly thick; from other angles he has the perfect profile.  This does not detract from his screen presence, quite the reverse; it created an interesting tension as to how he would appear next.<br /><br />The story is well-crafted and provides the right touches at the right times.  Superman has never been quite so human; he is clearly moved and tears come to his eyes at a key moment in the story.  His devotion to humanity is conveyed by his gentle touch--he very tenderly and slowly sets rescued victims down, commences to fly softly without excess noise and fuss.  This makes his feats of speed and strength by contrast even more astonishing.  A wonderful moment is when a villain shoots him in the eye and we are shown a close-up of the bullet flattening on his retina--a special effect applauded with glee in the movie theatre.<br /><br />Superman is a superhero of contrasts--he has several moments where he uses all his strength and needs human aid but quickly recovers.  Yet he can be stern.  When he pursues a particular villain he cracks the earth when he touches down.  His flying scene with Lois Lane, while manifestly erotic, does not overplay the moment leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />Casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is a masterly touch.  While it seems like Spacey plays this role with consummate ease, he nevertheless provides the right touch of supercilious villainy to keeps the role from being a caricature.  Kate Bosworth as Lois is fine, she neither captivates nor annoys and there is reasonably good chemistry between her and Superman.  Eva Marie Saint provides a charismatic Martha, unfortunately we don't see enough of her.<br /><br />In sum, all you can expect from a good summer movie--action, suspense, romance and a surprise ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I saw this in IMAX on Canada day (in 3D) it was totally f|_|[king awesome!

Bryan Singer, best known for his direction of the box office hits, X-Men 1 & 2, gives the viewers a movie that honors the beloved American icon and wisely ignores the two sequels that pretty much killed off the Superman franchise.<br /><br />The plot begins 5 years after the ending of the second Superman  movie.  Superman, having gone off to find his home world, Krypton and finding nothing, returns to Earth to find Lois moving on with her life, now a mother and a Putlizer prize winner, not to mention the fiancee of Richard White, nephew of Daily Globe editor, Perry White.  While gone, Lex Luthor, Superman's nemesis has been released from prison, bamboozled a rich old lady out of her money and set into action a wicked plan that will doom billions of people.  The storyline places Superman face to face with Luthor as well as placing him as the guardian of Metropolis and the world.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is a perfect selection for Clark Kent/Superman.  With his clean cut good looks and charming smile, he easily fills the red boots vacated by Christopher Reeve, to whom along with his wife, Dana, the movie is dedicated.  There are times when Routh looks uncannily like his predecessor.  He is perfect for the role and I look forward to seeing him in the inevitable sequels.  Kate Bosworth is also good as Lois Lane.  I wasn't impressed with the casting of Ms. Bosworth as Lois when I first heard, but I think she gave a nice performance.  My biggest disappointment, is with the casting that I most looked forward to-----Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.  I guess I just expected more.  He didn't seem to fully throw himself into the role and Parker Posey as his moll, Kitty, stole all of her scenes with him.  And one other trivial comment---someone give Lois' son, Jason, a haircut, please!  He looks like they pulled him out of a cave, where he was raised by wolves!!<br /><br />The special effects are impressive.  The whole sequence with the airplane is worth the ticket price alone but there are other great action sequences in the film.  The flying effects are so much more advanced from the other films and it really looks so much more convincing.  One of my favorite scenes, which I think is quite romantic, is when Superman first confronts Lois about his disappearance, taking her for a ride above the clouds where he offers a simple but heart-felt apology.  Bryan Singer apparently loves these type of films and puts a lot of heart and effort into them.  I hope that he will direct the sequel before he flies off to another project!<br /><br />This movie has a lot to live up to and must certainly justify its pricey film budget.  While it wasn't as perfect as Spiderman 2, this is a great superhero film and a must see on the silver screen.  I gave the film 5 stars because of Brandon Routh, the special effects and the direction of Bryan Singer.  If I could have, I would have taken a half a star for Spacey's lack luster performance.  Otherwise, this is a near perfect superhero movie.<br /><br />If you are looking for action-packed summer entertainment, this is it.  Grab your popcorn, sit back, and become a kid again...wishing you could fly too!</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I waited a while to see this film because I was just not sold on Routh as the man of steel, but after seeing the movie, I think he was a good choice, eventhough it was a bit creepy to see him mimic Christopher Reeve, it was almost like caracature.  Kevin Spacey was fantastic, though i was taken aback at how dark they made Lex, I mean to have him actually Murder Superman was shocking and the way it was done was so cold and raw, but he did channel Hackman with some of his humor.  It was a gorgeous film to watch, the cinematography was stunning.  If  you have any interest in Superman or enjoyed the Superman of Christopher Reeve, then i dont think you'll be disappointed in this film, but be forwarned it can be dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>Brandon Routh does present a good Superman even in light of those that think Superman should be witty & charismatic, even funny. That is the main problem with this world, Superman should be Captain Marvel, Dick Van Dyke, Hamlet, and Orson Wells all wrapped into one for our amusement and entertainment into believing there really is a Superman. That is the problem with legends throughout history, they are just people with extraordinary circumstances. They are not stand up comedians or grand philosophers. Superman is the last son of Krypton. He's at a point of struggling to find himself as well as be himself, a not so easy journey even for a man of steel. He is really an ordinary person with out of this world superpowers, and that's what makes him a Superman, not his lighter than air quips or fast talk, or gift for gab. That is why Brandon makes a fine Superman, not only does he look good, but he is a simple down to earth level headed soul. Just the right touch from Mr. Rough who leaves the stereotypical macho schmuck behind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>WOW! With Batman Begins and Superman Returns both coming out within a year of each other, we have two epic DC Comics franchises that will carry on for years to come. Brandon Routh was very convincing as the man of steel and Kate Bosworth played a lovely Lois Lane. Of course Kevin Spacey stole the show as Lex Luthor, while Parker Posey was a riot as his sidekick. With a budget around 250 million you would expect the CGI to be amazing and yeah, it really was. I had a feeling this film would follow in the tradition of the 1978 film as soon as I heard the iconic theme and saw the blue cast credits flying overhead. What a great summer film. Now bring on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest!</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>To me, what truly bogs this film down is bad casting, particularly Lois Lane, the pacing and the lack of originality. While Brandon Routh (who is a dead ringer for Christopher Reeve) acts very well for his role, he doesn't seem to command screen presence like Reeve (ironically the first Superman being his first big feature). Kevin Spacey uses more dry humor and has a lethal threat to him when compared to Gene Hackman. My only wish for these Superman films is STOP USING LEX LUTHOR! It's not like he's got plenty of other villains to go up against (Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Silver Banshee, Mongul, Doomsday, etc.) And since they did use Luthor, again, couldn't they've turned him into the twisted business man instead of him just going after land? Again. Frank Langella does a good job with Perry White, even throwing a reference to the old TV series. Sam Huntington is bland as Jimmy Olsen (a character I don't really like anyway, he gets on my nerves too easily). James Marsden's character was a nice twist so that way Lois isn't always pining after Superman, but the guy must not be very confident in Lois' affections towards him as every time the hero's name is mentioned, he gets into some whiney attitude. Eva Marie-Saint, Jack Larson and Noel Neil (Jimmy and Lois, respectively, from the original series) cameo as well. Bosworth was a complete mistake as a Lois. I don't know if its the way they chose to go with the character or not, but she HATES Superman, almost downright dispises him. I know the guy left without saying goodbye and that can feel hurtful but to go on and write an aricle about how the world doesn't need Superman when, before he left anyway, he was always constantly saving her skin, doesn't put her in a good light. And she looks way too young for the role. When I saw Margot Kidder, I didn't see an actor, I saw Lois Lane. The other aspect I hated was the allusion that Jason is Superman's son (alluding to Supes and Lois' one night stand back in Superman II). It seems too contrived and it feels like a forced plot point. The pacing is slow, especially once Luthor's Kryptonite landmass is formed. For an action movie, the third act, which is supposed to be the climax, just feels like an extension of the second act. The effects are good but the heat vision you can just barely see and some shots of Routh flying (I suppose when its actually him) looks like he's CGI. The story feels unoriginal. I know Singer meant it as a tribute to the first two (more so the first) but Superman reiterating the line about airplanes, using Marlon Brando, Luthor's obsession with land and the romantic flying sequence just feel like they were ripping those moments off. Now, subtle references/moments which work better for me are Kitty asking if Luthor's been in the Fortress before, saving a plane and Lois' first interview with Superman. John Ottman does a fine job adapting Williams' classic themes while doing a great job with his own material (and editing the movie as well).</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>After 20 years, The Man Of Steel is back...with a new face. From the director & writer of "The Usual Suspects" (an engrossing suspense thriller with a wicked twist of an ending) comes the "Sequel" to<br />"Superman II." Disregarding the abysmal "Superman III" & "Superman IV" (despite a terrific performance from Christopher Reeve; stupid script & horrible direction), this film is a sequel & homage to the films made in 1978 & 1980. Brandon Routh makes an interesting Clark Kent/Superman, but he fell flat when he said the lines spoken by Christopher Reeve in the original. I enjoyed the subplot with Lois Lane and her son. Really good. I'm looking forward to the sequel. Rated PG for action violence.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Two things to start off: First, I think this film deserves three and a half stars as opposed to 3, but Amazon doesn't allow half-star ratings, and I feel that it is closer to a three than a four.  Second, this is the only Superman movie that I have seen the complete film the whole way through.  I have seen the beginning and ending of Superman II as well as a scene from the original Superman, but that is it.<br /><br />Anyway, Superman Returns serves as a sequel to the first two Superman films, effectively erasing the canonicity of the third and fourth films (which is probably a good thing).  After astronomers claimed that they found the location of Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) felt that he needed to see the remains of his home for himself and left Earth for 5 years.  In that time, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from jail, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has found a new lover, won a Pulitzer for an article called "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", and even had a son.<br /><br />Upon his return to Earth, Superman finds that he has been missed by the public as well as by Lois, despite what she has said.  Immediately he is off saving people again, while his alter ego Clark Kent gets his job back at the Daily Planet.  He is upset that Lois is now engaged to Richard White (James Mardsen), the nephew of the Planet's editor Perry White (Frank Langella), but he that pales in comparison to the revelation that Lois is now a mother.  The kid, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), is one of the film's low points, as his point in the plot is only to cause Clark angst and then (mild spoiler warning) help Lois out of some trouble.<br /><br />Luthor's overall scheme once again has to do with real estate, but it doesn't seem as maniacal as the one he used in the first film (despite not seeing it, I know what his plan was).  It's true that he would once again cause numerous deaths and would amass a lot of power, I just couldn't buy into it.<br /><br />Overall, the movie had some very strong points and some very weak points.  Some of the strong points included the effects as well as some of the scenes of Superman's exploits that didn't have to do with Luthor's plot.  However, some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy ("I forgot how warm you are!"), Routh lacks the charisma to effectively portray Superman, Bosworth doesn't appear to have any chemistry with any of the men in her life (that includes Supes, Richard, and Jason), and, as earlier stated, the threat just doesn't seem to be as menacing as Luthor makes it out to be.  Furthermore, I found a few inconsistencies towards the end that have to do with Superman's reaction to kryptonite, but I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't say what they are.<br /><br />Maybe I just set myself up too much for this film.  I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, and not just his work on his other superhero films.  While his two X-Men films are good (X2 is superb in my opinion), The Usual Suspects (also starring Kevin Spacey) is cinematic bliss, and House, which he executive produces, is a great medical drama.  Yet I was underwhelmed by this film, and I feel part of the reason is that Singer tried so hard to call back to the previous Superman films that he didn't infuse enough his his own vision into this one.<br /><br />It's too bad; this was shaping up to be the must-see film of the summer, but I (along with a sizable number of critics) left the theater feeling that that title will now go to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Let me start off by saying that the first two Chris Reeve films were the first movies I ever saw as a little boy. They changed me. Superman and the films sculpted my entire childhood. 19 years later, we get to witness his return. And what a wonderful return. By now, you probably already know the details of the film. Superman comes back after 5 years, Lois Lane has moved on and has a kid and a fiancee, and Lex Luthor is plotting a new real estate scheme involving Superman. But really, how is the film itself?. Folks, I had a great time with this movie. It's big, it's breathtaking, and makes you happy. Superman is back, and we couldn't be happier. Brandon Routh is wonderful. I saw Chris Reeve in him early on, but it doesn't last long. He becomes Clark/Superman and makes it his own. Spacey is wonderful as Luthor. There is some humor there, but this is not Gene Hackman or Michael Rosenbaum. This Lex is nastier and deadlier. Bosworth does well, is beautiful, but doesn't have much beyond being hurt over Superman's disappearance and being the damsel in distress. Story wise, it's out there(at least the Lex part, but does one come to these films for intricate plots?. John Williams' theme and other familiar Superman scores pop up, and they really take you back and make this film soar. The effects are not only astonishing and visually stunning, but some are just breathtaking. The look of the film is beautiful and so well detailed and planned out. The movie is just superb looking. Some complain the film is too long, light on action, and moves slow. The movie is long, but this shouldn't be a problem to anyone. Light on action?. If you call the chilling and mesmerizing airplane sequence, roof top gun fire, earthquake, water rescue, and more and more light on action. Folks, this movie isn't light on anything. There are a number of homages to Richard Donner's film, and they will bring smiles to any true Superman fan. How about Lois' kid?. The boy is great. Just a normal boy who isn't forced to be cute or whatnot. A great kid and a great kid actor. There are a number of memorable moments here that aren't soon to be forgotten. The airplane sequence is incredible and the best sequence in any Superman movie. I could go on. Do I have complaints?. Very, very minor ones. I would've liked more scenes that were cut in Smallville(James Karen must be ticked)back in, and the last half seemed kind of dark. Like it was a "Batman" film or something. Basically, my gripes are meaningless to the greatness of the film. The movie is dedicated to the memory of Chris and Dana Reeve. Sadly, this comes after the end credits when it should of come before, when more people would see it. Noel Neill and Jack Larson are along for the ride as well. And what a ride. Superman Returns is filled with wonderful humor, real, genuine heart and emotion, wonderful set pieces and score and imagery. This is one summer blockbuster that justifies the term. Go see it, and await anxiously for Superman's next big return.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>For more than 60 years he has been the most popular superhero of all time and now he's returned to movie screens in Bryan Singer's action packed and emotionally terrific triumph "Superman Returns" no question the best Superman movie yet, Brandon Routh is a recarnation of Christopher Reeve, Kevin Spacey outdoes Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Kate Bosworth gives a terrific new approach to Lois Lane. Spetacular and fantastic, a triumph, one of the best summer movies no doubt, a brilliantly riveting motion picture event that pays homage to the Richard Donner films, Terrific Entertainment, this is a must see event, go look up at the movie screen "SUPERMAN RETURNS" and I hope he returns again. "I see an old man's sick joke"</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>The "Superman" movie franchise got off to a great start in 1978, with Richard Donner's original, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role, and co-starring Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Margot Kidder. When "Superman II" rolled around, it hit rough waters. Production problems, combined with an end result that felt a little mixed, made for a good sequel, but trouble was apparently on the way. Following it up, were two films that put the nail in the coffin of the franchise for two decades, "Superman III" and "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace." These films are best forgotten, and such is the premise of "Superman Returns."<br /><br />Taking flight as a direct sequel to the original, with very loose ties to the second movie, "Superman Returns" is basically an attempt to make up for lost time and to finally show the world that Superman is truly an icon, not just some guy in a spandex costume, floating behind a blue-screen. Newcomer Brandon Routh replaces the late-Christopher Reeve, and does a splendid job. Routh is dead on in his portrayal as both Superman and Clark Kent (my only regret is that there wasn't much Kent to be found in this movie). The brilliant Kevin Spacey does Lex Luthor sweet, sweet justice, and not to do degrade Hackman's prior performances, but Spacey serves up the most threatening and diabolical version of the character. Behind the direction of Bryan Singer, who helped bring the "X-Men" franchise to the surface, "Superman Returns" is a success by nearly all accounts. Despite it's flaws, such as a mis-cast Lois Lane in Kate Bosworth, and a somewhat predictable plot, this film is easily the most action packed and enjoyable blockbuster of the year, and truly revitalizes Superman.<br /><br />It's sad that it took the success of another Warner property, the outstanding "Batman Begins," last year to get this movie, (which had spent years in development Hell), up and off the ground, but alas, Superman has been reintroduced into the public eye, and in a big way. The best part about this movie is that not only is it true to the source material, and to the film(s) that precede it, but it's also a film that wasn't tailor made just to please the Superman faithful. "Superman Returns" is a film that everyone and anyone can find enjoyment in.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>I liked this one a lot better than the original movies.  Unlike those movies that were too campy, this movie is a lot more serious.<br /><br />Clark Kent has a real personality.  He is not the bungling nerd portrayed in those earlier films.  He actually has a bigger role in this movie than Superman.  Kate Bosworth is a much better Lois Lane than Margot Kidder and Kevin Spacey is perfect as a much more ruthless Lex Luthor.  This movie seems to revitalize the Superman series the same way as Batman Begins has done for Batman.<br /><br />In this one, Superman is caught up in a triangle with Lois, her son and her "fianc&eacute;e" whom her son refers to as "Dad."  The fianc&eacute;e happens to work at the Daily Planet and becomes fast friends with Clark.  Not to give anything away but besides Superman saving Lois and her fianc&eacute;e, Lois and the fianc&eacute;e have to save Superman.<br /><br />There is a real touching moment when Lois' son draws a picture of Superman holding onto the fianc&eacute;e, who is holding onto Lois and the son.  When Superman first left Earth, Lois was upset that he left without saying goodbye so she wrote an article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman," for which she wins the Pulitzer.  All during the movie she tries to distance herself from anything about Superman, preferring to cover a large blackout story instead.  Of course, by the end of the movie she will end up writing "Why the World Needs Superman."<br /><br />Nice cameo by Jack Larson as a bartender that shoots the breeze with the new Jimmy Olsen.  Frank Langella is also excellent as Perry White.<br /><br />Forget all the flaws and the negative reviews.  This one delivers!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D3XQC2DIT.html">A1D3XQC2DIT</a><br/><p>Adrenaline. If I had to pick a one-word theme for the movie, that would be it. Edge or your seat, heart-pounding adrenaline. If you have watched the preview for the movie, you may be familiar with a scene involving Superman and an airplane. It is maybe 30 minutes into the movie and I kid you not, they could have ended it right there and I would have paid to see it a second time. That is not to say the movie was downhill from that point on, but it was worth the price of admission, even in the days of increased movie ticket prices.<br /><br />I had heard reports that Superman Returns was too much of a love story and not enough of what we should expect from a Superman movie: Superman fighting crime and saving the day. The (awkward) love story rekindled between our caped hero and Lois Lane was obvious, but not overbearing. There were scenes devoted to it entirely, but this was not the first Superman movie to do it. Let's not forget the rest of the movie, however. Bryan Singer did a great job of incorporating all of Superman's powers over the course of the film. We see plenty of flying, impenetrable skin, super-human strength, heat vision and super breath. But don't leave out the tights and the cape; Superman was well represented throughout the film.<br /><br />I liked how well Brandon Routh maintained the dichotomy of the character he played, selling the Clark Kent secret identity. He stayed clumsy as Clark and was, for the most part, strong and confident as Superman. I was among those in the camp who thought Tom Welling probably should have gotten the part when "Mr. Unknown" Brandon Routh was announced. Sorry Tom, but Brandon ended up being a good casting choice. Tom Welling may have been a little too "teen drama" and not enough "comic-book superhero" for the part.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is no Gene Hackman, but he did well as Lex Luthor. Watching Lex in action I did have the realization that though I typically prefer Marvel books, I like DC villains much better. My favorites are The Joker (big surprise), The Riddler and Lex Luthor. DC villains, to me, seem much more... complex. Lex Luthor is a bit over the top and he does require some over-acting and forced lines as well as some just-right facial expressions to fully portray his quirks. Spacey kept his composure and I really think he nailed the part.<br /><br />So I really did like the movie, but I did have a few small gripes. You probably would not believe I wrote this if there wasn't a flaw or two pointed out...<br /><br />_<br /><br />Did they make Kate Bosworth look like Natalie Portman on purpose? Or did it just happen naturally? Don't get me wrong, she looked better as Lois Lane than she has in any other role I have seen her in. All I am saying is that after Natalie does a movie or two with a shaved head, maybe Hollywood is trying to snatch her look back from her before she has a chance to make another movie with hair.<br /><br />I love that James Marsden continues to get roles in comic book films as the guy who has the girl who is at least arguably in love with someone else (think Cyclops). I understand he followed Writer/Producer/Director Bryan Singer from the X-Men series to Superman, but he is now sufficiently typecast.<br /><br />Was Brandon Routh's "Clark Kent" hair a tribute to Jason Schwartzman?<br /><br />Kal Penn goes from a late night craving for White Castle burgers to playing Lex Luthor's goon? Really? It does not seem like the most natural transition to me. At least I am pretty sure he did not have a single speaking part.<br /><br />_<br /><br />Petty criticisms aside, I really liked Superman Returns. The movie had a few slow scenes, primarily right at the beginning, but they served well enough to build up to the climax. The casting was great, even down to Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen. I hope I can find time to see it again...in IMAX this time.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I don't know what it would be like viewed normally, but we went to see the IMAX version with the four 3-D sequences tipped in, and it is out of this world!  The whole theater was filled with the sounds of the audience screaming and crying and gasping and applauding, the way very few movie experiences inspire one to do.  Afterwards we just lay there flattened out as though run over by a bulldozer or after the pleasures of orgasm.  Of the 3-D sequences, the last is disappointing after the second and third, which are visceral, passionate, full-bodied film-making.  The first one is just Superboy learning to fly, and then Clark of the present remembering himself as a boy on Jonathan and Martha's farm way back when.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, who I don't llike in general, was great in this and well worth every penny, but Parker Posey, who must have been somewhat cheaper, was just as good, making you wonder if stars are really needed in these big ticket blockbuster.  If you ask me, Kate Bosworth wasn't old enough to play Lois properly, or to play anyone with a child, her anorexic body doesn't seem developed enough to have given birth in the past, especially to a little boy who might actually be a super-baby.  Bosworth tries hard, but she's simply miscast, they might have found someone 25 or 30 to play the part.  She's got something, and the more I got into the picture I found her screen chemistry with Brandon Rotuh fairly overpowering, but at the end of the day she just was too young.  Maybe in the sequel, if they maake a sequel.<br /><br />What about it, Warner Brothers?  You might be disappointed with the box office returns, but millions of fans have seen the film and most of us have loved it!  We'd see another if you let Bryan Singer do it again.  Okay, maybe the little boy was kind of an ugly tyke, with that messy hair he didn't look like the little rich boy he was supposed to be playing, but some kind of savage from Appalachia or somewhere where they don't have hair scissors.  He was silent where he should have talked, and when he talked, he didn't seem very bright.  I'm sure his mother moves him in real life, but casting agents, Hollywood is filled with cute, talented child sctors, is this the best you could do for the biggest child's part in decades?  Otherwise this was the movie of the year, if you were lucky enough to watch it on tbe IMAX screen and scream your lungs out, especially when the growing crystal city snags Lex Luthor's big yacht, the GERTRUDE, and lifts it high into the air until the front and rear parts of it threaten to snap off in 3-D!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Once John William's extraordinary score comes blasting out with the title Superman Returns popping up on the screen, and the credits flying across the screen (a nod to the original Superman film), I felt like jumping and cheering. Unfortunately, that was to be the most excitement I would get throughout the 150 minutes I spent watching the most disappointing sequel of the year so far.<br /><br />You can't help but watch Superman Returns and think about Christopher Reeve, Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, Marc Maclure, and Marlon Brando (the only actor from the original that we actually see and hear in Returns). The reason why you can't stop thinking about those actors and hope you can see them onscreen instead of the actual actors who are in the film is because none of the actual stars, excluding Brandon Routh, convinces you that they are Perry White, Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, and Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is just too young (merely 23 years of age) and not vibrant enough to play Lois. Besides, there is no chemistry between her and Routh, who plays Clark Kent and Superman pretty swell! Kal Penn, who played Kumar in Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle, plays one of Luthor's thugs, but his character doesn't speak throughout the film (what a waste of comedic talent), the kid who plays Jimmy Olsen is not funny, and annoys you everytime he appears onscreen. Finally, there's Frank Langella (the man who played Skeletor opposite Dolph Lundgren's He-Man in Masters Of The Universe) who doesn't have the natural charm that Cooper brought to the Perry White character.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the script: horrendous. The plot and the plot twists are just one big mess aside from some unnecessary special effects and action sequences (the airplane crashing scene where Lois tumbles from one end of the airplane to another), and Clark Kent drinking beer (didn't Superman confess that he never drinks nor lies in his interview with Lois Lane in the original film? It seems Supe is a liar after all!). Warner seems to have rushed through pre-production picking one of the worse drafts of the scripts for production, but why? I'm not going to go into the details, but what were they thinking with the last 30 minutes of the film? Have they lost their minds? This is a Superman movie...not a Lois Lane movie (I hope those of you who saw it understand what I mean?).<br /><br />The only two good things about the movie are Brandon Routh and the opening credits and musical score. With that aside, Superman Returns flies flat on its face!<br /><br />Not recommended unless you're a gigantic Superman fanatic.<br /><br />D</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>After a five-year absence, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Metropolis and finds Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) now has a child and a boyfriend, and archenemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again.  Lex wants own the world and starts creating a new continent; Lois is on his trail, and Superman is after her.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, mainly because he looks a lot like Christopher Reeve.  He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.  Even boy photographer Jimmy Olson and editor Perry White look wrong.  They should provide a little humor, but are bland and forgettable instead.  The film has so much computer-animation that nothing feels real.  There is no romance or sense of danger.  If you like non-stop action on a grand scale, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for memorable characters that are developed and ring true, you'll be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VJ7HYM1EC94M.html">A1VJ7HYM1EC94M</a><br/><p>I can now forgive Bryan Singer for ditching X-Men - possibly even he couldn't have saved X-3, but what he did with Superman Returns puts him at the top of the heap of action film directors.  Quite simply Superman Returns is just about perfect.  It has nearly everything one could want in a 21st Century incarnation for the Man of Steel and the physical production is visually as eye-poppingly glorious as anyone could hope for.  The flying scenes (especially the Superman in space scenes) have a breadth and beauty around them that almost stops one's breath - absolutely stunning.<br /><br />As we've come to expect, there is great humor throughout with winks to the comic books and previous Superman flicks and director Singer doesn't shrink from paying obvious homage to the Reeve flicks - a very nice touch, indeed.  Singer doesn't shrink, either, from going for broke in the second half of the film's more emotional content and the balance between action, love story, and pseudo-religious, philosophical storyline is just about perfect.<br /><br />For all the pre-opening hype criticisms centering around an unknown actor portraying comic's most beloved hero, Brandon Routh proves the naysayers pretty much wrong.  He's got the look, the moves and the feel of the character down.  If his Clark Kent doesn't quite have the presence Reeve brought to the role - (this Clark isn't quite as endearingly bumbling or nerdy) he makes Clark likeable and believable - and makes fully plausible why Lois finds him slightly forgettable.  As The Man of Steel, however, Routh takes the challenge straight on and does not once disappoint his audience.<br /><br />The opening sequences setting up the story have a classic old movie feel, a bit of exposition for history, hilarious snips of Lex Luthor beginning his bid for world domination, Lois and the rest of the world moving on in the years since Superman (and Clark's) leave of absence, all culminating in a breathtaking action sequence wherein our hero saves the lives of those aboard the space shuttle - and ties it all in with America's favorite pastime - Baseball!<br /><br />Kate Bosworth's Lois is a bit bristley (Lois always was) but she always let's the vulnerable quality of her character crack through the tough-as-nails exterior.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's Lex starts off with a bang, but it isn't until the sequence with Lois aboard his yacht - the turning point of the film - that he gets to fully charm us with his evil craziness.  If up til then I thought Spacey hadn't quite captured the role (as I envisioned anyway), from this point on he OWNED Lex.<br /><br />Parker Posey is an entirely different creature than was Valerie Perrine.  Where Perrine was all curves and opinions, Posey is all angles and dim.  A different spin on the character, but a worthy one.<br /><br />It was terrific to see Eva Marie Saint - now in her 60th year of films, in the small role of Martha Kent.  Even washing dishes or driving her truck, Saint exudes movie star quality that proves the old adage "there are no small roles."<br /><br />The movie's more than two and a half hours fly by and everyone - at least at the screening I attended - is left feeling like a kid again.<br /><br />This is probably going to be the hit of the summer and well it should.  It has just about everything one could want in a first "return" feature for this superhero and I'm already excited for 2009's sequel!  See it on a big screen.  Now!</p></br><a href="../users/A27P0MW8TE1JQP.html">A27P0MW8TE1JQP</a><br/><p>Nearly 30 years ago we saw the rebirth of the 1938 character on screen, we had seen the black & white to color TV reruns, but until unknown Christopher Reeve flew to John Williams' music embodiment of the Superman, we believed that "a man could fly" like the tagline offered, and the film still holds up pretty well. But this "Return" after 1987's fourth and weakess offering is styled to continue the movie continuity (more post Superman II, than IV) with the original nearly invulnerable character with the same two weaknesses we all know and love: Kryptonite, of course, and those pesky human bonds, i.e. the people around him who can be used by his enemies as leverage, the very reason for his lame CK alter ego. Both of these weaknesses are exploited again and again in the films, this one too. These weaknesses are exploited by nemesis Lex Luthor, played in the spirit of Hackman's incarnation of the character here by the brilliant Kevin Spacey. This time his plan isn't any more original, just visually inspired, he plans to use Superman's Kryptonian tech to create "New Krypton" on Earth, with a Kryptonite twist. Luthor's philosophy is articulately outlined by an early scene with his latest groupie Kitty Kowaiski (Parker Posey) in which LL is asks if he considers himself a god, and he sees himself as Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to "share it" with mankind. I thought that this was a truly original view of Luthor's motivation for his hatred of Superman, not the old he's good and I'm bad, setup, but a genuine distain for this alien who's holding out on the human race.<br /><br />There was preproduction talk, about the same time the DaVinci Code was being scrutinized, about the messiah angle of SUPERMAN RETURNS; Jor-El sends his only son to Earth to lead through example, he returns to the heavens (search the remains of Krypton),  his "second coming" back to Earth and towards the climax of the film he takes a "Passion"-like beating from Luthor's thugs looking on like Roman centurians. The original character concept has always been at least a demi-god, coming to terms with his human-half like Hercules, super-strong, part-god, part-man, his greatest weakness his hubris. Jewish immigrants themselves, the original creative team, before "Supes" did more than leap over tall buildings, probably saw him as the ultimate immigration success story, not for themselves they got little over 100  bucks and a 10 yr contract for the character, but Superman was embraced by the fictitious world the same as the real world. Director Bryan Singer explores the emotional impact of a world that has moved on without Superman, a concept probably more effectively done in the various Superman comic series over the years (he has left Earth for self imposed exiles on multiple occasions, not to mention his death in 1992). The film deals with the impact on those around both Clark Kent and Superman. Lois has had a kid (who was born shortly after Superman leaves Earth, hmm...),  gotten an X-man fianc&eacute; and written a Pulitzer winning story "Why the World Doesn't Needs Superman." Sure there's loads of character exploration, that's what Singer excels at ( see Usual Suspects and X Men 1 &2), but there's also more action than you'll see anywhere else this summer, even without Richard Donner. The story could be better considering all the writers who didn't make the cut in the end (Kevin Smith, J.J. Abrams for starters). I wish they had broken away from the familiar, maybe dare I say it "left out Lex," maybe even used the "Death of Superman" storyline, including Doomsday and the "Reign of the Supermen."  WB's Smallville has proved that the character can be successful without being constrained to canon.  But this familiarity is surely a strength that makes the film feel like a long-over-due sequel. It's got the same, only darker, sense of humor as the originals. There's also an amusing anti-smoking gag that runs through the film (for example, a catatrophic sequence of events started by a cabbie's stogie, and Lois is hounded to quit by multiple parties).<br /><br />The art direction was bold, but while the suit pays homage to decades of design, it is careful not to stray to far (although the retro-reverse shield on the belt is a cool touch). Metropolis, is finally a real city now, not just a recycled New York, the Daily Planet looks great, and you just know that globe on top is gonna see some action from the opening. But as for FX, there are some milestones here, some crazy-good super-saves, I mean a bullet to the super-eye, awesome, New Krypton awesome, I wasn't sure they could top "Matrix" flight, or even "Smallville" limited airborne moments, but never has the rescue of a crashing plane  been handled with better style, believable physics and sheer coolness!<br /><br />With Singer as big a fan as he is of the original films he should have tried get John Williams to handle the whole score instead of his X-staple John Ottman. But Ottman uses enough of Williams' Superman motiffs and themes to satisfy.  And it's plenty better than the X3 music, yuck.<br /><br />On casting, the movies gotten loads of grief, partly because the part has turned over so much, but I agree with the need for a relative unknown, so you aren't distracted by a celebrity. Brandon Routh, fits the bill, he looks and sounds like Reeve, which was more the plan than getting Superman, I think. Spacey is so good in everything that he does his celebrity transcends any part he plays, Kate gives a lot of heart to the Lois character as does the great Frank Lanella playing editor Perry White. Using Brando footage as Jor-El is inspired as is the casting of Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent. Sam Huntington plays Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen well-enough (although the guy is almost never out shooting pics), while Superman's revial for Lois' affections are played believably by James Marsden as Richard White, who at one point in a "discussion" with Lois throws her previous story title "The Night I Spent With Superman" in her face. There's a nice love triangle, but it's not the traditional Clark/Lois/Superman. There's little chemistry between Brandon as Clark and Kate as Lois, but once she overcomes her abandonment issues with Superman he becomes a player in a triangle with Lois and Richard. But, he comes to terms with his role in their lives when he asks his competition during a rescue if "he's got them." By the end we realize, as does Clark, that the world still needs a savior and a Superman. I'm glad we've got one in Superman Returns.<br /><br />There are some nice twists that may or may not keep you guessing (especially at the end) but, it is a great flick. Also it has SPIDERMAN 3 PREVIEWS!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>First of all, if you want to do any prep work for watching "Superman Returns," all you really need to see from the Christopher Reeve series is the 1978 "Superman" film.  All that matters from the second one is that Lex Luthor has been to Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and the third and fourth films are thankfully flushed from our cinematic memories of the Man of Steel.  However, you have another option in that director Bryan Singer, who came up with the story for the film along with screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, also came up with stories for four "Returns Prequel" comic books, entitled "Krypton to Earth," "Ma Kent," Lex Luthor," and "Lois Lane."  They work in most of the key elements from the "Superman" film that matter here.  I have seen several similar comic book prequels, but these are by far the best, reminding us of why Jor-el sent his only son to Earth, and showing us that the world misses Superman but Martha Kent misses her son, how Lex hooked up with Kitty, and why Lois Lane wrote her editorial "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."<br /><br />Still, even if you have not seen that "Superman" recently you will probably recognize a lot of the elements from that film that have made their way in this summer's big blockbuster.  In fact there are so many that there are points where you wonder if "Superman Returns" is more of a remake than it is a sequel. Lois still cannot spell and still tries to sneak a cigarette, while Superman still saves her, still takes her flying, and is even telling the same jokes as before.  They are still using John Williams' theme music, but that would be a good thing to keep from the first movie.  Fortunately, there are some significant new things to go with the borrowed and the blue (suit).<br /><br />What happened was that when astronomers discovered a planet that could be Krypton, Superman decided he had to travel there to see what happened to his home world.  Five years have passed and before Superman returns it is Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) who comes back to the Daily Planet to find things are different.  Mainly, that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has two new men in her life, Richard White (James Marsden), the nephew of Perry White (Frank Langella) and an associate editor at the Daily Planet, and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), who is, interestingly enough, about five years old.  Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), is out of prison, thanks in part to the absence of Superman, and with help from Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), gets his hands on some items from Krypton that will make him rich and help him kill Superman.<br /><br />The bottom line is that "Superman Returns" is better than we expected, which is impressive given how high our expectations where for this film.  I was rather surprised how easily I was willing to accept that Routh was Superman, but he has the attitude down pat.  He tones down both parts from what we saw with Christopher Reeve, but that makes sense given what he spent the last five years doing, even if he does not look like he is five years older.  Bosworth is a much more solid Lois Lane and they really should have ditched the spelling and smoking bits.  Spacey picks up where he left off the last time he played a bald character (i.e., "Seven"), and makes Lex lethal this time around (plus props for having his credit last so the name of the guy who plays Superman comes first).  But for me the standout character in the movie is Marsden's Richard White, because this guy is good enough for Lois and a hero in his own right in this movie.  This was rather surprising, but a key reason why the movie works.  The character they needed to ditch or rewrite was Posey's Kitty, who is a rehashed Miss Teschmacher, which is not what these movie needed (any more than bringing back Otis).  There is enough comedy that works in this film without needing anybody other than Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) as the comic relief.<br /><br />There are several treats for fans of Superman in all of his myriad incarnations.  Noel Neill, who was Lois Lane on television's "The Adventures of Superman" and Young Lois Lane's mother (on the train) in the 1978 movie, plays Gertrude Vanderworth, Lex Luther's benefactress, while Jack Larson, who played Jimmy Olson on the series, is Bo the Bartender.  The end credits mention the memories of Christopher Reeve and Dana Reeve, but the best homage to his memory (and there are a lot in this film) is when Singer repeats the bit where Superman is flying in space and right before he flies out of the frame he looks into the camera and smiles at us.  That was the quintessential shot of Reeve as Superman.  Just like Jor-el, Marlon Brandon proves that death is not a deterrent and I have to add that while there are some pretty emotional scenes at the end of this one, I flashed on what could have been a fantastic scene between Lois and Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint) in the last act that would have blown everybody completely away.  But, hey, boys and girls, that is why they make sequels and as long as they ink Singer and this cast and stick to the archetypal vision of Superman, Warner Bros. could have a franchise that will rival Spider-Man (bet they air the trailer for "Spider-Man III" everywhere they show "Superman Returns").</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Continuity-wise, Superman Returns takes place 5 years after the events of Superman II (1981). Superman has just returned after years of searching deep space for remnants of his native planet Krypton. But, while he was gone, the world had shrugged and continued to spin without him. As Clark Kent, he gets his old job back as mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet. But things are definitely not back to normal. Lois Lane, to his dismay, has moved on. She's now the mother of a young, asthmatic boy and is engaged to Perry White's nephew Richard. She's even won the Pulitzer Prize for her article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" (ouch!). Lex Luthor, too, is up and about, released from prison due to a technicality: Superman didn't make his court date to testify against him. Lex's new master plan is to use Kryptonian technology to raise a land mass while simultaneously sinking much of the U.S. of A. After all, real estate is where it's at. He also has an ace up his sleeve with regards to the Big Red "S".<br /><br />So I went to see this movie in deep, hopeful anticipation. I wanted to be able to tell people that it did justice to the Christopher Reeve classics. Afterwards, I walked away somewhat with mixed feelings but, overall, leaning towards the positive. Superman Returns was certainly entertaining and filled with great f/x, but, no, I don't feel it lived up to all the hoop-la (but, then again, it would have to have been just about the perfect film to be worthy of all the monster pre-screening pub it got). While Superman Returns truly is an epic effort, it falls short of Superman I & II. Yes, it has its moments of sheer majesty and scope, but it lacks enough of those quiet, little personal touches that allow the audience to fully connect with the movie. Scenes with Lois and Clark, which, to me, were some of the hallmark moments in Superman I & II, are too few in Superman Returns. Routh should've been given more scenes as Clark Kent as he's the one that grounds Superman to reality and the one whom we usually identify with the most in the film. Also, one of the challenges in doing a Superman flick is ensuring that the Man of Steel has a worthy adversary. This time out, Lex Luthor proves to be a subpar opponent. And how many times can one introduce kryptonite as a weapon?<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a very good job. Yes, it helps that there's a vague resemblance between him and Christopher Reeve. And, yes, Routh channels Reeve in much the same way Ewan McGregor channels Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Routh ably captures Clark Kent's personal quirks and mannerisms, and even sounds eerily like Reeve at times. But Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeve. Here's the difference: Reeve's Superman had an almost self-deprecating, straight-faced-but-with-a-wink attitude about him. We felt that, while Supes does have abilities beyond those of mortal men, there was still a humanizing element about him that enabled us to put ourselves in his place. But Routh's Superman is so aware of the all-encompassing mission his father had given him that he comes off as somewhat aloof and detached. Oh, he smiles and waves but there isn't that same warmth we felt exuding from Reeve. In Superman I and II, it was Clark Kent who was playing Superman. In Superman Returns, Clark Kent seems to be the disguise.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer goes to great extent in showing the audience what it feels like for Kal-El to co-exist with beings infinitely more fragile than him, and the isolation and loneliness of his unending burden. Singer employs recurring shots of Superman hovering in space, gazing watchfully down on his adopted planet (or sometimes with his eyes close, so as to better focus his superhearing for any plea for aid). Superman's own personal life, in his own mind, must ever take a backseat to his ongoing pursuit of truth, justice and cheesecake.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is not as good as Margot Kidder or Teri Hatcher here, but she has room to grow. She lacks that certain sassiness that is a hallmark of Lois Lane. Given, Lois now has a child and is engaged, and is probably thrown off-keeled by Superman's return. But, still, I longed for that smart-alecky gleam in her eyes. Ah, well. Maybe, next time...Frank Langella is not crusty enough as Perry White, while Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen is forgettable. Eva Marie Saint, whom I loved in North by Northwest, didn't have enough screen time as Martha Kent. Kevin Spacey is on and off as Supe's arch nemesis Lex Luthor. There is one standout scene, though, which takes place on Lex's cruiseship, in which Lex, in traditional villainous, braggadocious fashion, unveils his mad scheme to Lois and then taunts her about Superman's guaranteed inability to foil his plan - this time. Parker Posey as Lex's sidekick chick Kitty is very funny and steals some scenes.<br /><br />So, I do recommend this film: for its sheer grandeur, the sense of nostalgia it invokes, and its sincere striving to be great. The production values are excellent and will make you believe that a Superman can fly at supersonic speeds, wrestle down a space shuttle, and stop a bullet with his eyeball. And this is only Brandon Routh's first try as the Man of Steel and there are sequels undoubtedly planned, so I expect him to grow into this role. Welcome back, Superman. I missed you, man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>I went into the movie with a lot of skepticism. Star Wars fans all seemed to hypnotize themselves into liking Revenge of the Sith, and I was concerned that so many comic fans liking the new Superman movie was something similar. In this case, I needn't have worried.<br /><br />In the end, I only have minor quibbles. Everything I was worried about (the kid, Lois being engaged) worked out great, the Super stuff was beyond awesome and the visceral impact of seeing Superman "return" five years after 9/11 was weirdly cathartic: I haven't been to a superhero movie where a lot of people in the audience were crying before, but people were absolutely bawling when Superman was re-revealed to the world after the first big rescue of the movie.<br /><br />Brandon Routh isn't the world's greatest actor, but neither was Christopher Reeve. But both had the decency that Superman (especially the Cary Bates-drawn Superman of the 1970s radiated) requires. Worst haircut ever, though.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth, while not my first choice for Lois, made the character semi-appealing to me for the first time ever (Action Comics was my very first comic book and I subscribed to Superman with my allowance money through the 1970s), although at the end of the day, she's still kind of a bitch. But Singer clearly saw Lois Lane as Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby, and Bosworth was even dressed the part. That sort of manic, well-meaning but steam-rolling character actually could make Lois charming, if the writing ever fully catches up to the interpretation (it never has in the comics -- there Lana Lang was always clearly the better love interest, Betty to Lois' Veronica).<br /><br />Kevin Spacey split the difference with Gene Hackman's over the top version of Lex Luthor (did I mention that this film is an explicit sequel to the Christopher Reeve movies?) and a more realistic Luthor for an audience that has seen Oz and the Sopranos. His comments about prison were a great grounding in reality and his personal attack on Superman at the edge of the cliff (you'll know it when you see it) is one of the great iconic images that I suspect will be recycled in the comic books for years to come.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was fine, although I think Frank Langella was badly miscast -- sorry, Frank, but you're a bad guy, not a generic cipher but generally friendly editor type. But boy, has Parker Posey fallen from her indie film queen days.<br /><br />Spider-Man's Daily Bugle was always more realistic as a newspaper (even if that newspaper was the New York Post) than Superman's Daily Planet, and this movie was the first time the Planet seemed like an actual newspaper (the LA Times, in point of fact, down to a lot of the decorations in the Planet building), although Lois asking questions that were answered in the press packet about the shuttle was annoying. (Although maybe only to me.)<br /><br />I think the twist everyone saw coming was handled very well, and Lois' fiance, rather than being an anchor around the neck of this film, actually added a lot to the proceedings from where I'm sitting, because it definitely gave the feeling that life had moved on and here was a guy that the audience couldn't really dislike and who fills the roles that Clark left empty in both of his personas when he left Earth. (It also proves that he annoyed me as Cyclops in the X-Men movies because Cyclops is annoying, not because the actor is. Cyclops has always sucked.)<br /><br />Without question, though, this is Superman at his most Super in any film or television show. Kudos to the creators for making it look hard for Superman, which isn't something that always happens in the comics.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>Even though the story isn't horrible and Brandon Routh's Chrisopher Reeve impersonation isn't too far off the mark, I found this movie too weak to be part of the permanent Superman Genre.  You know, the way the Peter Sellers "Casino Royale" isn't really a Bond Film.  Of course, I didn't like Superman III with Reeve and never bothered to see Superman IV.<br /><br />What is good about the film?  Well, it has the comic book silliness.  You know, the space shuttle launching from the back of a 747 because it would get more of a boost from them than two solid rocket boosters, and the familiar engines of the shuttle fire powerfully without any observable place for the fuel.  Almost every scene is full of the same kind of nonsense, but it is this daffy disregard for reality is part and parcel of comic books.  I also liked the fact that Superman more or less levitates in this film rather than "flying" like a jet.  Since he has no "thrusters", levitating makes more sense.<br /><br />I hated what they did to his outfit.  The cape and boots are too dark and the "S" signature on his chest is too small and too high.  However, since they were turning the "Man of Steel" into some kind of metrosexual, using the "S" as a bodice rather than a shield or breastplate might make some sort of perverse sense.<br /><br />And the inversion of sexual mores is complete in this film with Lois Lane becoming a single mom, the details of which you will have to learn for yourself by seeing the film.  However, if such a plot point had been used in the original superman, well, one would not have required super hearing to notice the instantaneous outcry from the public.<br /><br />My advice is to treat this film the way the middle "Highlander" films were treated when they decided to get back to the original.  Just ignore it and pretend it never happened and get back to the "real" Superman in the next film.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey played Lex Luthor pretty straight, as a sort of emotionally void killer.  He is smart and an egomaniac, but doesn't have the inner humor of the Gene Hackman Luthor and Spacey never plays for laughs.  I actually liked his performance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>Twenty-odd years have passed since the last Superman movie, so I guess it's high time for a new one for the new generation of moviegoers, like my daughter.  Having never seen any of the "first" series, she thought "Superman Returns" was great.  Having seen the first series, I wasn't so psyched by the return of the screen version of the Man of Steel.  "Returns" seemed to borrow much of its plot (and some dialogue, as I've read) from the original Superman; Brandon Routh borrowed his look from Christopher Reeve, and Kate Bosworth seemed too young to play Lois Lane five years after her tryst with Superman. Kevin Spacey brought more evil and less humor to the part of Lex Luthor, who's still obsessed with beachfront property--this time by creating a new continent in the Atlantic to push the ocean up and over the Eastern US.  Secondary players Frank Langella and Sam Hutchinson were just fine as circulation hound Perry White and awestruck Jimmy Olson.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />I think the biggest and most important thing is that Brandon Routh makes a great Superman.  Maybe it's his unknown status, maybe it's his lookalike affinity with Christopher Reeves, but he fits and plays the iconic character pretty much to the T.<br /><br />The other characters, not so much, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were bad.  Kevin Spacey was a brilliant Lex Luthor, but Spacey's bad misfortune is to have a very recognizable face.  He's... Kevin Spacey.  However, the baldness suited him and he really did seem to move around comfortably in Luthor's shoes, so to speak... sometimes acting very chillingly.  Kate Bosworth did a good Lois Lane, but I must say that this movie really made me dislike the character.<br /><br />I don't remember Kitty from anywhere, but that is one great character, especially as a foil to Luthor.  Her ditziness can get annoying, but the way it helps one underestimate her character is actually one of the better parts of the movie.  I can say that Kitty stole the show with this one, though nobody else ever mentions her.<br /><br />Many people told me this movie was too long before I went to see it, but it's really not.  I hardly noticed the playlength.  That, to me, is a sign of a good, well-paced movie.  I didn't really get too much into story as a whole or even the action, it was mostly the characters and especially the exploration of the very iconography that interested me.  I think the most commonly seen image in this movie is Superman holding the weight of the world... various forms of the image "the world"... on his shoulders.  It's a very intriguing image, I must say.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>This was a surprisingly good movie, a surprisingly worthwhile viewing experience and I learned something.  This movie is definitely a keeper beceause for the first time, I realized from Brandon Routh's performance and from the production style that Superman is a heartbroken hero who has no one to talk to.  I sort of ignored that aspect of the character although it was expressed in the Christopher Reeve films.  I was never crazy about the character as a hero but I realize now that it sucks to be Kal-El.  His world is irreversibly gone.  The new story is also a bad one for the hero.  This movie is much better than I expected.  I didn't like the casting from photographs but in moving pictures, both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth look and express themselves beautifully.  It also helps to cast overqualified character actors Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey.  And Brandon Routh can pull off the same thing that Christopher Reeve did - be beautiful by gazing kindly i.e. evoke being beautiful from within despite whatever either one of them looks like.  Well done!  Someone else trying to do that would most likely look manipulative or drippy.  I absolutely loved how I felt assured listening to Brandon Routh use Jor El's words at the end of the movie.  It sucks to lose your entire world and way of life because of evil.  It makes me want to go in and fix it, just get it done and get it over with once and for ALL because otherwise is unacceptable and unbearable to think of.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I didn't go into this film with any expectations, and ultimately I thought it carried the torch fairly well, in spirit.  There was enough overlap from the original film to fill in the storyline without clinging unnecessarily to its coattails.  Whether the story progression in this film would align with the comic universe itself...  I have my doubts.  If you are a stickler for the die hard comic characters, this film will not live up to your expectations.<br /><br />I did not find Brandon Routh to be a particularly stand out talent. I've never seen him in anything else.  He seemed to be moving along the plot without making any real contribution.  Spacey and Parker were quite the caricatures of their roles, all but stealing the film for their villainous depictions. Even with them, though, I felt like they were doing the best they could with a weak script.  Bosworth played a fairly subdued Lane, but in the end she came across more one-dimensional to me than just hyper focused on her work ethic while trying to hide a fiery passion for blue tights.  In fact,  she came off flat out cold in her interactions with her son, the enigma of which is deciphering who his real father is. With that interjection of doubt shadowing the little one you would think that with all this overwhelming love we are supposed to believe that she feels, that she would show a little more compassion to her son.  The majority of the characters were so bland that in the end I found myself not really caring if some of the principals didn't make it.  In fact, it would have been more in keeping with the canon storyline if...  well.  You just have to see it.<br /><br />The plot moved somewhat slowly in the middle, with quite a few leaps in logic (or flat out misinterpretations of the original Superman mythos) conveying it through its shallow and open climax.  There were no particularly dazzling special effects but the CGI maintained the comic vividness rather well.  Honestly I spent most of this film working out contradictions in my mind regarding collective consciousness, archetypes and which came first--the broken planet or the displaced hero, but I wouldn't expect those to convey well in a film review.  =)</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>In one sentence "good, but could have been better."<br /><br />Overall, this updated Superman - the first since the Christopher Reeve versions a generation ago, is decent but too bland.<br /><br />What this new series needs is some "cool" villains, people fun to watch such as the three escapees from Krypton in Superman II. This series needs a spark that Spacey's "Luthor" didn't deliver. Add more humor, too. The other films had some laugh- out-loud scenes. Give Olsen and Perry some personality. Jack Larson's "Olsen" back on the TV series provided a lot of humor to the show. Get Perry White stirred up. Loosen up Brandon Routh (Superman) and make his character a little more fun, too. This movie would have been so much better with a lot more humor.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth not only is, by far, the prettiest Lois Lane ever, but portrays Lois in a likable fashion. That was nice to see. As for  Routh being the new Superman, I have no complaints. He reminded me a lot of a young Christopher Reeve. I liked the fact that although they played up Superman's feelings toward Lois, they didn't overdo it. They didn't have stupid lines like in 1978 with Superman proving his x-ray vision by telling Lois what color her panties were. In other words, this relationship was not corny or stupid as I felt the Reeve-Margot Kidder one was. Let's hope it stays that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>Brandon Roush and Kevin Spacey lead a very able cast in a less than able movie. The script/plot was horrible and unbelievable. You don't really get to see astronomers FINDING Krypton... and how can they find what isn't there? The world was destroyed.<br /><br />Having Superman leave should have been motivated by something more believable. Maybe some other Kryptonians survived and were thriving in another distant civilization or whatever.<br /><br />The point being that this plot failed from its very inception. Frank Langella made a great "Daily Planet" Editor and the rest of the cast were very well played. But the movie didn't give you any information about the Christopher Reeve series. My son kept asking me questions that would have been answered had he seen the Christopher Reeve movies first. If you're going to make a movie for a new generation, to try and revive a love for Superman, it's best to return to his roots.<br /><br />You can always send him on a different mission later, but when introducing Superman to a generation that wasn't alive in the 1970's and 80's you need to give them background on how he became Superman to begin with.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Superman Returns" starts off well - we quickly move through a lot of Superman's back story, because the filmmakers know we've all seen Christopher Reeve's original "Superman."  Indeed, the theme music is the same; Brando's footage and voice as Superman's father are repurposed; this movie clearly acknowledges that the first Superman movie happened and is meant to be placed in the same universe.  Brandon Routh does a credible Christopher Reeve; Kevin Spacey maintains the same tone as Hackman did in the original; and indeed the tone of the picture is very much that of the original "Superman."<br /><br />So why three stars?  First, there just isn't much of a story in this movie.  The first one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling, but it had plot aplenty compared to this.  Second, "Superman Returns" lacks the iconic moments of the first movie that you remember even years after seeing the film.  Third, this movie isn't so much about Superman as it is about Lois Lane.  My wife pointed this out, and she's right.  Not that Lois Lane isn't an interesting or worthwhile character, but we want to see a movie about Superman when we are watching "Superman Returns."  Instead, Superman is the cipher at the center of this film, a sort of Oliver Twist around whom all manner of events happens, but whom we never really get to know.<br /><br />It's worth a rent, and it's better than Superman III or Superman IV.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>What a pleasant surprise! I expected Brandon Routh and the rest of the cast to be doing imitations of their predecessors who starred in the 70's films. Not at all! Brandon plays a sensitive, strong and spiritual Superman who is quite distinctive from Reeve's boyish Man of Steel. Kate Bosworth holds her own against Margot Kidder's classic portrayal of Lois Lane. And, man what a Lex Luthor! Kevin Spacey is comic, but extremely cruel. He doesn't give one inch to Gene Hackman. The subplot about Lois' little boy is very well done. The classic musical themes from the 70's film will make you want to cry with nostalgia. Great special effects. One caveat: the film is over 2 1/2 hours long so watch it when you can devote sufficient time to it. One last word -- Marlon Brandon's Jor-el is seamlessly integrated into the film and it really works. Superman fans will love this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A13TO1ZFAH9SVN.html">A13TO1ZFAH9SVN</a><br/><p>There hasn't been a great Superman movie made in my 22 years of living. I'm a huge fan of the man of steel though and this was one of my most antcipated movies of 06. It's Directed by Bryan Singer(X-Men, X-2} who left that franchise to come Superman. All Superman movies are graded upon the first made by Richard Donner and the numerous great tv shows based on the character. Superman Returns jumpstarts the movie franchise and gives us something Superman 3 and 4 lacked being a good movie.<br /><br />Superman(Brandon Routh) has returned to earth from his five year exodus to the planet Krypton. He found the planet in ruins and returns to earth almost in a mid-life crisis. Earth has gone on without him. Lois Lane(Bosworth) has moved on being engaged and having a five year old son. Lex Luthor(Spacey)has gotten out of jail because Superman missed his courtdate. Once again he is launching a sinister plot to make himself alot of money and kill some people in the process. Superman must rebound and stop Lex and get life back to normal.<br /><br />I liked Brandon Routh as Superman. I hate the little curl they had him wearing when he was the man of steel and not Clark Kent. He is a Christopher Reeve clone and that has to be how he got the nod over Tom Welling from Smallville. He fits the part great though. He's a physical presence on the screen and like Reeve he just embodies Superman. You look at him and say, "Yeah, this is Superman." It's a huge role for a non-known actor to take on.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is on the greatest actors of my generation and plays "The Worlds Greatest Criminal Mind" to perfection. Where Hackman was over the top Spacey is funny. He is intense at times and just a touch sarcastic. I wish he had more screen time, but oh well.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is ok as Lois. She stops the movie from being five stars. It's not that she does a bad job, it's the things she can't do. Kate is 23 years old and Lois has to be in her early 30's. She is one of the most established reporters in the world and this movie has a five year old son. She looks to fresh out of college. She has good chemistry with Routh and could have played a younger Lois fine, but just doesn't fit the movie.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic. The flying looks very real and is so smooth. It doesn't look computerized like lets say Neo in the Matrix series. He has all his abilities in the movie and uses them and they look the best they ever have.<br /><br />The specials on the two disc are alright. We have some deleted scenes and we get to hear more from Kevin Spacey. He's such good actor and gives this film some credibility.<br /><br />If you love Superman you got to pick this one up. It's a fun action movie the whole family can enjoy. Get out there and support the galaxies most powerful hero and like me just look forward to the next sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I've never been a real big fan of comic books and have never seen a single Superman movie (although I did see that series with Dean Cain a couple times). I am familiar with Superman and, from what I can tell, this film is pretty good. It's not perfect (it's definitely way too long), but it's good, entertaining, and has some great special effects. The film is directed by Bryan Singer, who left the "X-Men" series to do this film and stars newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The movie opens with a title card that tells us that Superman disappeared for five years to explore his extinct planet Krypton. When he returns, he resumes his job at The Daily Planet under the alias Clark Kent but finds that things have changed. His love Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, 'Beyond the Sea') has a young son, Jason, and is engaged to the editor Richard (James Marsden, 'X-Men: The Last Stand'). Meanwhile, the evil and bald Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, 'American Beauty') has come up with a money-hungry plan for world domination...As Clark adjusts to his new life and returns to his role as Superman, Luthor discovers a way of getting lots of money AND killing Superman. Now, here are a couple problems with the movie. First, Lex Luthor's plan is idiotic...Although, that's usually the case with movie villains whether they're in a Superman movie or a James Bond movie. It's way too long...It's never dull and my favorite movie of all time has the same running time as this film, but it could've been trimmed. Bosworth's Lois Lane isn't incredibly likeable and Bosworth isn't really credible as a mother. But with the cons come the pros. Routh makes a credible Superman and the fact that he's an unknown makes it a lot more believable, because you're not thinking to yourself the entire time "That's Brandon Routh!" People have complained about Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luthor, because it's campy. And, yes, it is campy...But I think it works better this way. If he had played it straight, there would be no fun in it and with the plan Luthor has in the movie, campiness is the best choice. The movie co-stars<br /><br />Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint (as Clark's mother), Parker Posey (as Kitty, Luthor's girlfriend),<br /><br />and Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's dad. There's a fascinating Bonus Feature on the 2nd disc, detailing how they digitally recreated Brando's role from the original and placed it in this film.<br /><br />Posey is wonderful as Luthor's girlfriend, camping it up herself yet holding her ground against Spacey. Whenever there's a movie based on a comic book, people tend to lash out at the director.<br /><br />Bryan Singer has taken a lot of heat, from the beginning of the "X-Men" trilogy to this film. I got to say, the dude is doing a pretty good job. Could someone better have directed this movie? Probably, but I wouldn't know who. "Superman Returns" should please fans of the comic book or just the casual viewer, despite its shortcomings. It's worth watching, at least once.<br /><br />GRADE: B</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Like 1978's "Superman", 2006's "Superman Returns" is more stately, grand, and admirable than truly exciting and fun. But, like the earlier film, those traits are more than enough to recommend it. In many ways, in fact, this film feels more like a remake of that first Christopher Reeve film than a quasi-continuation of the Reeve series.<br /><br />For example, "Superman" featured a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new West Coast of the United States. "Superman Returns" features a plot centering around Lex Luthor's scheme to create a new continent. "Superman" featured a sequence showing Superman being dumped into a swimming pool with a hunk of kryptonite chained around his neck, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. "Superman Returns" features a sequence showing Superman being dumped into the ocean with a hunk of kryptonite jammed into his side, with him luckily being rescued by a woman who jumps into the water and removes the kryptonite from his person. The former film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a helicopter mishap. The new film shows Supes rescuing Lois from a jetliner mishap. In other words, in classic remake fashion, the new film just upped the ante and created fancier versions of those earlier scenes. So, if you don't mind that approach (and especially if you liked the earlier film), you shouldn't have much of a problem here.<br /><br />Of course, "Superman Returns" doesn't completely take the remake approach. It also functions as sort of quasi-sequel, making it clear that to some extent the events of the earlier films happened to this new Superman we're seeing. I say "quasi-sequel" because director Brian Singer seems to pick and choose among the details of the earlier mythology, keeping some and discarding others. For example, it's acknowledged in the new film that Superman and Lois did indeed have a previous relationship, but it's pretty clear that it likely didn't happen exactly as depicted in the Donner/Lester films. If it DID happen pretty much the way we remember way back when (especially in "Superman II"), the NEXT Singer/Routh film will need a scene like this to smooth over all the plot contortions:<br /><br />Supes: I'm sorry for everything. You must have been pretty confused when you found yourself... expecting. I, uh, made you sort of forget that we ever... became close.<br /><br />Lois: Yes... I remembered the feelings, the emotions, the fact that we had a connection... but, yeah... I didn't remember that we, uh... you know.<br /><br />Supes: So, what did you think when...?<br /><br />Lois: Actually, I guess I have you to thank for me not going crazy wondering what happened to me. Now that I know the truth about Jason, as far as I can guess... your, uh, alien DNA or whatever- mixing with my human DNA- resulted in a pregnancy that took well over a year to come to term. And I didn't show for the longest time. Another side effect of our... "hybrid union", I guess. So, by the time it WAS clear I was pregnant, I had long since been dating Richard and just thought the baby was his. Honestly, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you.<br /><br />Supes: I know. But what do we do now?<br /><br />But we'll let the film writers finish up the above scenario if they choose to do so in the next "Superman" installment... "Superman Returns Again", perhaps? My point is, even though I hope the next chapter is more of a fun roller coaster ride where Superman really lets loose, the quirky remake/sequel nature- and ultimately "tribute" nature- of "Superman Returns" does result in a movie that is never less than interesting. And, yes, the movie does have its exciting sequences, too, even if some of those sequences are laced with those same pesky illogical quirks that plagued the exciting moments from the first film. But those are a whole other set of quibbles.<br /><br />So, just get the DVD (the two-disc version with all the extra features is quite well done) and sit back and enjoy the movie. Just do yourself a favor and leave your keen sense of scrutiny off to the side for later, like for when you're doing your tax returns or editing your Master's Thesis. Because, if you just try to relax and have fun with "Superman Returns", chances are you'll do just that.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Instead of giving us X-Men: The Last Stand, Bryan Singer decided to take a grander project first. The new Superman sequel has been anticipated for quite some time now, and it truly does live up to the hype. Superman Returns basically is set after Superman II, because I think everyone can agree that we may as well just pretend that numbers III and IV don't exist. Here we see Superman returning back to Earth to find that Lois Lane is now engaged as well as being a new mother. He comes back and also finds that planet Earth is still in chaos with crime and danger around every corner. Lex Luthor is Superman's villain in this sequel once again. Kevin Spacey steals the show as the eccentric pioneer, and suprisingly looks very much like Gene Hackman. Superman Returns is a good movie, it really is. However, I think what I found subpar about it was that it tried to make the man of steel this vulnerable and emotional character. The original films made this character an icon, a character with no weaknesses that could overcome anything. I mean sure, in the hero's journey there must always be some adversity that the main character needs to overcome in order for the plot to work, but for some reason I just never saw Superman as this complex character. I'm not saying that it was bad to make Superman more complex, in fact if I saw a replica of the original with nothing new to offer then I'd be trashing the movie. I really liked Superman Returns, but I just wasn't blown away by it like we were all expecting. The movie doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen before in other superhero movies. I still think that Spider-Man is the film franchise to beat in this genre. On the technical side I can honestly say I was blown away. The CGI work was breathtaking and very detailed. I heard a lot of people complain about the length of the movie, but I never found it to drag at all. It is a great summer blockbuster, but it wasn't great enough to make me anticpate the next installment in the franchise.<br /><br />ACTING: Newcomer Brandon Routh is a perfect fit for the character. His acting was not stilted or dull, and he really added great depth to the character. He had lots of great stuff to work with though, and that definately helped. Kate Bosworth did a fine job but she felt incredibly cold as a character. It seems like she was mad at Superman and that in turn made her mad at everyone else, even her son and fiance. There was no warmth from Lois Lane, and that made the romance of it all feel very dull. Kevin Spacey steals the show and does an amazing job as the power hungry Lex Luthor who plans to grow his own continent. Kevin Spacey was so good that at times I thought he overpowered the Superman character, which I thought hurt the film a little as well.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Bryan Singer definately crafted a well made superhero movie, but when there is a superhero movie in the theater almost every few months sometimes "well made" is not enough. The only problem with Superman Returns is that it played it safe and didn't change that much. For example, Batman Begins completely reinvented the franchise and gave us a completely fresh new movie to enjoy. Superman Returns is great, but we've seen it all before.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>I was not even born when the original "Superman" movies were made and released with the late Christopher Reeve, plus I've been pulled towards the Marvel Comics movies historically speaking so I didn't know what to expect with the first "Superman" movie of the 21st century, 2006's "Superman Returns". I however got lucky and was invited to see this on July 1 and ultimately in the end, "Superman Returns" has truly lived up to the great reviews that I've been reading all across the net since it's release to the theatres. Benefiting from the likes of "X-Men" movie director Brian Singer, this has turned out to be a major favorite movie of 2006 so far.<br /><br /> On the planet Krypton, Superman is sent away from there and escapes just in time before it's `sun' star collapses and then explodes in a supernova destroying the planet with it's civilization perishing in the disaster but Superman escapes and reaches earth.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Superman (Routh) is back, five years after where "Superman II" left off.  He returned to Krypton, hoping to find some life still there, but when he found nothing, he returned to Earth.  As Clark Kent, he gets his job back at the Daily Planet, and is reunited with Lois Lane (Bosworth).  But, people have moved on.  Lois has a five year old son, and a boyfriend (Marsden).  She has also won a Pulitzer for an article about how the world does not need Superman.  Elsewhere, Lex Luthor (Spacey) is free from prison, and up to no good.  It seems that he has found Superman's Fortress of Solitude, and has devised a plan with what he found there that will wipe out most of the United States.  Once again, Superman must try to stop Luthor's evil scheme, and try to win the girl in the process.  But things will be a little more difficult this time.<br /><br />After almost two decades, Superman is finally back.  Bryan Singer takes the helm as director after bowing out of the X-Men franchise.  Not the wisest move, but it is the opportunity of a lifetime to bring back the Man of Steel.  He does a few things right.  First, he uses the backstory established in "Superman" and "Superman II", wisely ignoring "III" and "IV", and not having to do a complete reboot.  He attempts to have a look of continuity and even uses John Williams' famous themes from those films.  This IS the Superman we grew up with, he has just been away for a while.  Kevin Spacey is great as Luthor, bring menace and some humor to the role.  He even manages to inflict some pain on the hero.  On the weak side, Lex's plan is dumb.  For as smart as he is supposed to be, he has not really thought things through.  Kate Bosworth is weak as Lois, and James Marsden has the unenviable role of being the other man.  Brandon Routh does not bring much to the table as Superman/Clark Kent except a resemblance to Christopher Reeve.  Finally, the running time is way too long to support the story.  Some trimming could have improved the story's flow.<br /><br />Yet, for the most part, it works.  It is good to see Superman back after all these years.  The effects are top notch, and the movie is mostly fun.  I do recommend this movie, but I hope that the filmmakers are able to tighten things up the next time around.  A sequel is planned (duh), and could be better than this restart.  For now, we can enjoy what we have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I knew nothing of Superman when I went to see this. Well, I knew he wore red and blue tights and could fly. I knew he loved Lois Lane. But I've never read the comics, never seen the old movies, never watched Lois and Clark or Smallville... my life was devoid of the man of steel. Now that I've been exposed to his world, I'm addicted. I thought nothing could be better than Spider-man and Batman, what other superheroes do you need when you have Spidey and the caped crusader?? I had no idea how complex the character of Superman actually was, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I could, indeed, become crazily obsessed with another superhero.<br /><br />Superman Returns stars the amazing Brandon Routh as Superman/Clark Kent. Superman is back after having been gone for five years. He's lucky to get his old job at the Daily Planet back, where Jimmy happily greets him and gets him up to speed on everything he's missed, particularly the life of Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth)-- Superman's man squeeze who has since moved on. She even has a son and a permanent fiancee to prove it. But she really hasn't moved on; she's completely hung up on Superman, of course! Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning to use crystals and kryptonite in his next scheme, hoping to kill Superman and create a new continent that will belong solely to, who else, himself.<br /><br />There's lots going on in this movie, as if the filmmakers were trying to make up for lost time in the Superman franchise. It loses points there. And the mis-use of Lane's child also loses points. The kid could've been an excellent plot device, as well as an engaging character, but he does little but sit and stare and look kinda creepy. But it's still a great movie. Full of action and romance and tortured souls.<br /><br />Routh is practically the poster boy of All-American goodness-- his bright smile and eyes, that perfectly coifed hair, that manly physique. He plays the role of Superman with just enough torture, just enough charisma, just enough cheesiness, that it works to perfection. Bosworth should've played the role of Lois with a bit more spunk. I love Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He's menacing and cold, but idiotic and funny. And Lex's girl Kitty (Parker Posey) is just plain hilarious, delivering the movies more lighter and funnier moments just when you need them.<br /><br />Awesome summer fare. Awesome anytime fare. One of the best superhero movies I've ever seen! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>I went in to see "Superman Returns" with cautious optimism. The idea of finally seeing the world's most beloved superhero return to the big screen was a great one. However, I had some concerns with the people behind the scenes. I feared that the idea of making the Man of Steel a more emotionally-complex character would turn this into another melodramatic cry-baby fest, like the overrated "Spider-Man" movies. Also, I was not excited  with the idea of Bryan Singer directing, as the "X-Men" movies were not among my all-time favorites. And even though he had let Singer do the movie he wanted, producer Jon Peters had shown signs of ruining a new "Superman" movie (Just listen to what Kevin Smith said on the "An Evening with Kevin Smith" DVD).<br /><br />However, I left the theater with a huge smile on may face. While no film could come close to matching the first "Superman" movie from 1978, this new movie is still very good. The cast and crew have done a fantastic job of creating an exciting, character-driven motion picture. Brandon Routh does a fine job of filling the shoes of Christopher Reeve. He brings the warmth and humor that Reeve gave to both Clark Kent and Superman. And while the character is more emotionally-complex, he doesn't come across as a panzy like Tobey Maguire does in the "Spider-Man" films.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey does a terrific job as Lex Luthor. He retains the humor that Gene Hackman brought to the role, but also gives him a darker edge, making his version of the character more similar to the comic-book. The only real problem cast-wise is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She's just a bit too young to play the character. However, she still manages to do a fine job. The rest of the cast does a commendable job as well.<br /><br />Bryan Singer and his crew have done a terrific job of brining Superman back to the screen with the excitement, humor, and joy that made the first movie a classic. The plot is interesting, the story is believable, and the visual effects are Oscar-worthy. And while some may quibble with the comparisons of Superman to Christ, this doesn't detract from the film any at all.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is great film-making. It ranks alongside "Batman Begins" as one of the greatest super-hero films of the modern era. I highly recommend "Superman Returns" to both Superman fans and fans of great films. You're sure to enjoy it.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Roger Ebert gave the first Batman 2 stars and he's wrong again with Superman Returns which he also gave 2 stars. It's a great ride and it brings back the kid in you just in the opening credits and hearing the John Williams classic musical score. Superman returns after 5 years of looking for any piece of Krypton that he can find. He returns to find Lois engaged to Perry White's son played by James Marsden (X-Men) and with a kid as well. He finds himself needed again just when he's settiling in. Lex Luther has an evil plan to basically turn Earth into Krypton in a world where he'd be the leader.<br /><br />  This movie is 10 times better than Superman 3 and 4. It's not better than part 1 or 2 but it's right up there with them at least. Brandon Routh may not be as good as Christopher Reeves as playing Clark Kent or Superman. However he is the best Superman next to Reeves. Routh's Superman looks like he popped right out of the comic book. He may not have Reeves' charm but he still makes a very heroic Superman. As for playing a bumbling reporter, he needs to work on that a lot before the next movies. Ebert was way off though when he said he barely had any lines because they probably dind't know if he could act. Routh has a good part at the end where he delivers the lines that were once said to him by his father. He does it well too.<br /><br />  Kate Bosworth's Lois is more vulnerable than the kind of Lois we're used to. I mean she gets knocked around violently by one of Lex's bodyguards. You know the Erica Durance Lois in Smallville wouldn't take that [...]. Erica Durance is a very good Lois and it's sad that Smallville is only interested in pushing Lana in our face constantly and they don't  know how to use Lois. Anyway Bosworth still looks the part at least and does give us a different Lois even if it's not a better Lois.<br /><br />  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Lex Luther, he basically gives us an older version of Michael Rosenbaum's Lex in Smallville. Gene Hackman was a great Lex Luther too but his was a little too whacky. Spacey makes a great ruthless and scary Luther and it's one of his best performances in awhile. Parker Posey is also excellent as his partner Kitty. She livened up movies that weren't that good, like Scream 3 and Blade Trinity. Here she's finally in a good a movie and has really good chemestry with Spacey. Hell they have better chemestry than Routh and Bosworth who don't have Reeves and Margot Kidder chemestry.<br /><br />  One problem with the film is that....Lois Lane and Clark never work together. She never even wonders why Clark isn't around when Superman is around. It is funny though when Lois and her fiance joke about how Clark and Superman have the same height and built. Plus although Spacey is a great Lex Luther, I am sort of Lex Luthered out. I know part 3 sucked when it tried to have someone other than Luther as the villian. But I'd love to see Darkseid in a Superman movie for once . They need someone evil with powers like part 2 had Zod. I'd like something like that instead of just Luther as the villian again. It's still hard not to get into this movie though or get excited when you hear the John Williams score.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is an awesome movie. i was kind of woried about this guy playing superman. but he did a good job. garantee he will be no christopher reeve but he did superman in his one way which was cool. i think brandon roth did the character justice and kevin spacy did an excelent lex luthor. this was a good fresh start on a new superman hopefully he will stick with it. one thing i did like about this movie was that it was a continuance not a remake or reboot. this is a awesome film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought the 1st "Superman" was ok. I actually enjoyed Part 2 better; part 3 was my favorite; and even though part 4 got a lot of harsh criticism, I didn't think it was so bad. I kind of liked it.<br /><br />Onto the subject at hand. I understand that this movie was an uphill battle at best and a doomed failure at worst. I understand that most people already had the irrevocable image of Christopher Reeve as Superman. But this already difficult battle was not handled well.<br /><br />For one thing, this movie tries to be consistent with Part 1 and 2. (It shows images of Marlon Brando from Part 1, and having Lex Luthor know about Superman's base from Part 2.) BUT, this movie seems to forget that the death of Superman's 'earth' mother was mentioned in Part 3, and that Superman made arrangements to sell the family farm in Part 4.<br /><br />The main problem here is that the movie does NOT remain consistent with the 1st 4; NOR DOES IT MAKE A CLEAN BREAK AND START FRESH. (Making a clean break and starting fresh was probably the best bet for this difficult uphill battle.)<br /><br />Moving on, it almost gets annoying when it at least seems that Rooth is imitating Christopher Reeve. He may have been better off just bringing his own style to the role. Something like this happened recently.<br /><br />After 2 Harry Potter movies, Richard Harris (who did Dumbledore) died. He was beloved in this final role. Now when Sir Michael Gambon took the role from part 3, he was smart enough not to imitate Richard Harris. He knew this was a difficult spot. So he just did Dumbledore with his own style. (Probably Sir Michael Gambon's smartest move under the circumstances.)<br /><br />Well, back to Superman. His jealousy over Lois Lane having moved on with her life seems a bit unfair. (He did after all leave for some years.) Lois Lane did the healthy thing. She moved on with her life. (She also has a son now.)<br /><br />What saves this movie from being a complete and utter disaster is Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. He has gotten out of jail and now has the family fortune to start new with. He is very bad. But like many of Charles Dickens's villains, he carries a charm that makes him likable in a way. His big plan is to use Kryptonic elements to create a new world, and take over.<br /><br />There is an interesting climactic moment where Lex Luthor leads Superman into a trap, and it's hard not to enjoy seeing Lex Luthor finally get his chance to punch out Superman.<br /><br />Another character worth mentioning is Frank Langella as Mr. White. In his minor (but still significant) role, he adds a bit of charm. Lois is starting to feel bad about her book: "Why the World Does Not Need Superman." And with some charm, Frank Langella says: "Don't worry Lois. People won't remember what you got the Pulitzer Prize for. They will just remember that you got it."<br /><br />Believe me, I TRIED to be open to this film. I TRIED to give it a fair chance. I TRIED to understand that Brandon Routh had a very difficult if not impossible task. But it just didn't work. I give the movie 1 star for Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, and 1 star for Frank Langella. Another annoying element is that if the movie takes place some years after Part 2, why do the characters look younger than they did in Part 2?<br /><br />SUMMED UP: They had a choice. They could have either remained consistent with the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, or they could have made a clean break and started fresh. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DID NEITHER.<br /><br />Being perfectly honest, if you have not seen the 4 Christopher Reeve movies, you may be more able to accept this and enjoy it on its own. But it really doesn't fit with the Christopher Reeve movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>This film offers a nice follow-up to the first two Superman movies.

Spacey steals the show as Lex Luther, but even here, we could have done without the bumbling of his henchmen...a criminal mastermind can't hire better help?  For what it is, it's a good ride.

He was heard on radio and seen in comic books.  In 1941, a brief cartoon of Superman was shown in the movie theaters with the voice of Bud Collyer as "Superman".<br />  Kirk Alyn made his appearance as "Superman" in 1948 with Noel Neill as "Lois Lane".<br />  Superman returned again in the form of George Reeves as Clark Kent/Superman in "Adventures of Superman" (1952-58).  Noel Neill returned as "Lois Lane" and Jack Larson began as "Jimmy Olsen".  George Reeves was growing tired of playing "Superman" and was upset that he would be typecast.  He committed suicide, June 16 1959.  This was dramatized in the motion picture, Hollywoodland (2006).<br />  The most poignant motion picture of "Superman" came in 1978 with Christopher Reeve (no relation to George) in the title role.  He had been an actor on the soap opera "Love of Life".<br />  Superman was a super-hit with Christopher Reeve and three more movies were made, Superman II (1980), Superman III (1983), Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987).  Supergirl was made in 1984.<br />  In 1995, Christopher Reeve was in a debilitating horse-riding accident that left him paralyzed from the neck-down. He needed the assistance of a breathing-machine so he could breathe.  With improvement, he was able to act again wheel-chair bound and even appeared in a couple "Smallville" tv-episodes.  Reeve died October 10, 2004.<br />  On August 14, 2004, Brandon Routh was told he was the new "Superman". He used to appear on soap operas, One Life To Live (2001-02), Port Charles (2001-02), General Hospital (2002-03).<br /><br />  Superman has been away for 5 years to find out the truth about his birth planet, Krypton.<br />  He arrives back to Earth in the same way he arrived as a toddler.

Singer lead Marvel's X Men and X2...ummm...marvelously. So turning the helm over to Singer for DC Comic's Superman Returns was a big buzz.<br /><br />Perhaps Singer has been watching too much Smallville? Don't get me wrong, I think that Smallville is excellent. However, with Superman Returns my expectations were not set for a slow moving love story between Superman and Lois Lane...which is what 50% of the movie is; I would expect that kind of filler from Clark and Lana in the TV series Smallville...lot's of episodes to fill.<br /><br />Plus based on how action-oriented Singer's two X Men entries were, I had very high expectations for Superman Returns. The action was indeed good in Superman Returns, but it was predictable. There were no surprises. The special effects were good; the flying looked better than any Superman movie ever. But nothing that made me say out loud, "Oh, cooool" or "That is awesome!"<br /><br />And the story really fell flat. In fact, it was almost a re-do of Lex Luthor's quest for real estate in Superman 1. I've seen much better stories in the Justice League animated series than Superman Returns. Much better.<br /><br />Some of the situations in Superman Returns were very far fetched, i.e. (without revealing any spoiling details): Superman crashing via meteor back to earth with no public fanfare; Richard White rescuing Lois in a sea plane; Luthor Waltzing right into the Fortress of Solitude. I'd have liked to have seen more realistic scenarios like the excellent job David Goyer and Chris Nolan did with Batman Begins...just...more realistic.<br /><br />So perhaps Singer should have stuck with X Men 3 and let someone else have Superman Returns...but that is not the way the cookie crumbled. In fact, Singer has signed on for Superman: The Man of Steel scheduled for release in 2009.<br /><br />Brandon Routh was a pretty good Superman preserving the Christopher Reeve portrayal almost mirror image. Kevin Spacey was a good Lex. And Kate Bosworth was a bit young looking for Lois.<br /><br />After saying all this, I didn't think it was a bad movie. It just fell far short of what I expected. And that basically took a smile and turned it upside down.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Very nice movie.  Very impressive graphics and story-line.  I enjoyed the fact that they did not scrimp on the plotline and story-line.  I love movies not afraid to be over two hours.<br /><br />Can't say I love this genre of films.  I'm actually very bored by them. I have not seen every Superman movie.  My best memory of seeing the original Superman, back in the 80's was when I accidentally went in the wrong theater, showing the film, 1 1/2 hours already into the movie, and not realizing it.  My date and I sat there, very confused.  As a kid, I didn't realize that when you show up on time, usually the movie hasn't started yet.  Maybe we were 5 or ten minutes late, and thought it had started already.  Perhaps that when I first started avoiding these types of movies.<br /><br />My buddy Bobby Asslong recommended this movie.  He stood in line for a midnight showing when it launched at the bigscreen.  I would never do this, let alone, for a regular screening.  But to each his own.<br /><br />I give this 4 starts for excellent quality and story-line.<br /><br />MC White said:  Super!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Like the citizens of Metropolis, I didn't realize how much I missed the Man of Steel until I once again witnessed Clark Kent (Brandon Routh) running down Main Street, shedding his clothes and setting sail to save the day for the first time in Bryan Singer's big, beautiful, fast paced, masculine yet very touching take on the Superman franchise, "Superman Returns."<br />Routh's Kent/Superman, a superb creation of director Bryan Singer ("Usual Suspects," "XMen"), Dan Harris ("Imaginary Heroes) and others, is as usual na?ve, befuddled and endearing as Kent but this Superman, along with being strong, upstanding, driven and sure of himself, is also very emotional and human...a mensch: outwardly a product of the love bestowed upon him by his adoring adopted mother (Eva Marie Saint) and his girlfriend Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).<br />Much of "SR" is jaw-droppingly gorgeous thanks to the superior work of Production Designer Guy Dyas and the visuals of Newton Thomas Sigel ("Three Kings," "Brothers Grimm"). In fact the first rescue sequence involving an aborted launch of a space shuttle with Lois on hand is truly amazing both in physical execution and emotional impact. Also of note is the way in which Superman levitates throughout the film: on the one hand almost balletic in movement on the other very much akin to the mechanical movement of a heliocopter.<br />"Superman Returns" and I for one am glad he's back.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.<br /><br />Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:<br /><br />Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.<br /><br />Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.<br /><br />Once said "continent" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.<br /><br />Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?<br /><br />Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.<br /><br />The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.<br /><br />Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!<br /><br />I could have made a better movie with my camera phone.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>I'm fortunate enough to have seen the original Superman and Superman II in the theaters when they were first released. Those two films introduced me to the fantasy world of comics and I haven't left since. Those first two films were followed up by two more inferior sequels that I don't even want to acknowledge. Since then the franchise has languished in development hell for almost two decades. Even with the early success of Tim Burton's two Batman films (again I shan't acknowledge the three inferior sequels afterwards) the Superman franchise still couldn't get back onto the silver screen. With comic book film adaptations all the rage and Batman even getting its best and truest film adaptation from 2005's Batman Begins, Superman finally gets back into the theaters within the capable hands of Bryan Singer (director of the first two X-men films).<br /><br />Bryan Singer must've felt like the rest of the Superman's fans since he clearly establishes the timeline of Superman Returns after Superman II. Nowhere to be found were any hints or talk of Richard Pryor's character and the evil-inducing kryptonite or any mention of Nuclear Man. No, Superman Returns follows-up Superman's climactic fight against General Zod and his followers with a sudden jaunt out into the deepest reaches of space to find his home planet of Krypton. He leaves Earth and its people without a hint of goodbye and most of all leaves the woman he loves without any warning. Lois Lane wasn't very happy about that turn of events and she tries to move on with her life partly by writing a Pulitzer Prize winning editorial proclaiming the reasons "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman". The film doesn't dwell too much on Superman's trip back to Earth after discovering that Krypton's not much more than a cosmic graveyard and that he truly was the Last Son of Krypton. The rest of the film was pretty much Superman trying to reintegrate himself both as Superman and as Clark Kent within Earth's society. The film does show that the world may have changed since he left for Krypton five years prior, but in the end the world truly does still need Superman.<br /><br />Bryan Singer tried to balance continuing the franchise as a direct sequel thus minimizing exposition and sequences introducing the origins of Superman. When he does fall back on origin themes he does so through flashback and dialogue that seemlessly blends in with the rest of the story. He also uses to great effect the late Marlon Brando's speech to his son Kal-El about his purpose and destiny. If there's a flaw to be seen in the overall product it would be the plot concocted by --- the recently released from prison --- Lex Luthor to use Superman's Kryptonian legacy to make himself ruler of the world. It's not a small feat, but the overall feel of this part of the story seems abit too much of a rehash of the original plot Luthor came-up with in the first film. This time Luthor doesn't just go for just one coastline of the Continental US, but the whole world. One would think that Luthor would've come up with something abit more creative while he was in prison. I can't fault that part of the storyline too much since it had one of the awe-inspiring sequences showing Superman's true power levels. I won't spoil the sequence, but that scene Superman showed that Superman really has earned the label he's been given since the first two films: Superman as godlike.<br /><br />Really, Superman Returns shows less of Superman's human side, though it shows through when he's Clark Kent, and more of his alien legacy as an outsider whose abilities and unflinching principles makes him out to be some sort of alien Messiah. This was clearly evident in Brando's speech as Jor-El in how Kal-el (Superman) was his only son and his gift to humanity who has in them the capacity to do greater good if only shown the light. I'm sure I won't be the only one to pick up on this. But it's not a wrong conclusion to arrive at. Superman's always been seen throughout his history as some sort of Christ figure. There's a scene in the film where he flies out of Earth's gravity and just floats in space looking down on Earth. It's a scene that evokes a god looking down on his charges. This has always made Superman even more of an outsider than Batman. Batman has his humanity to keep him grounded. Superman doesn't play on being human, but he knows that he'll never truly be one with the people of Earth yet he still protects them as if he is one. If there's a sequel to this film, I would dearly like to see how they take this messianic complexity of Superman and continue exploring it.<br /><br />But enough with the serious part of the film. Despite the flaw in parts of the film's plot, the audience reaction to the film was definitely positive. We cheered and laughed and clapped throughout the film. The action sequences didn't overwhelm the picture, but when they were there it seemed seamless. I didn't nitpick once about how Singer and crew portrayed Superman's abilities. Two action sequences --- one in the first half and the other close to the end --- had me cheering and speechless at the same time. Whatever amount of money they spent creating those scenes were money well-spent. In the end I wished that they'd added a few more action-oriented scenes, but I was glad they pulled off the ones they did have with aplomb.<br /><br />The performances by the two leads, Brandon Routh as Superman and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, were more than adequate. One could see that Routh tried channeling Christopher Reeve as Superman and Clark Kent and to some success. But at times it showed too much like mimicking and less a creative impulse. I'm sure if the franchise gets a go ahead ofr a sequel Routh will get a chance to make the character his own. But his performance was well done in any case and he showed a presence that befit a Superman. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor would've been brilliant if he'd decided upon one look for Luthor. At times he looked like an extension of Gene Hackman's diabolical car-salesman performance. Then there'd be times he resembled something close to the characterization similar in theme to Lex Luthor as savior of mankind against a godlike alien being whose mere presence hinders humanity from reaching beyond its mortal ken. In the end, Spacey's performance was great for pulling off Luthor as Superman's greatest arch-nemesis, but it would've been even greater if he had settled on which Luthor-persona to portray. Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was serviceable. Again she didn't perform badly, but she didn't put a stamp on the character to make it her own. I think that was one thing I noticed in all the performances. They were well done, but in the end they seemed to honor the past performances of the cast from the first two films abit much instead of taking their roles and running with it. Hopefully this will change with any subsequent sequels.<br /><br />Even with these flaws in the film I cannot give Superman Returns a grade less than great. For even with the flaws, Superman Returns didn't disappoint and followed through on the hype surrounding it. It might not have reached the pinnacle and bar set by Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but it does reintroduces with a bang an iconic figure in pop-culture history back into the limelight. Superman the film franchise might have been gone from Earth far longer than the character was in the film, but he was welcome back with cheering applause from an audience both young and old. Despite the current generations ambivalence towards straight-laced heros and types, Superman Returns showed that the world truly does need Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>In a post 9-11 world, we have usually taken our heroes (comic book or otherwise) with a healthy dose of derangement.  Comic book hits like "Spiderman," "Batman Begins" and Bryan Singer's "X-Men" films thrived and fostered on the darker, deformed sides of their eponymous superpowered warriors and the weighty themes of their stories.  And usually, the films were tremendous, as superhero, comic book flicks grew and matured beyond the juvenile stereotypes that the general public had for them.  But, for a while, it seemed we would no longer buy into heroes who were earnestly virtuous, and who did righteous deeds because they felt they had a responsibility to a higher cause.<br /><br />But then, "Superman Returns" rolled around.  And even though it bears a couple nagging flaws, the most glaring of which is a somewhat sluggish pace, "Superman Returns" is by far one of the most ravishing, bustling and joyous films in years.  Its' by equal turns exciting and romantic, and in a refreshing change of pace, director Bryan Singer does not drive his film with angst, but with sincerity.  Not only will you believe again that a man can fly (the special effects and set pieces are spectacular), but that a man can be unambiguously moral.  The biggest triumph of this new "Superman" is it reminds all of us that it just might be possible to be Supermen on our own.<br /><br />The film opens with the return of Superman (Brandon Routh, ably filling the shoes of the late Christopher Reeves) after a five year search to find the devastated remains of his homeworld.  Back in Metropolis, the Man of Steel, tries to reconnect with Lois Lane (a superb Kate Bosworth), only to find she has moved on to a new man (James Marsden) with whom she has sired a child.  But in the background, the malevolent Lex Luthor (a smarmy, gleefully vicious Kevin Spacey) has bought his way out of prison to fashion a new scheme to kill Superman and conquer the world.<br /><br />Singer, and his writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, work hard, and succeed, to reestablish Superman for a new generation by first and foremost breathing new life into the romance between Supes and Lois Lane.  Routh and Bosworth are dynamic as two star-crossed lovers learning to how to relate to one another again and their performances yield emotional, heartfelt dividends.  Meanwhile, Spacey, a Singer Veteran from "The Usual Suspects," has a ball as Lex Luthor, happily chewing scenery with the efficiency of a born baddie.  All told, "Superman Returns" with  surely be fondly remembered as one of the best films of the summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>"You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but, everyday I hear people crying for one."<br />- The Man Of Steel tells (on again, off again girlfriend) Lois Lane one of the many reasons why "Superman Returns"<br /><br />Twenty-five summers after the release of "Superman II" & another roughly ten to fifteen years trying to get the project off the ground, Superman finally makes the leap back to the big screen in the aptly titled "Superman Returns". The results are mixed (I actually give the film ***1/2 stars).<br /><br />After the events of "Superman II", "Superman Returns" starts off with the Man Of Steel returning to Earth after a five year absence. It looked like astronmers had found the remains of what looked to be the burnt out planet of Krypton, Supes' his homeworld & Kal-El had to find out if anyone was home. Finding out that he truly is the last of his people, Superman returns to his real home, Earth.<br /><br />As for Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, he's free after Superman fails to show up for his parole hearing.<br /><br />"How much do you think that pisses off Superman?", asks Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />"A lot.", replies an unamused Clark Kent, stunned by the news.<br /><br />Lex is also back in the green after swindling an inheritance from a millionairess, early on in the film.<br /><br />In the wake of Superman's mysterious dissapearance, the people of Metropolis realize that maybe they don't need a Superman afterall. That's the big question that Big Blue has to face. Will people accept his return? Do they really need him?<br /><br />Things don't actually look up for Clark Kent on his return to "The Daily Planet". Sure, he got his old job back, but, it's a one two punch that sends him to the local bar, in search of a drink, after finding out that Lois Lane has written a Pulitzer Prize winning essay on why the world doesn't need Superman, has moved on with her life with her five year old son & is engaged to Richard White, Perry's nephew, associate editor to "The Daily Planet", & father (?) to Lois' son.<br />It's at the local sports bar, having a beer with Jimmy Olsen (the only one that seems happy to see him back), & a dangerous mishap with a NASA space shuttle, that Clark Kent makes up his mind to bring Superman back into the public eye.<br /><br />While most of the people of Earth embrace the return of Superman, two people aren't happy to see his arrival.<br /><br />Lois Lane, originally, heartbroken & now, angry has quite a few questions for her former boyfriend.<br /><br />As for Lex Luthor, he's making a huge land grab that will sink most of America underwater, thanks to some Kryptonian crystals pilfered from Superman's Fortress Of Solitude & Kryptonite stolen from a local museum.<br /><br />Of course, it's not a Superman film without Lois getting into trouble & all hell breaking loose thereafter. After some snooping around, trying to find out the cause of a mysterious citywide blackout, Lois, with her son in tow, accidently lands on a yacht that belongs to a freshly showered millonaire.<br /><br />"Lex Luthor."<br />"Lois Lane?!"<br />"Your bald."<br /><br />It's up to Superman to save Lois, her son (who may or might not have the White family blood running through him), & the U.S. of A from Lex Luthor's "Century 21" making disaster.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is one of those films that should be epic & fun, but, comes off big & by the numbers. I expected a lot more from director, Bryan Singer. There are quite a few loopholes to the film. "Returns" can't hold a match to the first two "Superman" films (those are still tops).<br /><br />"Superman Returns"' main & ultimately crippling problem is that it lacks the charm, warmth, & humor of "Superman: The Movie" & "Superman II" & this problem spreads throughout the film's lead charcter's. The chemistry between Lois & Superman is practically non-existent (they don't even kiss for God's sake!), & the big battle between Lex & Supes is lame & could be akin to a New York gang mugging.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a passable job in the title role, but, in some scenes it seems as if Routh is doing an empty impression of Reeve. The classic Superman flyby that ends each "Super" film is mechanically done here. Oddly, of all the character's in the film Superman gets the least lines. The scenes where Superman secretly looks in on Lois & her family, & the scene where he watches, what might be his own son, sleeping are actually, & I hate to say it, a bit creepy.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is too young to be playing Lois Lane. Her Lane is more of a smoking, soccer mom than a hard-nosed reporter. The thin plotline of Lois' son possibly being Superman's is just ludicrous. Remember, Superman gave up his powers in "II" in order to be with Lois. Only after learning about the Phantom Zone criminals taking over the world, did Supes go back & retrieve his super powers.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is one of the saving graces of "Superman Returns" (the action scenes are the other saving grace). His Luthor is more inline with Gene Hackman's portrayal than Spacey admits. However, Spacey doesn't bring that sense of menace that both Hackman & Michael Rosenbaum (Luthor in "Smallville") to their roles.  The scene where Luthor discovers Lois & her son aboard his yacht & the scene on the island near film's end are priceless. Parker Posey is dissmissable as Kitty (Posey was better as Gail Weathers in "Scream 3"). Valerie Perrine's, Miss Teschmacher & Ned Beatty's, bumbling Otis are sorely missed.<br /><br />The action scenes are pretty much what makes "Superman Returns" worth watching, especially the shuttle/airplane sequence.<br /><br />Superman's return is a welcome one but it's not an epic one.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" flies home on DVD on November 28, 2006. Two editions will be available both in the 2.40:1 film aspect ratio. The first is either wide or full screen & contains just the film. The 2 disc edition has "Requiem For Krypton" - a 3 hr. doc on the making of "Superman Returns" & other features.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I love comic book movies, but this one just didn't do much for me.  At almost 3 hours long, I was expecting much more.  Brandon Routh did a great job as Superman and Clark Kent, and I was able to buy Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, but Kevin Spacey was a little too over the top as Lex Luthor.  He came off too much as a "bumbling genius" and the film never really portrayed him as much of a real threat.  In fact, the entire Lex Luthor plot could have been removed from the film entirely and it would not have made too much of a difference.<br /><br />This film is mainly about Superman's five year absence from Earth and his relationship with Lois Lane and her son.  There are a lot of scenes of Superman defeating various crimes and people cheering, all of which has been done before in the previous films.  The only new take on this we have are better special effects.  Now I know you have to show this in a Superman movie, but there was nothing that jumped out at me to give me that inner excitement and say to myself "wow, awesome!."<br /><br />While not a bad movie, "Superman Returns" just doesn't live up to the hype of 10 years of production and a huge budget.  There are too many plot holes, too much camp (Lois Lane's son kissing superman on the forehead when he's sick...), and not enough of a villain.  This movie really could have done better if Bryan Singer had demonstrated more weakness in Superman.  Where's the suspense if Superman is never really shown in danger?<br /><br />Ultimately, most general audiences will enjoy this film and I am glad I saw it, but I don't have any interest in sitting through it again or owning it on DVD.  But if you're expecting this to be one of the best films of the year and you've been waiting to see it for a decade, you'll likely be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>"Superman Returns", the long-awaited NEW chapter of the Superman Saga, rewrites Superman's cinema history, occurring after the events of "Superman II" (III and IV have been thankfully discarded), and a 5-year absence of the Man of Steel, as he explored the remains of Krypton, searching for something tangible from his past. The film introduces Brandon Routh (1979- ) as the latest incarnation of Krypton's Last Son, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Christopher Reeve while in the Kent identity, and an aloof, almost Christ-like benevolence as Superman.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris ("X-Men" I and II) wanted to create not only an original new chapter in the Saga, but a sincere homage to Richard Donner's definitive first "Superman", as well, digitally inserting clips of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, utilizing John Williams' famous theme (for the fifth time in the franchise), showing pictures of 'Pa Kent' Glenn Ford on the the Kent Farm's mantle, and repeating key dialog from the first film (Superman's well-known advice about flying brought laughter and applause from theater audiences). While "Superman II" and "Superman III" composer Ken Thorne, and "Superman IV" composer Alexander Courage (who wrote the original "Star Trek" TV theme), had been hamstrung, creatively, by being forced to simply 'adapt' John Williams' soaring music into the sequels' storylines (with decreasing success, in each film), frequent Singer composer John Ottman actually expanded upon Williams' vision, adding his own themes and motifs, creating a score even more vaulting, heroic, and spiritual.<br /><br />To those critics who would claim "Superman Returns" followed the first Superman film too slavishly, there was a major change, barely noticed when the film debuted; the 'take' on the Man of Steel's superpowers came from the mid-eighties' comic book revamp of the character...No longer did Kal-El come to Earth already possessing "Powers and Abilities Far Beyond Mortal Men"; he, instead, was a Kryptonian solar "battery", powered by Earth's yellow sun, who would not manifest his abilities until sufficiently 'charged' (which was why young Clark would be seen in the film wearing glasses; he actually needed them, as he was quite frail...as would any child be, of Kryptonian heritage...baby Kal-El could never have lifted Pa Kent's truck, saving his life, in this version!)<br /><br />Superman would soon find that things had changed dramatically in his absence. Lois Lane (portrayed by Kate Bosworth as much calmer and more level-headed than Margot Kidder, though incongruously younger-looking), feeling betrayed by his never having said goodbye, has won a Pulitzer Prize for her editorial "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", now shares her life with Perry White's nephew, Richard ("X-Men" star James Marsden), and has a frail five-year-old son (portrayed by young Tristan Lake Leabu, who is a pivotal character in the plotline). Lex Luthor (a very engaging if sinister Kevin Spacey), long released from custody (since key witness Superman never appeared at his trial to testify), bilks an aged millionairess (legendary 'Lois Lane' Noel Neill) on her deathbed, and uses his new fortune to return to the Fortress of Solitude and steal the Krypton crystals in the 'ultimate' land scheme. The only friendly faces around are his stepmother, Martha Kent (the always wonderful Eva Marie Saint), Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), who, in a nostalgic scene, takes Clark to a bar run by Jack (TV's original 'Jimmy Olsen') Larson, and Perry White (played with rumpled charm and a twinkle in his eye, by Frank Langella).<br /><br />After a truly spectacular rescue sequence, involving a space shuttle, a disintegrating airplane, and a stadium full of people, Superman regains the public's confidence (another scene that brought cheers from the theater audience, the night I viewed the film)...but Lois would require far more time...and Luthor plans to kill billions, beginning with Superman.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is a stunning, brilliantly conceived achievement, offering not only the expected (and superbly created) 'super heroics', but a deeply satisfying, uplifting 'morality tale', of life, death, and redemption, as well. Brandon Routh, while not as charismatic as Christopher Reeve, proves himself more than capable as the Man of Steel (although I DO prefer the old Superman uniform over the Speedo-inspired new look!)<br /><br />While I believe the first Christopher Reeve "Superman" movie is still the best film of the series, thus far, this newest production runs a very close second, in my opinion...<br /><br />With generally enthusiastic reviews, and a world-wide box office gross well over $350,000,000, there is definitely life in the Superman franchise, yet!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I've got to admit that I didn't expect much from Superman Returns regardless of the talent involved.  Being a fan of his work on the first two X-Men films, Bryan Singer is an excellent choice to helm the silver screen return of the classic super hero, but sadly, the film never reaches the lofty heights that it sets out to attain.  Newcomer Brandon Routh is a great choice as the Man of Steel, who returns to Earth after a five year absence to find that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on, as has the rest of the world.  The one person who hasn't truly moved on however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who has his own diabolical plans, including one that Superman might not be able to stop.  Routh is good, Spacey is a hoot, Bosworth is a bit miscast, and the rest of the cast, including James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Kal Penn, and Sam Huntington, are quite good.  The story, crafted by Singer and his X2: X-Men United cohorts Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, is a bit predictable but offers some nice surprises while paying homage to Richard Donner's 1978 original film, and unlike many comic book films, has actual heart to it.  The special effects are spectacular, and as a whole the film is better than I had anticipated.  It doesn't achieve what the original Superman, X2, Spider-Man 2, or Batman Begins does, but it's pretty close nevertheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>Superman Returns is a strange movie to watch.  Gone is the square jawed linebacker sized hero.  Instead, newcomer Brandon Routh gives you a Superman that is more like Michelangelo's David: an almost sylph-like figure, that floats beautifully above us all, watching, protecting.  In doing so, the movie conveys, intentional or not, a great loneliness and vulnerability in the Man of Steel, but also, always, the sense of Duty.  Essentially, I liked Routh's version of the great hero.  But the rest of the casting is not very good.  Spacey and Langella, two really fine actors, are miscast.  They never seem to capture the elusive "whatever" that director Bryan Singer was able to capture with Routh.  Spacey is viscious at Lex Luthor, but he has no style.  Luthor has to have style, but Spacey gives us a villain that is just a dead eyed figure belonging to another genre: noir. Langella seems like he's on medication, and not the hyper editor we should expect.  Only Parker Posey, as Luthor's associate and babe Kitty, seems to remember that this is a story based upon a comic book.  Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is also miscast.  There were times I felt most of the supporting actors were sleepwalking through their roles. The story itself is somewhat incoherent, but I chalk that up to the film being something of an intended re-introduction (and grab bag) to the characters and elements of the Superman story.  However, despite all of these missteps, weirdly, the film works.  I guess, perhaps, because we all want a Superman up there, watching, protecting us all. And Superman Returns does remember that One Essential part of the story, and returns to it, smartly, again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>When I first saw the previews for "Superman Returns," I got really nostalgic for the "Superman" I remember seeing while I grew up, Christopher Reeve.  I even went out and bought first the Reeve flick just so I could refresh myself on that movie and introduce my daughter to Reeve's version of the hero.  I knew that director Bryan Singer and his crew would have a tough row to hoe considering how loved Reeve has been since donning the red cape and blue tights.  I was even hoping at one point to be let down by this new vision of one of the world's most famous superheroes.<br /><br />Instead, I saw a film that pays homage not only to Christopher Reeve's "Superman," but also to the old serial starring George Reeves that most of my generation and definitely these young kids today haven't seen or heard of.  Singer takes great care of forming newcomer Brandon Routh's version of Superman into a completely new being with a consistent nostalgic nod to those in the role before him.  Granted, some liberties are taken with the character, but they don't take away from the mythos of the original comic hero.<br /><br />The story goes like this:  Superman, after finding out that astronomers think they have located his home planet of Kryptonite, heads off to see it for himself.  He returns five years later and empty-handed, not finding what he is looking for.  Almost immediately, he begins doing what he always did:  fight for truth, justice, and the American way.  Some quibble over a line delivered in the film that refers to "truth, justice, and all that stuff" as being unpatriotic, but I felt that the line was rendered in a fashion that didn't take away from the "American way."  Besides, real fans of Superman know that he is definitely for the American way, no matter who tries to make him politically correct.  Anyway, while saving the planet as usual, Supe's old foe, Lex Luthor, is once again planning to take over the world, Lois Lane is engaged and has a young son, and Jimmy Olsen is still full of giddy, childlike innocence and ignorance.<br /><br />Routh was perfectly cast as the Man of Steel.  He has a look that harkens back to Christopher Reeve, but manages to make the character his own.  Kate Bosworth has received a lot of flack for being cast as Lois Lane, but she, much like everyone else in this flick, had some very big shoes to fill.  I miss Margot Kidder's raspy, sassy Lois, but Bosworth does a wonderful job no less.  I also longed to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, but Kevin Spacey is sinisterly devious in his execution of the role.  Much like in the older "Superman" flicks, Luthor delivers some of the funniest lines and relishes in his wickedness.  Sam Huntington is game as Jimmy Olsen, though his role is considerably smaller than everybody else's in this flick.  Frank Langella and James Marsden play father and son, Perry and Richard White.  Richard is engaged to Lois, and although Superman is a little miffed about this, he doesn't linger on it long once he realizes that Richard is a decent and caring man.  Parker Posey plays Kitty Kowalski.  She's no Valerie Perrine, but she has enough goofy charm to steal plenty of thunder from Spacey's Luthor during the film.  There will never be another Otis, performed originally by Ned Beatty, but Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar Go To Whitecastle) is the only recognizable member of a gaggle of thugs that Luthor keeps with him.  Few words are spoken amongst the group, but they have a very intense sequence in the film when they meet up with Superman.<br /><br />Singer was careful not to offend fans of the older versions of "Superman," maintaining the goofy charm of Clark Kent and the "big boy scout" quips by Superman such as nagging Lois about smoking.  He spent a lot of time allowing us to see Superman in flight, giving the audience a healthy dose of trips into outerspace, skimming the ocean with Lois, and catching falling victims in mid-air.  He also pumped up Supe's eye beams, putting them to frequent, and visually fun, use.  We get to check out the X-ray vision, outrunning speeding bullets, stopping speeding bullets, and even a cool flight through fire.<br /><br />Much like Sam Raimi with the "Spiderman" films, I feel that Bryan Singer was truly the best choice for taking command of a project like "Superman Returns."  He obviously loves the character, and respects the old TV shows, movies, and the comics.  This movie was much better than I ever expected and looks to be a very solid beginning to a new series of "Superman" flicks.  Hopefully Singer will be able to make more of these films and give them the treatment they deserve.  He managed to make a superhero flick with heart, and that's a hard thing to do these days considering the ease of CGI use.  Most directors, as did Brett Ratner with the latest "X-Men" installment, dump storyline for action sequences.  Singer serves up plenty of both in this latest entry into the comic movie world.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great story, light humor, and plenty of action.  Also, for all of you Christopher Reeve fans out there who think you shouldn't tamper with perfection, just know that "Superman Returns" realizes where it came from and does justice to the past.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>That doesn't make for a great movie title perhaps. But, the truth of the situation is that (despite what the intro to the George Reeves TV show said) "Superman" is the disguise, and it is Clark Kent who Kal-El really is...adopting a disguise that he wears when he conducts his super-feats, to protect his own identity and privacy, and to protect his family.<br /><br />I enjoyed Superman Returns a great deal, but it didn't ring perfectly for me in just this one area. While Clark returns from his 5-year voyage, to his parents' farm first, and spends time with his Mom, and then goes back to Metropolis and gets his reporting job back at the Daily Planet, he doesn't actually do any investigative reporting, as he is well known to do. On the other hand, perhaps he's just out of it, from his long trip, just a little. It's a small thing, this detail, in a story that otherwise worked quite well for me. It's clear from Clark's actions that it is as Clark, rather than Superman, that he wants to interact with Lois.<br /><br />Our story opens with Clark returning from a 5-year trip, to Krypton and back. He describes Krypton as a "graveyard" to his mother upon his return. After his short stay with his mother, he heads back to Metropolis, where he gets his old job back, and slowly falls back into his interrupted old life...but with the twists that a five year gap can bring: the love of his life has a child, a fiance, and has moved on.<br /><br />In the meantime, Lex Luthor has also been toiling away. He has a plan (you'll recognize an old theme in this plan of his), and he needs--and steals--Kryptonian technology to execute it. When he hears that his old nemesis has returned, he adapts his plan so as to exact his revenge. Lex's grudge against Superman has strains of truth to it, as he compares Superman to the Greek Titans, and himself to Prometheus...it bears some thinking about.<br /><br />I can't say much more, without spoiling the movie for you. So, let me close with a few other comments. The movie sounds great, re-using the old, familiar themes. The acting...well, it's all reasonably solid, and no one should ever be expecting Oscar performances in these types of movies. The attention paid to the Superman mythos was great to see, from the small touches like the photograph in the Kent home, to the familiar look of the opening credits. And the memoriam in the closing credits was nice to see.<br /><br />It's summertime! Beat the heat, get into the theatre, and enjoy the movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I went into the theatre really not expecting alot, after seeing the trailers of the movie I found that it was very limited and honestly the only real thing that I knew about "Returns" was that Kevin Spacey plays the notorious villian, Lex Luther.<br /><br />Bryan Singer obviously took an advantage of his large budget of - 260 million and really put it to outstanding use, the special effects, visuals and Technology was obviously advanced from the beginning credits. I would say that it is up there with Peter Jackson's "King Kong" and George Lucas's "Star Wars: Episode 3".<br /><br />The only flaw that I really noticed from this film was the acting - not that it was bad but I thought that lacked a certian Chistopher Reeve. It's not that Brandon Routh was a "Bad" Superman, but I thought that he lacked the heart and overall emotion that Christopher Reeve brought the charactor. I thought that they might have brought in a more experienced actor to play such an important role, but I have to admit that he sure did LOOK like Superman. I think that I am just such a Reeve fan that I would be saying this about anyone who played the part. I just think that it was a hard path for Routh to follow after Reeve had the uniform on for so long. Other than that the acting by everyone else was by far up to par,Kate Bosworth played a very good Lois Lane, Parker Posey was absolutly flawless in playing Kitty and of corse Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was a perfect fit. Even the smaller roles were very well played. Overall though I do believe that this last installment of the Superman film series does lack the heart that it showed in the first couple of films.<br /><br />Overall the story was just like any Super Hero movie should be, you know how they go. Villian wants to destroy the world, good guy fights bad guy to SAVE the world, good guy wins. So I just told you the VERY short version, the actual version is about two hours and thirty minutes long. Every Minute is worth watching.<br /><br />This very well could be the Biggest Blockbuster film of the summer. You dont want to miss "Returns" it is alot of fun to watch on the big screen.<br /><br />P.S This movie, though PG-13 is not rough what so ever and it is most definatly appropriate for Children of about 6 or 7 and above. It is possibly the lightest PG-13 film that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Grade: B</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>Clearly, what the director is trying to do is make a superman for a new generation of kids by stealth. The actors are made younger than what they would have been if the film had continued from the 1970s version. What is over 40 years in this movie is a five years.<br /><br />It has very good filming something I expected; the special effects are good. The problem is nothing is particularly original here.<br /><br />The story itself is as weak as the first one but at least that was original. It gets close at times to being almost the same story. The script for an adult, I do not think is particularly good. None of the characters were interesting.<br /><br />The acting is average.<br /><br />I would class it as a remake by stealth made for a new generation.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>My son loved this film, from the bullet bouncing off of SM's eye, to the fact that "Lex Luther was really a scientist".  He provided me an excited commentary throughout the whole film, having seen it b4, and asked me questions on supermaniana that I knew from years of reading the comic at his age.<br /><br />For myself, I thought it was a reasonably good story:  SM returns to the Earth after a mysterious absence, during which the other characters have moved on with their lives.  Lois is married, angry at him, and has a son.  Meanwhile, Lex is at his normally evil plans, which are genuinely earthshaking in this film.  So SM saves the day, with a lot of good suspense filled in.<br /><br />There is no way, of course, that I would have bought this were it not for my son.  That being said, it was such a delight to watch it with him that I was carried away by the peculiar magic of this film, which is a mark of its success.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>After finally seeing this movie, I think Brandon Routh was unjustly raked across the coals.  I thought he did a good job as Kent/Superman-mainly because he was seriously channeling Reeve's performance.  As far as Lois, Bosworth was a little on the young side and she didn't bring anything unique to her character, but her performance didn't turn me off either.  The film did bite off a little too much from the first Superman and when it did it one too many times I was irritated.  The Plot...well, all right I didn't understand the master plot.  But Lex Luther and his henchmen obviously were the inspiration to such cartoons like Pinky and the Brain.  What are we going to do tomorrow?  Take over the world.  Speaking of not bringing anything new to the table what happened to Spacey?  He used to bring such chrisma and presence to the screen.  Now it seems like he plays all his characters the same.<br />The main problem with bringing Superman to the table now is...well, we already get our Superman fix in Smallville-which is a pretty darn good show, by the way.  So when I saw the trailer for the movie I didn't want to see it.  I like following my weekly soap from the WB.<br />So what do we have?  A few miscasting and a M.I.A. plot.  And still I was entertained.  Go figure.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Superman Returns, up up and away, to the big screen once again.  I admit I was a little uncertain about the portrayal of our beloved hero by the relatively new actor Brandon Routh, but after I saw it, all fears were laid to rest.  Kevin Spacey also did a splendid job as Lex Luthor.  I honestly have no complaints about this movie.  This time around, the filmmakers showcase Superman's powers better than ever before (at least partially due to advances in filmmaking).  You really get the idea that Superman is the king of all heroes, with a heart of solid gold.  He is truly worthy of leading the Justice League (also fiction, I know, but what's wrong with a little fantasy?).  This movie is a real treat, and a very moving experience.  If you are a fan of superhero or action movies, this movie belongs in your collection without a doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>There's a lot that is supremely well done about this expensive-looking 2006 revival of the long dormant blockbuster franchise, and having the talented Bryan Singer ("X-Men", "The Usual Suspects") helm it was a smart decision since he has proven abilities in creating a singular cinematic vision without compromising the integrity of the story at its core. However, the overriding challenge centers more on the somber, almost reverential tone that Singer has felt a need to imbue the film. That's not to say there are not thrilling moments or even some comic ones, but the most pervasive sense in the epic-length movie is the priority placed in sustaining the mythic stature of Superman and reusing familiar elements from the previous films to ensure we are not disappointed with any possible discontinuity with the legend. I just wish Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris could have looked a little deeper into the irony of a superhero now that we are dealing with a greater sense of ambiguity between good and evil.<br /><br />The film picks up the story about five years after the end of 1980's "Superman II" as the superhero returns to Earth after a lengthy sabbatical in which he was futilely trying to find survivors of his home planet Krypton. The world has fallen into inevitable chaos in the interim, but more pertinent, his longtime love Lois Lane has moved on with her life. Still a star reporter at the Daily Planet with a Pulitzer Prize in hand, she now lives with fellow reporter Richard White, the nephew of editor Perry White, and has a young sickly son. Meanwhile, arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, released from prison, embarks on a diabolical plan to create a new continent and destroy North America using the Kryptonian crystals he steals from the Fortress of Solitude. From this elaborate set-up, the plot covers pretty familiar ground for most of the duration, but it is punctuated by some amazing sequences like the young hero's discovery of his powers over gravity in a cornfield, the derring-do rescue of a 737 with Lois aboard, and Superman's misty-eyed airborne seduction of Lois. The story takes an intriguing turn when things look the bleakest for our hero in the last third, but it all ends with the door unsurprisingly wide open for a sequel.<br /><br />Although he has a tendency to look a bit glassy-eyed, Brandon Routh turns out to be an ideal choice for a sincere and somewhat melancholy take on the icon. When he reverts to alter-ego Clark Kent, he seems to be channeling his predecessor Christopher Reeve's bumbling charm, which makes these gratefully brief scenes feel a bit derivative. Given Kevin Spacey's innate tendency toward hamminess, I am surprised that he doesn't seem more inspired by Luthor's utter villainy and satirical sense of cruelty. It's as if the fun has been exhumed out of his performance. Following in Valerie Perrine's footsteps, Parker Posey plays Luthor's moll with air-headed assurance, though the actress' idiosyncratic persona is not fully utilized here. The most problematic casting, however, comes with Kate Bosworth as Lois. Sincere and as committed as she seems to be in the role, she lacks the gravitas and maturity to be remotely convincing as such an accomplished woman. Eva Marie Saint barely has any screen time as Martha Kent, and outtakes of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's deceased father, are used rather cryptically near the beginning.<br /><br />Not too surprisingly, the film is much more visually lustrous than its inspiration thanks to Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography, Guy Dyas' production design (especially of Metropolis) and the truly superb special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD set has the 154-minute movie on the first disc though unfortunately without a commentary track from Singer, the screenwriters or the principals. The second disc offers extras that would be of interest to fanatics, specifically a five-part documentary that lasts nearly three hours and should have been really edited down for the general audience. There is a quick short, "Resurrecting Jor-El", that is somewhat interesting to see how the Brando footage was prepared, as well as fifteen minutes of relatively uninteresting deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This movie gets plenty of things right but the little kid in peril routine feels very, very old and tired. I also disliked the part of Lois' boyfriend who casually flies planes and lives in a house by the sea, too expensive looking for any non-millonaire (just like Margot Kidder's apartment in the original). The ending, featuring tons of CGI water felt way too artificial also.<br /><br />Still, Routh is perfect for the part and Spacey is great as Luthor. The flying effects make the ones in the old Superman feel rudimentary but after 28 years, that was to be expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Superman Returns" picks up the cinematic tradition of Superman after "Superman: The Movie" (1978) and "Superman II" (1980), ignoring the ill-conceived, campy Superman III & IV movies. We have a new Superman (Brandon Routh), who abandoned his love affair with Lois Lane and his adopted planet to search for his history in the ruins of Krypton. Returning after a 5-year absence, he resumes his reporting  job at Metropolis' "Daily Planet", disguised as mild-mannered Clark Kent. Still pining for star reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), Clark finds that she has taken up with the boss' nephew Richard White (James Marsden), with whom she has a young son. Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey), however, has not abandoned his old ways. Out of prison once again, he plans to become the ultimate real estate mogul by replacing North America with his own brand new continent, aided by crystals he has stolen from Superman's Fortress of Solitude.<br /><br />I think fans will rank "Superman Returns" lower than Superman I & II but higher than the other sequels. The story is fine. Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey, as Lex Luther and his bubble-headed mistress, are sufficiently heavyweight thespians to inject some laughs into the adventure without undermining it. Brandon Routh makes a beautiful superhero, and I think that returning to a young image was probably smart. This is an entertaining movie with a few conspicuous flaws: The action sequences are the least satisfying aspect of the film. They seem compulsory and flat. Lois Lane is bland. She doesn't have enough personality to keep our interest, much less Superman's. Kate Bosworth is clearly too young for the role -though I suspect that is to avoid having Lois look older than the new, youthful Superman. And, at 2 hours 34 minutes, this movie is too long. More interesting action and a more forceful Lois Lane would have saved "Superman Returns" from mediocrity. As it is, a marginal 3 ? stars.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2006 single disc): No bonus features. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Along with fellow director Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer ought to be regarded now as the best American director of films based on comic book heroes. Having enjoyed his two fine filmed adaptations of the "X-Men" comic books, I had little reason to expect anything worse than yet another decent film adaptation from Singer. With "Superman Returns", Bryan Singer pays ample homage to Richard Donner's great 1978 "Superman" film and offers a superb cinematic epic in what promises to be a successful re-launch of a "Superman" film series. Much to my surprise, Singer's riveting new film isn't nearly as dark as his two "X-Men" films, but instead, remains true to the optimism and light comedy which Donner conveyed successfully on screen. Indeed, "Superman Returns" should be regarded as the immediate sequel to the first two "Superman" films starring the late Christopher Reeve, since it is set approximately five years after the second (1980) film, relying once more on John Williams' memorable "Superman" theme (courtesy of young film composer John Ottman, a frequent collaborator of Singer's) and a brief, digitally-realized cameo appearance of Marlon Brando as Superman/Clark Kent's father.<br /><br />Much of "Superman Returns" success is due to a fine script written by Bryan Singer's "X-Men" collaborators, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, and excellent acting from a truly memorable cast featuring distinguished veterans like Eva Marie Saint ("Martha Kent") and Frank Langella ("Perry White"). Although others have unfairly compared Brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent to the late Christopher Reeve's, I found his portrayal quite credible, without trying too much to be quite evocative of his famous predecessor's brilliant portrayal. Without question, the best acting honors goes to actor Kevin Spacey, who brings a disarmingly devilish twist to Lex Luthor, transforming him into a more malevolent villain than Gene Hackman's splendid portrayal. Parker Posey is almost as fine too as Lex's femme fatale companion Kitty Kowalski. Actor Kevin Huntington steals nearly every scene he appears as the earnest, if naive, photojournalist Jimmy Olsen. I also enjoyed Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane, but I will concede that hers isn't nearly as romantic as Margot Kidder's. And I didn't see nearly as much of a romantic chemistry between her and Routh (or with James Marsden, who portrays her fiance, Richard White, Perry White's nephew) as I recall seeing between Kidder and Reeve in the first two "Superman" films.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's direction is superb, though "Superman Returns" isn't as visually exciting as his two "X-Men" films. Still there are plenty of superb action sequences, beginning with Superman's breath-taking rescue of an out-of-control U. S. Air Force Boeing 777. All of these action sequences had the audience's rapt attention during a screening I saw yesterday afternoon. Singer's splendid "Superman Returns"  is undoubtedly a vivid, well-executed re-launch of the Man of the Steel as a potential cinematic franchise along the lines of the James Bond and "Star Wars" films. Having enjoyed Singer's "Superman Returns", I look forward to the prospect of a possible revival of the "Star Trek" movie franchise, which Singer may be at work on soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>It is inevitable that 'Superman Returns' will be compared to the series of 'Superman' movies starring Christopher Reeves that came out in the eighties, but it is best to judge this movie on its own terms.  'Superman Returns' is a fitting return for the caped crusader with advantages and disadvantages from its predecessors.  The technology and grandeur are stunning enough, and the situations he's placed into are dire enough to keep our interest for long stretches throughout.  The acting is a mixed bag, and the side melodrama, while not as compelling as 'Spiderman 2,' is interesting enough to garner its place in the movie.<br /><br />Superman returns after a voyage from the his home planet, Krypton, leaving a void that was filled by Lois Lane with a lover and a boy--and a world returning to injustice.  She is resentful, and he has much explaining to do, but his return is timely enough to coincide with a wrinkle in the justice system:  Lex Luther has found a loop-hole, upon which he may return to the civilized world and wreak havoc.  The causality of his criminal mayhem should raise eyebrows by motive and method:  He wishes to control the world by creating new land via small samples of crystals obtained from Superman's arctic lair.  He will lay waste with his new land creation and implement an environmental terrorism meant to wipe out billions of people and near continents, both submerged under water.  Next, he will be in charge of the new real estate.  The execution of the plot certainly creates substantial tension where the unintentional silliness fails to make us believe...<br /><br />It is Kevin Spacey's portrayal as Lex Luther, however, that bridges much of the credibility gap.  While Gene Hackman's portrayal was thoroughly entertaining as Luther, Spacey's is creepy and menacing.  And the directing has made all the difference.  While madcap director Richard Lester ('A Hard Day's Night', et al) made the 'Superman' series into a glorious cartoon, Bryan Singer turns 'Superman' into a foreboding spectacle.  This is not to say there aren't funny moments, but the general campiness of the Lester fare has been abandoned for a more taut adventure.  The other performances aren't as worthwhile, but they do provide a different venue.  Brandon Routh's Superman provides quiet strength, but little of Reeve's charisma.  He does the duo identities decently, but not spectacularly.  He is nerdy enough as Kent, but only exhudes the strong silent type to sustain his stature.  Similarly, Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane is attractive enough in looks and personality, but there are a few missing nuances as well. Comparisons to Margot Kidder aren't fair because she did well for Lester's carnival atmosphere.  Bosworth gives us an immediate emotional anchor for the film's plots, though. Also, sometimes the plot is fragmented, which can only be justified as a series of warm-ups for the main plot.<br /><br />In sum, 'Superman Returns' does to Superman what 'Batman Begins' does to Batman.  It removes the campiness, returns to basics, and starts to thrill us with ominous adventure.  Only in 'Superman Returns' it doesn't do it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>I came into "Superman Returns" with moderate expectations.  I'm not one of those people who have been yearning for the revitalization of the franchise.  The original "Superman" with Christopher Reeves was a good movie all but destroyed by one of the biggest "cheat" endings in film history.  I hated it when I was a kid, and I still hate that ending--heck, if you can turn back time, it really negates all drama.  "Superman 2," however, was more to my liking--good villains and a nice mix of romance and comedy.  And the less said about the other films in the series, the better.<br /><br />So, "Superman Returns" was a very pleasant surprise.  While still retaining the innocence and cheesiness of tone, the tale has been updated with modern day sensibilities.  Starting five years after "Superman 2"--everyone has moved on in Superman's absence.  Most notably, Lois has a new man and a child.  But not to dwell on the plot, let's just say that it's brisk and amusing.  There are some nice action set pieces--the most memorable being Superman saving a doomed airliner.  I saw this film on the IMAX screen and this was most definitely a highlight in 3D.  And I really enjoyed the way elements of the original film (Brando, anyone?) are incorporated into the film's framework.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a fine job filling the shoes of steel.  Kate Bosworth is surprisingly effective--oh, but why does she have to be so neglectful of Clark?  James Marsden actually has a much better role here than in the final "X-Men"--what a disappointing send off he got there.  As Lois's other man, he is a credible alternative to Superman as a romantic lead.  One of the pleasures of the film is that he's a fully fleshed out and worthy rival--not a boob or a villain!  And Kevin Spacey and Parker Posey have a grand time overplaying the villains--it's especially good to see Posey in a major film.<br /><br />The success of "Superman Returns" is that it honestly develops the relationships--there is a real emotional resonance, real longing, real passion.  It's a smart script that doesn't betray the characters, but richens them--it really adds to the Superman lore.  "Superman Returns" is a sophisticated and solid entry--it's always a great surprise when you don't have to be ashamed of liking a big summer blockbuster.

As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fiance (Marsden) and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman." Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.<br /><br />Before seeing this film I scanned many of the Amazon reviews to see if it was worthwhile and the first thing I noticed was that most of the people wrote very long, detailed reviews. I thought, "Wow, these Superman fans really take ol' Supes seriously." I also noticed that people either seemed to love the film or hate it.<br /><br />Count me as one who loved it. I'm not the biggest Superman fan but I used to collect many of the comics and I loved the first two movies. I only had a half hour to kill last Saturday night but the movie was so good I watched well over an hour without really realizing it and finished it the next night. In other words, the film successfully pulled me into the story and I lost track of time. This is a good sign (especially when the film has so many dramatic parts).<br /><br />The story is an obvious retelling of the Christ story:<br /><br />--  Jor-el gives his son to protect (save) humankind.<br />-- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent).<br />-- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion.<br />-- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent.<br />-- When superman "dies" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.<br /><br />In adition to this, Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizzazz she had when she once believed.<br /><br />Of course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture is two and a half hours long. But it succeeds!<br /><br />The film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous parts, which are truly laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious "It's a bird," "It's a plane" piece).<br /><br />Other things worth commenting on:<br /><br />-- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter "I no longer believe" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role.<br />-- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun.<br />-- Some complain about Lois' fiance and her son, who may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her "shacking up" before marriage can be attributed to her new "I no longer believe" mentality.<br />-- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death.<br />-- I liked the fact that Lois' fiance (Marsden) isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Marsden even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean.<br />-- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White.<br />-- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor, much better than Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe.<br />-- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next cgi action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects.<br />-- "Superman Returns" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($391 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers (!), claiming it should have made $500 million.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I was truly surprised to discover how good "Superman Returns" is. This is an epic and moving superhero film -- sci-fi/fantasy at it's best, in fact. Is it as good or better than the best superhero films? Not only is it as good or better, it's deeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>Good bonus features with this DVD.  Some of the behind-the-scenes footage dates back to the time before director Bryan Singer was even attached to the project.<br /><br />Routh is wonderfully understated as Supes/Clark.  He brings a quiet grace to the role.  Reeves' performance was very comic-bookish by comparison.<br /><br />Singer tosses in some references to his favorite films in "SR".  I betcha a nickel that Singer is a fan of "Capricorn One" -- there is one element in "SR" that is too similar to a scene in "C1" to be coincidental.  Even his production company is called "Bad Hat Harry", a phrase from a line in "Jaws", a movie he confesses to loving (as many many many of us do).<br /><br />Actually, as much as I enjoy actor Kevin Spacey, I thought his performance was rather unremarkable.  Competent, sure, but not particularly thrilling.  At least he didn't go too far the other way and take it too far over-the-top.  That would have been worse.<br /><br />I also bet ya that even though Noel Neill played the dying widow Gertrude in the film, her dialogue was dubbed over by Margot Kidder.  Betcha a nickel on that too.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Richard Donner's take on Superman with Christopher Reeve was certainly entertaining, especially #2. The humor was always prevalent, and I will always like the first 2 of that original series. Fortunately, for the movie-going public at large, the very smart, very brilliant Bryan Singer came up with a new, darker take on the series...though a very indvidual accomplishment. The 2-disc version is quite fine, with great insights on the casting, and various other elements that went into this filmmaking endeavor. Mr. Singer is ever-present in these many extras, providing humorous and fun stuff. The film, itself, is quite fine. I saw it in a theatre before I bought this set. Brandon Routh is certainly the best looking, most handsome Superman ever on film. It's unfortunate that Mr. Singer kept him brooding and serious most of the time; that smile could melt anyone. Kate Bosworth was a terrific Lois, and I  may be the first to say the Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olson was great! Indeed, he made Clark's return seem exciting and interesting. James Marsden also was fine in what must have been a difficult role. Then there's Mr. Routh, never missing a trick, always in command. The absolute best thing about this film, in my opinion, is that there's the nastiest of Lex Luthor portrayals by Kevin Spacey, truly the way it should be. The meanness was uncompromised, and it was the most powerful performance in the film. Also, I've also been a fan of Parker Posey, especially in  Christopher Guest's improvisational films. She is very fine here, too, being the foil to Spacey's maniac tirades. I also very much liked the reference to John Williams' original score, and the love theme, "Can You Read My Mind" (which was NOT nominated for an Oscar in '78, but is one of the most remembered themes in film). With all due respect to the two Donner films, I really enjoyed Bryan Singer's addition to the Superman legacy...</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>... which is very much how I feel about people who went to see this film expecting something straight out of the regular comics continuity(something more akin to BATMAN BEGINS), but unfortunately for them, this is in fact a continuation of the original Salkind/Spengler-produced series that, if we are to accept (and I happily do) to ignore the awful 3rd and 4th SUPERMAN films, and believe that the saga left off at the end of SUPERMAN II, the last film of that series that was truly a good film. This film pays homage, more than anything, to the work done by Richard Donner in the first two SUPERMAN films (That's right, I said the first TWO... because Donner was cut loose after filming approximately 70% of part 2) and the mythology of all of the screen incarnations, with Jack Larson (The old TV series' Jimmy Olsen) and Noel Neill (the serial's Lois Lane). That being said, this film is a joy to behold. It has heart and soul, some fantastic set pieces, and some of the most iconic imagery ever presented in a superhero film. Brandon Routh, coming in to fill the extremely large-sized boots of the late Christopher Reeve (who admittedly by pretty much everyone who ever either made or saw the previous films was born to play the dual role of Superman/Clark Kent) and he does an admirable job. He may look a little younger and a little slighter, but he does more in this film than just a Christopher Reeve impersonation (as he was essentially was accused of, which is a crock... the personae of Clark Kent/Superman was not created by Reeve, but merely perfected by him) and he does quite well. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor... I was very excited by this prospect since Spacey is one of the great working actors in film and stage now, and seeing him in this film, it only made the film stronger. His Lex is a little darker, and not quite as tongue-in-cheek as Gene Hackman's portrayal in the previous films, and he works the role to Spacey-esque proportions. The only real failing of casting in this film is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, and it has nothing to do with her level of talent since she is quite a talented actress. It does really have to do with her age... she seems impossibly young to play the grizzled, world-renowned, Pulitzer-winning intrepid reporter and mother. Erica Durance, who plays a much younger Lois Lane on the television show "Smallville" seems older than Bosworth and more than anything, Bosworth's young looks are more distracting as to take her out of the role. A misfire of casting though hardly diminishes the narrative and emotion of the scenes she plays with Routh, Spacey and the EXTREMELY underrated James Marsden as her fiance. The real star of this film though is its director, Bryan Singer, who helped Marvel prove that Superhero films could not only make money but be good as well with his work on the first two X-MEN films, and now has proved to DC that he can make Superman work again. The film takes well-paced breaks from the action that instead of hurting the flow, assist in the emotional investment. Singer is a director who is not afraid to take his time when dealing with characters. This was the only "blockbuster" film of the last summer that really gave you something worth your money, including a last moment homage to Reeve's portrayal that tugs heavily at the heartstrings and really does make you believe that a man can fly.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>SUPERMAN RETURNS takes place about five years after SUPERMAN II ended.  In the film, Superman (Brandon Routh) left Earth five years ago when astronomers discovered the remains of his home planet of Krypton.  Having to be certain that there was nothing left there, Superman left on an odyssey across the universe.  In the meantime, life on Earth went on.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) was tired of waiting and became disillusioned and wrote an editorial entitled "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" which finally netted her a Pulitzer.  She also birthed a son and became engaged to Perry White's nephew (James Marsden).  Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) went to jail and after years of good behavior was released early and immediately began planning his next diabolical plan.  All the while, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) kept taking pictures.  As for the rest of the planet, the Average Joes struggled to live in a world that increasingly became more violent, turbulent, and destructive.<br /><br />Having been released from prison, Lex Luthor befriends an extremely wealthy heiress and on her deathbed has her sign a will that leaves her entire fortune to him.  Using his newly acquired wealth, Luthor travels with his new squeeze, Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey), to Superman's hideout, The Fortress of Solitude.  Once there, he ease drops on some of the boy in blue's personal tapes from his Dad and steals some of the crystals.  Later he breaks into a museum and steals some kryptonite.  Meanwhile, Lois is having an emotional breakdown as she tries to figure out her life now that Superman has returned.  As for Clark Kent, he's busy trying to fit back into work at the Planet after having been gone for a five-year world tour and Superman is out saving the world: everything from stopping a space shuttle from crashing to rescuing a stray animal from a tree.  Everything seems to go according to Lex Luthor's plans.<br /><br />Superman has always been one of my favorite superheroes and there's not a whole lot that one can complain about in SUPERMAN RETURNS.  It is true that in style and structure, SUPERMAN RETURNS closely follows in the footsteps of SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II while completely ignoring SUPERMAN III and SUPERMAN IV.  There are scenes in the movie that are very similar to scenes in SUPERMAN, several lines are copied directly from that movie, and Luthor's motivation is the same as the first film, too.  Nevertheless, with some solid acting from most of the cast (Routh doesn't get an opportunity to do much of his own acting--most of the time he's re-enacting Reeve's performance), state of the art special effects, and a great story, director Bryan Singer does an excellent job of keeping the golden boy tied to his roots, but allowing him to enter the 21st Century.  As Lois Lane discovers, maybe the world really needs Superman after all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good/bad film. What this means is that there are good things within the film that outweigh the bad.<br /><br />Because positive reviews should end on an upbeat, this review will cover the negatives first then delve into the brighter side of the movie.<br /><br />But first, a little history...<br /><br />Superman (Brandon Routh) has returned to Earth after a five year absence. He traveled to Krypton to see if it was really gone and if he was truly alone as a species. Rest assured, he is. Nothing of Krypton -- save himself and a few asteroids -- remains. Returning to Earth isn't easy, either. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, BEYOND THE SEA) feels jilted because he'd left without saying goodbye. And she has a new beau ...and child! Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) is this unique young boy and if you're observant you can figure out a few things rather quickly (for instance, add up the child's age and pay attention to a few subtle clues). Also, due to Superman's abrupt disappearance five years ago, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey, THE USUAL SUSPECTS) got a lesser sentence because the Man of Steel wasn't around to corroborate evidence against him. And now Lex is on the loose, trying once again to wrangle some illegal and deadly real estate dealings against the people of America.<br /><br />The bad: This story has been done. If you've seen the original Superman film (Christopher Reeves, 1978) you know the story all too well: Lex Luthor, Gene Hackman, wants to shove California into the sea so that he can be a land tycoon but first he has to get rid of Superman, yada, yada, yada... I'm sure some of this may have been done intentionally, as a sort of homage to that first film (more on that in a minute, too), but here it just felt very unoriginal.<br /><br />Casting. I can see why they picked Brandon Routh as Superman. He's good-looking, has a sort of chiseled quality to him, and he's got that boyish charm. The boyish charm is the biggest problem. Since he's now five years older, and perhaps paternally bound, a fatherish figure would seem more appropriate. Mr. Routh looks younger than Chris Reeves did during the first Superman film. That's a problem. In fact, everyone looks younger, not older. Even Frank Langella's character looks younger than Jackie Cooper (the original Mr. White).<br /><br />The Script. It's corny. Sorry but had to say it. The dialogue is often stilted ("All I hear are people crying out for a savior.") Barrrrrf!<br /><br />Okay, now that we've dissected the innards, let's get into what's good.<br /><br />Director Byran Singer does his best with this tough script and pulls the film up by its sagging bootstraps. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The outerspace shots (from the opening credits) are, to use my son's expression, "Wicked!" This makes it a must see on the big screen.<br /><br />The costumes. Loved the fact that Superman's outfit is a bit darker. The cape isn't blood red anymore but is purplish. The "S" on his chest is also darker, indicating Superman has faults. He's a shadowy man now. He has jealousies (towards Lois Lane's fiancee) and feels out of touch with humanity.<br /><br />I mentioned a bit of homage going on and Mr. Singer puts some of it to good use. Most notably a kind of tribute to the late, great Chris Reeves, whom many of us movie-goers consider the ultimate Superguy. The smug super-smiles (especially at the end of the flick), some similar dialogue ("Statistically speaking, flying is still the safest way to travel"), and the emotional weight hefted upon Superman by all the women who faun over him are all there and done exceptionally well. Many may feel a closeness with Mr. Singer's approach for including these items in the film. I know I did.<br /><br />So there you have it, a mixed bag. Not great but not horrible either. Definitely worth your while, especially for DC comic book fans and those who enjoy a stroll down Super-memory lane.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Superman is my favorite superhero, and this was a great and honrable comeback for the man of steel!  Way to go, Bryan Singer.  Admittedly, when the familiar theme song and familiar opening credits to Superman Returns began, my heart fell a little to see the names Christopher Reeves, Margot kidder and Gene Hackman replaced by Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey.  But it's time to let go.  The torch has been passed.<br /><br />Superman comes back after spending five years in Space looking for remnants of his home planet Krypton.  He returns to Earth after finding nothing and also discovers that life on Earth has gotten along without him.  Lois lane has a five-year-old boy and practically engaged.<br /><br />From this point, the movie jumps right into the plot without explaining too much of Clark Kent's absence and presses forward.  Really no need to do a re-hash of Superman's background.  Bryan Singer takes this story on a more emotional journey that surprisingly both Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth do pretty well.  On top of that, Bryan Singer refines in outstanding special effects what Richard Donner started in  1978.  Expect more graceful, vertical shots of Superman flying as well as beautiful twilight cinematography.  Witness a sonic boom when he shoots up into the air or creating ripples as he darts across the water's surface.<br /><br />As the movie goes along and we've become used to seeing Superman's familiar life-saving strokes, the story becomes more interesting...in fact, very interesting.  I never thought I'd say this, but there is a scene towards the end of the movie that is somewhat of a tearjerker.  Bryan Singer shows his ability to tug at heartstrings as well as put out some great action.  Last time I saw that was X-men 2.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this film was made with a sense of grace and reverence for the world's oldest superhero.  Definitely a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>It's hard to believe that less than a decade ago, comic book-to-live-action-movie adaptations were so, uh....well. falling so short of their potential.  There were a few enjoyable movies among them, but their best were generally far from the best of the larger crossgenres epic vein they were a part of (think the Star Wars movies, Terminator 2, Braveheart, and other big, powerful greats like those for comparisons from the same timeframe) and they were also falling far short of hitting the mark as adaptations of their source material and of presenting the world of modern comics to the much larger movie audience.  The best jobs, by far, in that department were being done by certain animated works: "Batman - The Animated Series", "Superman: Last Son Of Krypton", "Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm".<br /><br />  Flash forward just a few years from when the bigscreen comic adaptations temporarily disappeared and all of a sudden: the X-Men series.  Batman Begins.  Spider-Man.  Elektra.  And now "Superman Returns", in one of the biggest, most incredible, better-than-ever comebacks of all time.  This is the level of movie that the Superman comics have deserved to have up there representing them for a long, long time.<br /><br />  I'll admit it - the movie doesn't nail the realism mark nearly as well as the modern comics (or even the younger-geared, animated, Superman material of the 90s for that matter).  And it does rely heavily on a couple of pretty large coincidences.  In this case,that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter in the same way that, when "Star Wars" is playing, it doesn't matter that in space you wouldn't Really be able to hear those great explosions as X-Wings and Trade Federation Droidships are being blasted to kingdom come.  It doesn't matter in the way that, when you're watching "E.T.", with any real Earth government involved, events most likely wouldn't really have been allowed to end as beningnly as they did.  Sometimes a movie just goes past the 'larger than life' mark and becomes larger than reality.  "Superman Returns" is one of those movies.<br /><br />  Watching this, you believe it all.  You care about the characters, and you Know the characters.  It's exhilirating,  humorous, emotionally moving, inspirational, dramatic and forever memorable.<br /><br />  Apparantly set more or less in the continuity of the previous live-action Superman movies, the Man Of Steel returns to Earth after a five-year abscence off in space seeking out the remnants of his homeworld Krypton in hopes of some trace of survivors.  The world he comes back to seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the one he left; just like the world of today seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the world of years ago (or, more likely, we're just in general more aware of the more distressing aspects of our planet nowadays).  Superman's actual return to the public eye is one of the most stunning moments in movie history.<br /><br />  By one of the above-mentioned coincidences, his return comes at the same time Lex Luthor is putting into play his biggest and most ambitious plan to date.  The Luthor of "Superman Returns" occupies a midway point between the entertaining but too-buffoonish Luthor of the earlier live-action movies, and the deadly believable, genius behind-the-scenes manipulator of the books; I would have voted to go far closer to the comic book version but the incarnation presented here turns out to be extremely effective after all (over-the-top masterplans and all) thanks in part to a fantastic performance by Kevin Spacey.  Perry White (the chief editor at the Daily Planet) is quite different here in both appearance and mannerisms but comes off very well also, with Frank Langella doing a great job in the role.  Lois Lane, as played by Kate Bosworth, is pretty close to the comics version but actually, in my opinion, a bit Better of a character than she often is in the comics, and she seems more indispensable to the Superman mythos than in previous adaptations.  The new, created-for-the-movie, characters, come off great and add tremendously to the film.  And Brandon Routh proves to be worthy into stepping into the lead role and living up to 68 years of glorious Superman history; he does a great job of synthesizing the feel of the 'classic' Superman from years past and the 'modern', post-Crisis On Infinte Earths (a DC comics crossover from the mid 80s) incarnation of a more believable and detailed Superman and DC Universe in general.<br /><br />  I hope they do ten more of these (bring on Darkseid!).  Awesome in every regard, "Superman Returns" defines the term 'movie magic'.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>In the realm of superhero films, Richard Donner's SUPERMAN is legendary.  As far as general filmmaking goes, it's a classic.  It is single-handedly responsible for the superhero film.  To this day, it ranks as one of the very finest superhero films ever made, by which all others shall be measured.  Wisely, director Bryan Singer opted not to remake Donner's epic masterpiece.  Instead, he set writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris to work crafting a sort of sequel to SUPERMAN II, ignoring the last two sequels (which had never been too popular with audiences or fans).  The result is SUPERMAN RETURNS.<br /><br />At the start of the film, a brief blip explains that a group of scientists discovered the remains of the destroyed planet Krypton - which is, of course, Superman's homeworld.  The Man of Steel left his adopted planet behind and set out to investigate these remains, hoping to find one of his own kind.  Five years later, Superman - played by Brandon Routh - returns.  To his shock, things have changed - a lot.  For one thing, his nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has been released from prison.  Also, without Superman, the world's crime rate has gone way up.  The biggest shock of all - Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is married, and has a young son!<br /><br />I remember that back when McG was helming this film, I was certain that it would fail.  McG, the man who brought us CHARLIE'S ANGELS and CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE, directing a Superman movie?  Please, no!  Though I felt a little better when McG left and Brett Ratner signed on, I was still nervous.  Then, thank the Gods, Bryan Singer - the man behind THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the comic book masterpieces X-MEN and X2 - signed on.  I breathed a long, heavy sigh of relief.  The project, I felt, was in good hands.<br /><br />Was I wrong?  No.  Not at all.<br /><br />Singer knows what to do and when to do it.  He has an eye for spectacular, thrilling visuals, but can also get great performances from his cast.  The action sequences in SUPERMAN RETURNS are some of the most exciting ever filmed.  That's not to say that this is some cheap action flick.  Hardly!  This film is just as moving and emotional as it is thrilling.  The real story of the Superman comics is the love triangle between Superman, Lois Lane, and Clark Kent.  Bryan Singer realizes this, and makes use of it.  Singer, however, sets Clark off to the side and focuses more on the relationship between Lois and Superman - which has become far more complicated now that Lois is married, and, as Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) points out, "a mommy."<br /><br />One of the big worries of every Superman fan was the casting of Superman himself.  Christopher Reeve, whose portrayal of the Man of Steel is now legendary, was perfect; to countless people, he WAS Superman.  How could anyone hope to fill his shoes?  Wisely, Bryan Singer decided to cast an unknown, just as Richard Donner had done when he made SUPERMAN.  That unknown was Brandon Routh.  And Brandon Routh is amazing.  He is very nearly, maybe even as good as the dear Mr. Reeve.  His performance resembles Reeve's, and yet Routh manages to bring his own touch to the character.  He is truly to be commended for his portrayal of the Man of Steel.  Wonderful.<br /><br />Then there's Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Possibly the most famous comic book villain, and undoubtedly one of the most popular villains in history, Lex Luthor is Superman's scheming, brilliant nemesis.  In the 1978-1987 series, he was portrayed by Gene Hackman.  Hackman's portrayal was good, very good, but he seemed a little too jokey and cowardly to me.  Where was the sinister, evil Lex Luthor of the Superman comics?  As I had suspected he would, the magnificent Kevin Spacey brings to life the maniacal, spiteful Lex Luthor of the comic books.  This Lex does not hide beneath the ground, plotting Superman's defeat while suffering his bumbling sidekicks.  Spacey's Lex DOES plot Superman's demise, but he does so with pure hatred, off to the side, surrounded by violent thugs, and when Luthor finally confronts Superman, he stands there and stares the Man of Steel right in the eye.  You can feel the hatred seeping from Lex Luthor, and from Mr. Spacey.<br /><br />I feel that Ms. Bosworth is getting some harsh and undeserved criticism from people.  Her Lois Lane is angrier than Margot Kidder's, but she has reason to be.  How could Superman, Earth's savior, just take off and leave Earth's people for five years?  I think that Bosworth is a terrific Lois, and she performs very well with Routh.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes James Marsden, who also appeared in Singer's X-MEN movies, as Richard White, Lois' fiance.  Marsden's character clearly feels that he is standing in Superman's shadow, but he never comes across as being stuck-up or a jerk; rather, we sympathize with him.  Frank Langella plays Perry White, the clever editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet.  Langella is great, better than Jackie Cooper was in the original Superman movies.  The lovely Parker Posey provides much of the comic relief, replacing Valerie Perrine as Lex Luthor's female accomplice.  Sam Huntington is very funny as young photographer Jimmy Olsen.  Eva Marie Saint appears in the film briefly as Clark's mother.  Interestingly, Saint made her big-screen debut in 1954's ON THE WATERFRONT, opposite Marlon Brando.  Through footage from Richard Donner's SUPERMAN, and unused footage from that film and SUPERMAN II, Brando returns as Jor-El.  It is wonderful to hear his soothing voice again as Superman's wise father.  Also, Jack Larson and Noel Neill, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane in the 1950s SUPERMAN TV series, have fun cameos.<br /><br />One of the things which troubled me during the making of the movie was the music.  John Williams' music for the original series was absolutely flawless, perfect, stupendous, magnificent - one of the greatest film scores of all time.  I was familiar with John Ottman's work through THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the X-MEN movies, but that didn't really give me much of an idea what his music for SUPERMAN RETURNS would be like.  I needn't have worried - as Ottman himself says in the liner notes for the soundtrack CD, he was a big fan of Williams' score.  What Ottman has composed is a score that is at once majestic, powerful, heart-pounding, and beautiful.  At the same time, he lets Williams' themes soar when they should.  It's truly a delight.  Should Mr. Williams ever listen to it, I'm sure he would be proud.<br /><br />Though the plot of SUPERMAN RETURNS is not the most brilliant ever conceived, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.  It is, quite simply, one of the finest superhero movies ever made.  It's a delightful, soaring, romantic adventure that is as charming as any film I've ever seen.  The cast, the script, the directing, the effects, it's all wonderful.<br /><br />The tagline for the 1978 epic famously proclaimed "You'll Believe A Man Can Fly!".  After seeing SUPERMAN RETURNS, I believe once more that a man can fly, and I believe that under the control of Bryan Singer, this new series will soar as well.  I am proud to proclaim that Superman, the Man of Steel, Krypton's last son and Earth's saviour, has most certainly returned.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I was able to see this film over the holiday weekend. I've noticed a lot of people were hungry for this film to come out and ended up somewhat satisfied with the product.  "Superman Returns" is a competent movie, generally very well produced, directed and cast. But it didn't quite gel for me. I thought it dragged at points, as Superman got bogged down with pining over Lois Lane instead of saving the day. I thought the dialogue just wasn't sharp enough to sustain these heavy-handed emotional scenes; what sort of catchphrase is "I'm always around," anyway?<br /><br />Here's what I did enjoy. The flight scenes were beautiful; Superman cut a very majestic figure as he soared across skylines and stars capes. The set design was great, too, creating a modern feel with hints of the Art Deco style I associate with Superman. And I appreciated the performances of Spacey, Bosworth and Langella. Routh had a curiously small role, especially as Clark Kent, so I had trouble judging whether he was wooden or actually good at playing a modest hero.<br /><br />Here's what I enjoyed less. Luthor's plan simply didn't interest me. I found the whole notion of growing a giant crystal island very surreal and not too threatening. Also, he poses a fairly boring threat to Superman. If Luthor's got Kryptonite, Superman is helpless; if he hasn't got Kryptonite, he's helpless. These two legendary antagonists can never really meet on equal terms. Thus, most confrontations between them must inevitably be one-sided.<br /><br />I also had a mixed reaction to the CGI effects. Some were wonderful, and others looked artificial despite being very detailed. I so very much wanted to love this film but sometime Hollywood studios have a way of systematically destroying every decent franchise they get their hands on. In spite of my mix emotions of the movie, it's far from being horrible. It's just not great...like it should have been.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I'm laughing at all the positive reviews on this movie&lt; I've heard that some of the plot is explained in the deleted scenes, my response is this. Superman would never leave earth without telling Lois, Two. If this movie really took place after the Richard Lester Superman II, he broke his promise. Because before he flew off the roof of the white house, he informed the president he wouldn't let us down again. But yet in this movie, he just leaves, and appearently leaves Lois with a kid, which is his. OOps did I spoil anything, I agree with some of the other reviews, this movies acts like it's ashamed to be a Comic book movie, and tries to be serious. While Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the X-Men movies, he clearly shows he has no idea how to handle Superman, it was a rehash of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie. And for those who just let this movie get by with a pass, shame on you, This movie's idiocy was shoved into one scene. The infamous krypton island scene, now people have tried to explain it away, but you can't really fix bad scriptwriting, particularly when you establish rules in a movie. You can't just abandon them five minutes later in the movie, now when Superman lands on the island. He immediately loses his powers, gets beat up by Luthor's henchmen, then gets shived, but after Lois rescues him. He flies into the sun, recharges. And flies back to the island, but flies under it. Now here's where the problem arrives, Superman is protected from Kryptonite by wearing LEAD. NOT MUD, and he still has his powers, even after he's flying the island into space and his protection is falling away leaving him exposed to the Kryptonite, is he effected, Naw. Now once he tosses it into space, we get a drama scene, by the way. This movie is full of them, anyway he falls back to earth. This movie, much like "The Dark Knight" was not a comic book movie, it was trying to be serious. IT"S A SUPERMAN MOVIE, this movie isn't</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Yes, i was entertained with this Version of Superman... Instead of bringing us a darker ...more violent movie...like most of the franchises<br /><br />do to widen their audiences...they brought back the Superman we all<br /><br />loved from the previous movies....its more like a comic book..and<br /><br />i cant wait for the next one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This film fits right into the series of sequals in the superman films.  I must give it at least a four star review due to the use of a non-major star for superman, and kevin spacey's performance, but the overall movie seemed to drag at some spots, and really was really almost to easilly follow, not much surprise. However, when there was action, the screen was always busy, kept me interested.  The situations are classic "superman" situations with mass destruction and displays of unhuman strength.  Overall though, I was left with a feeling like there just should have been more.  There will likely be a sequel, we'll all just have to wait and see. Rent this movie, or buy it for a discount price, but likely not worth spending more than the single disc price for.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Director Brian Singer (X2) brings the legendary Man of Steel back to the big screen in the highly anticipated comic book spectacle "Superman Returns". After a 5-year mission in outer space, the world's greatest superhero (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth and learns that the world especially star journalist Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on without him. When arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) resurfaces with a new sinister plot, Superman must put his troubles behind to protect the countless lives that lost faith in him. "Superman Returns" is an absolute joy to watch. Director Brian Singer has done an amazing job with the X-Men franchise and his latest comic book adaptation truly shines. "Superman Returns" pays tribute to the original 1978 Richard Donner feature film with the same 3-D opening titles and memorable music score. The movie features an entertaining storyline, outstanding special effects, rousing action sequences and fine performances by Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and newcomer Brandon Routh.<br /><br />If you're a Superman fan or just looking for a solid good time then "Superman Returns" 2-Disc Special Edition is a worthy purchase. The 3-hour summer spectacle is presented in its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has a sharp video transfer with bright colors and good resolution. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound definitely gets the job done. The DVD also features an extensive "The Making of Superman Returns" documentary, deleted and extended scenes, theatrical trailers and "Resurrecting Jor-El" FX featurette. Overall, "Superman Returns" gets a "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>I have to say first, I'm not a comic book fan. I've never read, nor will I ever read any sort of comic book. I am, however, a movie fan. I loved the first two Chris Reeve Superman Movies, (3 and 4 were just dreadful) and I was hoping that with this reincarnation it would bring back the awesomeness of the first two. It seems that with Superman Returns for whatever reason it decided to become a sequel, but not a proper sequel, just a sequel where they change things that happened in the past which we know didn't happen because we watched the first four movies. (The last two, yes unfortunately)<br /><br />I'm going to touch on quite a few things that I noticed in this movie where I raised one eyebrow and thought, WTF? The first one is the main one that I think most people will have noticed and genuinely asked the question. What were they thinking? OK, Superman had left Metropolis to find the remains of his home planet which had apparently been discovered by astronomers. This was something that had happened after Superman 4, and now he returns to jump back into the job he abandoned and make friends with the bitter Lois Lane. This is what annoyed me. Lois Lane, for whatever reason had suddenly forgotten that Clark Kent was Superman? Forgive me if I'm wrong here but didn't she find out his real identity in the first Superman Movie? I know this film wasn't billed as an actual sequel, but if you're going to name a movie Superman Returns, and it's released 28 years after the original Superman movie then you have to at least keep it consistent because you have a lot of people at least expecting a bit of a sequel feel to it.<br /><br />The other thing I wanted to poke at was something another reviewer has also mentioned. This is a comic book movie, correct? This is a movie based on a man from another planet who's pretty much invincible, correct? Then why is it that with this sequel they had the beauty of CGI and the ability to bring a crazy villain (rather than Luthor) to go against Superman. Why don't we get some real comic book action in this film? Spiderman did it, The Incredible Hulk has done it, hell even the Dark Knight has done it. So why did Superman not bother? Why did Singer, Harris & Dougherty decide to give us a soap operatic movie that simply, Superman fans weren't after. Sure the Lois reunion would have been cool and to see her moved on would have been interesting, but this was the whole damn movie. Superman returns to Earth to find that a bitter Lois had written a Pulitzer prize winning article on "Why the Earth doesn't need Superman." Lois has moved on and she's now in a new relationship with the unlikeable Richard played by James Marsden and has a child to him. Sure a new relationship storyline is fun and all but this consumed the entire movie and the Lex Luthor's insane plot was overshadowed by that.<br /><br />That's not the icing on the cake, you're going to love this ridiculousness. The kid, while on a boat being kidnapped by Luthor, along with Lois by the way. Lois is being approached by one of the henchmen who's ready to beat the crap out of her, then BAM!!! out of nowhere a piano flies into the face of the henchman. So the child is the child of Superman, remember Lois can't remember who Superman really is, she's forgotten. Nothings confirmed though, you see it could have been just one of those crazy feats of strength that you hear people have on the news.<br /><br />I've got nothing else to say, apart from this is THE worst superhero movie EVER. I know that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I can assure you I'm not. This is even worse than the Batman & Robin movie from 1997 because at least that had more fighting and action. In Superman Returns we were presented with about three major action scenes and they were literally no longer than 5 minutes. Brandon Routh can make a good Superman and Spacey a good Luthor. Bosworth needs to be dropped as she's just terrible as Lois Lane. I'm only hoping that in the sequel entitled Man of Steel (the DC movies are creating a theme with comic book movies now, just look at The Dark Knight, sequel to Batman Begins) the cast have another bout of amnesia and the child and the poor relationship are forgotten about and we can be given a real comic book movie from the new Superman. I would like to see an intergalactic villain in the sequel, maybe Metallo or Doomsday?<br /><br />Terrible movie, stay away.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>Of all the reviews I have read about Superman Returns, I feel that Roger Ebert's is the most accurate.  Don't get me wrong - I liked the movie...I just didn't love it.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />It does everything it can to draw a direct line from the original Superman movies.  The first Superman has my favorite opening credit sequence of all time, which this film copies.  The message is clear: Superman HAS returned.  The art direction does its best to be reminiscent of the originals.<br /><br />I liked the cast.  Brandon Routh is a good actor and eerily like Christopher Reeve.  Kevin Spacey is perfect for the new Lex Luthor.  (Lois Lane left me wanting though - she isn't tough enough to be a reporter.)  Of course, Marlon Brando is the only actor to "reprise" his role from the first film.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD:<br /><br />The script.  I love the original Superman movie - so I don't need the new one to keep quoting it every five minutes.  As soon as I saw that Singer had hired two twentysomething skater kids to be his screenwriters, I knew this would be a problem.  The first superman movie was great because it had wit and sophistication - things that take experience to earn.  Instead of being witty, this movie quotes lines from the first one.  Instead of giving us new magical moments, it tries to recapture the magical moments from previous films.  The result is that this film lacks a sense of fun.  Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it is not the best filmmaking.<br /><br />I get the same feeling from this film that I got from the first Spider-Man film and the first X-Men film.  This will re-establish the franchise, but you have to wait for the second one for it to get really good.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>OMG, where to begin? The movie is slow; the pathetic excuse for a plot doesn't really develop until half way through the movie (and when it does, it's rediculious). The attempt make the characters all tortured and conflicted is just lame. Campy. Predictable. Boring. Cliche. Take your pick.<br /><br />On top of everything else, the Lois Lane character is kind of a b$%ch which makes Superman look like a dufus for fawning over her. Pathetic.<br /><br />The only part of the movie that didn't COMPLETELY suck was Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />This is the worst Superman movie ever and one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />So NOT recommended.<br /><br />P.S. I wonder how many people die every day while Superman farts around pretending to be a reporter and stalking Lois Lane...</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>Who is the Man of Steel? This is an interesting take on the Superman series. Due to the classic nature of the first couple Superman films there was high expectations set for Superman Returns. An important note about this installment is that it is actually the fifth and final installment in the original Superman film series and serves as a sequel to Superman and Superman II. This film ignores the events of Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. The basic premise is that Superman (Brandon Routh)  was gone for 5 years of soul searching and now he is back. At the same time the evil mastermind Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is also back and plotting to take over the entire world. All the rest of the key characters are here as well and the film actually makes a successful transition from the original second installment of the series. Overall it is a great action packed return to form for the Man of Steel. A new character is also introduced in Superman Returns. As you watch the film you will find out who it this individual is and you may find the connection quite interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />There seems to be a feeling afoot that The Man of Steel may just possibly have outlived his usefulness - that after a 19-year-long hiatus from the big screen, Superman might be a tad too much of a straight-arrow boy scout to compete with all those morally confused, angst-ridden comic book heroes that have come our way in the past several years.  This is certainly the criticism I've heard most frequently leveled against "Superman Returns" - that the movie simply isn't sophisticated enough to have any relevance in our cynical, post-modern 21st Century age - but, frankly, I find the movie's simplicity, straightforwardness and actual LACK of sophistication to be rather refreshing for a change.  Not all comic book heroes need to be deeply conflicted to be interesting.  Some times it's nice just to believe in a super human savior who's ready to swoop down from the skies and rescue us from a fate-worse-than-death at a moment's notice, no questions asked.  Who's really going to be fussing about the do-gooder's moral and psychological ambiguity at a time like that anyway?<br /><br />As "Superman Returns" begins, we learn that the Man of Steel has been absent from the earth for five years, having gone back to his original planet, Krypton, after some astronomers located its whereabouts.  Having found little there but a desolate cinder, Superman returns to earth to re-kindle his love interest with Lois Lane and to resume his fight for truth, justice and...well, you fill in the rest for yourself, the filmmakers having cagily opted to de-emphasize the character's nationalism in an effort to boost the film's revenue potential overseas.<br /><br />As stated previously, "Superman Returns" is a relatively straightforward tale of good versus evil done in broad strokes with only a minimum of psychological shading.  Superman may have problems in the romance department, but he seems otherwise well adjusted to his role of the world`s sole functioning superhero.  Crippling self-analysis has really never been Superman's "thing" anyway so there wouldn't be much point in his suddenly becoming unduly brooding and introspective here.  Luckily, the film makes up in warmth and charm what it lacks in sophistication.  Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to emphasize the romance over the storyline which is little more than the usual generic silliness about Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) inventing a machine that will allow him to take over the world (ho hum).  The real conflict comes with Superman discovering that Lois has moved on to a new love interest and has a five-year-old son.  Superman's attempts to woo her back provide some of the most lyrical, touching moments of the film.  In fact, Singer, who has directed the film with both energy and style, is at his best in the subtler moments when he's showing us Superman flying across the city and around the world, backed by some of John Williams' most subtle musical passages since "E.T."  The Lex Luthor stuff, with all its attendant, high-tech special effects and eye-popping action sequences, just feels like the icing on the multi-million dollar cake.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is far from a perfect film.  It runs way too long at 155 minutes and we still can't understand why nobody is able to put two and two together and figure out that Clark Kent and Superman are really one and the same person - especially when they both disappear for five years, then make a surprise return to town at exactly the same moment.  Oh well, some things one just has to accept on faith when it comes to movies of this type, I suppose, and this is clearly one of them.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth lack the spunk and charisma that Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder brought to the roles, but they have a chemistry that works well on screen anyway.<br /><br />At least "Superman Returns" has a bit of a heart and soul to it, which is more than can be said for other recent blockbusters like the "Mission Impossible" or "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.  And even though I appreciate a layered, psychologically conflicted comic book figure as much as the next guy, it's nice to have the real thing back for a change as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Check out the plane crash... he doesnt just stop it, he has to manage the plane from breaking to bits..

The result is a movie that surpasses the last in the series (Did anyone dare see Superman IV?) but doesn't quite close it like a Rocky Balboa.<br /><br />Brandon Routh manages to make Clark Kent seem a little too cool, and Superman a little too dorky, but perhaps that's part of the act.  The movie is long - two and a half hours - and could've been clipped by thirty minutes without damaging anything.<br /><br />It's a worthy movie, but by no means must see.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>I loved watching this film in the IMAX. It took my breath away. When I saw it again at home, I realized that the story was lacking.<br /><br />That being said--Routh does a terrific job as Supes. Spacey is (of course) incredible and Bosworth is a wet washrag. (66% on casting, eh?)</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>First a confession--I really liked Richard Donner's first film. If you didn't like Donner's treatment of the subject you're not going to like this film and you're probably not going to like my review. Then you'll give me a "not helpful vote" and move on to express your opinion. For those who enjoyed Donner's film read on for those that didn't skip this film and go see "The Devil Wears Prada" or "X3" again.<br /><br />The film is certainly flawed. 1) It's too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. It could easily have been cut by 40 minutes without damaging the story. 2) The pacing is off (which probably has a lot to do with the running time). The film builds to a climax and has to rebuild again when its defused. 3)The "Messiah" imagery is overused. Richard Donner's original film was flawed as well (it was too long and the whole sequence with Superman and Lois Lane flying could have been cut to a minute)so, in that respect, "Superman Returns" has a lot in common with Richard Donner's film and "Superman II" (the film to which this is a sequel). It's still darn good entertainment.<br /><br />Like "Superman" "Superman Returns" is fun populist entertainment. "Superman Returns" doesn't have the dark edge (nor despite what's been written a gay subtext) like "X-Men" or "X2" the two other superhero films that director Bryan Singer has made. It's pure, sweet and comic with some interesting themes and conflict. Sure it isn't the Superman of the comics nor of the TV series or cartoons but I didn't care then nor do I care now about that. The late Christopher Reeve was perfectly cast as Superman and even Margot Kidder worked well as the scattered Lois Lane. Donner's job was to reinvent Superman for a new audience.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's film captures the same qualities that made Donner's film so fun to begin with and he's stayed true (for the most part) to the 1978 film's mythology. The film isn't perfect (how could it be? It's a sequel to a film made nearly 30 years ago!)but it's darn good.<br /><br />**There are some minor spoilers ahead so you may want to skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the film.**<br /><br />Superman (newcomer Brandon Routh in a marvelous performance that captures elements of Reeve's while establishing the role as his own)has been absent for 5 years. When the location of Krypton was identified he decided to return and see if anything remained of his home world. Exposure to Kryptonite in space weakened him but he manages to return to the Kent farm after his absence and recovers with the help of his mother Martha (the great Eva Marie Saint). He also briefly recalls his youth when he first discovered his superpowers.<br /><br />He returns as Clark Kent to Metropolis and is rehired by Perry White (Frank Langella)only to discover that Lois (Kate Bosworth)has moved on with her life and has a five year boy and has won the Pulitzer Prizer for an editorial entitled "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman". Clearly she has issues with Supes. She's also taken up with Perry's nephew and the paper's associate editor Richard White (James Marsden from "X-Men" and "X-Men 2")living with him. The only one who seems to have missed him is Jimmy (Sam Huntington).<br /><br />Lex Luther (Kevin Spacey who fills Gene Hackman's shoes nicely bringing a deliciously evil edge to Lex)is free as Superman never showed during the parole hearings to argue for his incarceration. He has a plan and it involves in a perfect quotation from the original film, "land" and the death of billions. Lex returns to the Fortress of Solitude and learns everything he can about Superman and his lost world before stealing important artifacts.<br /><br />**End of Spoilers**<br /><br />Singer recreates the feel of the original film while bringing a look that is uniquely his own to the film with its marvelous art deco production design. The story written in collaboration with "X2" writers Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (who also co-wrote the forthcoming remake of "Logan's Run")quotes liberally from both Donner's "Superman" (even using footage and recordings of Marlon Brando as Jor-El)and the George Reeves TV series (with cameos by Noel Neill and Jack Larson). Heck, Singer even throws in the iconic final shot from "Superman" and "Superman II" with Supes circling the Earth for good measure. It's clear that this film was a labor of love but also an attempt to examine a lot of themes that are essential to the Superman mythos including the Messiah myth as well as the unresolved love affair with Lois. Singer's direction of the actors is top notch. If the film is flawed its due to its running time--"Superman Returns" probably could have been trimmed by a good 20 minutes (much like Donner's "Superman")and worked just as well. Still all that screen time allows Singer to maximize the action set pieces (including a stunning robbery where Superman proves that bullets do indeed bounce off of him) without sacrificing the chararcter development.<br /><br />Routh manages to channel Reeve's winning performance as Superman/Clark Kent staying true to Reeve and Donner's(and writer Tom Mankiewicz's) interpretation of the character. Routh manages to inject enough of his own personality and make the character his own while still touching on Reeve's interpretation. Although Kate Kosworth's Lois might be a bit less kooky than Margot Kidder's take on the role she's as hard nosed a reporter and a bit more believable when it comes to helping Superman. James Marsden works well as the third part of this romantic love triangle as the new man in Lois' life. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as Lex much like Routh touching on Gene Hackman's performance but adding an edgy dangerous edge missing from Hackman's. Spacey's Lex is someone that you could believe would kill billions just to make a "killing" on a land deal.<br /><br />The visual effects are truly stunning and state of the art. The sequence involving the launch of the new space shuttle and its mishap is brilliantly realized. Much the same can be said for some of the other sequences involving the foiled robbery and the unexpectedly moving conclusion which refers to the Messiah myth and a recent Superman comic book.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is a loving valentine to a film that Singer clearly respected and loved (heck he even uses John Williams "Superman" theme and the same opening title design as in the first film). I'd highly recommend "Superman Returns" for fans of the first two Chris Reeve films. It's populist filmmaking at its best tackling a number of challenging themes within the entertaining package of a superhero fantasy. The bottom line go see it for yourself don't read all these reviews and if you don't like it leave midway through the movie and ask for your money back. Vote with your money not based on someone else's opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AZDVOFC2MTIM5.html">AZDVOFC2MTIM5</a><br/><p>Superman Returns is alot like a gift from a fairweather friend.The intentions are good, but the execution is less than desired.After years of getting this project off the ground,Superman Returns marks the Man Of Steel's return after a 19 year big screen absence(as well as various TV shows ie Lois and Clark,Smallville).Bryan Singer wisely decided to pick up where Superman II(1981)left off and bring Superman into the early 21st century where most are still jaded post 9/11 and a hero like Superman seems outmoded and archaic.<br /><br /> After a five year absence seaching for the remains of Krypton,Superman (Brandon Routh) comes back to a different world where even his beloved Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) wins a Pulitzer on "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman".Meanwhile Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey paying great homage to Gene Hackman) recently paroled and rich, plans his next neferious move.<br /><br /> In Bryan Singer's hands,the movie brings the larger than life Superman to a more "human" level,as well as pay tribute to the first two Richard Donner pictures starring Christopher Reeve(Donnor's original cut of II will finally be released on DVD).Unfortunately, the film contains alot of plotholes(Lex's kryptonite waterworld,the true nature of Lois Lane's son), miscasting(Bosworth), and a downbeat ending.<br /><br /> Like Singer's first X-Men movie,it's more of a (re)introduction that promises a greater follow up.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I'm incredibly torn over how I feel about Bryan Singer's "Superman Returns." On the one hand, it has enough heart to render anyone within a five-mile radius deeply moved. It's not just a meaningless gathering of action, mayhem, and special effects; it actually goes deeper by presenting a story filled with complexity and emotion, all in the face of stylized danger. I'm afraid I can't describe that aspect any further because doing so would give away some really important plot points. Let's just say that Superman's return enables a wealth of repressed feelings to resurface, some of which have been kept secret for a long time. This alone is enough for a recommendation.<br /><br />However, I had some major problems with the film as a whole, and that brings me to the other hand. As classic and well loved as Superman is, this new story doesn't do much to enhance his reputation. Nor does it make it worse; what it does do is prevent him from transcending his well-established image. It's so well established that he practically vanishes behind a gigantic cliche. As I watched "Superman Returns," I came to the realization that he's really not that interesting a character anymore. We live in an age when heroes like Spider-Man, Batman, and the X-Men rake in the big bucks at the box office. True, they were all created in comic book stories many, many years ago. But through the talents of screenwriters and directors, they've been able to stay fresh, energetic, and edgy on the big screen. Superman, however, is exactly the same as he was when he started out back in the late 1930s. Even today, he can dodge bullets and lift heavy objects. He still has x-ray vision, and he can still shoot lasers from his eyes and blow frost onto a fire. And he still believes in truth, justice, and the American Way.<br /><br />I suppose now you can see why I'm so torn over this film. I loved its humanity but was disappointed by its lack of originality. I was also disappointed by Superman's overall look. Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a young man whose role called for him to be dressed in a rubberized suit and for his hair to be overly slick and shiny. I thought he looked more like a plastic Ken doll than a real person. Looking so fake and pristine doesn't exactly add to his credibility as a character. However, it does help that his physique and facial expressions bear a striking resemblance to Reeve's. Somehow, I found that it gave the entire project legitimacy; Routh recaptures a wonderful performance as established in Richard Donner's original 1978 film.<br /><br />One of the best things about that film was the opening sequence. It showed the credits flying towards the camera amid shots of outer space, all the while playing John William's triumphant main theme. "Superman Returns" opens in much the same way, and it includes William's theme (interwoven throughout the film with John Ottman's original score). But this time, the credits move so quickly that you barely have time to notice any of the names. Luckily, few people care about reading names at the beginning of a movie; all they're really interested in is getting lost in the story, which in this case is incredibly interesting. Superman returns to Earth after an intergalactic journey to the remains of Krypton, his former home planet. Apparently, pieces of it had recently been discovered, and it forced him to wonder whether or not the planet was, in fact, completely destroyed. Of course, we all remember the destruction scene from the first movie (if you don't, this new movie takes a couple of seconds to remind you).<br /><br />After reuniting with his widowed mother, Martha (Eva Marie Saint, whose character is barely developed), he returns to Metropolis as the clumsy Clark Kent and gets his old job back at the Daily Planet. All the important characters are still there. First, there's Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), the good-natured but undeniably geeky photographer. Then there's the head honcho, Perry White (Frank Langella), a man that's always ready for the next big scoop. Finally, there's Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the headstrong reporter. Upon his return, Clark is surprised to learn that Lois has since gotten involved in a relationship and has had a child. He also learns that she had written an article entitled "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" (which, interestingly, earned her a Pulitzer Prize). He realizes then that his untimely disappearance turned her bitter and resentful. She even seems to behave strangely towards the Clark Kent alter ego, never really interested in giving him the time of day despite not seeing him in many years. (Why no one could see the coincidence there is beyond me; I think it's gotten to the point where not realizing Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same is implausible.)<br /><br />Superman first reappears in public after he prevents a jet plane from crash landing. It was a plane that just happened to have Lois as a passenger (covering a story, no less). This heroic stunt is the first of many encounters that forces her to reassess her feelings. Yes, she does love her boyfriend, Richard (James Marsden), and rightfully so; he's a good-natured, friendly man, and he cares deeply for Lois and their son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). But Superman was always the one she truly loved, and that brings on a multitude of conflicting emotions. It gets even more intense when she begins to notice the way Superman and her son have formed a subtle yet significant connection.<br /><br />Of course, no "Superman" story would be complete without the inclusion of Lex Luthor, the evil criminal mastermind whose hatred of the flying goody-two-shoes is only surpassed by his lust for world domination. Taking the reigns from Gene Hackman is Kevin Spacey, who gives Luthor a diabolical edge that served the film well. This is not just in terms of the story; it's also in terms of the genre. Only a comic book villain could think up grandiose schemes that could never be accomplished in real life. Most of the time, they involve large gadgets, unheard of technologies, and the proposed death of millions.<br /><br />Luthor adheres strictly to that mindset, always being able to conjure up delightfully over the top ideas. In the original film he attempted to sink the entire California coast by launching a missile into the San Andreas Fault. Now he intends to literally create his own continent in the middle of the ocean, a feat that can only be accomplished with special crystals. Specifically, he needs the self-generating crystals that make up the structure of Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Naturally, he has the power and resources to collect everything he needs. The most unnecessary resource was his Pomeranian-loving female companion, Kitty (Parker Posey). Her semi ditzy behavior is not at all compatible to his sophisticated demeanor, and I just couldn't believe he actually wanted to be around her.<br /><br />His careful scheming sets into motion the comic book side of the story, the side that doesn't focus on complexity or meaning so much as it focuses on special effects and entertainment. It would be hypocritical of me to say that I didn't have fun watching those scenes. Let's face it; eye candy is great in a comic book adventure film. But they didn't enliven the experience for me, either. If anything, I felt like I was watching an undeveloped idea, one that never really took off because it was bogged down by unoriginal qualities (such as the fact that "Metropolis" is really Manhattan). But as I said before, the humanity it presents is so touching that it outweighs all the other flaws. It's that aspect of "Superman Returns" I want everyone to see, the one that delves into genuine emotion without getting overly sappy. So am I recommending this movie? Yeah, I guess I am, but just barely (if I could, I'd give it three and a half stars). It's a recommendation made in the hope that the emotional experience will be enough to satisfy you. If it isn't, then don't say I didn't warn you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>OK we all know the story, so I won't bore you with 9 paragraphs. Quickly I would like to point out 3 things.<br /><br />The crime and rescue scenes are wonderful. However, none of them gave me the chills like in the 1978 film, when Superman saves Lois Lane from falling to her death off the skyscraper and also catches the helicopter at the same time and lifts it back up, as the theme song blares when he catches the helicopter. To me that is the greatest movie scene in history.<br /><br />The new Lois doesn't measure up to Margot Kidder's quirky performance. Margot was beautiful in her own way and her character is what made the character so great. Seems like Margot didn't go for the glamorous side of Lois, but focused on giving her character. Kate Bosworth seems like she would freak if her hair got messed up while flying with Superman. Yawn.<br /><br />Finally, some of the scenes from the 1978 film that showed Superman landing and taking off seemed more real. Because he was suspended on wires and there were no special effects involved. the new one totally uses FX and it looks kinda fake. They should have stuck with the wiring.<br /><br />Still, it is a great film and I can't wait for sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>There is a reason that the 1978 version of Superman is a classic.  It stands against the test of time.  Christopher Reeve definitely made you think that he could fly.  Subtle body movements were more than enough to make you feel Superman in flight.  He also captured both Clark Kent and Superman, giving each of them defining characteristics that made you like and care about them, even though they were, technically, the same person.  Back in 1983, they tried to re-make Casablanca.  It isn't hard to understand why it failed.  When a movie is deemed a classic, it's virtually impossible to make it again.  Like a work of art, it can't be duplicated.<br /><br />And that was the first and biggest mistake of the writers and filmmakers on Superman Returns.  They simply should have made a Superman of their own rather than try to copy and extend the storyline from the original films made over 20 years ago.  Christopher Nolan understood this when he decided to finally make a good Batman film (Batman Begins).<br /><br />The writers probably thought they were paying tribute to the 1978 classic when they borrowed similar plot lines and even used the same dialogue in several places in this film.  You'll recognize many lines and parallel plots to easily make the connections between the '78 version and this film.<br /><br />In the 1978 version, Lex tries to sink part of California to increase the value of the desert land he bought.  In this version, he attempts to create his own land, using stolen Kryptonite technology and wiping out the eastern half of the United States.  You can't help but say, "haven't we already seen something like this before?"<br /><br />To be fair to Brandon Routh, you simply can't fill the shoes of Christopher Reeve.  However, Routh makes Superman much too wooden.  He doesn't give much indication of anything.  He lacks the charisma that's needed to play both Superman and Clark Kent.  His facial expressions are nearly void of emotion or feeling.  Christopher Reeve was a Juliard trained actor.  He literally immersed himself in his roles, including Superman.  Routh also doesn't disguise his voice as Clark Kent.  And no one can make the connection?!?  Reeve gave Kent the charm of a bumbling Cary Grant reminicent of the Grant's film "Bringing Up Baby."  Supposedly, Superman Returns is a continuation from the original Superman films.  If so, why does Clark Kent no longer disguise his voice?  Also, you just don't get the sensation that he's flying.  Part of the problem with this is that there aren't enough close-up scenes of him when he's flying.  The writers and director also never devoted enough time to the characters of Clark and Superman to where we feel a connection with them.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is simply awful as Lois Lane.  In fact, I don't think anyone has portrayed her worse.  Bosworth seems almost lost in how to portray the "tough" reporter of Lois Lane.  Even Margot Kidder furnished Lois with a "go get'em" attitude.  Bosworth plays Lois like a wallflower.  Plus, there is no chemistry between Routh and Bosworth which is the pinnacle of this story!  The love connection has always been about Superman and Lois Lane.  Again, they attempted to copy the romantic Superman/Lois flight as Superman takes Lois for quick ride into the night.  It doesn't work.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has his moments as Lex Luthor when he's almost good as Lex Luthor.  He attempted to stick with Gene Hackman's performance.  The scene with him beating on Superman when he's being affected by kryptonite is good.  Lex is supposed to have a savage side to him.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT BELOW!<br /><br />The back story is also not convincing enough.  Superman travels back to Krypton to find out if it is, in fact, destroyed?!?  After Jor-el tells him during his training that Krypton is gone, it's hard to believe that he would need confirmation, even if astronomers claimed to have seen it.  If Superman remembered Einstein, as Jor-el taught him about Einstein's theories of relativity in the '78 version, Superman would have realized that light from "Krypton" would only now be seen from Earth, and therefore, Krypton is not really there anymore.<br /><br />Also, the part with Superman having a son just doesn't fit at all.  When and where was this to have supposedly happen?  Again, if this is supposed to be a continuation of the original Superman films, the only time "Superman" slept with Lois Lane was in Superman II, and even then he was mortal.  Plus, the timing doesn't figure into it.  The writers tried to sell this "bit" but instead of trying to make it somewhat credible, it ends up being ludicrous.<br /><br />The kryptonite is also handled poorly.  Superman's powers are literally drained from him, making him even weaker than a normal person.  If you recall in the 1978 version, he couldn't even take the chain off from around his neck when Lex put the kryptonite on him.  And suddenly, in this film, with a fragment of kryptonite stuck in him, he's able to lift a land mass the size of a small country out of the ocean and into space?!?  It isn't likely or believeable, nor are we given a plausible explanation about how he could do this. Even in "Smallville" when Clark is exposed to kryptonite, he can barely move.<br /><br />Many of these problems could have been fixed simply by making a new and different Superman, rather than continuing where the previous films left off.  It would have been that simple.  I mean, they did manage to give Superman a totally different costume (the worst Superman costume ever designed).<br /><br />The special effects were first-rate, but this day and age, special effects aren't enough anymore.  We want a good story with good, believeable characters, and this film simply doesn't have either one.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Kind of long, and the special effects are sometimes strange, but for a superman fan, it is good stuff. Just it has been done before,<br />without the twist of super-son.<br />Kevin Spacey is quite the villain you might want and Kate Bosworth<br />is maybe not as sexy as other Lois actresses?<br />But the plot with the crystal growing island is pretty good.<br />I like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>Finally, a return not only of the man of steel, but of movie makers who know what makes a superman movie great. No more billionaire Luthor wannabes. No more lame solar-powered superman clones. No more women getting inexplicably assimilated with silver circuit boards all over their faces. This is just a good-old-fashioned Superman adventure with a little humor, a little sexual tension and a whole lot of Superman doing what he does best.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is a bit heavy on the soap opera at times, but that is mainly because they have to be sure to re-introduce the characters to a movie-going audience that hasn't seen them on the big screen in 19 years. And not in a *good* movie for 26. But even with the soap-opera aspects present, this is a great follow-up to the first two movies, conveniently pretending that Supermans III and IV never happened. (As do many of the fans.)<br /><br />Spacey is wonderful as Lex Luthor. Gene Hackman played up Luthor's charisma and self-importance superbly. Spacey, however, creates a Luthor that can truly scare you with a glance.<br /><br />Superb movie, and I can't wait for the follow-up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Brandon Routh plays an excellent Superman. But, you've got to love having Kevin Spacey in this movie. His performance is excellent. The first time we saw this movie, we went to IMAX to see it. Amazing! Some of the scenes actually make you feel as though you were flying. In Superman Returns we find Superman leaving Earth to find Krypton after astronomers have supposedly found it. When he returns to Earth, Lois Lane is engaged. And, of course, Lex Luthor is creating all sorts of challenges. Kevin Spacey as Luthor, is planning to destroy California but Superman stops him. Luthor realizes that by using the crystals from Krypton he can build a new continent... and he will hold the deed to the Real Estate. Billions might perish, but as always... Superman saves the day! Would sincerely recommend owning this DVD if you want to add a classic story to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>I was skeptical when I found out that they were planning to do another movie on Superman.  First of all, I thought why would they want to continue the sagas without Christopher Reeve?  I remember watching Superman in 1978 and Superman II in 1980 and thinking that nothing else could ever top those movies (especially with the disapointment of Superman III and Quest for Peace).  I thought that they have done enough and just leave the series alone.<br /><br />When I went to see this one, I was happily suprised to find that they used the music from the original sagas and that they didn't try to outdo the original series but pay homage to them and tell a different account of Superman.  Brandon Routh is a great Superman (unfortunately it will leave him typecast for the rest of his career), Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane is excellent (and she is so SEXY!), and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luther was great (wouldn't it been fun to see Gene Hackman as Lex Luther Sr.?) Anyways, great special effects, a good plot the story, and believeable characters.  I think Christopher Reeve would of been pleased with this rendition of Superman.<br /><br />Recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/AVQJD41PLPOOQ.html">AVQJD41PLPOOQ</a><br/><p>The long-awaited SUPERMAN RETURNS is a good movie, but not a great one.<br /><br />To its credit, I can deeply appreciated keeping the homage to Richard Donner's original 1978 SUPERMAN, with John Williams' score, the soaring opening credits, Marlon Brando footage and Brandon Routh's similarities to the late Christopher Reeve, intact.  Hell, if you look carefully, you can even spot a picture of legendary actor Glenn Ford, who played Jonathon Kent in the original SUPERMAN.  The performances by all involved are more than fair, especially from Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Where SUPERMAN RETURNS fails, in my opinion, is the severe lack of action.  Except for the rescue of a jet airliner and bullets violently bouncing off of Superman's chest, the movie is filled with mostly visual wonderment and natural disaster (both of which we had plenty of in the original SUPERMAN).  I should also point out that the outcome of Lex Luthor (he ends up stranded on a deserted island with Parker Posey; who by the way, absolutely ruins the whole movie!  Who told her she could act???) is incredibly stupid.  Sorry for giving that one away.  Tough.<br /><br />So, all in all, Bryan Singer has nothing really new to offer his audience except for brand new actors.<br /><br />If you read up on the history of this project, you'll know that there was a time the studio was considering a script based on the 1992 comic book DEATH OF SUPERMAN.  Action-wise, that would have been much more spectacular!  Perhaps they'll consider it for the sequel.  He can die in that one and be resurrected for the third film.  Just like Spock in STAR TREK II and III.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Superman Returns: 4 out of 10: This movie is definitely missing the spark that made the first two Supermans fun. (Superman 3 was pretty awful and Superman 4 is one of the worst films of all time). Superman comes across as a bit of a jerk and a bully in this film and the franchise is not all that better for it.<br /><br />Superman has gone away for five years in a plot contrivance that threatens to sink the film before it can begin. The claim is that he is seeking the remains of his home world (Not to sound like a comic book geek, but he if gets his powers from our yellow sun one would think he shouldn't be flying past Pluto let alone halfway across the galaxy.) He comes back, sort of says hi to mom, tortures his poor loyal dog with a tennis ball and heads to the big city where he stalks his ex-girlfriend Lois whom he did not even tell he was leaving and who has clearly gone on with her life.<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating the stalking. Superman hangs outsider her house using superpowers to snoop like some DC comics version of a cautionary Lifetime movie.<br /><br />Lex Luthor is also back with another stupid plan though Kevin Spacey does play the character well and a talented Parker Posey fills both the Otis and Mrs. Teschmacher shoes.<br /><br />Both leads (Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth) have zero chemistry with each other and considering they were passionate lovers, their conversations are pretty stunted and mundane.<br /><br />The action sequences are decent but the whole film seems to drag at two and a half hours and there is a distinct lack of joy. (You know something fun like everyone putting his or her Kryptonite up on E-bay, or Superman dating a supermodel to make Lois jealous that kind of thing, everyone seems so damn melancholy.) Speaking of melancholy, I noticed that Superman never asked about any disasters he didn't prevent while he was on his so-called vacation. Maybe a trip over lower Metropolis to see Ground Zero would have given him a reason for all the moping.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>After all the "Smallville" and other stuff, having the Man of Steel back on the big screen (like he really should be) was quite a treat last summer.  And now, the DVD let's you see it all on your big Plasma, hi-def screen at home.<br /><br />Much of what's written below compares, inevitably, Brandon Routh to Chrisopher Reeve.  Well, let's face it:  if you want Christopher Reeve badly enough, nobody is going to satisfy.  I thought Brandon did a wonderful job with the role.<br /><br />And I was, if anything, disappointed with Lex.  The guy playing him has been around, and has been celebrated as a great actor.  Here, he seems to sleepwalk through the role.  Kevin, you're not going to maintain your reputation this way...<br /><br />Finally, though, the true Achilles heel of this version is the writing, not the acting or even directing.  It should have been four stars, but the writers felt like they had to go for the shock value somehow.  I did not like that, and felt that it compromised the whole effort.<br /><br />Overall, though, it was one of the best movies of 2006, for sheer watchability if nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Even though my review might say otherwise, the original Richard Donner film was merely a good superhero movie and one of the better comic book movies. However, there were just some things that were merely uninteresting, slightly long or just unnecessary. Part II was actually surprisingly good while the less said about III and IV is for everyone's benefit. Stuck in development hell for the better part of a decade, the film finally got lifted off the ground when Bryan Singer, director of the Usual Suspects and first 2 X-Men films came onboard. Thankfully, the ideas of Doomsday riding a mechanical spider have been exorcised and we have a solid entry into the series that will probably disappoint some.<br /><br />It's been 5 years since Superman disappeared, searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton. Returning, he finds the world is still in trouble and moreso, his love Lois Lane has moved on, with evidence in the Pulitzer winning article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman". Not only that, but Lex Luthor is out of jail and he's got a mind for another land deal which of course puts the entire United States at risk. And so of course, Superman has to contend with not only Luthor but a woman who doesn't love him anymore and a responsibility that he abandoned.<br /><br />It's slightly eerie at how Superman's career has always been in direct competition or level as DC Comics' other hero, Batman. They both had an excellent first film, a pretty good second film with the next 2 being absolute duds, the worst being the 4th. Superman Returns is like the Batman Begins of the series, only it doesn't restart the series so much as it puts it back on track. Ignoring part III and IV, the film is essentially the "real" Superman III, taking place after II. Is this better than the first one? Relatively speaking I like it better but only by a bit. Newcomer Brandon Routh, while looking a bit too similar to Christopher Reeve, is perfect as bumbling nervous Clark and hero of the Earth, Superman. I never liked Gene Hackman's wisecracking portrayal of Luthor and Spacey manages to have that menace he needed while also providing some humor.(Some of it unintentional: "wrong!") While the rest of the cast is fine, the one misfire is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She doesn't give a bad performance really, it's just Lois is supposed to be a feisty gal born out of woman's liberation movement while she plays it as a soft-spoken damsel in distress at times.<br /><br />Well it's a Superman movie so do we get to see superhero stuff? Naturally. Probably the best action scene of the year, Superman has to save a maiden voyage of an airplane attached to a space shuttle has they careen towards space and Earth. It's exciting, energetic and just plain awesome. The rest of the stuff he does is not as ambitious but it's certainly no less cool, bringing out the geek in us that loves to see guys lift up 10 tonne globes. The one thing though is that the effects at times look slightly obvious. The flying though has never been better(except for a really bad digital double shot at the end), with the cape finally have some wind in it, unlike 1978's cape where it just flopped down his legs. Shot on the Genesis HD camera, the film looked sharp in theatre and most likely will on next-gen players but on DVD they look slightly too obvious or grainy. Is the film too long? At times, but it gives the film much needed character moments without being a teenybopper superhero movie for the masses(such as Fantastic Four).<br /><br />Batman Begins to me at times didn't feel exciting, as if it looked exciting but it didn't keep me enthralled. Superman Returns did, only the length and ANOTHER Luthor land mass scheme made it knock down a point or 2 but this is another one on the list for best comic book hero films, and it's about time too.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>It has to be said that doubts presaged my viewing of this revival of the Superman character on the screen. These doubts were only reinforced by some fairly negative responses in this part of the world. Not to mention the fact that the movie had some big shoes to fill following on from the movies with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />As already mentioned, some of the events are borrowed heavily from the previous Superman movies. Of particular note is the scene where Lane and Superman fly together, the crashing of Superman to earth at the beginning and a few other points. However, enough was original to keep it from being purely a re-run. Luthor getting out of prison because the prosecution's prime witness had legged it, (or rather flew the coop), was a nice touch.<br /><br />The computer graphics are probably what stands out, and their quality is fairly good. The special effects are excellent, though you can still tell the CGI when you see it. It is detailed and very well done. Superman's flight sequences are particularly good.<br /><br />The movie has a good pace to it, and it will not leave you looking at the watch. It has a good story line, with Luthor finding out about Krypton and all their technology. I have to admit, Kevin Spacey makes a good Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie. I would not say that it left me breathless, but there is something about Superman that always wins the day. It was a good reprise of the character and a good night's entertainment. However, see it again? I do not think so.</p></br><a href="../users/AXV9GS0TMSVW.html">AXV9GS0TMSVW</a><br/><p>Anyone who has seen the first two X-men movies was probably excited to hear Bryan Singer was directing Superman Returns.  In those movies he balanced the human (mutant?) element of the characters with a fair amount of external conflict with Magento and co.  One would think that he could take that formula over to the Man of Steel and make an equally good movie.  Not so.  The result presents Superman at his most vulnerable - which is not a bad thing - but Singer gives us a bit too much of it.<br /><br />Superman returns takes place after the events of Superman II.  Superman returns to earth after taking a 5 year hiatus to go visit Krypton.  What happened during those 5 years is never explained clearly in the film.  This causes it to be more than mildly frustrating when we hear that this is the reason that Lex Luthor got off the hook because Supes couldn't make his court date and that we see a confounded Lois Lane, played by a horribly miscast Kate Bosworth, who has moved on from Superman.  Throughout the film, Superman is trying patch up this relationship.  Singer spends a good amount of the movie showing that Superman is not very good at this.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there is some action in it.  Superman's first act of goodwill on his return involves stopping an air plane from crash landing.  Then there is a good montage of Superman going around helping people and then there is a finale with Luthor which kind of ends with a wimper.  The Luthor/Superman conflict is handled very poorly.  Though props to Kevin Spacey who has the part down really well.<br /><br />In defense of Singer, his biggest crime is not giving a good balance of the human/vulnerable Superman and the Superman who is the greatest superhero in the world.  Singer may have felt that viewers had enough of that and gave more attention to the humanity of Superman. That we see that side of Superman is not a bad thing.  There is too much of it and it never seems to get fully resolved.  Of course there will be sequels and it can be wrapped up there, but for an audience that is gearing up to have Superman back in their lives, this was not the right time to display so much of it.<br /><br />The film is laced with emotion, which Singer and co are good at, but it's too much too soon for the revived franchise.  The world needs a savior, yes, but not a guy who can't get his personal life straightened out.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Super Spoiler Ahead for those who didn't see the film.  Don't read this if you didn't see the film!<br /><br />Superman Returns was better than the original.  In this version Superman leaves earth for five years to explore the remains of Krypton.  In that time 9/11 occurs.  Lois writes a Pulitzer Prize winning article "Why We don't need a Superman."  She eventually develops a relationship with Perry White's son.  We get the impression the offspring is from her bond with her new man.  Although after the first hour we get to see who the son's father really is.<br /><br />There are scenes that make this movie better than the first version.  We don't have Superman changing the course of time to save Lois Lane.  Kevin Spacy plays a much darker and sinister Luther.  Frank Langella portrays the newpaper mogul in a less cartoony fashion that Jackie Cooper did in 78'.  I have to credit the director Bryan Singer for casting a better Lois Lane.  At least this one bears a resemblance to the one in the comics.  Unlike the Lois in Superman: The Movie with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />There was a controversy behind the 78' version.  The original creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were living in poverty with little or no money to live.  It would have been an embarrassment to Warner Brothers and DC comics if there wasn't a settlement to resolve the matter.<br /><br />DC artist, Neal Adams helped Siegel and Shuster obtain a legal defense to fight the case. Until recently the son of one of the creators passed away.  There is a documentary being produced about how the characters were taken away from the creators.  Back in the 1930s there was little known about copyright law.  Siegel and Shuster sold the rights only to regret that for the rest of their lives.  The recent article about the creators was a sad one.  The family has little or no financial benefit from an icon in American Comics.  Till this day the family is still struggling against DC Comics and Warner Brothers to get some sort of financial restitution after over 60 years.<br /><br />There are those who could say that the family is being greedy in asking for some type of financial gain.  I'd like to see the new documentary reveal the fact that the creators had been robbed of recognition and financial security.<br /><br />I don't know if the same is true in Canada and other countries marketing the new Superman movie; but look at all the merchandise!  I remember long ago when the first film appeared there was no where near the amount of cups, T-shirts and anything that could fit the Super logo on it.<br /><br />I do remember purchasing a $2.25 novel written by E. Nelson Bridewell (from DC Comics). It was an unrelated story that took place in the Superman universe. I never got the chance to read it. From what I've read the novel was one of the better ones.  I was surprised there weren't more.  At the time Marvel was releasing their own versions of prose novels.  The books were written by the popular names of the era; Marv Wolfman, Len (Wolverine CO-creator) Wein, and a few others.<br /><br />One of the commercial tie-in products I purchased were the Justice League Unlimited DVDs.  I wondered why the cartoons were played so late in the evening.  Well, the content is adult and is for older kids.  In one of the episodes Superman is under the influence of a flower alien parasite that controls his mind.  The first scene in his dream state shows his bedroom; with wife Lois Lane. Nothing inappropriate in the way of dialogue, but something I didn't expect to see in what is supposedly a kid cartoon. In the story by comics legend Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons of "Watchmen" fame"; Superman sees what his life might have been.  The parasite also gets a chance at Wonder Woman and Batman, but the parasite ends up on the black hat of this episode.  Seeing the villain looked so much like Darkside, I couldn't remember his name. Perhaps it was Mongul or Mogul.<br /><br />The other episodes featured Booster Gold.  Booster is a man who traveled in the past with current inventions and posed them as his own.  To tell you the truth, I stopped reading the comics so long ago, I haven't kept up with the characters anymore.  I just don't have the time.  I do see that the books are oriented to specific age groups more than my generation.  Back in the seventies you'd be lucky if you saw at least three titles with the same hero.  Today there are four, five and even more with the X-Men and Superman.<br /><br />There was a special features section that featured the actors.  The actor who portrayed the Green Lantern, John Stewart was from MAD TV.  It was hard to believe that this fellow had such a deep voice.  And here I thought the actor who played the part was a large guy.  There were other mini features that showed the physics behind Superman's powers.  Superman supposedly flies faster than the speed of sound.  That means video cameras couldn't catch him.  The whole idea of Superman changing in a phone booth is out of date today.  Not in the cell phone era at least.<br /><br />Superman is not the wimpy type that the comics often portrayed him as.  That is one of the aspects the new film touched upon.  Superman was modernized a bit so new audiences could appreciate him.  You could argue that he didn't fight enough for Lois Lane.  However in this film he stood his ground and wasn't a sap in front of Lois.  I did notice how the other actor who portrayed Lois's new beau was Cyclops of X-Men fame.  It looks like he was a contender for the Superman role.<br /><br />The days of skilled pen and ink rendering is gone.  It's created in a computer.  Comics have lost a lot of the nickel, dime charm and technology has taken over.  I like new things, but comics have lost their innocence.  Especially when the books are $2.99 apiece.  It looks like the video games are replacing the regular comics story.  That is why I have purchased the DVD collections of some of the old Marvel Comics.  So far I purchased the first 500 issues of the FF and Spidey and Mad on DVD and CD ROM.  That's enough reading for me for the next 10 years.  I do hope this catches on because I don't have the room to store all those in hard copy.<br /><br />If you like the Super hero cartoons your in for a treat this month.  I just picked up Superman the Animated Series Season 3.  It has 18 episodes with three accompanying directors commentaries.  Bruce Timm has a lot to say about the creation of each show and why decisions were made to streamline them for audiences.  I'd like to see more comics related animation from him.  Each project he's associated with has respect for it's source material.  When Batman: The animated series premiered all those years ago I was expecting a big letdown. I was glad to be wrong.  Comics were part of my childhood long ago and it's good to see that the classic ones are still around.  Although comics are no where near as popular as they used to be, they still have an audience.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>I really want to embrace this film with open arms.  From the time that I was a child, I sat captivated by various Superman incarnations (most notably the first two Christopher Reeve movies), then got into the "Supes" spirit again when Smallville hit the airwaves on television.  When I saw this movie in the theater on its premiere night in 2006, I thought it was absolutely incredible.  With a bit of reflection, however, it is clear that "Superman Returns" is little more than wasted potential.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Superman Returns" sees the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) returning to Earth from a long hiatus of searching for the remains of his home planet Krypton.  Upon his return to Earth and re-entry into the Clark Kent persona, he notices some major changes afoot.  Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is now married (husband played by James Marsden) and has a son (Tristan LeBeau), as well as a Pulitzer Prize for the article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman".  One thing that hasn't changed, however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) being up to his old nefarious deeds.<br /><br />I could prattle on and on about why this is a sub-par movie, but that dialogue can be summed up in two key bullet points:<br /><br />-First, is the utterly inconsistent plot/storyline.  Though director Bryan Singer wants us (the viewers) to believe that the world has "moved on" from Superman, it is as if nothing has changed whatsoever.  Clark still gets a job at the Daily Planet, all the characters act/look the same, and even the typical "Supes vs. Lex" rivalry is renewed with little to nothing new interjected.  The only addition?  A potential child figure in the life of the returning hero.  Without giving away any major spoilers, this is a TERRIBLE addition to the movie and only serves to complicated things more (as opposed to adding any real emotion).<br /><br />-Secondly, the writing/dialogue is atrocious.  Spacey is not a good Lex Luthor (though whether by casting or given dialogue I am not entirely sure), Bosworth is a middling Lois, and Routh can only channel Reeve (again, a failure to "move on" in the storyline).  The two actors who really stand out are Frank Langella (playing Perry White) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen), and even they are not on screen all that much.<br /><br />Simply put, "Superman Returns" is a movie for its time...and nothing more.  It was made to capitalize on the burgeoning success of Smallville, which had thrust "Superman mania" back into popular culture once again.  Singer does an okay job of playing to those who just wanted to see the suit, cape, Reeve impersonation, and flying scenes, but other than that he turns in an utter stinker.<br /><br />Ironically, while the cannon established in this effort wipes the events of Superman III & IV off the map, "Superman Returns" will likely not ever be considered cannon in its own right.  For rabid Superman fans, this is frustrating considering the massive potential that could have evolved from a truly great film at that time.<br /><br />The final verdict: Unless you care about nothing else but the visuals, this will be a severe disappointment.  You'll want to love it, but it doesn't ever give you a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I just recently watched the "Christopher Reeve collection" all four Superman movies in a row, so when I watched Superman Returns I had a proper visual in my mind to compare it too. Is it fair to compare them? Of course, because growing up with Christopher Reeve as "the" only superman makes me an expert skeptic, and with all the remakes and rip offs out there now, if you choose to make one you must be open to comparison. Superman is a seminal character in comic book, pop culture and movie history, essentially an alien story he has become the ultimate earth champion. I was afraid that making a new superman movie would pull him out of his gentleman old fashioned movie star ways, and recast him as some idiotic CGI modern superstar. Thank God they got it right!<br /><br />From the opening scene, with Brando's voice I just knew they were going to honor what came before. Brandon Routh is eerily similar to Reeves, both in looks and mannerisms. I am not sure how much of that is planned, or if Routh just carries himself the same way. Kevin Spacey as Lex is also like looking at Gene Hackman they both can carry off the "sneering, comical criminal mastermind", and look darn good bald. In the original movies I personally couldn't stand Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. Kidder never embodied Lane the way the comics fleshed her out to be, a strong reporter headstrong woman but feminine and just a bit na?ve, She was to abrasive and manly and quite frankly not all that attractive. So I hoped they would cast a better Lois, and that is the only thing they failed in. Kate Bosworth? Who's range of acting roles at this point have been to play surfers and horse lovers and Sandra Dee (who she also messed up). She is really a blonde, and the wig they used for her was awful, too high on her forehead. She is also too skinny and angular and just has one face for every single emotion. Routh deserved a better Lois just as Reeves did. As for the character of Kitty, played by the marvelous genius Parker Posey (who should have been Lane instead) she almost stole that movie altogether.<br /><br />As for the content of this movie, the plot, it was acceptable. They kept it simple and straightforward and executed it correctly without going too overboard and inserting too many CGI moments. (if you have ever read my reviews I abhor the misuse of CGI) the only time I cringed a bit was the close up of Superman flying and it was obviously not a green screen profile. The costumes were magnificent (love the new Superoutfit), the sets were breathtaking,  Bryan Singer made his own Superman, while honoring the old, and that is how it should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I am probably giving away my age but, as a child, I used to enjoy Superman on the radio.  I also read all of the comics.  By the time the television series began however, I considered Superman "kid stuff" and, for this reason, never saw any of the film versions of the Superman saga on the big screen either.  However, I'm now a grandma.  So watching "Superman Returns" with my 5- and 6-year old grandchildren was an interesting experience.<br /><br />When the film opens, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, is returning as Clark Kent to his mother, an elderly Eva Marie Saint.  He's been traveling in outer space for five years, trying to discover if the planet he originally came from, Krypton, still exists.  It doesn't.  And so he is thrust back into his life as both Superman and the quiet reporter, Clark Kent.  Naturally, he wants to see Lois Lane again, who just happens to have a 5-year old son and a boyfriend.  Of course there is also a bad guy.  That's Kevin Spacy, and he is introduced in a scene with an elderly woman which was extremely confusing.  This bad guy has a girlfriend, played by Parker Posey, who adds a bit of life into the rest of the film which seems a bit tired.<br /><br />Much to the delight of my grandchildren and the rest of the audience, there were great special effects.  However, I spent a lot of time explaining superman facts to them, like where Superman came from, and that the bad guy can hurt Superman by using Kryptonite. There is one part where the bad guy is beating up a weak superman which upset the children, but I was sure to tell them that in a movie like this Superman will ALWAYS win out in the end.  All of this explanation caused my grandson to as me, "How do YOU know so much about Superman, Grandma?"<br /><br />Yes.  I did enjoy the film.  But I don't think it had anything to do with its quality.  "Superman Returns" would have bored me completely if I didn't have my fresh-faced grandchildren to play mentor to.  That's why I can only give it a very modest recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>Everyone and the guy next to them at the bar has an opinion about this one. I liked it, hope you see it, and let it be what is. It is not everything I want in a Superman movie, but it was plenty of fun to see.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has been packed with pre-release hype. How can a Superman movie ever meet its hype? The hype for each movie has been building ever since Kal El first walked the Smallville cornfields in a comic book.<br /><br />The trouble with older viewers, like myself (near 40) is we grew up on the Christopher Reeve/Gene Hackman version, and watched reruns of George Reeves' TV version. Add that to years of comic book reading, cartoons and wondering what it would be like to fly, and our expectations are tough to meet.<br /><br />The Plot, in Short:<br />Superman comes back to Earth after five years of soul-searching, looking for the remains of Krypton. Lois is living with a guy, Perry's nephew, and has a young son. Lex is released from prison, and is out to get his life back as top bad guy with a plan to build a new continent. Clark Kent returns to his job at the Daily Planet.<br /><br />Lex's experiments cause a huge blackout, endangering, among other things, Lois who is on a plane that will launch a space shuttle. Superman saves the day, and the world applauds his glorious return.<br /><br />Lex coordinates a heist of Kryptonite, steals some crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and begins on his new continent campaign.<br /><br />Can Superman stop the destruction of most of the modern world? Can he save the lives of billions of people? Will Lois survive Lex's efforts to kill her? Will Lex succeed in killing Superman with Kryptonite?<br /><br />"Superman Returns" has the makings of beginning a great new franchise, but not because it is a great movie. It is good. Very good. Fun, active, occasionally funny, and usually interesting. It follows the strong themes: Patriotism, good is good, bad is bad, and crime is a world problem that needs a hero. It is replete with Christian and mythical symbols, from Jesus Christ, to Atlas, to Loki. It is filled with heroics we expect from the man dressed in red, white and blue tights.<br /><br />However, it comes off as a different vision than what I hoped. Superman isn't as masculine, Clark isn't as awkward, Lex isn't as "love to hate." It seems as if the softer characters are segued from the TV series "Smallville," and not the traditional Superman I remember.<br /><br />Lex is still the bad guy. He still wants to rule the world. He still has a devious plan to pull it off, and is still surrounded by less than bright lackeys. Kevin Spacey's Lex isn't bad enough to convince me he is so terrible. I like him too much.<br /><br />Lois is still love-torn about Superman, and still disregards affection for Clark, but Kate Bosworth does not seem enough like a journalist who could win a Pulitzer Prize for "Why the World No Longer Needs Superman." She lacks that spark of brilliant hard-work.<br /><br />Perry Mason isn't edgy enough. J. Jonah Jameson of Peter Parker's Daily Bugle comes off far better as that guy in charge persona. Mason is too easily pushed-off.<br /><br />A few twists are worked in that reduced my view of the perfectly wholesome Superman. I need to leave off why, but as the writers and directors of the movie built in Christian imagery (Superman is a world savior, he lives his life as a sacrifice for the world there's a second coming, some Trinitarian concepts, I could on), they hurt the image. Maybe this is an attempt to create a more human character. Spiderman's movies have done amazingly well humanizing his persona.<br /><br />I have no doubt we will see more of this Superman. Whether Lex returns in the next movie I suppose depends on finding a believable bad guy. Lex is a good model to start from, but our man in tights has a long history to draw from. There is more story in the canon, and I hope to be there in the seats.<br /><br />I fully recommend "Superman Returns."<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>It would be tempting to dismiss Superman Returns with a cursory he shouldn't have bothered. Certainly for all the noble intentions it's the most misconceived blockbuster in years, at times misjudging its audience more than any mega-budget film since Speed 2. On paper it sounds so promising - ignoring the last two Superman films and following on from Superman II as if they never happened, throwing Marlon Brando back in the mix via archive footage and bringing the Man of Steel back to Earth after an absence of several years during which people have begun to question whether they even need him anymore. And after Bryan Singer's success with the first two X-Men films, he'd seem the perfect director. Yet the end result is one of the most disappointingly dull and relentlessly glum movies of the century, and certainly one of the grottiest looking major studio films ever. It's at once one of those films that manages to look both expensive and cheap. You can see where money has been spent, but it never really counts. If anything it looks like a busted, bloated miniseries, all buildup but precious little payoff. What we get instead is endless brooding.<br /><br />Yet the relentlessly oppressive look of the film is merely a symptom of a far greater malaise. Where Donner mixed sorrow with joy and exuberance, Singer just gives us naval gazing as his Superman spends far more of the movie brooding, brooding and then brooding some more, not even finding any satisfaction in the few feats of heroism he performs. Indeed, they should have changed the tagline to 'You'll believe a man can brood' as he mopes his way through much of the agonisingly long 154 very long minutes. He hardly even flies - he just hovers around wallowing in wistful self-pity forever before we finally get half an hour of decent action before its back to the misery (albeit somewhat more effective than the dreary first half).<br /><br />The film is often genuinely monotonous in the dictionary sense of the word. There's no sense of pace or narrative economy, no joy of discovery, no eagerness to see what happens next, just an unexciting trudge through the superhero's angst as he endlessly hovers around. Worse, this is a film with no sense of wonder at all.<br /><br />Where the Donner films worked was their ability to juggle loss, emotion, a sense of wonder and joy and exuberance - with Reeve you got the impression that Superman enjoyed using his powers to do good, but here it's nothing but a cross to bear in a series of even-more-bleedin'-obvious-than-The-Passion-of-the-Christ metaphors. Look, there's Supes being crucified; look, there's Supes being scourged; and look - on the Third day the tomb is empty and he has risen!<br /><br />Yet for all the time spent on would-be character building scenes, even by the half hour point we know surprisingly little and care less about the characters, so that when Superman finally goes into action in a well-conceived but strangely unexciting shuttle rescue it carries no real weight. Only Kevin Spacey seems to be bringing anything to the party, his Lex Luthor dominating the film far more than should be good for it as he sets about his latest real estate scam at great length. On the side of good, Brandon Routh fares better as Clark Kent than as Superman, his weak voice combining with a poor sound mix to make the Man of Steel sound distinctly wimpier than the mild-mannered reporter. Kate Bosworth does her best with Lois Lane, but the character goes through the film with such a huge chip on her shoulder it's impossible to warm to her despite her best efforts. Hell, you know a film's in trouble when James Marsden makes the most impression!<br /><br />And it all looks so grotty all the time, with the limitations of the video photography robbing even close-ups of detail (some shots of Superman's face look more like a Final Fantasy computer simulation than a real person), limiting the color scheme (Superman's costume usually looks turquoise or green here) and seemingly limiting the action to clumsy tight shots that limit the film's scale. Even basic no-brainer shots are simply botched - hard to believe but even the would-be iconic shot of Clark ripping off his shirt to reveal - well, just a little bit of blue vest actually - flops because the shot misses the iconic `S' logo entirely as if the film was framed for fullframe TV instead of widescreen.<br /><br />Nor are the well-intentioned nods to the Donner films successful. The Brando footage, after the first scene, seem more gimmick than anything else, with lines thrown in almost at random to no effect whatsoever. It even rehashes huge chunks of other characters' dialogue from the first film, showing up just how short some of the players fall (Routh seems almost apologetic when delivering the `flying is still statistically speaking the safest way to travel' bit while Parker Posey does her best with Valerie Perrine's cast-off wisecracks).<br /><br />Although they're talking about adding more action for the proposed sequel, that's really not the solution - the 1978 film probably had less action than this, but it counted because we were involved with and liked the characters: you wanted him to rescue Lois from the helicopter, whereas this time round you couldn't care less if the surly cow burned up in the shuttle scene or not (as an introduction to her as well it's incredibly poor). What this needs is characters we like and can root for, not bigger set pieces. As it stands, Hell, even Fantastic Four was a more successful superhero flick than this. It's as if someone decided to film Lois Lane's editorial `Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.' Looks like Supe's fatal flaw isn't Kryptonite, it's Bryan Singer. Still, it could have been worse: it could have been Brett Ratner...<br /><br />The extras on the 2-disc set are good and at least highlight the sincere intentions behind this misfire but it's hard to muster up the enthusiasm to watch them throughout after seeing the film, especially since the expensive Krypton prolog is NOT included in the deleted scenes, being held back for a future special edition in what seems a particularly cynically commercial move. The transfer of the feature is okay, but the limitations of the original digital photography are often very apparent, meaning that it frequently looks worse than the first two films made more than a quarter of a century ago!</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This movie looks great. Beautiful cinematography and the special effects were amazing. But what's up with the rest of it? It's pretty obvious that Brandon Routh can't act. Bryan Singer barely gave him any lines at all and when he did speak, it was wooden. Brandon most likely got the part because he looked the part. But it probably would have been wiser to go with someone who can act. The storyline is just terrible. If and when there is a next one, it should start out with Superman waking up and everything that happened in this movie was all just a dream. He should not have a son. People don't want to see Superman as a daddy. And the kid has absolutely no purpose in this film. Other than throwing a piano. And Lois Lane's boyfriend is a drag. Lex Luthor is handled very poorly. He somehow figures out a way to raise an island from out of the ocean which will then flood much of the world and kill "billions." Well...the island does come up out of the water but nobody is flooded at all. There's one little wave and that's it. If you want to see a good, 3 dimensional villain, just look at Ian McKellen's Magneto in the X-Men films. Bryan Singer did a much better job with those movies than he did with Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I thought the original Christopher Reeve movie had its moments, but reversing time was just too stupid for me to take it seriously. I didn't watch the Salkinds finish killing the franchise, although I did read about the destruction on the Agony Booth website, where they treat me like kryptonite. And as a child, I thought the comics were just stupid. Thus, I was hesitant to see this. But one of my Chinese students, whose English name is Bruce Wayne, said he preferred it to BATMAN BEGINS. I love BATMAN BEGINS. So even though Bruce Wayne's loose lips gave me one of the big plot spoilers, I decided I oughta watch it anyway. Then, in Thailand, Jan gave my DVD to a student before I had the chance. No matter. I found another last week.<br /><br />Superman has always required a willing suspension of disbelief that's been difficult for me to pull off. The flaws in his secret identity really come to light when Superman and Clark Kent both return from five-year absences, and look much alike, and nobody notices.<br /><br />His supersuit is never harmed by the stresses of his lifestyle but yields to Martha Kent's scissors, needle and thread. It's creepy watching him spy on people with super-hearing and X-ray vision, not for some "greater good" that he has no right to judge, but rather to sort out his love life. Being invincible is boring, kryptonite is contrived, and why were doctors giving him oxygen when he flies through space and apparently doesn't need to breathe?<br /><br />But Lex Luthor finally makes sense to me. I love his boat.<br /><br />On the whole, a fresh approach, a good reimagining of the Superman concept, and a watchable movie. But I won't be rushing out looking for any sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Superman is OK. The SFX are good. The story palatable. An OK afternoon.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Last summer director Christopher Nolan boldly (and wisely) chose to revamp the Batman saga with the box office smash, "Batman Begins." The producers of television's "Smallville" took "creative license" with the Superman legend, producing a show faithful to the mythology yet unique in its own right.<br /><br />Now comes, "Superman Returns," which pays homage to the previous film and television adaptations, while maintaining the "comic book daring-do" and peril. Director Bryan Singer has a genuine respect for the character and does little to alter the viewer's preconceived notions of "The Man of Steel."<br /><br />And that's the film's biggest weakness: there's very little that is fresh and exciting about this interpretation of the myth.<br /><br />Of course, the special effects are state-of-the-art and one can see the producers' investments were well spent. However, the story itself is rather basic: Superman returns from a self-imposed exile, Lois has gone on with her life and had a child, Lex Luthor is still up to no good, and Superman eventually saves the world.<br /><br />But, even in the scene where an incapacitated Superman is roughed up by Luthor and his lackeys, one never feels that the "man in blue" is ever in any danger.<br /><br />And the fact the Lois Lane survives not one but two life-ENDING situations stretch the imagination even for a science fiction/fantasy film of this type.<br /><br />As far as the performances go, Brandon Routh does a reasonably good job as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman, even though he had some huge shoes to fill, following Christopher Reeve who put his signature on the role. The producers of "Smallville," as well as Tom Welling, were wise enough to not have the Clark Kent character interpreted as did Reeve.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth makes a worthy "Lois Lane" and James Marsden is very good as Lane's suitor who must come to grips that his main competition is a guy "faster than a speeding bullet." Frank Langella does an adequate "Perry White," while Sam Huntingdon does a good job of "channeling" Marc McClure from the first two Reeve's films.<br /><br />Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint is appropriately sincere as "Martha Kent"; however, "Smallville's" Annette O'Toole is a more dynamic interpretation and more of a contemporary version of Superman's "mom."<br /><br />Parker Posey's "Kitty Kowalski" is a bit too dense and doesn't compare to Valerie Perrine's "Miss Teschmacher" from the 70's films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kevin Spacey, though probably due to the script, makes "Lex Luthor" nothing more than a "thug with money." In both the earlier films, and both the animated and live action versions, Lex Luthor is calculating, ruthless, but possessing of an air of class about him. Michael Rosenbaum, Gene Hackman, and Clancy Brown have assayed the role, respectively, and have emboldened the character with traits the Spacey's version lacked.<br /><br />On another front, composer John Ottman borrowed familiar themes by John Williams for the original films. However, Ottman's "original" music sounds so similar to Williams's arrangements that the producers might as well have paid Williams' asking price.<br /><br />It is hoped that the next go-around will be a "return" that's a tad "fresher."<br /><br />3.5 stars, rounded off to 4</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>This should normally have been a five-star rating but there were a couple of things that irked me, despite some of the inconsistencies.  It was funny, the visual effects have been much improved since the last Superman releases, the acting was very impressive, and the story has been moved forward in a way that fans have been begging for a very long time.<br /><br />But for a Superman movie there was a lot of talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... while leaving everybody waiting for the next bit of action.  The action does come, but in small little pieces that leave you wishing for more.  This movie does not give Superman the screentime to really show off his powers.<br /><br />I was also irked by some of the changes.  For instance, the phrase, "life, liberty, and all that stuff?"  What, is the American Way not good enough anymore?  And some of the comparisons between Superman and Jesus Christ were a little unsettling.  Christ is the founder of one of the largest religions on this planet, DC shouldn't be getting such an ego comparing their comic book character to him.<br /><br />I got the High Definition edition of Superman and was very disappointed.  The picture quality, while better than DVD, was not as good as most of the other DVD movies that I've picked up.  The lack of high definition was very surprising considering the money put into this movie.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel, there is still a lot to learn and see from Superman.  And now that film technology has caught up (and bypassed) the imagination of DC comics I hope they don't delay on making more movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Superman Returns really does for me recall the first two  starring Christopher Reeve. First of all the physical resemblance of Brandon Routh to Reeve is striking. Second, neither of them can act. So what? That doesn't prevent either of these movies from being near great. Let's conveniently forget about 3. You once again have an over-the-top Lex Luther. Kevin Spacey v Gene Hackman? Not bad. So, nobody has seen Superman or Clark for five years. He just left. Superman was chasing a hunk of his home planet Krypton hurtling through the universe. Clark? Who missed him? Maybe Jimmy. He returns as if nothing had happened to resume his old job. Lois now has a son, also five years old. She must have hooked up, very quickly apparently, with a math whiz who can't add months & the kid calls him dad. That's the hook for the next chapter. Kevin Spacey is eating every scene he's in. He is creating a new continent off the shore of North America & billions will die. His girl friend, Kitty has a thing for Superman & talk about deja'vu. Anyway, Superman is again saved from deadly green kryptonite. Lex Luther is not killed. He is very much alive & free. I've left out the details, of course. They can make 10 more of these if they like just don't change Superman like they do Batman with every new movie. Brandon Routh is fine & Kevin Spacey is great. The rest of the cast is interchangable. Hardcore fans have probably already seen this one. Its been out for a while. I expect there will be a double disc dvd to look forward to in time for Christmas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9.html">A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9</a><br/><p>Last summer, director Christopher Nolan reinvigorated the BATMAN legend with a character-driven thrill-ride chock full of surprises and endless invention, but the same can't be said of Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS, which feels like a retread for much of its lethargic and bloated running-time. I can't say this was a major disappointment since my expectations going in were modest at best, but this thing was sooo shockingly mundane; nothing in this movie stirs up much excitement or comes close to matching the awe and wonder Richard Donner's film fashioned so exhuberantly.<br /><br />With few exceptions, the casting is disastrous: Bosworth takes the plucky Lois Lane and imbues her with the sum energy derived from digesting a handful of sleeping pills; Spacey's Luthor, while more faithful to the source material than previous screen versions, isn't half as memorable as Gene Hackman's playful take on the character, and Frank Langella is sooo lackluster a Perry White I'm not even sure he was awake when his scenes were shot. As for Routh, he improved as the film progressed, but he still looks more like Superboy (or, more precisely, RUSHMORE's Max Fischer) than the Man of Steel. (His adolescent looks and awkward first attempts to mimic Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent are painful to watch)<br /><br />The missteps in casting could have been glossed over if the film delivered some truly jaw-dropping scenes of Super-derring-do, but there's little suspense or excitement to the action set-pieces that seem regurgitated from previous films, and the special-effects -- the one area it was reasonable to expect improvement in leaps and bounds -- are competent but unambitious and not that big an upgrade from what Donner achieved in 1978. In fact, director Bryan Singer, who did such a fine job with the first two X-MEN films, seems so intent on capturing the style of the Donner classic that he leaves little of his own imprint on SUPERMAN RETURNS.  SUPERMAN RETURNS most reminds me of Tim Burton's "re-imagining" of PLANET OF THE APES; each had heaps of money lavished on them, but both are completely lifeless. And since when did Clark Kent wear glasses as a young boy??<br /><br />Ultimately, this new SUPERMAN may appeal more to those who didn't grow up with the Christopher Reeve movies, but at 2 1/2 hours, it may be too slow to become the smash Warner was hoping for; it certainly won't rule the box-office for 13 consecutive weeks as the 1978 original did.  In the end, it's ironic the filmmakers chose to feature the song "Heart and Soul" when SUPERMAN RETURNS had neither.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>I must admit, I only have a working knowledge of Superman.  I haven't seen the previous movies or the various TV shows.  Still, I know who all the characters are and was quite anxious to see this movie.  While that means I missed out of some cool cameos, I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />For five years, the world has been without Superman (Brandon Routh).  Now, he's come back to Earth and is ready to pick up where he left off.<br /><br />Fortunately, his alter ego, Clark Kent, is able to get his old job back at The Daily Planet.  While Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is thrilled to see him back, his reunion with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is very chilly.  During the last five years, she's moved on with her life.  She has a son (Tristan Lake Leabu) and is engaged to Richard White (James Marsden).  Seeing Superman again stirs up old feelings within her, so she's not exactly thrilled to be assigned to cover him again.<br /><br />Meanwhile, old nemesis Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has just been released from prison.  He's already planning his next bid for world domination.  It involves crystals, kryptonite, and creating land.  Will Superman figure out what he's up to in time to stop him?<br /><br />The movie is two and a half hours long, and unfortunately it feels it.  The first part of the movie is very slow with back story even this newbie didn't need.  Once the story got going, it was interesting and held my interest through the end, which again dragged on for a scene or two more then necessary.<br /><br />Much has been made of casting an unknown in the roll.  I liked Brandon Routh in the lead.  He has a commanding presence as Superman.  Kevin Spacey was great as well.  His Luthor was equal parts fun and menace.  The only real problem was Kate Bosworth.  She did a great job, but she looked too young for the part.  For this story to work, the actress playing Lois needed to be at least thirty, and Kate isn't.<br /><br />And, of course, there are the special effects, which are incredible and flawlessly fit into the film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie, but not the great movie I had hoped it would be.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>I thought Singer's XMen movie was decent. I thought XMen 2 was awesome! I know first films are difficult. The director and the writers have to set the stage for the characters which have been living in comics for decades. There had never been an XMen movie until Singer directed the first one. There have been four Superman movies before this one.<br /><br />My filmgoing companion loved the film. I was sorely disappointed with Superman Returns. Actors aside, the script is just not enough different from the original Superman film. So what's the point of recreating it? There's all sorts of "big" action (he stops a plane from crashing - the best action in the film - and other "big" stuff) but it ends up being non action, because it's all just too big and outlandish. And isn't anyone else out there getting more than a little bored with Lex Luthor - a mere mortal, albeit a megalomaniacal one - being the be all, end all nemesis for the Man of Steel? For Pete's sake there are many other villains that they could bring to the forefront. Let's see Superman fight for crying out loud! I'm sick to death of seeing him (on the big screen) stop trains, planes, buildings, signs, etc. It's all too big, too predictable. He can't fight Lex Luthor because Luthor will drop dead with one punch. After all Superman is SUPER! Give Superman someone SUPER to fight! What about Brainiac? What about dozens of other villains he's fought over the years? Geezaloo, are the writers/producers that narrow minded?<br /><br />Now, to the CGI (special effects)...didn't anyone else find Superman's look to be more than a little "plastic" looking? I was jarred out of my suspension of disbelief repeatedly by the smooth appearance of Superman's face and tights etc. He looked like a computer generated character rather than a living breathing actor (the handsome but stiff Brandon Routh).<br /><br />All in all, the best Superman storyline and proper updating of Superman has been getting done in the television series "Smallville" which has breathed far more life into the character and the stale storylines than Singer's blockbuster budgeted film ever could. In the television series Clark Kent isn't a complete bumbling dolt and as such he is fresh and believable.<br /><br />Unless Superman (read: producers, director, and studio) can come up with some better storylines and fresh villains, I'm afraid any future outings will just be further dull, listless outings. Give me the XMen, Smallville, Spiderman, HellBoy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and such as my super heros any day over the stiff and repetitive Superman Returns. The super heros in those films are hands on and the action is more "real". Sure, Superman is supposed to be "superior" and stand for truth, justice and the American way, but what's he's turned into is a big ol' dull goody two shoes with more muscles than sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>Roaring, triumphant, stirring visual poetry - this is "Superman Returns," a stunning piece of pop art celebrating a comic book superhero as more than a psychological headcase - although there's some of that in Bryan Singer's film - but as an icon that bridges the gap between, yes, Earth and the universe - the mystery that surrounds its vastness and God. Yes, it's underwritten - loose ends dangle about. And it's not very funny. And it's not "action-packed." And aside from Kevin Spacey's work as Lex Luthor, the performances are more about the look of the actor than the acting itself.<br /><br />But so were many of Stanley Kubrick's later films, when the director communicated a narrative beyond the script, marrying film, sound, music and editing into mesmerizing sequences that simply held you, alert and aware of the scene's resonance and singularity - it was like so much, and yet nothing like those things. It's exuberant and risky to compare Singer to that standard - his "X-Men" pictures were competent, nothing more - but the last hour of this film reaches for that titanic light and grasps it with a somber, beautiful tone that seeks to comment on nothing less than the fate of our souls.<br /><br />Using same credit titles from the original "Superman" and "Superman II," "Superman Returns" begins with the destruction of the planet Krypton, which Superman (Brandon Routh) despite knowing its fate, seeks out anyway, leaving Earth for five years to find it "a graveyard" and returning to more or less resume duties - and a relationship with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). But Lois has moved on to a decent boyfriend (James Marsden, again the other man) and a son (Tristan Lake Leabu), of whom, it is now known, is the son of Superman.<br /><br />The early acts of the screenplay by Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty concern themselves more with Luthor's plan to reconfigure Earth with Krypton crystals, which he finds can create new (if pretty uninhabitable) landmasses for his control. Spacey has reworked Luthor as a soulless, humorless but convincing demon who picks at the flaws of Superman while erecting a hell on Earth over which he can reign. His moll, Kitty (Parker Posey) is a mouthy dim bulb and his collected henchmen are, thankfully, more fearsome than idiotic. One experiment with the crystals causes an accident aboard an Airbus jet that Lois is on, and Superman's "return" is to save it and, in the process see Lois again.<br /><br />Routh is no Olivier, or even Christopher Reeve, but then Singer's doesn't require it; in fact, needs Routh to be just what he is. Superman is upright and quiet, burdened by human psychosis but not racked with it himself, content to let his deeds and warmth speak on their own. He makes an effort to woo to Lois away from her boyfriend, but it is not a fierce one. Bosworth makes a cute, likable Lois, smart and insecure, a trembler who marches forth anyway, and is drawn to Superman's certitude. She won a Pulitzer for writing an editorial about "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman," which of course is a substitute for a father, or God, or absolute authority. Superman really stands in as an angel sent by father Jor-El (Marlon Brando, in voiceovers from the original "Superman") to save "a good people, who wish to do well." An angel who complicates his existence by loving one of them.<br /><br />And we are them. Through Lois, and her boyfriend, Singer charts our relationship with the myth. Through Luthor, he presents an eloquent, brutal argument - just look what "goodness" Superman's home material will bring us. "God is a selfish being who share his powers," he says, prior to harnessing some of that power. Superman's rebuttal is a straight shot beyond Earth, to lend an ear to all the aggrieved who cry out, or to draw radiance from a blazing sun above the clouds. Singer presents these uncomplicated, pristine, wonderfully framed scenes at the right moments, capturing, in a blink, the relationship of a blessed son with his father, that son with the world, the son with himself. Better, at this stage in our cinematic capabilities, that the film doesn't bog itself down in the lengthy discourse required to explain Superman's pose to the world. More pointed and visually impacting to simply show it. Recalling "Batman Begins," the most memorable shot is that of Christian Bale, perched on a skyscraper at dusk, a sentry over the city. "Superman Returns" is full of that wonder, culminating in an extraordinary sequence that finds the Man of Steel saving the planet and falling back to it at an incalculable speed, rustling the trees of their mist upon his landing.<br /><br />Singer and cinematographer Thomas Newton Sigel wisely forge these visuals with a darker palette borne out of the deep blues and pitch blacks of outer space. The final act of "Superman Returns" is set against an ocean storm and gray, monolithic structure that recalls the undersea Manhattan of Steven Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence." Otherwise, Metropolis glistens, and the Daily Planet seems to exist in a perpetual golden dust, Singer borrowing Kubrick's technique to airbrush the light into a furry haze, especially around Bosworth. The production and costume design is classic, snazzy and retro. The movie resonates with the mood of an earlier, innocent era, despite the stakes at hand. The look is warm and rapturous.<br /><br />It cuts a path that will stupefy some moviegoers, who will find it dry, save Spacey's performance as Luthor. A hardening of the culture, and a lack of intangible curiosity, will bring them to their boredom, so accustomed they've become to the overliterate and brainy scripts of recent superhero movies. "Superman Returns" has a deep subtext - spiritual, in fact - but it's a visual one; the screenplay is enough of a foundation to support the images, but Singer does not endeavor to mire his picture down in a pop culture sludge that makes it tastier.<br /><br />The result is action cinema of high order. It can be chilling - a piano duet between the boy and one of Luthor's henchmen. Or tragic - a severe beating of Superman on the krypton island. Or, in the climax, extraordinary. But so many of the scenes have the whisper of deep care behind them, of exquisite construction, of the hush of a late evening across the world. "Superman Returns" is a mournful, moody, wonderful thing. Its calm is rousing, and its universal perspective wise. Some myth all right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I just saw this movie; MY GOD, More then half of this movie is DAMN SOOO slow & boring! I just wants to see this movie because of "Brandon Routh" in spandex! He's first film and he's real cute...YA, he's real cute an all. But movie drags a lot & slow pasted till almost end of the movie got picked up some action an all, then was kind of to late. I lost the interest, Because most the movie was slow Pasted! I was accepting like spiderman series, type a high tank action, but was way to far, they push the damn love story to it to much makes it more drama then comic action hero flick!!!!!!!!!!Anyway not all that. I guess just a rental worth and seen just once, nothing more C+</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>We have waited after that embarrassingly low-budget `Superman IV' and we have waited so long. We have seen TV series, yes, but what about the feature film? Now Superman finally comes back to the big screen, and maybe, just maybe, we should admit `Superman Returns' is not what we expected. Some have already panned it, even calling it `Superman Repeats,' and showing their disappointed feelings blatantly.<br /><br />[ORIGINALITY ?] Or we should call it `Superman Recycled.' The only significant difference in the unoriginal story of the newest version is that to his dismay Superman returns to find that Lois Lane is now living with another man and her little boy. But who can blame her? For five years ago Clark Kent suddenly left the Earth without telling anyone about the true reasons?<br /><br />This misguided idea of Superman's AWOL almost kills the first part of the film, in which we are told that Lex Luther returns because Superman failed to give testimony in court. We are also told that Superman travels back all the way to his birthplace only to find nothing. Yes, literally nothing. These are no thrilling news to hear, without which I can live and enjoy the film.<br /><br />The real story gets underway when Clark Kent becomes Superman and saves the life of Lois Lane and other passengers on the airplane. The exciting sequences are what we want to see, and the film gets better after that despite the fact that the dull script is virtually recycling the old materials from the Richard Donner version. It is a shame that Lex Luther couldn't come up with any brilliant plans to terrorize the world, only sticking to his old idea about the price of the land.<br /><br />Perhaps you are not supposed to find great acting here, and actually you don't find it. Brandon Routh is OK as Superman, but he looks slightly wooden and humorless, and so is Kate Bosworth who portrays non-descript Lois Lane. Director Brian Singer gives stress to the romantic side of the story, but more impressive is James Marsden as Lois Lane's fianc&eacute; who comes to realize their complex relations. Kevin Spacey is so-so as Luther, but you may miss Gene Hackman who effortlessly expressed the comic charms of this villainous role. Only Parker Posey and Eva Marie Saint know what they are doing and what they should do, especially the former as Kitty who gives precious comic touch to this film.<br /><br />Much awaited new `Superman' entry turns out slightly above-average superhero action film. In spite of its undeniable merits such as exciting actions, the results do not exactly justify our long waiting, though.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I thought this sequel could've been a lot better then what it is, like many of today's sequels & remakes of classics, they put all there time and effort into the effects they can do now that they couldn't do back when the originals where made and after that they decided to try & write a script around it.<br /><br />PLOT: Superman has left the planet and hasn't been seen for years since the last movie, apparently he left the planet because astrologers thought they had found his planet of Krypton, so he went to see for himself only to return to say it wasn't there to his Earth mother who they may as well have not included in the movie as she plays in scenes that aren't relevant to the story and she has nothing to do with anything in this movie.<br /><br />So Superman's back, he discovers Lois Lane had moved on with her life and settled down, gotten married and had a kid. Lex Luther managed to get out of his life sentence and has managed to steal the crystals of Superman's arctic home and use them for world domination. So Superman has to come back and save the day while feeling unloved.... boo-hoo.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the storyline to this one, I think they tried to show Superman's heartbreak over discovering Louis was married and had a kid, but quite frankly i never felt for him at all, nor did I feel one bit sad for him at the end of this movie with what happens or feel touched by his words to his so...mthing ... and I think they where trying to show that Superman excepted the husband, but man, that needed a huge re-write to tell it better along with so much else that you can pick up on and say "I get it" but I doubt anyone could say they felt it.<br /><br />The whole thing doesn't have the feel of the 70's/80's versions that this is a sequel to. There is just way too many visual effects, too much sickening CGI that is not needed to tell a story, I couldn't adjust to the characters not even resembling the original actors, and I suppose they did some ground breaking CGI effects and showed things that wasn't possible in the other movies, but again, use them to a well written plot instead of making a movie around the CGI.<br /><br />For the first half of the movie I was a bit confused not being able to work out what the hell was happening, I guess it all kind of made sense by the end, and speaking of the end, as I predicted, leave it as a set-up for a sequel.<br /><br />I didn't like the way the movie started, it was slow, confusing and boring, the middle kind of picked up a bit and became a little bit better, then the ending just had no satisfaction at all, an end to a superman movie should be climactic, not just be over and done with then fly around for 5 minutes.<br /><br />And another thing about the CGI, what is with this greyish looking fog thing all over these days' movies? War Of The Worlds did the same thing, have producers and moviemakers in Hollyweed got something against using more then 5 colours these days? Why can't they add some bright colours? Why cant trees be green and oceans be blue? Why do they almost have to be grey and dark all the time with fake fog and mist all over the place? It might be a work of art to those developing it, but give us a break and try and do something that looks real and doesn't make you nauseous for crying out loud.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this film was made simply by going to Warner and someone saying, "hey we can do more visually now then what we could back then with Superman, here is an hours worth of CGI, what do you say we cash in and make some money out of it? Don't worry about the plot or acting or a good script, you know the title alone will be gold"</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Bryan Singer's take on the Man of Steel.  Said to be a sequel to SUPERMAN & SUPERMAN II, it lacks the feel of the Donner film and not even the Donner/Lester amalgamation that is the 2nd film.  I like Brandon Routh as Kent/Superman.  He isn't Christopher Reeve but he does a pretty decent job.  Kevin Spacey is a truly vile and vicious Lex Luthor, Parker Posey a trip as his girlfriend Kitty.  Frank Langella is ok as Perry White (stepping in after Hugh Laurie had to bow out), Sam Huntington a good Jimmy Olson and Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent.  As the acting goes, the weak link is Kate Bosworth.  She is such a lousy Lois Lane.  What killed this project -- it was a $200 million production that made money but not enough (movies have to do double their cost to break EVEN) -- it is dark, it is violent and long and kinda boring.  What Singer managed to infuse into the X-Men franchise he couldn't do for the Man of Steel.  Will we see another Superman adventure on the big screen?  I am confident.  It might be years but you can't keep a good man down.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>...I'm still waiting for Superman. Bryan Singer brings his gee-wizardry to the mothballed Superman series and then utterly fails to add anything new. In fact, he barely can disguise the fact that he has - in essence - remade the first Christopher Reeves' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J">Superman</a>" with a time-line update or two. Brandon Routh (who seemed to get the part because of his uncanny resemblance to Reeves) returns to Earth after a futile five year search for the remnants of Krypton. He discovers that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, looking far too young for the part) has moved on, got a fiance and had a son. She even kissed Superman off with a Pulitzer Prize editorial called "Why The World Doesn't Need Superman."<br /><br />And then there's Lex Luthor. Using the five years that Superman has vanished to bilk an aging billionairess of all her money, he is back to plotting Lutherland again. I was all but waiting for the terrific Parker Posey to blubber "But Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack" as Luther (a malevolent and humorless Kevin Spacey) describes how millions, no, BILLIONS will die as he floods the continent.<br /><br />It's all pretty obvious where this is headed, no? If you're old enough to remember seeing the first Christopher Reeves version, then little of this will surprise you. Everyone plays their parts well (with the exception of Bosworth as Lane) and some of the minor casting is excellent (Frank Langella and Eva Marie Saint in particular). The crashing jet is a great opening for the film and does get "Superman Returns" off to a flying start, but there is just too much retread here to raise this above average. Here's hoping Singer, who has proven himself to be a far better movie-maker than this, gets a crack at the sequel. Should he manage that, I am hoping he can move past the cliches and deliver a Superman that is as original and as vibrant as the 70's movies he so obviously admires.<br /><br />Another nice touch - the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeves.<br /><br />Incidentally, this DVD has NO extras. Not even a trailer or previews. Nada, nutting. For a full price DVD, that's a bit of a gyp,</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>The Man of Steel is back!  Superman Returns is visually stunning, taking advantage of all the latest technology to make the story believeable, the settings real looking and true to the comics.<br /><br />More than that, the film recasts the hero in the mold set by Christopher Reeve.  Unlike the Batman films, where there is no continuity of character after Batman Returns, Superman Returns does as good a job as possible of picking up the story where it left off with the last Christopher Reeve film, at least in terms of the Superman character.  In the film moreso than the promotional material, Brandon Routh bears a striking similarity to Mr. Reeve's Superman.  He even sounds like him and did a great job of copying Reeve's Clark Kent twitches, eyebrow-raises and awkwardness.*<br /><br />There is no continuity with the rest of the characters.  Kate Bosworth, as Lois Lane, is cute but lacks the sassiness of Margot Kidder's Lois.  Frank Langella's Perry White lacks the crabbiness of Jackie Cooper's portrayal.  Jimmy Olsen is, well, still Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is a great villain and does a fine job as Lex Luthor.  He's brilliant and clearly evil.  But his portrayal lacks the charm and fun brought to the part by Gene Hackman.  Perhaps this is the script and not the actor.<br /><br />All in all, Superman Returns is darker, less light-hearted than the previous Superman films.  Gone are the one-liners and bits of comic relief.  In their place are more pieces of the love quadrangle between Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Superman and Lois's current love, Richard White (Perry's nephew.)  Lois, now a mother, has her heart tugged in three different directions after Superman returns (thus the title) from a five year hiatus from planet Earth.<br /><br />Superman Returns is a fun film.  Though darker, there was little killing (mostly bad guys being crushed by heavy objects.)  It may not be appropriate for smaller kids, but it is family-friendly if your children are older.  One caution for those with more traditional values: Lois has a child out of wedlock and lives, unmarried, with Richard.  That is presented tastefully, however.<br /><br />*[While Routh's recreation of the Christopher Reeve Superman is masterful, it may be a detriment to his career in the long run.  Rather than bringing his own interpretation of the character to the screen, Routh simply imitates -- again, probably what the writers, director and producer wanted -- Reeve playing Superman.  He's good at it, to be sure, but it is hard to imagine what he has shown to people looking at him for another (non-Superman) part.]</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Ever since Bryan singer left the highly anticipated X-men saga, people have wondered why he would leave such a successful series. But Bryan Singer heavily declared that reintroducing The Superman story has always been one of his lifelong dreams. (Just like Peter Jackson did with King Kong.)<br /><br />And his dedication in this film truly shows. Right from the getgo we are introduced to superman's nemesis Lex Luthor who is slowly plotting a plot to destroy superman and have his taste of victory once and for all. Follwoing that, Superman makes his entrance. But It's not your normal entrance. This Superhero's been gone for several years. And leaving Metropolis has taken it's toll on the citizen's. They now have learned to completely forget about superman and move on with there lives.<br /><br />(Just like in real life, audiences were secretly craving another superman movie but slowly moved on and thought that it wouldn't happen.)<br /><br />This time around, Lois lane has adapted her life completely Superman-free. That is, until, you know who starts flying around the town doing good deeds. You begin to realize that Superman is slowly rebuilding his status in Society and returning to what he does best.<br /><br />Replacing Gene hackman is Kevin Spacey, a perfect casting decision of course.<br /><br />Replacing Christopher Reeve is Brandon Routh, a newcomer to the series and this is his debut film.<br /><br />Throughout the filme, you will notice that the special effects have been improved on massively compared to the 1978 version of the classic Superman. But Brandon routh doesn't feel like a simple replacment in my eyes. He looks and sounds just like christopher reeve which only brings more of a joy to the superman legacy of fans. Well done in casting, Bryan Singer.<br /><br />In this movie you'll find Drama, comedy, romance, thrills, chills, and shocks beyond compare.<br /><br />What I really, really, loved about this movie is it's close relationship to the fans and it's Christianized aspect.<br /><br />Not only is superman back and better than ever but the fans are overjoyed by the positive response. The movie even leaves room for a possible sequel. Oh, just a quick note, in order to fully comprehend when and where in the series this movie takes place, you must put Superman II completely out of your head.<br /><br />And, for a movie that lasts 2 1/2 hours, you'd think that it would drag but the good news is that it doesn't.

In that era, the Internet still was confined to government agencies, cell phones were extremely bulky contraptions only for the `super' wealthy alone, and the Cold War still existed.<br /><br />This screenplay attempted a tremendous feat of going back in time to an era, essentially before the last two movies were even made.<br /><br />Unfortunately doing this made Clark Kent into a very inept `nerd'. Because he is now effectively established in pop culture as `good looking' in his own right, Singer really should not have tampered with `Clark Kent'----instead leaving him as Dean Cain and Tom Welling  effectively reconfigured this part of the legend in public consciousness.<br /><br />Since Brandon Routh is a pretty decent looking guy himself, better `Clark' character development easily could have highlighted his own sex appeal throughout this entire film ultimately without alienating audiences. Even the earlier Christopher Reeves and George Reeves interpretations wanted their audiences to come away liking `Clark' as much as 'Superman'; Clark isn't supposed to be the buffoon leaving viewers wondering how he even got the Daily Planet's attention. .<br /><br />Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) having a kid is admittedly off cannon, but I've seen deeper goofs on television. It's an interesting proposition though: can Clark now be a parent to the same kid that he briefly fathered while a non-kryptonian but then never met until just now? Because he gets presented as the 'good guy' this technical revelation of Superman/Clark Kent as 'the absentee father' is a novel plot twist!<br /><br />Less convincing is Lois's relationship with Perry White's nephew, I've never ever heard of him until now! Plus, the idea that she would just happen to fall in love with the boss's relative is too coincidental for my tastes. Not to mention Lois herself--who does not either look or act like the big city investigative reporter whom I attempted to emulate with some success in a college newsroom!<br /><br />Singer obviously took advantage of the advanced special effects capabilities and set designs since the 1980's, so having 'Clark' and other characters walk around in (what I presume is an attempt at) 'classic' wear just makes them look like they are obvious actors on an obvious movie set. I understand that both this screenplay's writer and director wanted to pay tribute to Christopher Reeve and his time in the title role, but they also needed to have decided what era they were setting this movie in, and then STICK WITH IT!<br /><br />There is a reason why Routh looks much better--not to mention more comfortable--decked out in the 'Superman' outfit as opposed to his 'Clark' clothes. If he himself appears so uncomfortable in the latter character, why should audiences ourselves be comfortable with that role--who ultimately is the real person while Superman is the powers according to this script?<br /><br />Sure, there are highlights in this film--Kevin Spacey plays a delicious 'Lex Luthor' and  archive footage of  Marlon Brando as 'Jor-El' reminds audiences of the additional reasons why the first 'Superman' movies WERE awesome blockbusters.  However, this particular screenplay itself is obviously a case of not having completely thought through how to implement a `great idea'. Thinking projects completely through is always essential to ensuring they are a `super' success.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>In a movie overpopulated with miscasts, Brandon Routh was a delight as Superman. Sadly, he wasn't given much to work with. The movie itself was anything but a delight, as it didn't pass my "must make sense" meter.<br /><br />I like to watch films that would be classified as fantasy (and this would) with people who don't intrinsically understand fantasy. What I mean is that if a little green man pops up behind a tree and does something magical, the person I'm watching the film with should understand what the little green man's purpose is at some point prior to the conclusion of the film. If they don't, then I think the movie or story failed to establish itself appropriately. One friend of mine, who is a scientist, reads the books that win Pulitzers, yet loved the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films. To me, his assessment of whether the filmmakers did what they needed to do to make fantasy reality is a good one. That said, I've disagreed with him more than once, and the word idiot has surfaced. When it did, that never went well with us. &lt;grin><br /><br />That said, I believe that fantasy needs to make sense. But, you say, it's fantasy! It doesn't need to make sense!<br /><br />Not so.<br /><br />More than any other genre, fantasy has to make sense, because it has more to prove. You question this? Think on Gollum.<br /><br />Here we have Lex Luthor, taking a crystal from the Fortress of Solitude and encasing it a hand-made cylinder of Kryptonite (what a guess!), and launching it into the ocean, using it to try to create a continent that somehow - magically perhaps? - creates a habitable continent that will not only destroy all of the United States with the exception of the western states (YIKES...is Bryan Singer really a friend of Ann Coulter?) but will have its own mapped states - for indeed, the continent as Lex showed it looked a bit like Australia, chopped up into "regions".<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />As to the miscasts, Lois Lane looked more like a porcelain doll, and her son - and I feel horrible for saying this - just couldn't be a product of his parents, regardless of what angle they're playing. Lex Luthor was a brainless wimp who resorted to stupid bully tactics when faced with a "kryptonited" Superman. For someone smart enough to encase a crystal in kryptonite, he certainly showed himself for a fool. His thugs - well, some of his thugs didn't even have muscles. One appeared in a movie that served as a White Castle commercial.<br /><br />My guess is that since Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor in the 70s, they wanted another good actor to play Lex Luthor. The problem with that line of thinking is that when they tried to pick a good actor in the 21st century, they settled on an average actor: Kevin Spacey.<br /><br />One who wasn't miscast, but also wasn't given much material: Parker Posey. She's always a delight in whatever she does. I just saw her in "For Your Consideration", and she took what she was given and did a terrific job with it. Here, she did the same. Again - she wasn't given much.<br /><br />Even though I felt this was a disaster of a film, I'd like to see another. Certainly not from the same production team or screenwriters, but there is something in Superman's "mythology" to mine: "The Death of Superman". In the early 1990s, Superman faced a foe capable of astonishing destruction, and that series of comics sold more for DC than any other. The sequence needs to be brought to the screen, and I believe Brandon Routh is the right Superman to play the part. With CGI where it is (again, think Gollum or anything from The Lord of the Rings that wasn't human), the timing is right.<br /><br />Let's see it.<br /><br />And let's have the studios give Brandon Routh another chance with better material. He did a terrific job with what he was given.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Okay, I so wanted to like this movie.  I really, really did.  But I just can't.<br /><br />The movie is way too long.  The action is way too missing, though the action scenes that actually happened were very good.<br /><br />I liked the special effects in the film.  I liked half of the cast, hated the other half.  I liked half of the script, hated the other half.<br /><br />Lex Luthor is going to create a continent that is going to so upset the environment of the earth that almost all of North America will be destroyed, yet he is sitting right there on the beginnings of the new land mass?  Please, what kind of shallow writing is this?<br /><br />And exactly how can Lex Luthor have been paroled less than five years into a double-life sentence?  A parole hearing in less than five years?  Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaassseeeeeeee!  It's called a script, find one!<br /><br />I expected so much more.  How about a Lex Luthor who surrounds himself with people who are a little interesting!  How about a plot that the audience care about?<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was given little to work with in this movie.  They even resorted to bald jokes from kids?  Good grief!<br /><br />Kate Bosworth (Lois Lane) tries to save this movie from her first appearance to her last, but there is just no way to pull this film from its watery grave.<br /><br />I realize a lot of people liked this movie, and I understand people are going to differ when it comes to commenting on an end production.  But I doubt there is anyone who truly believes that the script and the length of the film could not have been improved.  Be honest.<br /><br />I saw this movie in a FULL theater, and other than a few "something just jumped out at you" moments, I did not hear anyone laugh, clap, or even respond to a single scene in the movie.<br /><br />Sorry I didn't think much of this movie, but I really didn't.<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Okay, I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to movies. There is a lot of junk out there. More than ever before. Tired of the same ol' same ol. Tired of the excessive ratio of 5-to-1 horror movies shot by your neighbor on the video shelves. Tired of talentless people getting GOLDEN opportunities to star in films and less then average screenplays getting green lit.<br /><br />That being said... I'm not NEAR as jaded as some of these SUPERMAN geeks who are whining about the costume (ENOUGH ALREADY). They've read so many comic books so many times that they can't bare to see ANYTHING altered.<br /><br />That being said. SUPERMAN turns out being what going to the movies is all about. An adventure. Escapism. If you're going into this movie LOOKING for things to complain about, I feel sorry for you. ME, I found myself wrapped up in a film more than I've been in a long time. I felt the dread. I felt the emotional moments. I laughed and I cried (well... I didn't cry, but I welled up once... I'm a new Dad... give me a break).<br /><br />Superman has it all. Most importantly, Bryan Singer (the director), did what a lot of these superhero films are forgetting to do (i.e. see fantastic 4... er, don't), that is, get the audience EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.<br /><br />SUPERMAN's opening sequence sets the stage wonderfully. As his ship crash lands once again in the Kent family farm in Smallville, Kansas, you wonder briefly if we're looking back in time, rehashing, and then his earthbound mother finds him in the wreckage, cradles him and says, "Clark. My son."<br /><br />Many things have changed. Most noteably, Lois Lane is now married with son. Lex Luther is free from prison and SUPERMAN wastes no time realizing that the world was missing him.<br /><br />I won't give away things, because SUPERMAN has surprises. But, I will say that KEVIN SPACEY brings Lex Luther to life. He is phenominal, kooky, funny, insane and dangerous. You feel the dread. You feel the danger in the plan he is concocting. I mean... how to do you defeat the unbeatable man of steel? Well, the creators of this new version of SUPERMAN hooked me.<br /><br />I think, Kevin Spacey, in a lot of ways... made the film.<br /><br />The film is gifted with comedy, nostalgia, action, romance, dread, surprises and heroism, and despite what some are criticizing, this IS, WITHOUT QUESTION, one of, if not THE BEST Superhero movie to come along in a long time. Many of the tactics and techniques used in this film will set the standard for future hero films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this movie, but it's really hard to point out it's good points. Clocking in at 2hrs and 40 minutes, you might think this was 'The Godfather'! This movie has two serious flaws....it's not much fun and it's very boring at times. They don't even have the excuse of getting the origin out of the way. This is supposed to be a sequel....right? Why do Lois and Clark look younger now than they did 20 years ago in the first two movies? I know it is only 5 years time in movieland, but they look like they are ten years younger not 5 years older. Jimmy Olson still looks like a high school kid though.<br /><br />Brandon Routh had some big shoes to fill and the truth is, the kid does a pretty good job imatating Reeves....maybe too good, it only made me miss him all the more. Kate Bosworth's Lois is flat and without the quirky charm of Margot Kidder. There are several silly action scenes too....Superman gets blasted with a gigantic gun that could blow holes in a battleship and when there is no effect on him, the thug pulls out a hand gun and shoots him with that too!(OK the bullit in the eye was pretty cool!) The action scenes are very well done, but the scenes with Superman and Lois floating around are not romantic, but yawn inducing! I also found it ridiculous that Lois's body would stay perfectly and effortlessly straight horizonally while flying with Superman, just by having his arm loosely around her waist.<br /><br />I know this is a comic book movie, but if you are trying to make the characters realistic, then I'm going to question these types of things. Some good news is the new Superman costume is cool. With some serious editing this could have been a great film as there are some good ideas in this uneven comic film. In the end, it just isn't very fun and it lacks the heart that Christopher Reeves brought to the role!(Shouldn't all superhero movies be fun???).....and I thought 'Batman Begins' was too serious!...Hoo Boy! ;-( ......at least that film had a brain!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>I am not A Super Man fan, but I thought the movie was good, except Kevin Spacey who I can't stand due to his political stance.

I mean it's Brandon Routh!"<br /><br />The '06 release of `Superman Returns' is both a nostalgic tribute to the `70's `Superman' films starring the late Christopher Reeve with its incorporation of composer the John Williams original theme and a promising introduction to a new Superman series of adventures tailor made for the 21st century audience.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer masterful combination of both old and new elements of the Superman Mythos was a stroke of genius, creating for the "Old School" Superman fan a comforting sense of continuity with the earlier films. I openly admit to experiencing an increased heart rate and a childish sense of wonder and excitement the instant I heard that familiar John Williams' theme as part of the new musical score.<br /><br />Along with incredible special effects `Superman Returns' delivers a great new soundtrack and a strong script. Add to the mix a well chosen new superhero played by Brandon Routh and a top notch performance by Kevin Spacey as the villainous Lex Luther and we've got a new cult classic to enjoy over and over again. Now if I could only find that old cape of mine!</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>First on the cast: Love Kevin Spacey as Lex and Parker Posey as Kitty. Brandon Routh's physionomy bears uncanny resemblance to all other actors ever in the role of the Superman. Kate Bosworth BORING Lois Lane (but then again, Teri Hatcher is the only L. Lane who's not an annoying loser of a chick).<br />Special effects extremely obvious.<br />And now to the really disappointing bit - it is, beyond doubt, the script. Superboy portrayed as lovesick stalker (guess L. Lane is not married to the man she lives with to keep Superman's shmoozing with Lane politically correct?!). Cryptonite embedded in the crystal soil cripples him and brings him to brink of death on one occasion, but a lil later he pulls it out of the earth's core and launches it into space almost unaffected? L. Lane in Luthor's boat locked in the pantry with her son and they sit opposite each other on the floor? Huh??! What sort of a mother is that? But a lil later she dives into the ocean to save the Superguy (and leaves her husband in the plane, looking like a moron). She pulls a 105 kilo guy from the water like its nothing? Then she marches to Superman's hospital bed like the celebrity she is not (and she is NOT Superman's relative). Its so annoying! They could have done a better job at it. 4 stars only cuz I am a fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OMPSEVL59ZDK.html">A3OMPSEVL59ZDK</a><br/><p>What happens when you make a film in the year 2006 but make it as if it was the 1980's? Superman Returns is one giant homage to the original. From the opening theme you already know that Singer is in love with the original and wants nothing more then to recreate it for you in the guise of a "sequel".<br /><br /> Four years have passed since Superman left on a wild goose chase and it seems time must have stopped still because this film tries so hard to emulate the first two films that it never becomes its own film. Its one giant wink and if you aren't winking back then this isn't going to be a fun ride.<br /><br />Everyone is miscast and the film has even less action then the original film. By the time they put Superman in the emergency room...if your not laughing as they try to work on him...well then you are taking this movie far too seriously.<br /><br />Thats the main problem is that Bryan Singer took this film way too seriously. Where's the American flag? Where's the modo "truth justice and the american way?" Its no where to be found and yet Spiderman has no problem displaying some good ol' american pride.<br /><br />Perhaps the sequel can liven things up but they have a long way to go and it may take a huge shake up at Warner Brothers to make it happen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>Long on schmaltz and cliches, Superman Returns slogs on and on, at times seemingly trapped in virtual slow motion -- arcing this way and that, through plot holes and wooden acting.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Superman. I'll admit that. And I've never been much of a fan of Bryan Singer. I think he's a middling director, and a second-rate storyteller. Superman Returns did nothing to disabuse me of either notion. But I really wanted to like this movie. The trailers were intriguing. Stopping a bullet with your eye? How cool is that?  It suggested a spark of originality, of pushing the envelope. But when the movie starts sluggishly and gives us our first glimpse of the young Superman running and leaping a la the first Spiderman movie--so patent was the rip-off, it made me shake my head in disbelief--it becomes apparent that there's little hope.<br /><br />Brandon Routh brings a naive charm to the role of Superman. No great shakes, but he's the best of the bunch. Kevin Spacey? Wasted -- plus he doesn't bring the sick fun to the role that I expected. Granted, with those ridiculous lines, he started at a great disadvantage. Kate Bosworth is pretty enough, but most of her tears -- and there are too many -- seem eyedropped in.  James Marsden? Eh. Parker Posey? A low-rent Valerie Perrine. The kid? He looks like a young, anemic McCauley Culkin, and that about sums up his performance.<br /><br />And as this Mulligan Stew of a movie plods on and on, this way and that, we do get some impressive special effects. The flying is very realistic and thrilling. But for every impressive effect, there are bad ones, too.  In a number of scenes, Superman looks fake -- the helicopters look fake -- the buildings look fake. If this is what you get for effects in a $225 million film, someone ought to sue the special effects company for overbilling.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning, too, the overbearing analogies to the story of Jesus. Yeah, yeah. We know Jor-El sent his only begotten son, blah, blah, blah, but the scene in the hospital, when we see the bed empty ... too much.<br /><br />Watch box office plummet as word of this weary -- and stupefying  -- movie spreads.<br /><br />The trailer for Spider-man 3 was the best part of this film. Here's waiting for next May and an exciting super-hero film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Don't think this is a masterpiece of ecological, political or cultural thinking. Certainly not but it is a good entertainment, even if the editing could have been slightly more dynamic at times. They have dared ressuscitate him, like the simple comic strip character he used to be. They suddenly remembered that he would not be the first one. Sherlock Holmes was ressuscitated by Conan Doyle. Aliens were ressuscitated for a fourth episode. Even Harry Potter will be ressuscitated in a few years by Ms Rowling after she has has him killed in billions of various sufferings and ordeals. They also say that Jesus started in a way the literary trick for the second episode of the Bible, the New Testament, which became a real bestseller since then. What's more, they're even preparing the next episode by grooming the next generation. Yes, indeed, Superman had left a child, a son, behind him when he left last time he was around. And the son promises : he kills a gangster by knocking him down with a grand, a very grand piano. The bad man, Luthor, is back too, just out of prison, not the man in black like with Stephen King, but a man in white to cultivate differences in a way. And he even finishes his carrier the same way as in `The Stand', though in this case there is no savage he can start preaching and manipulating on this desert island. It is really funny at times, and very emotional when our Superman manages to save a whole family in one single flight. Of course you may wonder if the world really needs a saviour, a new Jesus. Even if you are a Christian Born Again you may have doubts about it, especially if you see the mess some of them Christians Born Again create as soon as they open their mouths. Note the only emergency number they do not dial in this film is 911. We understand why since they try to destroy the whole city in one single attack. That would have been a little bit too simple. A good summer film for this hot season when we can go around without any shirt nor any pants on, at times even without any shoes. Superman will keep you cool even if his human girlfriend had forgotten the heat of his body. You're not obliged to come too close.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is a really well crafted movie by a director who obviously loves the character.  The problem with this movie is that it is basically a reintroduction to the character of superman.  There hasn't been a new superman film in quite a while, and not a good superman film since part 2 over 20 years ago.  This film throws out part 3 and 4 and takes place 5 years after part 2.  Superman has returned from a long space journey to find the remains of his destroyed planet of Krypton.  When he returns he finds a lot of things differant, and earth has moved on without him.  The film then examines whether the world needs Superman.  You also have the return of Lex Luther who was released from jail on a technicality.  For new fans, this is a great movie that gives you superman's origin, a bunch of back story and adds a lot of modern sensibilities.  For comics fans, or even fans of the original movies, there isn't much new.  Wonderful upgrades in special effects make this much prettier than the first Superman movie, but another fight with Luther and Kryptonite didn't really excite me.  I would have loved to see him duke it out with the countless super powered villains he has faced in comics.  Still this is a nice return, and I hope they make more films so that they can explore the characters more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>I've read quite a few reviews of this film here at amazon.  Most of them are very valid (even with wildly diverse ratings).  I gave it 3 stars because I was entertained.  I noticed many of the story flaws and raised many of the same questions in my mind that many reviewers noted.  Usually planet sized story/plot holes bug the crap out of me.  But for some reason, I still enjoyed "Superman Returns".<br /><br />The one thing that really distracted me as the film went along, was the blatant, obvious rehashing of the story of Christ.  Why this was a point of interest of the film makers I don't know.  I could have done without it.  I'm not against the teachings of Christ (anti-Christ?), but does it really belong in a Superman film?<br /><br />I'm sure many (most) of the people who saw this film noticed the Christ parody. If you're not sure you've noticed them all, here's a list of stuff that I noticed that might help:<br /><br />-Supermans dad, (Jorell/God?) says (I paraphrase) "Humans are basically good so should be protected (saved)from evil(sin).  So I give them my Son."<br /><br />-Bitter Lois says the world does not need a savior (Superman).  Superman says he can here everything, the cries for help.  "Sounds to me like they need a Savior".<br /><br />-Superman on a couple of occasions says "I'm everywhere, I'll always be around".  May the Lord Superman be with you.<br /><br />-Superman gets Lois pregnant without actually doing the deed. (that whole "spin the world backward to reverse time" trick in Superman 2}.  A fairly immaculate conception.<br /><br />-Superman sacrifices himself to save the "good" humans for the "sinful bad" humans.  He died to save humans from human sin (a bit stretchy, but not too much)<br /><br />-Superman is reserected from the dead.  (happy Easter Superman!)<br /><br />-Superman flys to the outer reaches of Earths atmosphere and creates a cross by extending his arms out to the side and pointing his legs straight down.  (Not well disguised BTW).<br /><br />I'm probably missing something, but that's a pretty long list of coincidences.  As much as I enjoyed the movie with it's stupid story/plot holes, great special effect, fun acting and cameos, I really could have done without the Idea that our God(s) are actually Kryptonians and Superman is our savior.  That is enough to lose a star in my rating.  In a nutshell, this film, though not great, is entertaining.  There are some slow spots, and it ends with a fizzle.  And you will have to be someone who is not offended easily when it comes to religeous mockery.  If I were a highly religious person of any faith, I might be offended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I wanted so much to enjoy this new version but what happened to "Truth, Justice and the American Way?"  There is NO American Flag or American Way.  Those of us who were raised in the 50's will understand that Superman was an American hero.  It's not that way any more.  It seems like Warner Brothers went out of the way to make this Superman politically correct.  I can not recommend this film.  Everything that Superman should and did stand for is "No More."  I was very very disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3.html">A2E0EZ8DO5YSU3</a><br/><p>It beats me as to why someone would pour money into a big budget production and then cast a no-talent unknown as the lead.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Superman Returns shows us just how much we have all missed Superman and still need him.  Of course, comparisons to Christopher Reeve are inevitable as he made the role his own, but Routh makes it his own as well.  Although he looks and sounds just like Reeve, intended by the studio no doubt, he is a good actor who brings depth to the role.  Okay, now for the specifics on the film:<br /><br />Plot: Well-conceived improvement over similar ideas presented in Superman I and II (slicing off California to enhance property value at the fault line and monkeying around with the Fortress of Solitude).  I also think it was a terrific idea to have this film pick up after Superman II where Lois and Superman, while reduce to a normal guy, get together.  This allows us to forget the dreaded sequels that followed and breathes life into the franchise with perhaps a "superboy" down the road.  In addition, this element in the story reminds us how Superman takes the high moral ground.  In Superman II he selfishly gave up his powers to sleep with Lois Lane and after realizing this error he sacrifices a normal life for the lonely hero life as the world still needs him.  To invade Lois's and his son's life at this point would be morally wrong and as equally selfish as when he gave up his powers in Superman II for a chance at a regular life and he knows it and, therefore, decides to step back from Lois and his own son's life (although we see he obviously cares when he observes them without them knowing it).  That's one big sacrifice and NOT a shirking of his duties as one reviewer here suggested.<br /><br />Character Development/Acting: Much time is devoted to character development than in most superhero films of the past (excluding X-Men and Spider-Man), especially regarding James Marsden of X-Men fame who is now Lois Lane's husband to be.  He has to struggle with the memory and return of the Man of Steel, and trying to be the best man for Lois and hero to his own son (who is really Superman's son).  He is very believable in this role.  Frank Langella is perfect as newspaper head and Lois Lane is wonderfully played by Kate Bosworth even to the point where you wish she was the original Lois Lane.  I never cared for Margot Kidder much in that role so I'm a bit bias here.  Of course, a superhero film isn't complete without the villain and Lex Luther as played by Kevin Spacey is perfect casting.  We never really feared Gene Hackman's Lex as he was a bit too cartoonish even though he damn near stole the second movie right out from under Superman.  Kevin is funny where he needs to be and punishingly ruthless where he has to be.<br /><br />Last, but not least is Brandon Routh, AKA Superman.  He knows he has big shoes to fill not just in Reeve's command of the role before him, but also in that many learned to love Reeve during his tragic post-Superman life wherein he really proved he was Superman with the courage he faced everyday while being a paraplegic.  I am one of those who grew to love and appreciate Christopher Reeve and I cried at his passing as did my children.  Someone new taking over this role established so well by a beloved actor has it's challenges and just as many are leary of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, some may be just as suspicious of Routh's Superman.  No need to be.  He pulls off the role with great skill and respect.  You can see the sadness in his eyes when he learns that Lois has moved on without him, had a son, is about to get married, and no longer believes the world needs Superman.  He is perfect for the role in spite of the studio's wish to simply find someone to mimic the looks of Reeve.  Routh is an acting find for this role and I look forward to seeing him in other roles as well.<br /><br />Director:  Who best to work behind the camera on this than veteran action TV series and X-Men movie director Bryan Singer.  He continues to prove his metal, forgive the pun, while working on the Man of Steel.  The story is well-paced between action sequences that are truly breathtaking and the plot and character development sequences.  He did a bang up job with this film.<br /><br />Special Effects:  Well, what is a superhero movie without them?  Those in this film are mind-boggling, especially the plane sequence in the early part of the film.  In fact, that sequence is probably the best in the film, but that doesn't mean the rest are poor, just not as good.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is fun for the whole family except those really young ones who might get a bit upset over the punishing beating Superman gets when he temporarily loses his powers late in the film.  That beating is rather graphic, hence the PG-13 rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Superman tries too hard to overemphasise on a small storyline.Superman,being away, from his loved ones is gonna cause a world of an impact. The movie lacks good direction, is full of cheesy goof ups and tries to rake in a lot of thunderous applause for it's action scenes but fails in doing so. The last half an hour was quite boring and the first forty five mins made me wish I had downloaded this film and given it a watch. That way I would've only cursed my download and not the money I had spent on watching this film.<br /><br />Superman makes me realise how I didnt miss much by missing out on films like Batman Begins. I've heard they were similar. Well, I'm twenty two and I like films with superheroes(or I can stand to watch them) but Superman Returns is a failure, a miserable failure.<br /><br />Three other reasons for my disliking of the film, a) Not enough scenes with Kevin Spacey, b) the child and the mother, none of whom can act; c) just how overdramatic it's limited storyline seems to be.<br /><br />You can hate me for saying this but this movie sucks. It's possibly the worst of it's kind. I'd much rather give animation movies like Cars a shot.<br /><br />p.s - there is not one scene in this film that will make you go "WHOA" [*sigh* what a let down]</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>The long awaited return of one of the most popular and beloved superheros finally comes back full cirle.Superman after being gone for 5 years to visit his home planet comes back to the one world he knows that is always in chaos-earth.His affections towards Lois Lane have'nt ceased,but his departure has left her  bitter.She has since "moved on" and durring that time had a child,very possibly his own?Old flames never die and it isn't long before Superman and Lois Lane aren't involved,and not always on romantic terms.His nemis Lex Luther is at it again with the plan of world domination by means of realestate.Luther steals crystals from his home world found at his Artic fortress and Luther soon puts them to the only use he knows how,not only as a means of destroying continents,but also to kill Superman once and for all.Be ready for a great story telling,characters,excellent acting,action and spectacular special effects.Brian Singer hits another home run with another comic book adaption as only he could.Well worth seeing and owning,this was of the few 2006 summer blockbusters that lived up to its hype and will certailnly be joining my ever growing collection of great films.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I'm not a die-hard fan of the Superman franchise by any means, but I would definitely consider myself enough of a fan to care about the quality of a new Superman film and hope that it does justice to what Superman is all about. Unfortunately, "Superman Returns" falls short of this IMO. I've seen it 3 times and just can't help feeling that there was wasted potential with virtually every aspect of it, but of course, mainly with the story.<br /><br />I'll echo what many other reviewers have pointed out about the plot-it just feels hollow, contrived and disjointed. I could never get attached to any of the characters enough to really care about what happened to them. I don't blame the actors, I blame the script. There are some scenes that just flat-out bothered me, for example, the lack of true terror on behalf of the airplane passengers after Superman saves them and goes inside the plane to check on them. They just plummeted from the sky in an aircraft and they're only a little shaken up? Come on. Instead of looking like real-life people horrified at having narrowly escaped death, they look like a bunch of actors doing an awful job of pretending to be horrified at having narrowly escaped death, at the command of Bryan Singer. It's poorly executed scenes like this that cause the audience to become ambivalent to what's going on. And why couldn't Superman's son have played a bigger part or have more done with his character? Why was he even in this movie?<br /><br />In terms of performances, I actually think Brandon Routh does a fine job as Clark Kent/Superman. I had no issues with him in the title role, even if he's a little young. Nobody could have filled Christopher Reeve's shoes, so Routh shouldn't be expected to either. To me Kevin Spacey was merely adequate as Lex Luthor. The only issue I have is with Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. Sorry, just can't buy her in that role. I could easily picture Courtney Cox as Lois...she does have some resemblance to Margot Kidder, and would be a more appropriate age for that role.<br /><br />But on to the good points. The special effects are excellent, even if the CGI isn't realistic-looking in some scenes. The main action sequences are highly entertaining, certainly a lot more thrilling than the previous "Superman" films, using the modern-day technology. And just the overall look of the film is impressive. So yeah, I suppose I'm saying that this movie's strongest point is with its visuals.<br /><br />If this were just another summer blockbuster movie I'd probably give it a better review, but this is Superman we're talking about. It could have (and SHOULD have) been a superbly-made spectacle that pays homage to the originals. Instead, it's "just another action flick." So for that it gets a 3 from me. I got my money's worth, but failed to walk out of the theater with a revived admiration for the legacy of Superman.<br /><br />And for those of you who own the DVD, here's how to access the Easter Egg on the second disc. Go to Special Features, then go to Deleted Scenes. Put the cursor on "Features" at the bottom of the screen and press Down once. A red Superman logo will appear directly underneath "Features" and "Menu." Place the cursor on the logo and press Enter to see some outtakes of Kevin Spacey doing his "Wrong!" scene.</p></br><a href="../users/APRZ2IVM8JTLV.html">APRZ2IVM8JTLV</a><br/><p>SUPERMAN RETURNS(2006) Directed and Written by Bryan Singer.<br /><br /> Starring Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint, James Marsden, Parker Posey and Keven Spacey.<br /><br /> One cannot say that Singer did a terribly brilliant job and he brought very little to the table that was of any worth and more than a bit that was unnessarary but Superman is such a powerful character that all one has to do is not screw it up and you have a passable film. Singer did not screw it up so it is passable..but I hope he does not stay for the next film.<br /><br /> The film is well directed visually and in terms of pacing. The film's use of color is generally very poor. Superman's cape does not appear to be red nor do his boots. Even when the sun is shining, the film appears to be taking place at night. I thought most of the cast were underplaying something fierce and consequently very few registered. Routh is okay as Superman but is basically doing a Christopher Reeve impersonation but that is fine. One can live with him. It is hoped that the next film allows him to have more dialogue. It seems to me that everyone is babbling away around him while he does monosyllables. Spacey is a very slight improvement over Hackman PLAYING Lex Luther leaning more towards Lyle Talbot's take on the character but he still comes across as a mere evil real estate salesman. Everyone else is disposable with the odd exception of James Marsden as Lois Lane's unmarried spouse. One was more interested in his character emotionally than anyone else save Superman...which is probably a flaw rather than a good thing.<br /><br /> The film's problems are as follows. Singer does not seem to like Superman over much. He is constantly being told off or mocked by characters either indirectly or to his face. The costume is very dark and looks dirty. Everyone has already heard that the Truth, Justice and the American Way line is tossed off with contempt. Lois Lane is, if possible, even more unlikable than in her 30s/40s period and Bosworth's vapid empty performance does not help.. While Luthor is slightly more serious this time out, he is also unaccountably more stupid. He is constantly taking actions that, for a criminal genius, are moronic. He is going to create a new continent using kryptonian technology. Yet when asked how he will fend off other nations attempting to claim the land for their own, he says he will fight them off using that same tech--yet all we see him with are a couple of laptops and a few suitcases. WHAT offensive Kryptonian technology does he have? Apparently none. He is on a private yacht when the continent begins to form--which he promptly abandons for no good reason with a helicopter that it turns out does NOT have enough fuel to reach the mainland. How was Luthor going to return to shore? Why abandon the yacht rather than chug out of harm's way for awhile. We later learn that Luthor has no food supplies yet we see him and his gang happily sitting in a cave on the new continent. The new continent is a barren rock. There is no food. The Chopper does not have enough fuel. He has no offensive weaponry. Just WHAT was Luthor thinking of doing???<br /><br /> Another Luthor related problem that is a holdover from the original series is that the character here--rather than being a brilliant super scientist--is really more of a parasite unable to accomplish anything without stealing and/or making use of other people's creations. In the first film, it was US tech. The second Kryptonian. Here the same. Only in the fourth film did we ever see Luthor actually BE a brilliant Super scientist..and that film is unjustly derided.<br /><br /> Another odd problem is also conversely the film's strength. To wit: the film is practically a shot for shot remake of the first film. Luthor's plot is much the same as before only bigger and with more cgi. His moll goes through the same story arc as the Valerie Perrine character in the first film. We get much the same dialogue and situations only tweaked. Luthor traps Supes with kryptonite and tosses him in water to drown where he is saved by a woman. Only here it is Lois and not Miss Tessmacher. Luthor explains his plans in his abode only here it is to Lois and not to Supes. A Kryptonian space ship crashes lands on the Kent farm where Mrs Kent finds her son. Supes save Lois from a crashing aircraft and then lecturers on the safety of flying. An averted plane crash by the way is directly swiped from the animated film SUPERMAN: THE LAST SON OF KRYPTON. Marlon Brando is trotted out to speak the same dialogue as he did in the first film. A major earthquake hits a major port city. Superman puts a stop to things by lifting a large rock.<br /><br /> On the other hand, since much of the above worked in the first film, it is still exciting here..just very familiar. The question is why watch THIS film when one has the original???<br /><br /> What Singer brings to the proceedings besides his unoriginality and distaste for the character is a Jimmy Olsen who is coded as being gay without ever coming out and saying it. A silly subplot about how Luthor got out of jail that was overly complex, added nothing to the proceedings and was not required. Luthor could have just broken out of jail. An anti-marriage agenda that is understandable coming from Gay Agenda Singer but not required in a Superman film. The whole thing of having Superman return from what was basically a great big silly and irresponsible wild goose chase also seemed unnecessary. Just have another adventure of Superman! The bastard son of Superman plotline which can be nothing but a problem for future installments of the series and is only there so Singer can have sooner or later another of his "Dad. I am different and not like other men" Gay Agenda moments. Superman dies not ONCE but TWICE in the film to diminishing returns. The thundering and repeated(5 times) antismoking propaganda barrage is so blatant that the last scene of the film is where Lois decides to stop smoking. THAT is the main message of the film. Don't smoke. And there is a nasty dog joke(and the film is generally unpleasant to canines in every scene in which they appear) that was not appreciated by me and very alien to the material. This is a Superman film Singer not a Monty Python sketch.<br /><br /> The film is also decided claustrophobic. Where the earlier films felt as if they were part of the planet with American Presidents, the Arms race etc all being involved, this film feels cut off from all that. I don't even think there is a shot of the American flag anywhere.<br /><br /> Still the film is an entertaining installment that should hopefully jump-start the series again. It is not as good as the first two and the fourth but is better than the third. Which is about as much as can be expected. The film suffers from that somnabulic acting and generally dreariness that seems to inflict many modern hero franchises from the dead on arrival BATMAN BEGINS to the disaster CASINO ROYALE. It is not as fatal here but the film IS generally dark, unlovable, uninspiring and suffers from the blahs. One cannot imagine ever watching it again.<br /><br /> Still if they dump Singer, kill Superman Jr, use a villain other than Luthor, maybe we will start getting somewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>I really liked the earlier Superman movies. Routh does a fair job of channelling Christopher Reeve, at least visually. And I'll suspend disbelief long enough for three impossible things, just to get the movie going.<br /><br />My suspended disbelief collapsed under the weight that this movie loaded onto it, though. Like how Lex Luthor "just knew" that the seed crystal would incorporate other material into whatever grew from it - but not the skin cells left from handling it or the bugs in the water around it. Like why Lois Lane kept dragging her son into insanely dangerous situations.<br /><br />And why we're supposed to cheer for a guy who uses his super-powers to peek into bedroom windows of a former girlfriend and sneak in on her sleeping child. That left me feeling as if I had come into way too much contact with something that I really need to wash off. Yeah, it was all innocent, but ... {shudder}.<br /><br />This movie presents all the super-stuff in pretty much the ways you'd expect to see it, along with Bryan Singer's fascination with things jittering off desks and tables (how many times was that used? four? more?). Between the strange character studies and the unending stream of "where did that come from?" events, I really came away wishing I had spent my money on a different movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>thats right!i said it!sure the real estate scam thing on the old one was corny but its better than a long,drawn out plot that only really gets cool right at the end.if they couldnt come up with a cool plot than they shouldve re-christened tim burtons  throw away project where he fights doomsday.all im saying is it didnt really fit into any one catagory too well because it lacked in so many areas.i mean ,ffs,dont pay actual money to watch it.i liked it least of any super hero movies ever made including  elektra,tv movies and all the bat-mans.i mean unless youre in live with superman,just skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FTHCGH06O4Y5.html">A2FTHCGH06O4Y5</a><br/><p>The adventure is acceptable enough, but what's with the adultery theme?<br /><br />This outing sees Lois Lane virtually married to another man.  Nevertheless, the Man of Steel (whom I had thought above such things), uses his X-ray vision to spy on her, leer at her, hold her, take her for unsupervised romantic night flights, etc.  Would you still feel okay watching this if Lois were your wife?<br /><br />Yeah, something was not right about this.  This whole thing gave me an uncomfortable feeling because you got the idea that Superman was wrongly trying to reclaim fields he had forsaken.<br /><br />Another bummer was the script never really let Kevin Spacey take off like you know he could have.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Over the years, gosh since maybe around the time of the first Matrix movie, magazines have been abuzz with how Hollywood is trying to script a new Superman. Screenplays where rejected and revised more than you or I have had hot dinners. Nicolas Cage was touted to play the man in red underwear. Then everything went flat. Spiderman came out and ruled. So naturally we waited for Hollywood to pump out the one that started it all. Summer 2006, Superman is here, and starts with an introduction where we get the same title effects of the 70s version with some CGI planets thrown in. All is looking good until Kevin Spacey stands around for minutes on end, looking old & bald, and saying "Wait for it" while nothing much impressive happens. The Marlin Brando scenes we all heard about do not exist except for a brief 5 second screen image that is superimposed on a crystal... and that is it. Superman returns from his debacle across the cosmos because he heard his planet had been spotted. Lois Lane has a kid. Kent goes to work in the Daily Planet. There is a power cut and Superman saves a plane from crashing, the best special effect in the movie is 20 min into the film! Between the twiddling-of-your-fingers, Kevin Spacey saying "Wait", and Superman sulking about Lois having a kid, you want something to happen and it does... Superman flies with Lois around the world to violin music. At the point you know something has gone terribly wrong and you know the direction that Singer is taking you. You will not be wasting your time getting up and going to watch X3 instead in the other screen. Secretly I just wanted Superman to let Lois fall. Heck, anything to just keep us awake. After the violin-playing flying around, Lois meets Lex Luther and he tells her that is going to take over the world by creating a super sized country in the ocean. There is then a terrible plot twist involving children that will make you balk, scenes with a plane flying around and a shipwreck just to have Superman pull people out of a sinking vessel (what was that all about???) and then a Superman Lex fight sequence involving kryptonite that begs to ask why Superman didn't detect something sooner. And it is not as if the Superman Returns makers thought much out either... this is a thorough no-brainer with many "what" questions asked, between Spacey's "wait" from start to finish. Even fans of Superman I, II and III will be scratching their heads. Not since Ang Lee's The Hulk has there been such a mess of the Superhero franchise. Thank God for Sam Raimi and Spiderman. Even Batman Begins got the emotional balance right. Sadly Singer's Superman Returns is a terrible, terrible, terrible untidiness, a wasted Kevin Spacey and asks us to just eat up whatever is slapped onto the canvas. And 3 hours of it. Give me a break. I want Superman, not Supersulk! This isn't what we waited 20-30 years for! I feel like Kathy Bates in Mysery and want to stand up and shout at the screen! Very Sadly, instead of preventing the trainwreck, Superman just became one.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>I was hoping it would be good but it wasn't. Here's why. Parker Posey, Kate Bosworth are really bad actresses. Kevin Spacey as Lex was good but he wasn't in it enough. plot was slow. Effects were good but story was way too long. Brandon as Kent was good only look wise.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This only just merits 3 stars. It really is far too long, and loses a star for that. It loses another star for the frequent and painfully obvious use of CGI and if I was being unkind it would lose more for its over sentimental and sugary styling. How much music with heavenily choirs and strings are we expected to take?<br /><br />I wasn't especially impressed by Brandon Routh, who was clearly copying the Christopher Reeve formula but he was wooden by comparison. The best by far was Kevin Spacey, but he wasn't given a lot to do. The films I've seen that have been directed by Bryan Singer have in general been very good, for me this is his first failure.<br /><br />By all means buy it, if you can get it very cheap, but its not worth spending much on!</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>After a nearly two-decades-long absence, the Man of Steel returns to the big screen in this superb fifth installment in the Superman series. But this belated movie is actually more of a sequel to the first two Superman films, the second released a quarter century ago in 1981.<br /><br />Director Richard Donner, novelist Mario Puzo, and uncredited screenwriter Tom Manckiewicz (listed as "creative consultant" in credits) conceived the initial outing, Superman: The Movie (1978), as a legendary epic of almost Shakespearian dimensions, a saga pitting good versus evil. Unfortunately, their lofty vision was not shared by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Uncomfortable with a serious treatment of the Superman story, they brought in the husband/wife screenwriting team David and Leslie Newman to make the script more "campy," &agrave; la the 1960s "Batman" TV series.<br /><br />As a result of creative differences, and the Salkinds' refusal to pay Marlon Brando's steep royalties, Donner was replaced with director Richard Lester on the next installment, Superman II, and much of Donner's original footage was left on the proverbial cutting room floor. Fortunately, cinematic history has been kind to Richard Donner. On November 28, Warner Home Video finally releases his authorized version of Superman II, not only restoring scenes with Brando back into the film, but also restoring Donner to his rightful place as director.<br /><br />To understand the downward spiral of the Superman franchise, consider 1983's Superman III, written solely by the Newmans and directed by Lester. An appalling collection of poorly timed slapstick gags, it has earned the dubious distinction of being the only movie in which comedian Richard Pryor can't buy a laugh. Superman IV in 1987 was even more unwatchable, suffering from bargain-basement production values and a PC script that reduced Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's classic superhero to a "No Nukes," Bleeding-Heart of Steel.<br /><br />Now, years after lesser filmmakers left the Man of Steel in rust, director Bryan Singer finally restores the untarnished, larger-than-life superhero to his pedestal.<br /><br />Comparisons between Superman Returns and Superman: The Movie are inevitable, especially because Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris consciously planned this film to have the same look, feel, and sound of the original. The most obvious similarity is in casting relative newcomer Brandon Routh in the role of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent. Routh bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Christopher Reeve; indeed, he looks as though he could be Reeve's younger brother.<br /><br />Superman Returns builds upon the plot of the first Reeve movie, and part of the second. To explain Superman's absence from the screen during the past nineteen years, Singer brings him back to Earth after a five-year self-imposed exile, during which time he trekked among the stars searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton.<br /><br />The movie opens with an amazing special-effects sequence as Superman's spaceborne ship hurtles through the galaxies back to Earth, returning to his family farm outside Smallville, USA. Voiceover monologue from his father, Jor-El--taken from Marlon Brando's unused footage for Superman II--sets the tone for the drama that follows. "Because of their [Earthlings'] capacity for good, I send them you, my only son." Using Christ-like visual imagery, Superman is cast as Earth's savior, rescuing the planet time and again from those who wield the capacity for evil.<br /><br />After a brief reunion with earthly mother Martha Kent, played by Eva Marie Saint, Superman reclaims his alter ego, Clark Kent, and his job in Metropolis as reporter for the Daily Planet. Things haven't changed much at the paper, except that cell phones have replaced desk sets and typewriters have been retired in favor of personal computers. Otherwise, editor Perry White (Frank Langella) is just as gruff as ever. Shutterbug Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) is still the same earnest greenhorn, and the only reporter in the MSM, aside from Tucker Carlson, still sporting a tacky bow tie.<br /><br />But one important thing has changed. When Superman left on his intergalactic quest for his roots, former lover Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), the Planet's ace reporter, believed she'd been ditched. Feeling betrayed, Lois won a Pulitzer Prize for an article, "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman." "The world doesn't need a savior," she tells Clark, "and neither do I." He is devastated to learn that, on the rebound, she has given her heart to Richard White (James Marsden), the boss's nephew. What's worse, Lois and Richard now have a son, Jason.<br /><br />Meanwhile, having discovered Superman's secret hideaway, the Fortress of Solitude, arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) launches a diabolical scheme using crystals laced with Kryptonite--the radioactive remains of Superman's planet that render him powerless. Placed in the Atlantic Ocean, the crystals multiply, creating a huge, artificial island that displaces enough ocean water to threaten much of North America with flooding. It's an ecological disaster right out of Al Gore's most fanciful nightmares, one that will force millions to turn to Luthor if they want to stay dry. Cha-ching!<br /><br />Brandon Routh more than fills Chris Reeve's boots, and also those of George Reeves, the square-jawed actor who portrayed Superman in serial movies and on television during the 1950s. Like Reeve, Routh convincingly projects the superheroic qualities of Herculean strength and speed, as well as honor, chivalry, and courage. However, this loner-hero is cast in a more human, vulnerable light, though without ever mocking his dignity and heroic stature. This is a nobler Superman: all the annoying touches that in previous movies were meant to undermine the character are absent here.<br /><br />Every superhero needs a supervillain in order to bring out his best virtues, and the movie delivers by casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Although Gene Hackman is a great actor, he underplayed in the Luthor role a generation ago, almost to the point of nonchalance. Part of his failure to portray a true supervillain was due to his goofy wardrobe and even goofier sidekick (Ned Beatty). The sheer silliness undercut his credibility as a viable threat to Superman.<br /><br />By contrast, Spacey's Luthor is a plausible adversary for the Man of Steel. "Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their powers with anyone else," Luthor snarls. Spacey's characterization conveys that, for little men with big ambitions, envy of the good can be the most corrupting motive. When I first saw Spacey in American Beauty (1999), his smarminess as anti-hero Lester Burnham really rubbed me the wrong way. But after seeing him as Jack Lemmon's duplicitous boss in Glengarry Glen Ross and as the deliciously sociopathic Luthor here, I find him uniquely suited to playing cads and villains--not unlike George Sanders (Rebecca, All About Eve) a couple generations ago.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is somewhat less successful as Lois Lane. Undoubtedly a better actress than the previous Lois (Margot Kidder), Bosworth's waifish looks and spiral curls aren't what come to mind when you think of the spunky journalist from the DC comic books. A stronger, more alluring actress, such as Hilary Swank, would have been perfect to play the female lead in Superman's life.<br /><br />All in all, however, Superman Returns is a widescreen extravaganza with something for everyone.<br /><br />For the guys, it has street cred as an action flick, with its shoot-'em-up pyrotechnics and computer-generated images. These are truly spectacular, because they don't look so much like special effects as like natural camerawork. In fact, this film comes off as even more realistic than another visually impressive superhero flick, Spiderman II.<br /><br />For the women in the audience, the movie offers a heart-rending story of unrequited love, though hinting at the possible reconciliation of the (literally) star-crossed lovers in the next film in the franchise, planned for release in 2009.<br /><br />For fans of John Williams's soaring score in the 1978 film, there is composer John Ottman's skillful weaving of Williams's brassy fanfare into the new soundtrack, and conductor Damon Intrabartolo's lush interpretation.<br /><br />For older movie buffs, Superman Returns also boasts the first reunion (in dialogue, thanks to the sound editors) of the late Marlon Brando and actress Eva Marie Saint since they appeared as working-class lovers in Elia Kazan's 1954 classic, On the Waterfront.<br /><br />And for the kids, the picture provides not just grand entertainment but also some wonderful lessons. Its themes of gallantry, honor, and bravery will cause even many adults to revert to the child's uncorrupted and innocent point of view. In fact, when we saw this movie at an advance critics' screening--in midtown Manhattan, no less--that was exactly how that normally blas&eacute; audience reacted.<br /><br />If a bunch of aging, cynical critics can "Wow!" aloud at the implausible actions of their childhood hero, boo and jeer at the soulless villain, and rise to a raucous standing ovation at the end, then Superman Returns may just be the savior that Hollywood has needed during all the years that he's been gone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Superman Returns was a bit of a disappointment, considering the hype, though by no means is it a bad movie.<br /><br />After taking an unexpected and abrupt leave of absence, Superman returns to find out that things are not as he had left them...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is the familiar Superman setting, the special effects are very good, while the dialogues and the plot are just average.<br /><br />The major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) The mediocre plot and the average dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.

To make matters worse, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and uses its advanced technology to launch his most deadly scheme yet.<br /><br />Although the film runs too long, I confess I enjoyed every minute of it.  Obviously, 25 years of advances in special effects techniques allow for far more spectacular sequences than the Richard Donner films to which this is an affectionate sequel, and director Bryan Singer takes advantage of them to present some great Superman moments.  His reintroduction to the world by saving a plummeting airplane is a highlight.  Routh and Bosworth aren't able to match the chemistry of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but they do a good job and I'm looking forward to seeing them in the next Superman adventure.  Spacey presents Luthor's cruel streak more effectively than Gene Hackman did.</p></br><a href="../users/ARFCORBCTKX1J.html">ARFCORBCTKX1J</a><br/><p>"Superman Returns" is -- overall -- a terrific film. It has one of the most thrilling action sequences I've seen in a long time. It has a clean, spare script and Kevin Spacey's tightly wound, near-psychotic Lex Luthor. The story line not only connects logically with the first two films, but builds on the "Superman as Christ-figure" theme and brings it to a logical conclusion. Several scenes reference "2001: A Space Odyssey", a film with similar thematic elements. * Not to mention the outstanding cinematography and magnificent production design. And it has Bryan Singer's nearly perfect direction, reminding us that he also directed "The Usual Suspects", which the X films did not.<br /><br />So why haven't I given it five stars? Brandon Routh.<br /><br />George Reeves and Christopher Reeve truly inhabited the role. The brought to it an earnest intensity, acting as if they really believed they were this preposterous super-being. Note particularly the scene in the Donner version of "Superman II" where Reeve removes his glasses and stares at Lois, and he _is_ Superman, though in Clark Kent's clothes.<br /><br />Routh largely wanders through the film, an actor in a costume. We never believe he's Superman because _he_ never seems to believe it. When Luthor's goons beat him to a pulp, and Luthor pierces him with a kryptonite shiv, our reaction is more one of embarrassment than sympathy or pity. My attention was drawn to Superman's cape, which looks like a cheap vinyl shower curtain.<br /><br />This failing can be laid at Bryan Singer's feet, who cast and directed Routh. An actor playing Superman needs, more than anything else, "screen presence". Reeves and Reeve had it. Routh does not.<br /><br />Unless Routh dramatically improves, or someone finds a better actor, the future does not look bright for the Superman franchise.<br /><br />* After 28 years, I finally noticed that the three final notes of the opening section of John Williams' main theme (dah dah-da-da-dah, dum, dum, dum) are the Zarathustra "World Riddle" theme in reverse.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>I must say that Superman Returns is a very good DC comic book movie, but it's not as entertaining as X-men. The film is a bit slow-paced for the first hour, but once things start to explode, it's non-stop action and spectacular visuals. The characters are not well written and developed. I don't really care for Kate Bosworth's rendition of Lois Lane. I thought that good girl/bad girl Parker Posey deserved more material to work with. Kevin Spacey is effortlessly stole many scenes, but his character is not evil enough to hate him. As for new comer Brandon Routh, I think he's very handsome, got a great body, and his performance is good enough. Isn't he a bit too young looking to have a kid(ops, spoiler)? The film lacked a heavy duty showdown battle between Superman and Lex. Perhaps they are saving it for the sequel.</p></br></body></html>

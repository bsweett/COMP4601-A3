The first half of the film actually has plenty of funny moments. Farrell (for awhile) does a great parody of an over-the-top Southern type -- the racing fanatic. He is egotistical, monomaniacal and 100% USA Grade A lunkhead. His wife Lucy (Jane Lynch) is a blond bombshell who is completely turned on by Ricky's winning. Best friend Cal (John C. Reilly) is as loyal as an old dog, and loves letting his pal Ricky win every race.<br /><br />But an hour into it, the the movie drops its winning formula and gets serious. Ricky suffers a loss and Must Face Himself. Will he overcome his desire to please his neglectful Daddy? Blah, blah blah. Half 1 had a good dozen laughs. Half 2 -- cliche-ridden and formulaic -- had none.<br /><br />By the time the movie ended, we were all involved in other things -- thank goodness for wireless laptops. Even the appearance of Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat) as an effete French driver was not enough to jack up this flat film.<br /><br />Strangely, the DVD extras -- with deleted scenes and extensions -- had almost as many laughs as the main movie -- even counting the borefest in the second half.<br /><br />An endurance test that runs out of gas well short of the finish line.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell and crew are really firing on all cylinders here. Anchorman was funny in bursts and spurts, same for Old School, but this one keeps up the fevered comedic pace up to the checkered flag.<br /><br />It makes fun of the French, Jazz Music, and friends of Dorothy, but also makes fun of NASCAR, Rednecks, KFC, Taco Bell, and Applebee's, but in such a way that even the people or things being spoofed would enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Dennis Miller has not been funny for a long time, and I remember he tried to make a joke about the Dixie Chicks, and how their criticism of the War and W wouldn't go over with the NASCAR dads. But hey, Dennis your Agememnon references ruined Monday night football for those same NASCAR dads, and you will never go over with them.<br /><br />Will Ferrell will go over with them, even as he parodies them, they will love him, and he will slip some Steve Earle into the soundtrack, and it will sound redneck but will actually be very subversive. Will Ferrell will totally get away with all of it.<br /><br />I watched this movie at Christmas with my dad, and he loved it, and my nephew also received a copy of it for Christmas, and he liked it too. There is a very touching father/son back story, and it appeals to all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.<br /><br />I just realized that the French driver was played by the guy who made Borat. I hear he is funny in that movie, too.<br /><br />Let's all get thrown out of Applebee's!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>I've got this problem! See,I'm a nascar fan but I can't stand rednecks. I know that puts me in the minority class(literally)but lucky for me because of that fact I just knew I was gonna enjoy this one from the word go & I definitely did. How could I not? This is a goofy movie that simply exsaggerates the truly idiotic behaviour of (not all) but most rednecks from all corners of the nascar community. Fans,Drivers,teams,owners ect. There definitely were a few dry spots but all the laughs make you forget about any of that. What I absolutely loved about the film is that it purposely doesn't take itself at all serious. One thing I can't stand about most mainstream comedies these days(both movies & tv)is when they try to throw a moral or two into the mix of an immorally funny situation. With "Talladega Nights" though,every time you expect a lame & cliche moral with a soft & puffy texture to be thrown into the mix they do a 180 on you by throwing in a nonsensical ludicrous & sometimes down right offensive but hilarious joke or situation rolled up in a big ball of stupidity wich inturn tickles the funnybone of any viewer just looking for a careless laugh such as myself. This film is for everyone not just nascar fans. As a matter of fact it may play better to non nascar fans,but I will say that being a diehard race fan & being truly embarrassed by the pea brain fan base that follows one of my favorite sports 'The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'(for me personally) is just what the doctor ordered.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>As most every one of my friends is privy, I am a HUGE fan of Will Ferrell.  I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me.  That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell.  As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast.  The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are "if your not first, your last" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life.  Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.<br /><br />When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell).  With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.<br /><br />With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film  With one liners that will live as long as "you my boy Blue" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script.  I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time.  Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Director Adam McKay's "Talladega Nights" starts off rather badly but improves considerably as it goes along.  In this affectionate and comical tribute to all things NASCAR, Will Ferrell plays a premiere  racer who loses all his self-confidence when a hotshot driver from France (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) challenges his supremacy on the track.<br /><br />At first the humor is strictly strained slapstick, too tame to be genuinely satirical and too vulgar to be anything but lowbrow, but long about the halfway point,  the screenplay (co-written by Farrell and McKay) suddenly shifts into high gear, hitting the right combination of amiable quirkiness and sweet-natured sentiment, then cruises along to the finish line.<br /><br />More than anything else, the success of the film lies in its performances, which are uniformly endearing and high-spirited.  Beyond Ferrell and Boren, there's a great deal of fun to be had from the likes of John C. Reilly, Michael Clark Duncan, Molly Shannon, Gary Cole, and Leslie Bibb, among others, all of whom slide into their roles with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of comic talent.  They alone help to compensate for the excessive length of the film, its tendency towards attenuation, and the overall dearth of laughs in the early stages.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Talladega Nights  DVD<br /><br />Talladega Nights is a spoof of NASCAR and every thing even remotely associated with it.  If you like Will Ferrell spoofs you'll like this one.<br /><br />This movie may be blasphemous to diehard NASCAR fans but was a non stop joyride for me. The fun is all in watching these characters play into the roles of redneck racers. Although the movie pressed a slight message of teamwork the true fun came from watching Will Ferrell interact with Sacha Baron Cohen. I can see these actors coming together on many comedies in the near future. With all the sex driven and action packed lackluster movies out now it's good to have a few good comedies to stir the pot.<br /><br />Recommended for non-fans of NASCAR and fans of Will Ferrell<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I thought this movie was incredibly funny. Lot's of great laughs. Awesome cast! What an outstanding film!<br /><br />This movie would have turned out much nicer if it were on HD DVD...the Blu-ray picture on this tile is a bit flat and unexciting, and the sound is just so...well, it's flat too.<br /><br />The shots in this film were such that you could have been drawn in, and the audio could have felt far more compelling than it did.<br /><br />I so highly recommend "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby". Five-star film, but sadly only a two-star or three-star Blu-ray transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>First, comments on the movie:  5 stars for this laugh fest.<br />I saw this movie (with a good friend) when it was first released in theatres and we both laughed ourselves silly at the half-packed matinee showing at the movie house.  If you are a fan of NASCAR at all, and/or if your neck might be a shade of red, you'll get this movie and be laughing throughout.<br />A dinner blessing/prayer that includes thanking the various sponsors, and a windshield laden with a sponsor message show the extents to which Ricky Bobby will go to get a buck from a sponsor.  None of which is far from the truth of the current state of NASCAR.<br />Will Ferrell plays the son of race car driver Reese Bobby.  The elder Bobby abandon his son and his mother years before, basically leaving his son with but a memory of his father mumbling something along the lines of "if you ain't first, you're last."  Words that young Ricky remembered forever.<br />Talladega Nights skewers NASCAR, NASCAR drivers, the partnerships that the driving teams make, and everything surrounding NASCAR, and does a great job at all of the above.  It's funny from start to finish, without being too crude along the way.<br /><br />Now, on the quality of the high-def on the Blu-ray version of this movie: shame, shame, shame on Sony for such a disappointing outcome with this disc.  Blu-ray is better than this.  Far better than this.  The original movie (on theatre screens) was better than this.  The video quality here -- where it should have been immediately impressive -- just isn't.  It's not horrible, but just doesn't seem like it's high def.  Instead it seems like someone forgot to remove or apply the correct filters.  Perhaps they were laughing too hard at the movie and forgot to hit the right switch while it was being manufactured, but it is not up to the standards one should expect of the Blu-ray format.<br />Worse yet is that in the extras on the disc the video quality is often times better (far better) than that of the movie.  That is something that one would never expect of a high-def disc.<br />3 stars (at best) for the video quality here.  Actually that's probably being generous.<br />Hopefully Sony will make another attempt at getting the video of this movie right and perhaps release a special edition version, or deluxe version in the future.  As much as I hate paying twice for the same content, I'd probably have to get it as I do love the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I'm not always amused by Will Ferrell, but this movie was very funny.  Though I could do without Walker & Texas Ranger.  Other than their names, I found their foul mouths a turn off.  I really don't have to go far to find rude kids in real life, so I can do without them in my "entertainment".  Sacha Cohen was also funny and John C. Reilly is in everything, isn't he?  During the rehilbilating period, it was quite funny him thinking he was poor and had to deliver pizza for a living.  Overall, Talladega Nights was a strong script and most of the humor was dead-on funny.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>I wasn't sure how I was going to react to this film after seeing Ferrell's last release, "Anchorman".  In that film, the film went way over the top and I was disappointed with the final result.  This time around, they get it right!  This film is a rip-roaring laugh riot!  The real star of this film is Sacha Baron Cohen's hillarious rendition of F-1 driver turned NASCAR speed demon.  He makes this film worth the price of admission!  This is for NASCAR fans and Non-NASCAR fans alike!</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>It's not typical nowadays to see a movie that can remain somewhat appropriate and be a good comedy.  This movie may be blasphomous to diehard Nascar fans but was a non stop joyride for me.  The fun is all in watching these chracters play into the roles of redneck racers.  Although the movie pressed a slight message of teamwork the true fun came from watching Will Ferrell interact with Sacha Baron Cohen.  I can see these actors coming together on many comedies in the near future.

I got 5 really big laughs out of it, and they all involved the scenes I saw in the commercials. Cohen is pretty much wasted here, and the whole middle of the movie seemed like they ran out of ideas. Will is a funny guy, and has his moments here. But after seeing him be funnier in many other movies(not to mention the re-runs of SNL), I can't help wonder what would have happened had they spent a little more time on the script...and come up with more ideas worthy of all this talent.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>When you put this film in your DVD player, you know what you are in for. It's not directed by Spielberg, it's not written by Mamet, it's not distributed by Miramax . . . this is a fluffy film that was designed to be entertaining. Plain and simple. As a self-proclaimed film-snob (hey, it's my job!), I dislike the majority of mainstream tripe . . . but this I did not dislike; in fact, it was genuinely funny.<br /><br />People who have no exposure to NASCAR culture (I am forced to behold the massive influx of crazies to the Pocono 500 every year), may not understand why this film is so hysterical. Likewise, those who are obsessed with NASCAR may feel slighted (the film paints them as the simple-minded, uneducated, uncultured rednecks they most assuredly are). Anyone else will find enjoyment in this silly, excellently acted film.<br /><br />The jokes are non-stop and genuinely funny! The humor is blasphemous, grotesque, sometimes coarse . . . and all of that is hysterical!<br /><br />Many complain that this is not the Will Ferrell of Elf. Who cares?! An actor does not want to be typecast . . . especially as a "family-film" actor (YIKES!!). Let us not forget how he began his career . . . do you really think he desires to be a role-model for children? I think he is a bit more interesting than that.<br /><br />Like others have said, this film was not intended to "change the world" . . . it was meant to inject humor into our lives . . . and, in that, it certainly succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) was always wanted to go fast.  That suits him well as a NASCAR driver.  He is the #1 driver, with a little help from his best friend Cal Naughten Jr. (Reilly).  Everything is going well for Ricky, until Frenchman Jean Girard (Cohen) enters his life.  He is everything Ricky is not,  and his alternative lifestyle is at odds with everything Ricky believes in.  When a race goes bad, Ricky finds himself on the bottom looking up, and he must decide whether to try for a comeback or move on.<br /><br />"Talladega Nights" is your typical Will Ferrell movie.  Take that as you will.  Ferrell has just the right amount of goofball charm to make Ricky a likeable character.  The always excellent Reilly is great as Cal, and Cohen makes Girard hilarious.  There are lots of NASCAR in-jokes, and that will appeal to that section of the audience.  Overall, "Talladega Nights" is not a huge step forward for Ferrell, but it is a step in the right direction.  His star is getting bigger and bigger with each movie, and he is quickly becoming the new Jim Carrey.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8.html">A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8</a><br/><p>It's a good movie with humor in it and a valuable story, that actually can teach you something in life. I think it was fine to watch it, and I can not say it was very funny, when in fact some jokes were dumb. I just take the valuable lesson, which that movie taught me about.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>NASCAR stock car racing sensation Ricky Bobby is a national hero because of his "win at all costs" approach. He and his loyal racing partner, childhood friend Cal Naughton Jr., are a fearless duo -- "Shake" and "Bake" by their fans for their ability to finish so many races in the #1 and #2 positions, with Cal always in second place. When flamboyant French Formula One driver Jean Girard challenges "Shake" and "Bake" for the supremacy of NASCAR, Ricky Bobby must face his own demons and fight Girard for the right to be known as racing's top driver. The characters are extremely funny. John C. Reily and Will Farrell make a perfect red-neck match in this comedy. So, whether you are a will Farrell fan or not, if you just enjoy fun movies that will have you laughing out loud from start to finish, than you should definitely check this movie out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP.html">A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP</a><br/><p><span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:05 Mins<br /><br /></span>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4P9P8">Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3STFVPM8NHJ7B.html">A3STFVPM8NHJ7B</a><br/><p>I saw the movie in theaters and then I bought the unrated version. There is not much of a differnce; The only scene I saw as new was a sterotypical black man dropping a few f bombs to Ricky. Thats it? Im so sick of these unrated movies coming out. Mostly every comedy and horror film that is released today will get the "unrated" version with stuff that they couldnt show in theaters or so they claim. I really cant remember every buying an unrated version of a film and thinking it was better then the orignal version. As with the 40 Year Old Virgin, a comedy should not exceed more then an hour and forty five minutes. This movie is two hours and two minutes. A few funny scenes here and there but no comedy gold.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>There was one point where I laughed so hard watching movies like American Pie and whatnot but then at a certain point, either the films became less funny or my sense of humor grew. I'll admit when a film did make me laugh but most of the times the film had an inoffensive air around it so it made it seem funny even though there was nothing just laugh-out-loud hilarious. While problematic in parts, Talladega Nights is probably one of those films where there's bound to be something that at least makes you laugh hard once.<br /><br />Ricky Bobby grew up with an unconventional father who taught him that winning is the best thing ever. Ricky loves racing so he combines the two and wants to become the best racecar driver ever. With the help of his friend Cal, his wife Carly and a misfit team, Ricky does become quite successful until gay French rival Jean Girard shows up and not only humiliates him in a bar but actually is better. Things get out of hand in a huge car crash and Ricky has to regain his footing again and become the best driver at NASCAR.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, there's bound to be at least something that makes you laugh, if only because like most comedies, they fire everything they have in the hopes that at least something will be funny among the numerous jokes. Some are repeated way too often (to paraphrase Stewie's jackal rant, that whole "Shake and Bake" thing wasn't funny the first time, why the hell would it be funny the next 10 times) but then there's some winners like a discussions about crepes, France's flat version of a pancake or a prayer involving Baby Jesus, not Bearded Jesus or Teenage Jesus but an 8-pounder Jesus.<br /><br />Casting is pretty spot-on although John C. Reilly is actually the surprise in that he's actually pretty likable and funny even though he's quite the intellectually challenged shall we say. And Sacha Baron Cohen (of Borat and the irritating Da Ali G Show) is quite hilarious as the gay French rival. It's also got some pretty great car racing scenes and some pretty brutal looking crashes but the emphasis is on Ricky getting back into racing so it's not packed with speeding cars but then some stuff in a way doesn't work like Ricky's sons Walker and Texas Ranger (I'm not kidding) who are basically little devil kids who become nice and Ricky's uncaring dad. Kudos for having Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams play the women though (despite my actual thought that it was Brianna Lynn Brown and not Adams playing that role, strange).<br /><br />If you liked Anchorman, I'm sure you'll love this. For everyone else, this isn't going to kill ya if you watch it so why not give it a shot?</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film wants to be a Sattire of Southern culture in terms of the Nascar circuit. it's a goofy film with enough predictable lines&scenes that either will make you laugh a bit or just feel how dumb this film is. Will Ferrell is pretty much stuck in the same role from film to film now. Sacha Baron cohen who these days is happening in film, showcases his humor. this film has alot of cliches&alot of Product placement which after a while makes you forget about the film. there are some moments,but on a whole this film is just ok at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is great and I try to catch every single one of his movies. There are some really funny scenes in this movie. Most of the humor is site gags, but there are some decent jokes as well. Although I enjoyed the movie, it seemed like it was missing something. I prefer him in "Night at the Roxbury". It was an excellent story and very funny. I'm just not sure about buying "Taledega Nights". This seems a little strained at times during some of the sight gags. You certainly will chuckle, but it may not tickle your funny bone as deep as some of his other works. I recommend renting it first before buying it. It may be funnier to you NASCAR fans since you know the sport far better than I do.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>I just finished wathing Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (Unrated Widescreen Edition).  I wonder if I made a mistake going with this version instead of the thaetrical release after reading reviews about some scenes not making it to this version.  To begin, I am a Will Ferrell fan.  I also like Nascar and can appreciate some good ribbing at the fans of the sport.  This movie was an example the typical average comedy that comes around many times a year.  Nothing super funny, some lame jokes, a few decent sight gags, but watchable because of the actors.  In this case, Ferrell is always fun to watch.  He was rather uneven in this movie, which is a good way to describe the movie itself.  Sacha Baron Cohen was a scene stealer in this film.  Most scenes in which he appeared were funny.  John C. Reilly was a good counterpart to Ferrell, but I guess I missed Steve Carrill as a more gifted sidekick.  The movie is worth watching for what it is.  Mindless entertainment in the tradition of other average comedies.<br /><br />Three (generous) stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>If you just go into this one expected a dumb but fun picture you will have a good time.  While not as good as Anchorman, I found the Ferrell Reily team to be very funny.  Cohen is excellent in a new role as a gay French race car driver.  Not very long on plot and very few suprises keep this from being anything other than an over the top silly comedy.  This one is a good buy and good for repeated viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell co-wrote and stars as NASCAR racer Ricky Bobby in TALLADEGA NIGHTS, the second part of Ferrell's planned everyman comedy trilogy.  Driven by the absence of fatherly love and the last words his father said to him,"If you ain't first, you're last", Ricky Bobby is the #1 NASCAR driver in the country.  Racing alongside Ricky is his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) who always finishes #2.  Together they are "Shake N' Bake".  The owner of Bobby's racing team Mr. Dennit (Pat Hingle) dies and his son, Larry, Jr. (Greg Germann) takes over.  Larry Jr. has always disliked Ricky Bobby and decides to bring a French Formula One driver, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) into the NASCAR circuit as part of the Dennit racing team.  After a serious accident, Ricky is left emotionally scarred and unable to race.  His wife kicks Ricky out of the house, divorces him, and marries Cal. Jr.  A few traffic accidents later, Ricky finds himself as a bicycle pizza delivery guy desperately needing a kick in the pants and some inspiration which his long-lost father provides.<br /><br />TALLADEGA NIGHTS is full of humor, both crass and otherwise.  Much of the humor skewers NASCAR and racing fans.  Despite this, the movie is not vicious in its comedy and attitude towards the sport.  Instead, the film seems to carry with it a slight amount of affection towards racing.  Having been raised in a rural area around racing fans, I picked up on many of the over-the-top stereotypes right away, yet was not offended.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of great quotes and contains some brilliant comic acting.  John C. Reilly is one of the best actors in the business, but I would never have pictured him as the sidekick in a Will Ferrell comedy.  Reilly nails the role of Cal Naughton, Jr. and in doing so raised my esteem for him as an actor.  Also worthy of mention is Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard.  Until this film, I had never heard of Cohen, but I've been told that he is an up and coming comical actor to watch.  His performance in TALLADEGA NIGHTS is impressive and has made me want to watch some of his other work, e.g. Ali G.  Michael Clarke Duncan (who is made to look normal-sized through various camera techniques) is also a joy to watch in this film as Ricky's pit manager, Lucius Washington.  The movie also has a simple message that it attempts to deliver (something about not taking the important things in your life for granted), but make no mistake this is a comedy and most of that message is lost through the hilarious quotes and hysterical actions.<br /><br />TALLADEGA NIGHTS is one of the best Will Ferrell films to have been made in the last few years.  Actually, I enjoyed it even better than ANCHORMAN and other movies he has made and consider it my favorite Ferrell film.  It's a hilarious look at NASCAR that tries illustrates a need for speed in life isn't as important as taking time to slow down and enjoy the finer and simpler things in life, such as family.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is a genius of improvisation.  So are Sasha Baron Cohen (playing the French driver, best known as Borat - you like?) and Jane Lynch (playing Ricky Bobby's mom, who you've seen in "Best of Show" and other Christopher Guest movies).  I don't know if they even had a script for this movie, but it didn't matter; it's still very funny and has a more coherent plot than many things I've seen lately.  The deleted and extended scenes, and other extras, show a number of alternate takes for a number of scenes.  It appears that everyone just made up funny dialogue on the spot, and the scenes were assembled in the editing room based on what was funniest.  Poor Jenny McCarthy - she turns in a good performance, but you can see the fear in her eyes in some of the deleted scenes where she tries to get in the improv spirit and fails miserably.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers who say this movie is overly long.  To its credit, they know that we know that Ricky Bobby is a big Nascar star in this movie, so they don't belabor the early days of his rise to fame, and we race through the exposition pretty quickly.  But the remainder of the movie does have some fat that could have been trimmed.<br /><br />This movie is at least worth a rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Lately, the comedy genre has been extremely hit or miss, but if there's one comedic actor whose films are able to churn out consistant laughs without relyng too heavily on gross out and gags and whose jokes carry actual wit and substance and behind them, it's Will Ferrell.<br /><br />In the funnyman's latest comedic venture, "Talladega Nights", Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a Southern NASCAR champion who, along with his best friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly), perfectly embody the stereotypical Southern lifestyle. Southern rock loving, gun toting, fast food munching doofs. With several championships under his belt, plus a hot wife Carley (Leslie Bibb) and a loving family, Ricky has it all.<br /><br />However, Ricky's life is about to get rocky with the introduction of homosexual French racing champion Jean Girard (the incredibly talented Sacha Baron Cohen), who is intent on overthrowing Ricky Bobby as champion. Ricky is determined on keeping his title, but when an accident leads to Rikcy into a state of psychosomatic shock and parayisis. While recupertaing in the hospital, Cal runs off with his wife, which puts an end to their friendship. After a few more mishaps, Ricky decided to quit Nascar, so he takes his two kids and goes to live with his mother. While there, Ricky meets up with his long estranged father, who are still unable to reconnect after all these years.<br /><br />However, things start to take a turn for the better when Ricky's crewmember Susan (Amy Adams) urges Ricky to get back in the race, rekindling his spark (as well as causing him to fall head over heels for her).<br /><br />At this pint, the film becomes predictable (though the final showdown between Bobby and Girard is unexpected and hilarious), but that does not stop "Taladega Nights" from becoming one of the funniest moives in recent years. If you're in for a good laugh, check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I remember the big excitement when they did some of the filming in N. Carolina. People were scrambling for a glimpse of the cast and it was great fun. I also have to commend Reilly for his bravery when his character, Cal Naughton Jr., slips on the Speedo in the hot tub scene. You can tell the actors enjoyed making this comedy and I'm grateful for the laughs. Sacha Baron Cohen adds an extra dimension to the race track as a 'not afraid to show my gayness' driver who leaves skidmarks on Will Ferrell's backside. Though it spins a lot of stereotypes out of control and creates a few new ones, I don't believe race car fans were insulted (if they were they take themselves too seriously). This is wonderful hilarity and just in time for the New Year. You go Ricky Bobby!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Ricky Bobby (Will Ferrell) spends his life living by a motto his deadbeat dad (Gary Cole) once told his elementary school class. "If you're not #1, you're last". Working on a NASCAR pit crew with his lifelong buddy, Cal (John C. Reilly), Ricky Bobby takes the opportunity to drive the company car when the driver decides to take a bathroom and lunch break. Considering the team's car is dead last, Ricky Bobby attracts a lot of attention when he comes in third. Soon, he and Cal are driving on the same team, working together to ensure Ricky Bobby wins every race. Shortly after becoming #1, Ricky Bobby marries Carley (Leslie Bibb), buys an expensive home complete with a driveway filled with every imaginable SUV, and has two sons, Walker (Houston Tomlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell), but can he stay on top forever? Will his dad ever show up to see him race? Will he be able to outrace a French Formula One Driver (Sacha Baron Cohen)?<br /><br />"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby", the latest film from writer/ director Adam McKay and writer/ star Will Ferrell, the team behind "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy", is pretty much the same film with the same types of laughs and the same types of problems. Both films tell the story of a larger than life personality surrounded by a cast of eccentrics who live out a strange existence.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is a funny guy and in "Talladega" he returns to form. "Talledega" isn't a great film, far from it, but it shows off the comedic talents of the star far better than his previous few efforts, the disastrous "Bewitched" and "Melinda and Melinda". Ferrell is almost brilliant, in a way; he always comes so close to making us believe he is actually the character he is portraying. As Ricky Bobby, the North Carolina native who becomes a NASCAR champion, he brings earnestness to the role, making us feel for his character and believe he is the uneducated redneck he portrays. When he checks to make sure two tickets have been left at will call for his dad, a ticket vendor explains to his coworker Ricky Bobby always does this and his dad has yet to claim them. There are a couple of these low key, believable moments throughout which help to make his persona all the more real. At the same time, these moments provide a nice counterpoint to Ricky Bobby's outrageous behavior, making many moments funnier than they have a right to be.<br /><br />A lot of Ferrell's films seem to be improvised and "Talladega" follows this formula, adding to the charm of the film. This practice makes the characters seem more interesting because they speak in a more realistic way. Their conversations are filled with pauses, missteps, etc., much like a normal conversation.<br /><br />But "Talladega" also shares a similar problem with "Anchorman"; the humor is very hit and miss. Part of this is attributed to the improvised nature of the dialogue; the characters often revisit topics and themes they apparently feel are hilarious but only elicit a chuckle or two. A prime example is Ricky Bobby's mealtime prayers to the "Baby Jesus". The first time Ferrell does this rift, it is funny and elicits laughter, partially because of the strangeness, but I get the feeling the filmmakers were overcome with hilarity because he does a similar rift at least one more time later in the film.<br /><br />John C. Reilly plays Cal, Ricky Bobby's lifelong friend and sidekick. He has a few funny moments playing a dumb, uneducated hick, but he is ultimately the straight man in the film.<br /><br />Michael Clarke Duncan, Greg Germann, Pat Hingle and others pop up in supporting roles. Molly Shannon has a short, but memorable bit as Germann's boozing wife. But none of these characters is given the opportunity to make an impact. The story is about Ricky Bobby, so only those who are closest to this character receive any significant screen time.<br /><br />Gary Cole has some amusing bits as Ricky Bobby's deadbeat dad who shows up a couple of times in his life. On one occasion, he shows up at Ricky Bobby's elementary school, just in time for career day, surprising his son. Following the Waffle House manager, Mr. Bobby explains what his life is like and that the class shouldn't listen to the teacher. He becomes a hero to Ricky's classmates and then quickly leaves his son's life again. Later, he returns when Ricky Bobby is having a hard time and tries to help his son get back on track by helping him train. This is a funny sequence involving driving while blindfolded and staring down a cougar in the car.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen proves to be Ferrell's equal as Jean Girard, the French Formula One racer who comes to America for the opportunity to compete against Ricky Bobby. From the moment he arrives, speaking in an exaggerated accent, his mouth slowly forming the words in English, his performance is weird, interesting and slightly disarming. It takes a moment to get used to him.  realization struck. Many foreign actors use the same technique when they appear in their first American film, Gong Li in "Miami Vice" for example. If Cohen is making a comment on this, it is a brilliant idea. Basically, I think he is playing a French actor playing a French character in his first American film. It works. Very well. Then, when he shows up with Gregory (Andy Richter) and announces Richter is his husband, the role just becomes more weird, unusual and interesting. Unfortunately, most of this is probably lost on a significant portion of the audience.<br /><br />There were a lot of guys at the screening I attended, with their buddies, sitting with a seat between them, painting a perfect portrait of the intended audience for this film. Guys, NASCAR fans, the like. Yet, the film goes to great lengths to make fun of these same people. Many of these jokes are funny, but they are not as funny as the filmmakers think and they lose some of their impact. We get the point that Ricky Bobby is uneducated, so when he runs down the track after an accident praying to Jesus, `that Jewish guy', Tom Cruise and Oprah Winfrey, its funny. But later, when the family thinks fine dining is eating out at Applebee's, the joke is wearing thin. When Ricky Bobby reveals the name of his two kids, Walker and Texas Ranger, we laugh, but an ongoing joke where they show nothing but disrespect to their grandfather just doesn't work. We get the point that Ricky Bobby and all of his friends are rednecks, but by the fifth or sixth joke about this, we realize the filmmakers don't have a lot to add to these characters.<br /><br />There was a lot of laughter in the audience. Apparently, the guys in the audience weren't offended by the jokes. I'd be interested to see how the film plays in the South. I'm sure they're relating some of the moments to their buddies at work right now. Or maybe tonight, as they are smashing empty beer cans against their heads while watching football, they might spare a moment to tell them about that `awesome joke' they heard.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Everybody in my theater was cracking up throughout the entire movie. This is my favorite Will Ferrell movie by far. He really nails the part and doesn't abuse his comic gifts. John C. Reilly as his best bud, Gary Cole as his wacky father, and the french rival, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, are great as well. I really haven't had this much fun watching a comedy at the theater in a long time, there are just so many lines that are destined to become classic. I will be adding this one to my DVD collection for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I felt pretty stupid watching this movie because I just couldn't stop laughing. It's a racing comedy and the racing scenes are surprisingly well done and the cast works great together. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Ricky Bobby who just wants to go fast, so it's not surprising that he became a fast rising racing star. His father "Gary Cole in great comic form" appeared once in his childhood just to give him one piece of advice "if you're not first, you're last". So Ricky heald on to that piece of advice his entire life.<br /><br />  After a racing accident that leaves him afraid of driving fast, his father finally shows back into his life to try and get him back on his feet. He didn't only lose his racing career but his best buddy "the awesome John C. Reilly" stole his wife. Cole helps him out in the funniest ways. I mean one scene has him telling Ricky to drive away quick because he taped cocaine on the bottom of the car and called the cops. This movie is just great fun and it's hard not to laugh watching it when everyone in it is actually funny. Michael Clarke Duncan is even more lively than ever as Farrell's racing coach. While John C. Reilly and Gary Cole "especially Cole" are so good here in supporting roles that I wish comedy roles got nominated a lot more. Reilly can handle any type of role whether it's comedy or drama and he's a great partner for Farrell here. He was Ricky's bestfriend since childhood and loves him but is jealous that he  has to help Ricky win but Ricky never helps him win.<br /><br />  Even it's uncalled for  jokes are hard not to laugh at even if they are wrong. Sure Ricky's kids curse a lot and he taught them to tell off their grandfather and it may have been wrong to laugh but.... I laughed. I may also go to hell for laughing at how Ricky prefers praying to baby jesus but....I laughed. Stuff like that may make the movie sound overly offensive but it's not really. It's actually a smart movie with some charm and has a better script than most Adam Sandler comedies "maybe even all Adam Sandler comedies". I usually think the summer is dead once August hits but this movie really caught me by surprise. It's a ton of fun and one of Will Farrell's best movies. It's certainly way better than any of his comedies that he made last year.</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>Ignore the critics.  This is a film that delivers great comedy.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is excellent as Ricky Bobby, a man who, by a twist of fate, ends up becoming a NASCAR superstar.  The script Ferrell is given is perfect for him, allowing this comedic genius to work his on screen magic from beginning to end.  This is one of Ferrell's best movies.<br /><br />NASCAR fans will appreciate the detail and race excitement throughout this film.  The racing scenes are fantastic, vivid, and as real as it gets.  I've been to over 100 stock car racing event over the past thirty years, and I appreciated the realistic look to all of the racing scenes in this film.<br /><br />Gary Cole is perfect in his role.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Ricky Bobby's father.  His "hillbillyish" charm and ignorance was funny, interesting, and addictive throughout the film.  His character is not far off from hundreds of thousands of men who follow the same philosophy on life.  "If you ain't first, you're last!"<br /><br />Leslie Bibb is extremely convincing and hilarious in her role as Carley Bobby, Ricky Bobby's wife.<br /><br />In fact, almost every role in this movie is perfectly cast.<br /><br />Comedies are supposed to be funny, in case some critics have forgotten this fact, and Talladega Nights delivers plenty of laughs, along with a very interesting storyline, some great action, and a cast that is committed to making this film a success.<br /><br />I was not happy with some of the profanity or the gay humor throughout this film, but for the most part, it was a family friendly film that delivers plenty of laughs and lots of fun.<br /><br />I say this Talladega Nights is a DVD worth owning.  And if I say it, you can be sure it is a worthy purchase.<br /><br />So ignore the negative reviews and purchase this excellent comedy.  That way, you'll know what to do with your hands during an important interview.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I'm not a Will Ferrell fan.  In all fairness, the first 30-40minutes of this film were solid stretches of funny, though once a need to focus on a plot emerged, the humor became watered down in the development.  The general satire of the racing (and general sports) world and celebrity life were amusing, but for the most part, about halfway through the jokes started to become rehashed and any wit was lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is pure slapstick. Will Ferrell continues with his zany antics as usual but the performance that surprised me the most is Leslie Bibb who plays Ricky's over-zealous wife. Bibb is hilarious and shows range I didn't know she had since mostly she does t.v. work. John C. Reilly also flexes his comic timing and while the film has some embarrassing moments, Talladega Nighs did make me laugh. You will either love it or hate it, good luck!</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We liked JUNEBUG so much that we consulted IMDB to find out what Amy Adams was up to next, and the database spat out the name of TALLADEGA NIGHTS.  To our surprise, Frabk Hoyt Taylor, who memorably played the fiery, pathetic old "outsider artist" specializing in crudely drawn portraits of Civil War genitals, was said to feature in TALLADEGA also.  Well so there we were and for a few minutes we might almost have been watching JUNEBUG 2, for the first movie ends with a young couple reuniting after some disputes, driving down a long Southern highway in the moonlight, while TALLADEGA NIGHTS opens up with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch driving down a lonesome road, but after that the two pictures veer wildly, and to tell you the truth, Amy Adams was admirable in JUNEBUG, but lousy in this one, and as for crazy old Frank Hoyt Tayler, we never did spot him!  Even his own mother, if he had one, would be hard pressed to pick him out to the sea of hillbilly humanity that is THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.<br /><br />The love story, and that's stretching it, is supposed to be a little like the one in THE SURE THING, where our hero is so knocked out by the sensual appeal of his dream girl, that he doesn't notice that his plain little girl pal is really the one for him.  That's a hard part to play, the caterpillar who becomes a butterfly when she pulls her T-shirt up over her chest, and Amy Adams does it as if under protest, gritting her teeth and despising herself and her agents for allowing her to undergo what Meryl Streep never had to.  That said, the movie is hilarious and the other girl, Leslie Bibb, seems to glory in being dumb as a post, like the ex-wife in MY NAME IS EARL, she is having some serious fun.<br /><br />When Ricky Bobby has to choose between the two girls, and chooses the caterpillar over the sex bomb, the movie deflates a little, like a tire what picked up a rusty ole nail.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I found this movie to be way too long clocking in at 2 hours.  Maybe it was because we don't get that super crazy Will Ferrel we are used to.  In fact when he does go crazy it is not all that fun like when he thinks he is on fire.  BUT the director seems to take a different approach and puts in a little less comedy to put more into the story.  It really doesn't work but it makes for a good endign with the family getting back together and all.  Not being a fan of 'Anchor Man' I still have to say that 'Ricky Bobby' is not as good.  I am stuck between a 2 and a 3 because I come to a Will Ferrel to see some the insane thigns that he does but I am a sucker for a good ending to a movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>As most every one of my friends is privy, I am a HUGE fan of Will Ferrell. I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me. That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell. As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast. The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are "if your not first, your last" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life. Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.<br /><br />When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell). With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.<br /><br />With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film With one liners that will live as long as "you my boy Blue" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script. I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time. Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year!<br /><br />~I wanted to mention on the DVD itself, there are quite a few GREAT extras, like Will's commentary which is hysterical, a gag real which is worth its weight and a bunch of random scenes with random lines that didn't make it into the movie. I purchased the theatrical version since I hear the uncut version is worthless...so for that I can't say, but the DVD I have is priceless!~</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>Maybe the rated version is better than the unrated but this was not funny...no humor; may have laughed twice.

I expected a laugh or two for my money, Will Farrell's generally good for that, and was prepared to suffer through a lot to get them but this truly, deeply, achingly bad movie was one of the most egregious misfires to come down the pike since the Dumb & Dumber prequel. I'm not a comedy snob, I'll take laughs where I can get them, gags about bodily fluids, farts and amorous overweight old ladies not excluded, but this film oozed a stench that effectively covered anything resembling humor. This was one Blu-ray that went straight to the nearest Goodwill once I was done with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This ridiculous farce along the intelligence level of Steve Martin's "The Jerk" does have its few funny moments and catchy lines (If you don't finish first, you're last!).  Race car movies are usually very boring ("Days of Thunder") but though this movie may be annoying at times it is certainly not boring.  Ricky Bobby was the product of an uncaring father who left him as a baby and would periodically show up and embarrass him (ex. Career Day at Bobby's elementary school).  As Ricky becomes a famous NASCAR driver, he constantly leaves a pair of tickets for his father at all of his races, hoping for him to show up.  When his father finally does show up at one race, it is not exactly what the audience expects.<br /><br />The actor from Borat portrays another highly annoying character as Farrell's arch nemesis.  As with Borat, there are a few of his scenes that had me cringing in embarrassment.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Wow. I am sitting watching "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" and trying to decide if this is a movie made by people who like NASCAR or hate NASCAR. I can see evidence for both perspectives in this 2006 Will Ferrell comedy, but by the time we get to what I will describe as the non-handshake scene between Ferrell's Ricky Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's Jean Girard (I would have been worried about their futures by the former has "Stranger Than Fiction" and the later has "Borat" no-I-will-not-do-the-entire-title, so things are looking up for both). So seeing Dale Earnhardt Jr., Darrell Waltrip, and other drives in this movie was something of a surprise. I mean, this is a movie where the title character has to come back from a spectacular crash and where the big race in the finale has what I assume is one of the biggest car crashes in a big race finale of recent memory. Now, I know that car crashes are a part of racing and that people get killed doing them, but Dale Earnhardt Jr. being in a movie that has such fun with car crashes creeps me out a little bit. To be clear, I am not a NASCAR fan. I do not watch car races. But I have to wonder: If I think this film is rather insulting to NASCAR and its fans, then is it not reasonable to think that NASCAR fans would find it even more insulting? This movie made $148,213,377 at the U.S. box-office and there is no way of knowing but I wonder if most of that money can from NASCAR fans or non-NASCAR fans.<br /><br />My wife did not watch this movie, but she walked into the room while I was going through the special features and after watching 15 seconds she turned to me and said, "NASCA endorsed this?" To be clear, she was even more incredulous than I was. However, the special features make it clear that the approach with this movie was apparently not so much writing a script but letting the camera roll will characters tossed off lines. I assume they then went into the screen room and anything anybody actually laughed at they put into the movie (I liked the literary analysis by Walker and Texas Ranger of the Steinbeck story read to them by grandma, although I think Walker and Texas Ranger would be funnier names if the kids were twins). The story is that producers pitched this movie idea to the studios with the six words "Will Ferrell as a NASCAR driver," which must be how they sold it to NASCAR as well because you would hate to think that they read this script and signed off on it. Then again I can see how they could have shown the script to NASCAR and then threaten to make it even worse if NASCAR did not go along with it.<br /><br />This is not to say that "Talladega Nights" is without redeeming social value. There is the important lesson that when your daddy blows into town and stops guzzling bear long enough to lay down a stupid law like "You're either first or your last," you should not let that become your core belief let along your mantra. Of course the lesson would work a bit better if it came from somebody other than daddy in another one of his semi-sober moments, but there is an actual lesson in this movie and that must be acknowledged because it provides cover for some of the other nonsense. This is a movie that takes the stereotypes associated with this sport and the South and embraces them. I think it is making fun of them more so than celebrating them, but that is just my opinion and probably that was the whole point. I just cannot get over the fact that NASCAR signed off and let them do this at their racetracks. To reiterate my opening point: Wow.<br /><br />"Talladega Nights" also raises some interesting theological points, and not just on Ricky Bobby's willingness to call on not only baby Jesus but the Jewish God and Allah when he is trying not to burn to death, which would be an implicit plea for universal oneness and religious tolerance. Ricky Bobby likes to pray to baby Jesus instead of the risen Lord that you would think would be the Jesus people should be praying too. Ricky Bobby's position is not all that extreme given what the types of Jesus that his best friend and sons like to pray to, so he ends up being the voice of moderation here (scary thought). We are all aware that Catholics have the opportunity to pray to different saints who are associated with particular occupations, vocations and situations, so the thought that there is a continuum of Jesuses that you could pray to is rather provocative. Please realize I am talking about something like Jesus at the Wedding in Canaan or Jesus cleansing the Temple in Jerusalem and not the ninja Jesus suggested in this movie. Okay, clearly I am plumbing for depths in shallow waters at this point, but I had all these brain cells I was not using while watching this film and this was actually what went through my mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell's latest comedic effort, "Talladega Nights:  The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" calls to mind one of my favorite Mel Brooks quotes.  A person who had seen one of Mr. Brooks' early comedies accused him of making a "vulgar" film.  Mr. Brooks' response was something along the lines of, "Madame, my film rises below vulgarity."<br /><br />That kind of ridiculous-yet-sublime humor motivates the best of Will Ferrell's comic efforts, whether it be "More cowbell!" on Saturday Night Live or "Stay sexy, San Diego," in "Anchorman."  There is plenty of "stupid wit" on exhibition in "Talladega Nights," and it is executed nearly flawlessly.  This is an improvement over Ferrell's previous project with director Adam McKay, the occasionally-hilarious "Anchorman."<br /><br />The titular Ricky Bobby was born in an American muscle car going over 100 mph as dear old dad (Gary Cole) was having too good a time driving fast to bother to stop at the hospital.  Dad was the biggest formative influence on Ricky, showing up to Ricky's school stoned and saying, "If you're not first, you're last."  That becomes Ricky's guiding philosophy as he joins the NASCAR circuit, along with his friend Cal (John C. Reilly, in a performance that brings to mind Jeff Daniels' wonderful job in "Dumb and Dumber").  Together, they form "Shake n Bake," where Cal always helps Ricky win and together they put product placements on everything in sight . . . including saying grace.<br /><br />That's all I'll do as far as recapping the plot, but it is a comic plot full of rich, intelligent-stupid humor.  To say that NASCAR is ripe for the comic picking is an understatement, and Ferrell's team nails it without ever getting condescending.  Sure, there are plenty of jokes poked at NASCAR fans, but it's the same kind of humor you find in "My Name is Earl" on TV - these guys may be losers, but they have a certain dignity to them.  And speaking of "Earl," if you like Jaime Pressly in the role of Joy, you are going to love Leslie Bibb's performance as Carley Bobby, Ricky's NASCAR-flamboyant (and opportunistic) wife.<br /><br />Look for several laugh-out-loud moments in "TN," but surprisingly little profanity and no nudity.  I'm reviewing the "Unrated" edition, and other than a couple of f-bombs that apparently weren't in the theatrical version, there is nothing here that obviously warrants a "Do Not Let the Kiddies See This Version" alert.  Also, sit through the out-takes over the closing credits for some hilarious moments involving Ferrell, Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan, and others riffing unsuccessfully during various scenes.<br /><br />Here's to you, Ricky Bobby - you're surely #1 on the NASCAR charts.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Good old Will, he's a guy that can be funny, but also is entertaining.<br /><br />Movie moves along and has character...just like that Borat guy that<br /><br />steals part of the movie with his great character acting...but thats good<br /><br />it adds to the movie...</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>Listen the only thing you ever did Chip is make a hot daughter, Thats it !

Will Ferrell can execute some very funny moments in his films, especially in "Elf."  However, when he's given free reign in a film, as he was in this and also in "Anchorman," Ferrell seems to skip the part about trying to be funny and attempts to be all out silly.  This leaves the viewer wondering why much of the dialogue between his character and the rest in the film often makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />In "Talladega Nights," Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, an idiot who "wants to go fast" and lives by the code his deadbeat father gave him at career day in his school:  "If you're not first, you're last."  With this standard in tow, Ricky becomes the top racer in NASCAR, thanks to the help of his best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly).  In the wings, however, is one Jean Girard (Sasha Baron Cohen), a Formula One racer who is determined to take over NASCAR and eliminate Ricky Bobby.  Well, that's what seems to be Girard motive, but there is another reason he is in NASCAR that is revealed later in the film.  After a terrible accident, Ricky Bobby loses his will to win, his wife, and his home.  His friend, Cal, takes his wife, his home, and the NASCAR spotlight. Ricky and his two sons head for Ricky's hometown, where he moves back in with his mother.  While living with his mom, Ricky learns that he needs to quit trying to impress others and do things for himself.  His useless father also drifts into town and teaches him how to be a real racer.  It all boils down to Talladega, where Ricky Bobby faces his old best friend and his new French foe.<br /><br />The story is just plain silly.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it all feels forced upon the viewer.  It's as if Ferrell is saying, "It's me, Will Ferrell, laugh!"  I have nothing against Ferrell, but he just isn't funny in this flick.  It features ex-SNL buddies, David Koechner and  Molly Shannon.  Koechner never was funny on SNL in my opinion, and he does nothing to improve his status with me here.  Shannon has a minor role but makes the most of it and is one of the few bright spots in the film.  Gary Cole plays Ferrell's father and had he had better lines to work with, he would have done a better job.  John C. Reilly is good, but he is so much better in other films.  Sasha Baron Cohen is wasted here.  He's much funnier than this flick would imply.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed Ferrell in "Anchorman," you'll probably find this film to be hilarious.  I personally just don't care for it.  If you're a NASCAR fan, I'm sure you can enjoy the ribbings poked at you and your sport, but there must be something better out there.<br /><br />Mildly recommended to comedy fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has officially announced Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, which will be released on standard DVD and Blu-ray on the 12th of December.

As the crazed Frenchy speed demon, his effeminate stereotype crushes France and Ricky Bobby, the Will Ferrell - All-American NASCAR Driver alter ego with a sloppy kiss.  The rest of the film is dumb Southerners uttering stupid clich&eacute;'s in standard hate-redneck speech.  You think I'm kidding.  No, this film is one more blast at your average red state, Bush loving, and dumb gum chewing, big boob, blonde Southern folks. That is the way those Liberals in Hollywood at their cocktail parties lambaste the suckers that buy the tickets.<br /><br />One more note, the arcade game look of the races and crashes has gone beyond clay models.  Still, these special effects that look something like Madden Football, leaves me cold.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>The only thing unfunny about Will Ferrell on SNL was the sophomoric, loud and repetitious cheerleader skit.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing he's been bringing with him to the big screen.  In terms of the art of film comedy this one takes us back to pre-Chaplin, pre-Buster Keaton days--all the way back to Mack Sennett, who showed up on the Keystone set everyday without a clue and a bunch of guys in cop uniforms.  From that point on, the "writing" consisted of improvised slapstick called "riffing" (start with a single idea, premise, situation and go from there). At least, they didn't have the arrogance to credit "writers" in the screen credits.<br /><br />There are just enough hip allusions and racing send-ups in the movie to allow a mainstream NASCAR audience to view the film and think of themselves as being tolerant (even having a sense of humor about themselves!).  But don't kid yourself.  This is as lowbrow as it gets, guaranteed to appeal to a broad redneck mentality that simply enjoys seeing itself magnified in any fashion on the screen--proves they must be pretty important, after all.  Sold American!<br /><br />If you had doubts, what are the chances of a sophisticated, cultured adult Frenchman reading Camus' "The Stranger"?  (Even Dubya, we were told, read that book along with a couple of "Shakespeares" last summer!)  And guess what artists have a reputation for being gay.  Male ballet dancers?  Broadway actors?  Symphonic conductors?  Classical organists?  Not according to this film, which would have us believe that testosterone-driven jazz is the music with which to stereotype a gay Frenchman who obviously doesn't belong in the same bar as the film's dukes of Dixie.  So much for any pretenses at genuine satire, which depends on careful attention to details such as this.<br /><br />Then there's the physical stuff.  Guys kissing guys (isn't this getting a bit stale?), which comes off not as a countercultural slap at Southern homophobia but as a mockery of wimps like Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.  Or Farrell running around in his underwear in all his glorious mid-riff flab.  Problem is Chris Farley had more of it and used it more humorously if not gracefully.  Even the ending of the race is unclever, unimaginative, unmemorable and unfunny, given all of the visual possibilities with machines and humans racing one another to a finish line (I doubt the writers of this screenplay have ever seen a Chaplin or Keaton sequence employing the same device to always surprising, ingenious and creative effect).<br /><br />Just be thankful you didn't buy theater tickets for a family of four.  Even my son, who is a big racing and Ferrell fan, sat silent and stone-faced throughout.  With the exception of the rare "Little Miss Sunshine," today's screen comedies are making even Jerry Lewis' movies look good (a jab at the French adulation of J.L. which it didn't even occur to the writers of this movie to use).</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This is a very funny movie.  At points, its crudity goes beyond my taste, but I can live through them to enjoy the rest of the jokes.  Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby is certainly the point of the film, but his performance is only one of the thrill rides in this amusement park.  Let's start with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky's parents, Reese and Lucy Bobby.  They set the perfect tone for the film in the opening scene racing towards (and past) the hospital when she is just about to give birth to our hero.  Reese has some wonderful moments in the film, such as the career day appearance when Ricky is in grade school, or the family dinner at Applebee's that is going so well that it makes him uncomfortable.  Or what about the time that he finally goes to pick up the pair of tickets that Ricky has been leaving for him at every race for years (that the ticket sellers resell and pocket the cash)?<br /><br />When Ricky is down so low that he has to go live with his mom, Lucy is masterful with his ratbag kids and provides some of the great fun in the film.  She is a terrific character.  John C. Reilly is perfect as Ricky's best friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. and is the anchor that provides a foundation that allows Ferrell to soar as Ricky.  Cal is the one that came up with their "Shake and Bake" slogan and is willing to always come in second to Ricky's first.  Until he can't anymore.  His finding out that being on top isn't exactly what he was looking for in life is even a bit touching.<br /><br />Leslie Bibb provides the right amount of babeness and avaricious romance to the film as she claims Ricky and then Cal when Ricky can't get her what she wants anymore (and in neither case is it the man).  Carley is a tough role to get just right because we have to like her, maybe even attracted to her, and yet she has to be a bit creepy.<br /><br />Greg German and Molly Shannon as the team owners (the Denits) also get their roles just right.  Larry Denit is a hateful, and we gather impotent, owner who got the racing team from Daddy and resents everyone on the team who is able to do things he can't do except for the money he got from his pa.  Mrs. Dennit is fully aware of the ridiculous situation and takes her comfort from booze, from flirting with Denit's big ticket customers, and the vibrations of the track as the cars zoom by.<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard is most everyone's delight in the film.  And while it is a whacky character that helps Ricky Bobby to get even weirder, I thought the accent was so awkward and the emphasis on his being gay so over done that I found the role to be a net negative.  However, that is just me and I recognize that others think this guy is a comedy genius.  And I know that taking risks means at times doing things that don't work.  I am not saying the Girard role doesn't work, but I didn't find it wonderful.  Weird isn't wonderful or brilliant.  It is just weird.<br /><br />While Will Ferrell gets a lot of attention for running around in his underwear or less, for me the perfect moments in the film were his first interview with the ESPN guy, the scene at the bar with Susan (Amy Adams), and learning to drive again with his dad.  That and the knife in the leg scene at the hospital with Lucius (Michael Clark Duncan) and Cal.<br /><br />A pretty funny movie that people will laugh with for a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell and John  C. Reilly were perfectly cast here as best friends who grow up to be racers on the pro track.  Along the way, there is marriage, lots of money being spent, two rotten kids, a sensible grandma, a crash that leads to paralyzing fear, and the return of a prodigal father who somehow gives his grown son a push in the right direction so he can race once again.<br /><br />The story tends to drag on much longer than it needs to; this is unusual in a comedy.  But it is still funny and worth watching for a great cast and some very funny dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>As spunky Susan (Amy Adams) says, Ricky Bobby (Will Ferell) is not a thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver. One day, during a race, Bobby replaces famed NASCAR racer Terry Cheveaux (Adam McKay) and finishes the race at 3rd. Regardless of that, he caught the eye of Carly (Leslie Bibb), a smokin'-hot woman who flashes him. Both got married, and live in a beautiful home with two kids (Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell). Around this time, Bobby and childhood friend Cal (John C. Reilly) have perfected a technique called "Shake and Bake," where the former shakes and the latter bakes. This helps Bobby win races. That may come to an end, when he meets competition in the form of flamboyant formula-one racer Jean Girrard (Sasha Baron Cohen).<br /><br />Back in 2004, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay made a 90-minute SNL sketch, not on the sketch variety show, but on the silver screen. "Anchorman" was a hit with critics, but released at a bad time ("Spider-Man 2," anyone?). Well, the duo is back, moving from the news desk to the famous Talladega Superspeedway. This is "Talladega Nights."<br /><br />McKay and Ferrell (once again producing) have added some new twists to this comedy. Including keeping actors from hogging the camera for too long, "Talladega Nights" features plenty of NASCAR idiosyncrasies (including product placement from EA Sports to Power Ade), lots of redneck lampooning, and the idea of gay French men being part of a hard-boiled sport like this (once again, the artist formerly known as "Ali G" rocks the boat, this time with a hilarious French accent).<br /><br />Adam McKay also has a knack for directing good action scenes. But hey, you get famed cinematographer Oliver Wood ("The Bourne Identity" and "Face/Off"), anything's possible. Sure, some scenes look like they've been created with computers, but unlike "Dukes of Hazzard" and "Taxi," they don't wear out their welcome. And there's a rockin' good soundtrack featuring tunes from Audioslave, AC/DC, Saliva, and many more.<br /><br />Of course, the movie still has a lot of actors ad-libbing their way through scenes. This is Will Ferrell's comedy, and unlike in "Bewitched," McKay knows what works and what doesn't work. It's hit-and-miss, but Ferrell isn't as annoying. He even has good talent working with him, including some SNL alums (David Koechner, Rob Riggle, and Molly Shannon), award winners (Amy Adams and Michael Clarke Duncan), and Gary Cole and Jane Lynch as Ricky Bobby's parents. There are a good couple cameos from the real-life NASCAR drivers and announcers... but why waste Mos Def and Elvis Costello? I think they would've benefited from McKay's comedic direction. Oh well...<br /><br />I must say that after a couple of downers in 2005, it's great to see Will Ferrell back with his SNL writer-cum-director. And the actresses (including Leslie Bibb) are a joy even if they're not in the movie long enough (Molly Shannon, what the hell?). If you enjoyed "Anchorman," by all means check out "Talladega Nights." Let's hope it makes bank.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Will Ferrell is probably the most bankable comedian working in film right now. Anchorman was a huge success and it a pretty funny movie as well. Here we have a movie about a NASCAR driver and his journey to the top. The movie is funny and it has all the Ferrell antics we've come to expect. However, I really felt like Will Ferrell wasn't that funny in the movie. It was his costars that made the film enjoyable, and even then it wasn't as funny as his previous ones. John C. Reilly is an incredible comedic actor, and he displays that here in the movie. The show is stolen by Sacha Baron Cohen who plays eccentric French Formula "oohn" driver, Jean Gerrard. The man is one of the most talented comedians ever to grace the screen, and he truly makes the film what it is. Will Ferrell may have you rolling when he sticks a knife in his leg, but the show's one-liners come from Cohen.<br /><br />ACTING: As I stated earlier, Ferrell and Reilly are extremely funny and talented, but Sacha Baron Cohen steals the spotlight. I laughed the hardest at his character just because he did such a perfect job. People will recognize Cohen as Ali G and Borat, as well as King Julian from Madagascar. The man is extremely veristile and he can transform into anything. Would you have guessed he's from Great Britain?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A fun summer fare that will be one of those movies you pop in every now and then for a quick laugh. It's nowhere near as funny or clever as Anchorman, Zoolander, or the other comedies that the Stiller/Wilson/Ferrell team has offered.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Trying to review and rate a movie like this is tougher than most might think. There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY. Then there are those that'll snub it as another foolish not-ready-for-prime-time-style spoof designed to engage our dumbed-down society. But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.<br /><br />Hopefully there are those movie goers out there that enjoy watching parodies of various lifestyles, and this is where Talladega Nights gets most of -- if not all of -- its comedic punch. That we witness a southern Nascar driver with all of his conservative leanings hanging out for everyone to see was absolutely hysterical. Ricky Bobby's (Will Ferrell) big house, multiple gas guzzling cars (Hummers, etc.), a wife who's gauged on breast quality, and two kids named after a horrible action series ("These are my kids, Walker and Texas Ranger") are all over-exaggerations on conservative values; you wouldn't dare see one of them driving a hybrid car, for instance.<br /><br />The entrance of a homosexual Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat) adds an additional element in the American prejudice category, Ricky Bobby bashing Girard's foreign heritage while making a fool of Americans' naivete ("America gave the world Chinese food!")<br /><br />The challenge of Ricky Bobby to overcome his fear of driving after a horrendous crash is only minimalist humor added to the film. It is, at its core, a spoof on modern southern lifestyle and conservatism, and that is what makes the movie work.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>I'm a southern guy and I pretty much hate everything to do with NASCAR, which in this part of the country makes me a freak of nature!  So when I heard about this movie, I dismissed it.  Then I saw the trailer for the film and couldn't stop laughing. Only Will Ferrell could take one of the most boring sports in the world and turn it into a laugh riot!<br /><br />Ricky Bobby is the risk-taking star of the NASCAR circuit.  He has it all----his childhood friend, Cal, is also a driver; he has a beautiful (and white trash turned rich) wife; two sons (Walker and Texas Ranger) and a HUGE fortune.  Enter Jean Girard, a gay Frenchman who is determined to knock Ricky Bobby from the number one spot and, suddenly, the popular Nascar driver's life is changed.  During a traumatic crash while racing with Girard, Ricky loses his mojo and must find his way back to first place! The scene with him running in his underwear, convinced he is on fire and praying to Tom Cruise and Oprah is priceless! (I'm not giving anything away because you see this in the preview)  He loses everything that is important to him and must fight his way back to Talladega and reclaim his need for speed!<br /><br />Will Ferrell nails the role of Ricky Bobby and this is, by far, my favorite Ferrell film.  Sacha Baron Cohen nearly steals the show as the gay driver whose crush on Ricky is not so secret.  And from a short but great cameo role by SNL alum, Molly Shannon as a alcohol swilling sponsor's wife, to Andy Richter as Girard's dog training husband, the film sports a great cast and supporting cast that keep the laughs coming.  John C. Reilly, a terrific actor, is a gem in this movie!  One can only hope that we see him in more comedies in the coming years.  And Gary Cole is hilarious as Reese Bobby, Ricky's no good dad who show's up in Ricky's life about every ten years and has a hand in his return to the track---albeit by some unconventional methods!  There are tons of other star cameos, from actual NASCAR drivers to Elvis Costello and Mos Def!<br /><br />Take some good friends and just sit back and share some laughs!  And stay for the credits for some funny outtakes from the film.  I believe NASCAR fans and non-NASCAR fans will enjoy this comedy.  Some people may be put off by the gay kiss scene (hilarious and with more lip lockage than a scene from Brokeback Mountain) but they should get over it and just laugh along with the rest of us.  The one (and probably only) dvd I'll add to my collection with any relation to NASCAR!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This movie was as funny as it was billed. The preview barely shows you only any of comedy this movie delivers.  It is wall to wall laughs.  From birth, Ricky Bobby, the man with two first names, was made for speed.  With a father who fashioned himself as a fast race, Little Ricky could only say four words, "I wanna go fast!". Then he meets his buddy, Cal Naughton JR, and an "Shake n Bake" was born.  Then by chance, the two of them end up on a pit crew for NASCAR where the driver decides to quit. The need a pinch driver, and Enter Ricky Bobby...who becomes a legend.  This movie is his Ballad.  NASCAR fans, there are cameos from some of the big names in the sport.  The racing action is awsome.  This was almost ok for the kids to see, but still had some adult humor.  Talladega nights is another great showing for Will Farrell and crew.</p></br><a href="../users/AEMZRE6QYVQBS.html">AEMZRE6QYVQBS</a><br/><p>There's only a handful of words you hope never to catch yourself saying without a due period of reflection: 'I love you.' 'That dress makes you look fat.' 'Have you put on a few pounds?' 'Nobody will notice.'<br /><br />And then of course: 'This is the funniest movie I've ever seen.'<br /><br />I can hardly stop myself. I'm gonna' say those words about Will Ferrell's TALLADEGA NIGHTS. THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.<br /><br />I live in a town that titles itself 'the racing capital of the world'. In fact, I was out at the Brickyard yesterday to watch McLaren continue its resurgence via a Hamilton-Alonso one-two finish in the United States Grand Prix.<br /><br />There are three big races each year at Indy: The 500, Nascar's Allstate 400, and yesterday's F1 race. Each draws a completely different audience, each dismissive of the demographics of the race that came just before theirs and the one that comes after.<br /><br />That's the dynamic upon which Ferrell's Rick Bobby and Sacha Baron Cohen's irrepressible F1 convert to Nascar Jean Girard play. They rightly play to howls of laughter.<br /><br />Ferrell's and John Reilly's Cal Naughton, Jr. (even the name is perfect) hilariously draw out the bisyllables of Southern Fried culture. Even their motto - 'Shake and bake!' - is uproariously Southern.<br /><br />The movie's humor is a bit crude and may push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating of the in-theatre version.<br /><br />But it really doesn't get any funnier than this.<br /><br />I'm gonna say it!<br /><br />The funniest movie I've ever seen ...</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>I'm a huge NASCAR fan, so when I saw they were releasing this movie, I grabbed my other fellow NASCAR friends and headed to the theater. It was just what I needed to escape from my life (I'm going through a hard time right now) and despite my being depressed, Talladega Nights made me laugh just to spite myself. Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) has always wanted to go fast since he was a kid. Now as an adult, he and his best friend, together "Shake N' Bake," work the pit for one of the cars. But the driver is unmotivated and won't get back into the car after he has to use the bathroom, so Ricky Bobby offers to hop in and finish the race. Soon, he makes a name for himself and all of NASCAR knows Ricky Bobby as a champion. But soon, his perfect life begins to crumble away from his perfect wife, to his best friend, even to on the track with a French race car driver. I certainly don't want to spoil it, but for NASCAR fans, you'll be happy to see DW (my personal favorite NASCAR announcer) and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. among other familiar NASCAR faces. I venture to say that even people who aren't very interested in NASCAR would enjoy this, if they enjoy Ferrell's other movies. It's fun and not meant to be taken too seriously. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>You have seen the previews now for the last three or four month, and it finally has arrive in theaters. The long awaited Will Ferrell comedy Talladaga Night: The ballad of Ricky Bobby.  The biggest fear you have when you go to a movie that has been so Hyped up is that is will be horrible.  Well, this Movie actually follows through as promised, and it brought the bag of chips as well. Ricky Bobby, born in the back seat of his daddy's racing Chevelle, has speed in his blood. From day one, he had his goal in mind "I wanna go fast" .  He works his way to racing, and gets onto the pitcrew of a worthless driver.  When the driver takes off in the middle of the race, Ricky Bobby answered the call, and the rest is history.  With his best friend from school, Cal Naughton Jr., Ricky Bobby storms his way into NASCAR.  The ride to the top is fun, but what happens when your king of the mountain, someone want to knock you off. So who is the Arch enemy, Jean Girard, a formula one driver, comes over from France to take out Ricky Bobby.  Well, I don't want to unravel the rest of the movie, but Lets just say its a Roller Coaster of a Ride for Ricky Bobby, and an absolutely hilarious one at that. This movie will have you Crying with laughter.  This truly is a must see movie of the summer. An instant classic. Will Ferrell wrote a winner here.  And for Nascar fans, this movie in no way downplays the sport, it is an absolutely fantastic race movie. It's like days of thunder, with a ton of laughs. The race action is spectacular, amazing angles generated by computer through and around the racecar. Its not like special effects images of the past, truely awesome technology here.  So for a great comedy, as well as a sports enthusist movie, Talladaga nights is a true champion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>Some parts are ok, but the rest is a little sleepy. I bought this movie because Will Ferrell stars in it. I like him in his movies. But this one could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is popular as a comedian, but I've yet to find him in a movie that's particularly funny. This one was well-received, so I thought I'd check it out, especially since it has Sasha Baron Cohen in it, as well as John C Reilly, an actor I like very much. I'd say that of the three, John C Reilly is the funniest, with his good ole boy routine and his optimism that he can steal his best friend's hot wife and still remain buddies. Ha ha ha... Still, there are some good lines in the film like "[The French} invented democracy, existentialism and the beejay." Cohen, while not particularly funny here, does an interesting job portraying a "happy" Nascar driver. The gawks on commentators' faces when he introduces his husband are priceless. Sponsor's wife is lovin' the wall vibrations, that's pretty funny. Kenny Rogers scene is kind of funny. Nice use of a Monster Magnet song, "Space Lord", as well as AC/DC's "TNT", and Pat Benatar's "We Belong". Biggest car wreck ever. There's also a sort-of-funny "I want to picture Jesus as a..." running gag as well.<br /><br />The gag reel shows a great collection of Ricky and Cal's public service messages: kids on leashes, plastic - the silent killer, cardboard is edible, children reading too early, shopping cart safety, fare safety (kids wrapped in newspaper, sleep in a hammock, don't drink gasoline), shoplifting's fun, don't steal fireworks, packs of stray dogs that control most of the major cities of North America. Interviews with the actors in character are cute and sorta funny. The trailer shows scenes that are not in the actual movie (Ricky as a 10-year-old, for example).<br /><br />There's also a great French version of "Paint It Black" played in the film. Good soundtrack, so-so film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I think it's a fair bet to say that if you have enjoyed other Will Ferrell films, then you will also enjoy Talladega Nights. This has his same wacky sense of humour and hilarious delivery. This follows Rocky Bobby, who is a Nascar driver as he strives to drive faster and win races, gets challenged by an effeminate European driving sensation and loses everything and then finds what means most to him in his life. This has so many funny catchphrases in it that you can't help but laugh when they are repeated throughout the film (shake and bake) and Ferrell's delivery is what really makes this film. For example when he is driving with a Cougar in his car (!), it is so funny to watch him talk to it and roar back. His funny asides and commentary as things happen (like when he tells people to look away when he starts kissing a girl as `there's gonna be animal noises`) reminded me of Anchorman and raised just as many laughs. His two redneck, opinionated kids are hilarious as well and come out with some great lines. This isn't the best comedy I have ever seen, or even the best Ferrell film, but it does have some genuinely funny moments and easily passes a couple of hours in a light hearted and humorous way. It may not be as good as previous Ferrell films, but it is still worth a watch.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Like most of the other movies Will Ferrell is in that makes fun of various things (like the ones he did on ice-skating or being an anchorman), this is a funny twist and spoof on the chosen subject - in this instance NASCAR, the favorite sport of rednecks and white trash. His family dynamics are also entertaining to watch, like his kids cussing out Grandpa at the table, or his relationship with his best (and ex-best) friend. If you don't like Will Ferrell, you won't like this, but if you do like him and hate NASCAR, you will definitely enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Even people who have seen neither movie will discern that this DVD is a spoof of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000ILBL">Days of Thunder</a> (the fact that they allude to DOT in the film makes this fact all the more apparent!).  This is a racing story Will Ferrell style, and I like it!!<br /><br />To be sure, this is the funniest movie I've seen in awhile.  I thought it would be hilarious from the theatrical previews & I was not disappointed.  According to other reviewers, they actually deleted a few key scenes from the theatrical release.  I never saw the original, but it sounds like that was a poor decision.  Typically, "uncut" means they ADDED a few scenes, not deleted them!<br /><br />The film would have gotten a 5 Star rating from me except for the fact that, unlike most unrated Will Ferrell flicks, this one omitted the obligatory gratuitous nudity.  This fact is a particular shame in this film as Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams are both SMOKIN' hot - AND they had plenty of opportunities for some tittilating sequences if they wanted to put them in.  Hence, those expecting some topless girls to be thrown into the uncut version (as was the case with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKVQSE">Wedding Crashers - Uncorked (Unrated Full Screen Edition)</a> will be disappointed.  This is basically a PG-13 ditty with a few swear words added - that's it.<br /><br />While they didn't get the nudity part right, they did get the comedy part on the $$.  This is a movie that pokes fun at NASCAR as well as rednecks, which means that guys like me get a twofer!  I can't for the life of me see the appeal of watching cars going around in circles for 5hrs.  The makers of the movie tapped into the absurdity of the notion of marathon car races, as well as the silliness of having corporate sponsers tagged all over the race cars.  The sardonic wit of the movie's writers made this one quite cathartic for me!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Great collabo-Sacha Baron Cohen-Ferrell! You also have Reilly, Michael Clark Duncan, Andy Ricther! the movie is awesome.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>This was actually better than I'd expected. I'm not a NASCAR fan, but Will Farrell does on occasion make me laugh.<br /><br />And laugh I did. Ricky Bobby (Will Farrell) is a born race car driver who becomes a champion, until an accident leaves him psychologically unable to race again. John C. Reilly plays his sidekick, always coming in second, helping Ricky Bobby win. Will Farrell's over-the-top goofiness was toned town a bit--a small bit, which for me made the movie funnier, because I was laughing at the lines and situations rather than at Will Farrell.<br /><br />NASCAR is lavishly lampooned, but in such an extravagant and good-humored way that I doubt fans would be offended--the movie takes the stereotypes and runs with them. And there are a couple of subplots that keep the movie interesting--Ricky Bobby's kids are uncontrolled brats until his mother takes them in hand; he has to deal with betrayal and the consequences of his treatment of his best friend; there's love lost and found; and the commitment-phobic father who set him on the path to racing returns to put him back on track (heh. pun. sorry.) with hilarious training tactics.<br /><br />Jane Lynch and Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's parents have the best roles, I think--funny, but low-key. The kids were over-the-top both when they were obnoxious and when they were reformed, but that, oddly enough, kept them from getting on my nerves.<br /><br />We watched this with our sons, ages 12 & 16, and there were a couple of sexual references, but nothing that made me cringe. They were amused, and quoted lines from the movie for quite a while afterward.<br /><br />It wasn't a great movie, by any means, but it was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, and a good excuse to eat buttered popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>Another funny movie with the comedy of Will Ferrell. Ricky Bobby used to have it all, then a French racer, Jean beats him. His wife leaves him for his best friend. So, Ricky and his two sons have to go live at his mom's house. Ricky dad shows up after 25 years to train him to race again. Ricky and Jean have a rematch. If you love racing, comedy, and Will Ferrell, you'll love TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>Some of the funniest bits I've seen on film recently.

Ferrell plays the top racer title character, whose lifestyle of fame and fortune get curtailed by the arrival of French racer Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen) who seeks to out race our hero.  John C. Reilly is here and in fine form as well as Ricky's best bud Cal Naughton Jr., and there are enjoyable turns from Michael Clarke Duncan, Amy Adams, Greg Germann, Molly Shannon, and a wonderful turn from the great Gary Cole as Ricky's father.  While Talladega Nights isn't bad one bit, there are moments of occasional boredom.  Compared to Anchorman, and to a lesser extent the more recent Semi-Pro, Talladega Nights doesn't have the laugh out loud moments that one may expect to find here.  Still though, the good definitely outweighs the bad, and the moments of NASCAR lampooning are worth the price of admission alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>I thought this would either be a "oh laugh at the retarded race car drivers" movie, or worse a Larry the Cable Guy exercise in xenophobia and fart jokes, but it's surprisingly funny with Will Ferrell's Ricky Bobby going through all the ups and downs of the tragic hero (with the final up of the emerging superhero - we are America after all). And Sacha Baron Cohen was brilliant in not so much parodying the French but American attitudes toward the French.<br /><br />But sociopolitical subtext takes a backseat to the fact that everyone in this thing is just so weird and they play it straight enough that it comes out. You've got Gary Cole as the drunken father trying to motivate his son with a live cougar. You've got Sacha Baron Cohen proclaiming that the French invented democracy, existentialism and oral sex. Then later he's waxing poetic about training komodo dragons to perform Hamlet, and he does it so well. There's of course John C. Reilly who FINALLY got his own vehicle with Walk Hard and Will Ferrell holds it all together. Oh and the one race car technician reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689841582">Are You There God? It's Me Margaret</a> to Ricky Bobby while he's in a coma - Hilarious.<br /><br />I had pretty much written off all the absurdist comedies including Will Ferrell's after the Scary Movie franchises wouldn't get off my television. But thankfully I bought this one for cheap and gave it a chance. It's a fun movie. Plain and simple.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST.html">A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST</a><br/><p>With the final action, a match-race, which is seemingly a (drawn-out) parody of the ending to the classic early-1970s roller derby movie, Kansas City Bomber, Will Ferrell brings a funny romp through NASCAR to a frustrating checkered-flag.<br /><br />The plot surrounds Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) and his rags-to-riches-rags-to-riches saga on the NASCAR circuit. This is over-the-top farce on the roots of stock-car racing, the commercialization of the sport and fandom.<br /><br />But what plagues the script is many of the scenes are quick comedic bits that are wedged into spots, which stalls the story, instead of providing a needed boost. Ultimately, Talladega Nights - The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, is not on the superspeedway of comedic releases, but certainly holds its position on a short track.</p></br></body></html>

He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles."<br /><br />"The Dude" never had much use for his given name, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And for a man who lives to drink White Russians and bowl with his friends, who needs a big old name like that?  His real name is the source of much of his trouble in The Big Lebowski, however, as he is mistaken for a millionaire with the same name whose wife "owns money all over town".  Played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, long hair and oversized pajama bottoms and Bermuda shorts that look like he stole from a homeless man, the pot-smoking Dude passes through life with the constant abandonment of a lazy summer day...until goons seeking the other Lebowski assault him and urinate on the rug that "really tied the room together, man."<br /><br />The resulting action is a charming, meandering follow-up to The Coen Brothers' critically acclaimed Fargo.  Although the two have a few cast members in common and the Coens' trademark of finding art in shots of day-to-day life (a great montage of bowlers plays with the opening credits), the films have little in common.  Where Fargo was an unrelenting drama, full of suspense and mystery, The Big Lebowski is more of a good time.  Yeah, there's a plot in there about how Lebowski's search for retribution for his soiled rug thrusts him into a kidnapping caper with pornographers and nihilists, but the film is more about The Dude, the man for his time and place.</p></br><a href="../users/A243HY69GIAHFI.html">A243HY69GIAHFI</a><br/><p>To give away the plot to THE BIG LEBOWSKI would be criminal bordering on cruel.  Having said that, the plot is of almost secondary importance to one's enjoyment of this film.  What's most interesting is the way the story is told.  This is the movie your stoned roommate could've written, if only he knew a damn thing about dialogue, casting, and, oh yes, directing.  <p>The characters here are rich, complex, and finely balanced against one another.  Watching them work off each other is to invite yourself to see the movie countless times to catch every nuance of their performance.<p>This is no accident of good lighting, nor happenstance of the editing room.  It is the explicit design of the brothers Cohen, who must now surely be considered auteur.  Just as in FARGO and RAISING ARIZONA, they here continue to prove their ability to create not just a story but an environment.  Theirs is direction by immersion, not merely by camera angle.  <p>Anyone looking for lessons on how to write mesmerizing dialogue, how to create whole worlds without delving into the realm of fantasy or science fiction, would do well to start here.  <p>But then again so would anyone just wishing to have a great time at the movies.<p>[PARENTAL NOTES: Take the "not-for-sale to persons under 18" seriously.  The entire basis of the film is not likely to be one many parents will want their children to enjoy without supervision.  It's not that it glorifies a particular drug-based lifestyle, really. ?But many parents would want to discuss the film with their children just to reinforce the fact that this *is* a work of fiction.]<p>[DVD NOTES: There's not as much on this DVD as there should be, really.  But the 30-minute making-of featurette makes it well worth purchasing over the VHS edition.]</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>A friend of mine told me not so long ago: "My son watches 'The Big Lebowski' once a week". Well, I don't watch it that often but rather often. It's one of the films that can be watched over and over again and you'll never get bored with it. When I started my DVD collection another friend of mine asked me: "Do you already have 'The Big L.'?" I said no and he continued: "Well, if I were you it'd be the first movie I'd get". And I thought he's right - this is absolutely a flick for all times. If you don't have anything to watch on a sunday evening and there's nothing new in video-renting shop you can always take 'The Big Lebowski' from the shelf and have a guaranteed pleasant evening. By the way I bought it the next day.<br /><br />It's amazing how Coen brothers can combine comedy and criminal film. Their black humor is the best among all that exist in cinema. Every line, every word is a subject of laughter. For a long time you'll be recalling a rug, Vietnam and what happens when you do particular things to a stranger :)<br /><br />'The Big Lebowski' is a true masterpiece of the 90's, and it'll be a jewel in every collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>After the darkly surreal, snow swept landscapes of the Minnesota, depicted in Fargo, the Coen brothers wisely opted for a different locale and tone with bright, comedic vibe of The Big Lebowski. The film was just too odd for mainstream audiences and promptly tanked at the box office. However, it found new life on video and has since become a cult film favourite, inspiring countless websites and even an annual convention known as the Lebowski Fest that has been running for three years!<br /><br />The Coens are not known for providing many extras with the video releases of their films so it is a pleasant surprise to see a couple included with this fine disc.<br /><br />First off, there is a nice teaser trailer that is presented in its original theatrical format and features an excellent montage of the important characters from the film complete with the Kenny Rogers and the First Edition song, "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" that plays during the "Gutterballs" dream sequence.<br /><br />The disc also includes an entertaining 30 minute promotional video entitled, "The Making of The Big Lebowski." While not nearly as informative or exhaustive as the book of the same name that was released in conjunction with the film, this promo is worth watching if only to see Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and, in particular, the interview-shy Coens talk about their film.<br /><br />Lastly, there is the standard cast and filmmaker biographies/filmographies which features nothing that you couldn't get from a press kit or the official website. Pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />I daresay that The Big Lebowski is the Coen brothers' best film to date. It is the perfect mix of their flashy style, eccentric characters, and distinctive dialogue. It is a rare comedy that can be watched over and over and never get old. The richly detailed world that is so inviting and entertaining that you want to revisit it again and again. The Dude abides.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The Coen Brothers use bowling as their metaphor in this inimitable tale of mistaken identity, art, and a rug that really tied a room together.  Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar worthy performance) is Jeff Lebowski, a character who  goes by the name &quot;The Dude,&quot; has a penchant for white russians,  and seems to be perpetually mired in the '60s.  When the wife of another  Jeff Lebowski (the &quot;Big&quot; Lebowski, played by David Huddleston),  is purportedly kidnapped, the Dude and his friend Walter (John Goodman as a  singular-minded Vietnam vet with his own unique perspective on life and the  rules by which it must be played) bowl their way through the ensuing  turmoil, which includes a band of nihilists (lead by Peter Stormare), a  stranger (Sam Elliott) who assists in the telling of the tale, a man named  Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) who is a self-styled purveyor of adult  entertainment, a rival bowler named Jesus (an hilarious turn by John  Turturro), a moronic pair of rug soilers, a local beach community constable  long on attitude, a shady private eye, dreams subject to myriad  interpretations, an errant toe, and a marmot.  Rounding out the stellar  supporting cast are Steve Buscemi as Donnie, the third member of the Dude  and Walter's bowling team, Julianne Moore as the Big Lebowski's daughter,  and the ever versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman as his assistant.  &quot;The  Big Lebowski&quot; is stylishly crafted, wickedly funny, and will leave you  craving more of the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>"Why does everything have to be a travesty with you, Walter?" -- The Dude.<br /><br />I'm not going to write the usual things that you read in reviews about this film because there are a lot of reviews here that are incredibly repetitive and another one wouldn't serve anybody. Also, I live in Los Angeles, do work and have worked in the film business in different capacities over the years and I have very different things to say about this film ... so readers be warned.<br /><br />I saw this movie when it was released at the Hollywood Galaxy with a few friends and I'll be honest, the scope and impact of it didn't hit me right away. After I saw it, I didn't say "Sweet Jesus ... that's a masterpiece!" It was only when I saw it a few more times in the next handful of years did it dawn on me how good this film actually is.<br /><br />First, I want to tell you that the bowling alley where this was filmed, no longer exists. The Los Angeles Unified School District annexed the land, tore down the structure and erected a high school in its place. I used to bowl there regularly when it was still kicking though and I even have a memory of seeing the "We're going to be closed due to filming" sign that was slapped across the glass door just before they shot it. I also have a memory of the sign that said "We're closing our doors for good" sign when they put that up, too. Sadly, a lot of the fixtures, the exterior lights and different pieces of memorabilia were vultured and used as interior d&eacute;cor at the uber-silly Lucky Strike lanes located in the mega center of Hollywood and Highland. `Lucky Strike' is a place where no self-respecting bowler would step foot into, it's a place where they cheerfully play `The Eagles' on the jukebox and bourgeois fascists run amuck. It's a place full of fake tan wannabe trust-funders reciting `Killers' lyrics in a drunken haze as if it were poetry. I mourned the day the Hollywood Star Lanes closed and wept the day Lucky Strike opened with its stolen d&eacute;cor. If Walter Sobchak had anything to say, he'd do something about it.<br /><br />"If you will it, dude ... it is no dream." -- Walter.<br /><br />The next place is Johnnie's over on Wilshire and La Brea. Johnnie's was fully functional during the time that they shot there, just like Hollywood Lanes, but now it's a full-time film location and only opens for crews when they're shooting something. Some may sigh and feel bummed that they missed the opportunity to eat at the counter like Walter, all I can say is don't worry about it. I ate there several times and it was pretty bad. The waitresses were original d&eacute;cor too, the food was almost inedible and the coffee smelled like turpentine. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. If anyone tells you different about Johnnie's, don't bite - it's a sham. It's just one of those things that looked better on film than it ever was in real life. It's no mistake the Tom Waits never bothered to mention the place in song.<br /><br />"The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!" -- Walter.<br /><br />Next, I've been on a few film sets through years, and every time I hear the Director or the Producer utter the title of this film, I immediately freeze to hear what's coming next. One set in particular, the Director squealed out during an argument with a production person: "It's going to be just like The Big Lebowski!" I cringed when I heard that, as did several other people. Trying not to laugh was also painful. Nothing could be like The Big Lebowski. If anything could, we'd be surrounded by close facsimiles and we're not, which is why this film is such a classic now, from the first frame to the last. People will struggle to emulate this film in every way and probably all will fail. Even now, I've heard rumor that there is a screenplay and plans for another installment of The Dude and his troubles. The word `sequel' is not being used and thusly avoided. It's anybody's guess as to what's going to happen and when. You can hate me for mentioning this and say I'm full of it, but it is what it is, man. You know? Certain things have come to light, man.<br /><br />Lebowski Fest ... is what happens when people fall in love with something and go to extremes for the sake of carrying out a dream, so to speak. It's a worthy event and a lot of fun. I've been twice so far, when it was organized in Los Angeles and I had a blast. Jeff Bridges played on stage the first time and David Huddleston (The Big Lebowski himself) screamed `The Bums Will Always Lose' through the overhead PA at the Cal Bowl lanes in Lakewood, holding fast to a White Russian. Good times are sure to be had, and if you get a chance to go to Lebowski Fest, do so as it's one of the few great events that you can go to that you'll laugh from the first moment to the last minute. Lebowski fest is gearing up for their 7th Annual Fest in Kentucky where it all began.<br /><br />The disc could use more special features, it's been said. It would be good to hear more commentary and to see more footage and interviews, but maybe they'll put all that together for a 10th Anniversary edition this year, who knows. Anything's possible, man. If you will it ...<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is an amazing film that seems to be one of these flukes of filming like Casablanca. While people worked hard to make it happen, no one knew that it would become what is has while they were hard at it. I'm incredibly grateful to the Coen Brothers for this as it is solid entertainment through and through and shouldn't be missed. If you didn't get the first time, just catch it again, later.<br /><br />"Shomer Shabbos!" -- Walter.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi are perfectly cast in this classic comedy.  I couldn't stop laughing.  What tremendous acting performances and script.  I don't know how this one got by me when it was first released, but it goes down as one of the best comedies of all time.  All 5 stars.  I won't even go into the plot.  Watch it!  Enjoy it!

With Lebowski fests and often repeated phrases from the film, this has certainly entered the film goers psyche.<br /><br />After `The Dude's' rug gets urinated on after a case of mistaken identity he very rapidly gets drawn into a convoluted kidnapping mystery, when all he really wants is to get a replacement rug, drink White Russians and get back to his bowling league. Not too much to ask you would think. Yet he finds himself fending off threats from all sides and tries valiantly to keep his car from being totally wrecked in the process.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude and plays the part spot on. His long hair, slightly vacant look and stoner drawl fit the role to a tee. John Goodman is also good as The Dudes angry Vietnam vet friend Walter and the rest of the cast turn out great performances as well. The direction is very good and the more weird dreamy scenes are especially fun to watch.<br /><br />All in all this is a low key film that has risen to the top of the barrel over the years and it will keep you interested and will raise a laugh or two as you go along. There is a certain appeal to The Dude's laid back lifestyle and his charm really makes this film. Sit back and enjoy this minor cult classic.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>This brilliantly cynical losers saga is absolutely hilarious! With 600+ reviews written already, I won't waste any time going over the absurd plot,  ingenious characters or plentiful cameos. I just wanted to add my 2 cents, and my 5 stars, to this riotous 'high-brow' comedy from the Coens.<br /><br />The 10th anniversary edition has a good selection of extras, including making of features and the like. Also comes with Dolby 5.1, so you can really get lost in those dream sequences. Yeah! Yeah! YEAAAAAAH!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Like a lot of the Coen Brother's recent stuff, its whole is less than the sum of its parts, concerning itself with style rather than plot, and with witty, smirking dialog substituting for a storyline.  What keeps the movie going throughout a largely rudderless middle and ending is great dialog and acting.  When you have the Coen brothers writing and three of the best character actors in the business (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro), you can't go too far wrong.  And the point of the movie -- life is too short to get stressed out -- is well-taken.<br /><br />Also, this movie is much better on multiple viewings.  If you saw it once and thought "eh - o.k. I guess" then I recommend watching it again.  It will improve the second time.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is a great and very funny film. A case of mistaken identity leads Jeff Bridges 'Dude' into all sorts of problems. The Dude is extremely laid back (stoned a lot) - the Coens wrote the part for Jeff Bridges.<br /><br />A number scenes standout, but the Bowling Alley ones are particular favourites of mine. The cast are fantastic, and for me John Goodman as Vietnam Vet Walter just steals the acting honours. Walter is obsessed with Vietnam, to the point where he introduces Vietnam into any conversation regardless of whats being talked about. One of the very last scenes is an extremly funny example of this.<br /><br />I've lent the film to a lot of people and there is a split with this film between those that love it and those that really don't get it. So if you're unsure catch it on TV or rent it. If you like it you will have to buy it and watch it again very quickly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Jeff Bridges is Jeff Lebowski, Alias "The Dude".  An unemployed, pot-smoking loser, he's the laziest person in LA - which qualifies him as one of the laziest men on Earth.  Released in the late `90's, but occurring around "Desert Storm", "The Big Lebowski" tells of The Dude's misadventures after being sucked into what appears to be a kidnapping involving his wife.  (During pot-smoking binges, little bits of The Dude's existence boil out - incl. his credit in some past Hollywood movies which doubtlessly provide for his meager and undemanding existence.)  Only, The Dude's never been married - the kidnap really involves the wife of another Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire who is everything the Dude is not.  While The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) rules from a palatial estate, The Dude's existence boils down to weed, "White Russians" and bowling with Donnie (understated Steve Buscemi) and Walter (Coen Bros. fave John Goodman).  When his rich doppelganger's complications spill over on The Dude (literally, on one of the Dude's favorite rugs), The Dude decides to take the fight over to the big man himself - necessarily getting himself sucked into Big Lebowski's machinations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the best laid plans of mice, men and two Lebowskis are steamrolled by Walter - a one-man weapon of mass destruction.  Early on we see how far Walter will go to protect his ideals on bowling, and he soon buts his way into the schemes of the two Lebowskis to the frustration of everybody.  The Coen brothers's script tosses in a squad of nihilists (including indie rocker Aimee Mann), a master pornographer (Ben Gazzara), theft of the Dude's car, various hallucinations involving bowling, Big Lebowski's affected performance-artist of a Daughter (Julianne Moore) and a mysterious stranger played by Sam Elliot.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss this flick as a Coen Bros. version of "The Big Sleep" - the parallels are there in terms of plot and spirit.  (I prefer to view it an unofficial Coen Bros. sequel to "Tron", in which the ordered existence of cyberspace of the first movie has been eroded as mankind has begun to stumble into it via the worldwide web.  When you compare the people involved in programming in '82 to those involved in cyberspace by Netscape's IPO, it's not a difficult image.)  While others have easily written this off as a comedy of mistaken identity, it's more accurate to praise this flick as a shining example of the mistake-of-identity - nobody is what they seem by the end of the flick: despite his pot smoking, The Dude will experience moments of lucidity; Walter will adhere to Orthodox Judaism even though he's Polish Catholic, and by the end of the flick will give a eulogy for a character that has nothing to do with that character; Donnie will wear numerous personalized shirts - none of which actually bear his name; a flamboyant bowler named "Jesus" will be revealed to be a sex-offender; neither Lebowski nor his "wife" are what they seem; the nihilists aren't all that nihilistic.<br /><br />At the heart of the movie is a conflict between the Chandler-style plot (which begins to unravel) and the movie's will to be another fun, if preposterous Coen Brothers movie in the vein of "Oh Brother" and "Raising Arizona".  At some point, the Coens win out over Chandler, but that leaves the winners with a hollow shell of a movie - which retroactively becomes as rootless and inconsequential as The Dude himself.  In short, it's a fun flick that you shouldn't be ready to look into as deeply as I have.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The film focuses on a man named Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski ( Jeff Bridges). The Dude is a man that spends his days smoking weed and bowling. The story kicks into action when a pair of thugs, break into his apartment and mistake The Dude for a millionaire with the same name. The thugs demand money, and to get their point across, one of them ruins The Dude's favorite rug by urinating on it. When The Dude discovers that there is a millionaire with his name, he attempts to seek compensation in the form of a new rug. The millionaire refuses to give The Dude a new rug and claims that it is not his fault. Shortly after, the millionaire's young wife (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, and the millionaire agrees to give The Dude a new rug if he helps to get his wife back. The Dude sets out to save the millionaire's wife with the help of his best friend Walter(John Goodman) and soon finds himself thrust into a world of violence and intrigue that upsets his easy going way of life.<br /><br />Only the Cohen Brothers could come up with a film like this. The story, wide variety of interesting characters, and the overall uniqueness that the film posesses provide for a funny and enjoyable film. Jeff Bridges gives the best performance of his career as The Dude. His extremely laid back and lazy lifestyle will have you laughing for the majority of the film. The character is so lazy, that he writes a check for 69 cents at one point in the film. Jeff Bridges nailed the role so well that you would think that he really smokes. John Goodman gives one of the best, if not the best role of his career as The Dude's best friend and Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak. Walter's unique viewers on life and his constant use of profanity will have you cracking up for the whole movie. Some other great performances came from John Turturo as an eccentric bowler named Jesus and Juliane Moore as an erotic artist named Maude whose art consists of lying naked on a canvas. I was also particulary impressed with the camera work in this movie. At times, the camera offers a view from inside the holes of a bowling ball.<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is probably one of the funniest and most creative films that I have ever seen. Despite the fact that the film appears to be stupid on paper, the actors involved and other unique aspects of this movie will keep you laughing and entertained for the entire film. The DVD is worth the money because the Cohen Brothers talk for a solid 30 minutes on the making of "The Big Lebowski".<br /><br />A solid 5 stars...</p></br><a href="../users/AMKZHBOK7VMQR.html">AMKZHBOK7VMQR</a><br/><p>Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are perfectly cast in this weird offbeat buddy film. The plot is implausible and often bizzare but the performances are great. Reminded me  little of Pulp fiction in terms of style and very quotable dialogue. I'm not saying it isn't original but it definitely is in that category of weirdness. Ultimately Bridges character The Dude is one of the most memorable he's ever done. Goodman is very funny as a  partly deranged vietnam vet friend of the Dude&#62; he manages to be both offensive and sympathetic at the same time. Very cool movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Jeff Bridges does not play the title role in &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot;  Bridges plays the Dude; David Huddleston plays the Big Lebowski, a rich guy with a young trophy wife named Bunny (Tara Reid).  The problem is that the Dude and the Big Lebowski have the same name, which explains why when Bunny runs up debts the moronic pair sent to collet money from her husband end up at the house of the wrong Lebowski.  From that moment on the Dude's life gets very confusing and he is clearly the person least capable of dealing with this confusion of anybody in the greater Los Angeles area,<p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is only disappointing because it is the first film the Coen Brothers came out with after &quot;Fargo.&quot;  When you make a masterpiece it is hard to follow-up with something equally strong.  Even &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; suffers in comparison to &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; and whatever happened to the guy who made &quot;Titanic&quot;?  However, if &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; came out after &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; nobody would have batted an eye.  Not just because they both deal with a kidnapping that may or may not be a kidnapping, but also because the Coen Brothers have rounded up many of the usual familiar faces from their other films for this endeavor.<p>There are two main questions in this film.  The first is &quot;What is going on?&quot;  Repeatedly the Dude sits down and explains to his friends Walter (John Goodman) and/or Donny (Steve Buscemi) what he thinks is going on, or Walter takes a stab at it, and the odds are that sooner or later they are going to get it right.  Just do not put money down on it.  The second is what, if anything, the Dude will have left at the end of this meandering story.  You get the feeling that chances are neither the Dude nor his car are going to get out of this one alive and that his friends are as much a threat to the Dude (and his car) as the growing number of enemies who keep popping up through the festivities.  If only the Dude did not own a rug that really pulled his apartment together, then he might have been spared a lot of pain and frustration.  <p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a film that will grow on you, especially once you get atuned to the idea that the Dude is trying to keep his life together, the same way his beloved rug pulled together his apartment.  Even a misfire by the Coens is going to have some memorable moments and every film they make certainly has a chance to be on the level of "Raising Arizona" and "Fargo," so even their second tier efforts are worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A34K8D262NZQJF.html">A34K8D262NZQJF</a><br/><p>When I first saw this movie I really did not know what to expect or what I was going to see in the next scene and that don't happen to me much. This movie is totally mesmerizing and the characters are absolutely injected with life making the viewer fall in love or hate the characters involved in the plot. This movie is good in the way how 'the dude' tries to just get his carpet back but does as screwed up as his life already is. This movie is a total classic!</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>In what has to be the most brilliantly disjointed and anarchic look at the alienation, apathetic stupor, and pedestrian self-absorption of the pathetic Southern California lifestyle ever filmed, the two Coen brothers (`Fargo') produced and directed this near `cult' film to explore the plethora of cultural cop-outs parading as lifestyles in this zany yet affectionate look at a totally burned out and yet eminently likeable basket case  by the name of Jeff Lebowski, who is played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, in yet another of his consistently underestimated character portrayals. Lebowski prefers to go by his street name of "Dude", and seems to be the ultimate California case of a one-time fairly intelligent `n'er-do-well' now perpetually down on his luck and reduced to only occasional flashes of clarity and full functioning after way too many years of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and then some more drugs tossed in on the side.<p>The Coens' penchant for offbeat characters is having a field day here, with everyone in the cast allowed to vent in a kind of wacko 'Disneyland on the strip' approach to making the endless days of gorgeous LA sunshine pass, as our protagonist finds trouble in the promised land. Particularly memorable here is John Goodman weighing in as the paranoid and unpredictably violent Walter Sobchak, the `Dude's' best friend and perpetual bowling partner. The holy ceremony of bowling and the seriousness that it plays in the lives of the several losers like the Dude, Sobchak, and the preening eccentric Jesus Quintana (a wonderfully over-the-top John Turturro) and the rest of the motley crew on the Dude's team provides a kind of key that unlocks the mystery of their uniformly alienated, pointless, and directionless lives, as each tumbles from crisis to crisis, and with each attempt that Dude makes to cope with the circumstances that mysteriously start to swirl around his drug addled self-absorption and wake him into a groggy yet sober recognition that something very serious and potentially deadly is going on around him, he is repeatedly sabotaged and blind-sided by the myopic and near-psychotic antics of his friends. <p>Dude seems to approach crisis management as an exercise in spin control, and tries, sometimes quite ingeniously, to talk his way out of the staccato violence that punctuates his days with increasingly urgent frequency. But as the mystery deepens and Lebowski is sucked farther into the quicksand of coincidences, mistaken identities, and sheer madness that lurks just beneath the cover of these friendly skies, we are introduced to the powers and the principalities that are driving the madcap antics and the increasing shrill intensities of everyone but the Dude. The plot often seems disjointed, yet in a macabre way that seems to shout that not only is truth sometimes stranger than fiction, it is sometimes absolutely insane. Yet it eventually resolves itself into a semi-rational resemblance to plausible reality, or at least almost. And one walks way from the outstanding ensemble cast's performance thinking that something magic and allegorical has happened here, and it is perhaps exactly the insanity of the proceeding activity that is the point. They are indeed, every last one of them, just California crazy! This is a wild roller coaster of a film experience, but one absolutely worth the taking. Buckle up, kids, you're in for a bumpy ride! Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>"The Big Lebowski" is just perfect.  Everything about this movie is a laugh riot, even the bits of dialogue that aren't punchlines.  The cast is perfect, the writing is perfect... this movie has both Julianne Moore and Flea in it, what other movies can you say that about?  Well, there was the Gus Van Sant "Psycho" remake, but that doesn't count.  I found this movie by accident and I haven't let go of it since.  I may not be a stoner but I will say I've found more happiness since I embraced my inner Dude.<br /><br />Every time I go back to "Lebowski" I come away with something new that wasn't there before.  Like the realization, this time around, that Jeff Bridges is not seen to throw a single bowling ball in the entire movie.  And that Steve Buscemi's character rolls a strike every time we see him... except for the very final scene, for reasons that become clear a few moments later.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is just superb.  Remember Philip Seymour Hoffman as an unctuous PR man?  I'd forgotten about that.  Jon Polito (late of "Homicide") shows up as a P.I. in a familiar-looking purple VW bug.  Even Aimee Mann is in one scene, speaking German.  Oh, and Tara Reid, before her career completely and utterly collapsed.  Top supporting honors go to Sam Elliott, who according to the DVD documentary wasn't even sure what he was doing in the movie, but his opening narration gets funnier every time out ("And in English, too!").<br /><br />Another great thing is the dialogue.  You'd think the whole movie was done by improv, the way the dialogue is so natural.  Every character has their own particular jargon, and just like in real life, people keep repeating phrases they've heard elsewhere.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to finish a sentence, and neither can Steve Buscemi, although that's because John Goodman won't let him.  George Bush gets quoted a lot ("This aggression will not stand, man").<br /><br />Finally, I love the totally unglamorous portrayal of L.A. and Hollywood, limited to tiny theaters, a seedy bowling alley, a weapons store in the barrio, and the In 'n Out Burger (on Camrose).  The actor and artist type characters who show up are all obnoxious or pathetic, particularly David Thewlis's "video artist", and the chubby dancer/landlord who forgoes collecting rent from the Dude so long as the Dude shows up for his performances.  Not to mention Karl Hungus and the great Ben Gazarra cameo.<br /><br />But in the end, Jeff Bridges is the glue holding this movie together... and John Goodman... and John Turturro... and... and... aah!  Lost my train of thought here.  But... ah, [...], I've done introduced 'em enough.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>The Dude abides, my friends, and aren't you glad he's out there?<br /><br />What a mystery today would look like if Raymond Chandler was writing on Orange Sunshine.  Following on their acclaimed hit, Fargo, the Coens, known for strange and offbeat films, on this outing went totally surreally weird.  I confess I overlooked this film initially, despite being a Coen fan, but now I absolutely love it in all its idiosyncratic nuttiness.  Worthy of multiple viewings just to savor the throwaway lines and the marvelously bizarre cameos by the Coen's repertory company (Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare etc.) and the drop-ins (Huddleston, Tara Reid, Gazzara, Moore & a wonderful Sam Elliott).<br /><br />The plot, if you think one is necessary, has to do with The Dude (Jeff Bridges), an unreconstructed 60's throwback named Jeff Lebowski, being mistaken for a different, much richer Lebowski, and after being assaulted, his rug micturated upon and stolen (it ties the rooms together, man), begins a labyrinthine pursuit of the kidnapped wife of the Big Lebowski. Which of course, has nothing to do with the pleasures of this picture, which are the sidetrips and the characters, the asides, and the stuff thrown in just because its funny!<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is perfect as The Dude.  He knows this guy and he is this guy.  The perfect foil to The Dude is John Goodman's Walter, a Viet Nam vet who's a seething mix of outward calm combined with an explosive temper and a penchant for wrong assumptions.  These guys are great together.<br /><br />Anyway, delineation and explanation is just plain silly for this movie.  Just hop on and enjoy the ride and revel in the fact that the kitchen sink will come flying through at any moment.  There is a complete logic to this kaleidescope, but who cares?  Stay out of Malibu, Dude!  And don't forget to go find a cash machine!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The Big Lebowski (Comedy, Crime)<br />Directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen<br />Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi<br /><br />Universal Studios | 1998 | 119 min | Rated R | Released Aug 16, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital Copy<br />BD-Live<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />The Big Lebowski is essentially about mistaken identity if you care about the plot. Jeffrey Lebowski is known to his friends as The Dude (Bridges) and a gang of criminals pay him a visit thinking that he's another Lebowski who happens to be a millionaire. After they urinate on his rug, he seeks out the millionaire to claim compensation.<br /><br />The millionaire's wife goes missing and the gang asks for a million dollars in ransom. The Dude is chosen as the courier.<br /><br />That's about it. The plot is incidental; this is a movie about a way of life.<br /><br />The Dude hangs out with two of his bowling buddies, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran who has anger management issues; Donny hardly says a word and is told to shut up every time he tries to make a comment.<br /><br />The Dude is a mellow kind of a guy. He shops in his robe, gets high, and talks like he's permanently stoned. Walter is a mystery to him because he is so easily annoyed. When a competing team puts a toe over the line during a bowling game, Walter pulls out a gun and insists that it is marked down as a zero. It's a league game after all.<br /><br />The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and can be classed as a comedy more than anything, but the style of comedy may be different to the type you are used to. Many of the jokes are clever and subtle, and it's rare for the humor to be aimed too low.<br /><br />Watching The Big Lebowski is an experience. You're never quite sure what it is or where it is going. The plot elements aren't very important, but everything adds up and provides a reason for the characters to do what they do. It's the sort of movie where nothing happens, but you find yourself thinking about it days later.<br /><br />Fargo and No Country for Old Men are exceptional movies from the Coen Brothers, but many fans would argue that The Big Lebowski is better. I'm not among them, but it amuses me and I'm glad to finally own it on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Video Quality 3.5/5<br />Although the Blu-ray is a vast upgrade over the DVD, I'm a little disappointed with the overall look. Colors are much improved and everything looks brighter and cleaner, but the VC-1 presentation could have been better. Fine detail is present in a few scenes, but is lacking for the most part. Faces in particular seem badly defined. It just about earns a passing grade, but don't expect to be dazzled.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track sounds great. The songs carry a lot more weight than in previous releases. Dialogue is clear throughout and the predominantly front-heavy mix blends well with the action.

While not their very best work, it deserves a place in your collection. Bridges and Goodman excel in their roles and hold the whole thing together. The Blu-ray presentation enhances the experience, but not quite as much as I had hoped.

Being a die-hard Coens fan, I was ready for inconsequential lunacy, esoteric characterizations, and dangerous obsessions with style and substance.  Which is what I got.  Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.  Having revisited "Lebowski" recently, I now understand why.  Ill prepared to deal with the rambling narrative, I felt cheated by lack of structure.  Which, I now see, is precisely the point of the film.  So, my advice to first time viewers of "The Big Lebowski": never mind the plot machinations, this one's all about watching (and listening to [and learning from]) The Dude.<p>Remember that stoner guy in high school, the one with the flashes of wit and insight in between spaced-out ramblings about his favourite rock band?  Well, then you are on your way to knowing Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski.  Mistaken by collecting thugs for a richer, more married, other Jeffrey Lebowski, The Dude gets caught up in a kidnapping caper when all he really wants to do is bowl and own a urine-free rug that really holds the room together.  His dialogue belies years of smoking jay and downing endless White Russians.  But The Dude is no Spicoli retread, and he'd never be caught dead with Bill and Ted.  Surprisingly, he's a man of substance.<p>His history, missed by me the first time around, plays a terribly important role in his character.  There's the scene where he's in bed with Maude Lebowski (daughter of The Big Lebowski), where she point blank asks him about his past.  Obscure references are made to the Port Huron Statement and the Seattle Seven, which indicates a fair measure of radicalism in Jeff's student days.  But he also casually tells Brandt (The Big Lebowski's manservant) that his university days were spent, "occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick [and] breaking into the ROTC".  So a social conscience was never far from young Jeff's thoughts.  But now, some two decades later, he's burned out.  It's the yearning for the casual lifestyle, free from stress and, quite frankly, thought, that is the main theme at the core of the movie.<p>Standing in The Dude's way are a series of supporting characters that make up a Raymond Chandleresque menagerie of society's oddest oddballs (a group of nihilists with a defined sense of fairness; a trust-fund performance artist; an old-school pornographer; a bowling child molester; a seemingly endless parade of carpet pissers).  But they are less characters than roadblocks to The Dude's ultimate goal: a life of leisure.<p>Jeff Bridges, so adept at playing tormented angst ("The Fabulous Baker Boys", "The Fisher King"), proves that he has a deft comic touch, without ever being light.  His Dude is a scruffy sloth, impatient with the world around him, but unable to figure out a viable way out of it.  Bridges is truly hilarious here, never more so than with a simple expression near the end, when one character literally gets in his face.  Assisting Bridges on his quest for leisure nirvana are John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.  Goodman's Walter Sobchak is, if possible, even more over the top than The Dude.  A conspiracy minded Vietnam vet, Sobchak is the raving id to The Dude's laid-back id, which makes them fast friends, and a terrible team.  Buscemi, in what may be the most thankless role in the entire Coen canon, brings enough humanity to the eternally dim Donny that he becomes less a cipher and more an important friend.  The rest of the cast is a fine mixture of Coen regulars, recognizable character actors, and even a couple of my favourite musicians in small cameos (look closely for Flea and Aimee Mann as two of the Nihilists).<p>But it's probably Sam Elliott who makes the most undeniable impression here, as a smooth talking cowboy enigmatically called "The Stranger".  His thick southern drawl, bushy moustache, and constantly twinkling eyes brighten up the few brief scenes he's in.  Ostensibly the narrator (and who else but the Coens could dream up a narrator who loses his train of thought?), Elliott appears once at the beginning, once in the middle, and once again at the end.  He offers low-key charm for The Dude to play off of (one of my favourite jokes in the film:<p>THE STRANGER: One of those days, huh?  Well, a wiser fellow than myself once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, well, he eats you.<p>DUDE:  Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?  [Mike's note:  Oh yeah!  The whole Eastern philosophy thing is a great, subtle undercurrent throughout the film.  The Dude abides, indeed.  Catch him doing faux Tai Chi when he needs to mellow out more than the marijuana can handle.]<p>THE STRANGER:  Far from it.).<p>Ultimately, I suppose, "Lebowski" is a product of the Coen Brothers' minds, and its laced with their particular obsessions, stylistic devices, and eclectic musical choices (imagine scoring a tense bowling moment with a flamenco version of "Hotel California").  If you've enjoyed the Coens' anti-filmmaking in the past, and are prepared for an even more extreme example of it, take a quick trip with The Dude and Co.  You'll surely enjoy the ride.<p>(The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features, except for a nifty 30-minute interview with Joel and Ethan Coen.  It's a rare treat, offering a trip into the brothers' witty, eccentric, but thoughtful filmmaking minds.  Their anecdote about an interview they gave to a magazine called "Floor Coverings Weekly" is priceless, and it shows their playfulness and willingness to mock anyone not in on the joke.)</p></br><a href="../users/AK2AQIULQDFS5.html">AK2AQIULQDFS5</a><br/><p>I have seen this movie more than any other in my collection (tied with Die Hard.. actually)and it seems to get funnier every time.

Jeff Bridges should have got an academy award for playing the laziest,slacker, burn out of all time. From top to bottom this movie is GREAT. Sam Elliot as the narrator, John Goodman as my dad... er I mean as Walter the Viet Nam vet who flys off the handle at everything, Steve Beuschemi as Donnie ("Shut the 'F' up Donnie), The Big Lebowski and his henchman Phillip Seymore Hoffman, Lebowski's wife Bunny, The Nihilist, John Tutturo as Jesus the bowler (don't 'F' with the Jesus), I could go on and on. All the characters are funny as hell and origional. The story is hilarious. The dialouge again, hilarious. The direction by the Coen brothers is fantastic. This movie could actually be perfect if their is such a thing.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>To me, the greatest thing about the Coen brothers is how vastly different each of their films is.  For example, after making the dark, dramatic "Fargo", they made this film - "The Big Lebowski", a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen.  What other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film, and continuing doing so through all of their films?  Only the Coen brothers.<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed man known to everyone as "The Dude".  His life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman), the latter of which is an easily upset Vietnam vet.  Life is good for The Dude - until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug, mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski.  The Dude goes to visit "the Big Lebowski" (David Huddleston) and tells him about it.  Shortly thereafter, The Dude is beat up by three people he's never met, then ordered by the Big Lebowski to be the courier in an exchange - the Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (a young Tara Reid) has just been kidnapped.  From there on, things get worse and worse for The Dude.  How he's gonna get himself out of it is anyone's guess.<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" is really a fantastic film.  There is a well-written, clever, and funny script - which isn't really a surprise from the Coen brothers.  Great directing and cinematography (the latter by Roger Deakins), particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences.  There's also a really cool soundtrack, featuring Bob Dylan, CCR, and more.<br /><br />But what would the film be without the cast?  Jeff Bridges is really great and funny as The Dude.  The real highlight of the cast is probably John Goodman, who is absolutely hilarious as The Dude's over-the-top best friend.  There's also good performances from Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Sam Elliott.  Coen brothers favorites Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Peter Stormmare also appear.<br /><br />As I've said, the thing that is most appealing about the Coen brothers are the differences between each of their films.  "The Big Lebowski" is one of their very best.  It's a stoner movie - and it's one of the best movies ever made.  Watch it, dude.  You won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Trying to describe this movie is impossible.  When you get down to the core of it, it is about an unemployed stoner and bowling league member, The Dude, who gets mistaken for a millionaire philanthropist and has his crappy rug damaged by some bad guys.  The Dude's main position in the movie is trying to obtain restitution for his rug, and this leads to him getting caught up in the kidnapping of the millionaire's wife.  All of this plot is a little weak, and that's the beauty of the movie.  The movie is truly a collection of unforgettable characters and scenes in which the slacker criminals go up against the big guys.  We have a stolen car, a missing briefcase full of money, a severed toe, some neo-nihilist European criminals, a naked feminist artist, a porn king, and a lot of White Russians.  Jeff Bridges is brilliant as The Dude, but equally impressive is John Goodman's bitter Vietnam vet with a very clear sense of justice (even if it gets them in more trouble every time).  This is a ingenious recipe for a black comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Fresh from the Oscar success of "Fargo" it would have appeared that the Coen brothers had finally found the knack of cracking the "mainstream".  Then comes this tale of kidnapping, nihilism, pornography and...bowling.  In the masterful hands of the Coens these disparate elements all tie together not unlike the Dude's rug that the Asian thug soiled.  In a career of excellent yet unheralded performances Jeff Bridges' account of the Dude ranks at the top.  John Goodman as Dude's unhinged buddy Walter is probably the best work he's ever done.  Great supporting cast.  And what can you say about a film where Steve Buscemi is the sanest character?  I waited for years to replace my VHS copy of this film with a proper release.  I can't verify whether this "Collectors Edition" is misleading.  I did like the intro by "film preservationist" Mortimer Young, though.  The old VHS copy that I owned had Spanish subtitles running across the bottom.  Initially I thought this was another surreal joke by the Coens but a Latino buddy of mine assured me that it wasn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F.html">A1PCQHQ6NPGL9F</a><br/><p>I love this movie. Everything about it rules. It is hilarious. You have to see the DVD though because there is alot of cursing.<p>The best thing about it is John Goodman. He dominates every scene he's in.

Jeff Bridges is hilarious as "the Dude," a pretty simple guy whose life goes all kinds of topsy-turvy after he's mistaken for someone else with the same name - Jeffrey Lebowski.  John Goodman is hilarious as his best friend Walter Sobchak, a boisterous Vietnam vet with a quick temper and a pathological need to jump in and take decisive action all the time, and Steve Buscemi is his usual entertaining self as the only reasonably sane person in the entire film.  The Big Lebowski is really all about dialogue and delivery.  The script is just wickedly funny from start to finish, but it is Bridges' laid-back delivery that really makes the comic engine go, with all kinds of help from John Goodman.<br /><br />The Dude comes home one night, only to find himself thrown face-down in the toilet and otherwise accosted by two chaps demanding money to pay off his wife's debts.  He finally manages to convince the guys that he is not the Jeffrey Lebowski they are looking for - but not before one of the jokers gives his rug a golden shower.  The Dude is not at all happy about this, as "that rug really tied the room together."  After consulting with his bowling partners (the Dude spends a lot of time bowling), he decides to find the other, obviously rich Lebowski and ask him to reimburse him for the rug.  Soon thereafter, the Big Lebowski calls him in and asks him to serve as the courier for a money drop to some guys who kidnapped his pretty young wife Bunny (Tara Reid).  That's when all the trouble really starts.  The Dude's soon mixed up with all sorts of crazy people (including a gang of nihilists), while Walter manages to get him deeper and deeper into a lot of trouble he never wanted in the first place.  There are indeed lots of strands in the Dude's head as the whole story takes a series of odd twists and turns, each of them funnier than the last.  And he's got to get ready for the big semifinals of bowling league play, to boot - Walter is very, very dedicated to the bowling league games.  It's almost impossible to give a good overview of the plot, and I wouldn't want to do so anyway, as you really have to experience it all for yourself.<br /><br />You've got to love the Dude.  He's just a lazy slacker who wanted his good, clean rug back, and then all this crazy stuff happened to him.  Rest easy, though, knowing that "the Dude abides."  Sometimes, that's about all you can do in this crazy world.  I should mention that the film more than earns its R rating for profanity, as about every third word anyone says is a curse word - so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may be "out of your element" here.  I am quite confident, though, that most viewers will laugh themselves silly watching this movie and will want to keep on watching it over and over again.  The Coen Brothers hit a grand slam with this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>REFRESHING THOUGH UNORTHODOX WAY TO SPIN A GOOD YARN - BUT THERE'S LOT'S MORE:<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" was a delight to watch.

The script is a Coen Brother's specialty, with characters who are not very smart, or at least not nearly as smart as they think they are.  Jeff Bridges plays "The Dude", a likeable loser of a Californian who unfortunately shares the same last name as "The Big Lebowski", a wealthy older man with a trophy ex-porn star wife who owes bad characters money.  The Dude's chief social activity consists of drinking White Russians, being stoned, and hanging out with his bowling team.  The Dude's team includes John Goodman as a Vietnam Vet who doesn't think twice about trying to double-cross criminals to make off with a million bucks of ransom money, or pulling a gun on a rival bowler who makes a minor infraction, stepping across the line during league play.  Steve Buscemi is on the team as well.  It has been noted that another Coen trademark is bizarre manners of death for Buscemi characters.<br /><br />To try to describe the plot would meander worse than Sam Elliot's opening narration, but by the end Sam shows up in person (looking great as usual beneath a cowboy hat) to tell the Dude that he likes his style.<br /><br />The Dude abides, and I like the Coen's style.

The Dude wants restitution because &quot;that rug really ties the room together&quot;. <p>A visit to the Big Lebowski nets him a new rug, if anything, but that one will also be stolen. With his bowling friends Vietnam veteran Walter (John Goodman) and third-wheel Donny (Steve Buscemi) , he soon becomes embroiled in a kidnapping, intrigue, sex, and his never-ending quest to get his rug back. <p>It is a Coen brothers movie, and keeps their tone throughout - basically a film noir, but this time set in modern days and on an acid trip. Part of the fun is simply watching The Dude encoutering various colourful characters on his simple mission to get his rug back, but failing miserably and getting himself in more and more trouble. He has an acid flashback every time he is knocked unconscious, which leads to some of the most memorable scenes of the movie. <p>There is also a lot of humour in the characters. The Dude is a happy-go-luck character who bears the chain of events with befuddled aplomb. Walter, the quintessential movie war vetertan, flirts the line of sterotype but the Coen brothers give enough depth to the characters to escape it. Other characters like the Nihilist gang and the daughter of the Big Lebowski, a New Age artist, go above and beyond the call of duty. <p>The Dude: Let me explain something to you. Um, I am not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>You wouldn't expect anything lesser from the makers of Fargo and Raising Arizona, arguably two fantastic movies in their own right. The B L is a freaky comedy without any situational plot in particular but weirdly engaging in the theme and its treatment nevertheless. <p>It's about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is described by the narrator as the laziest man in LA  County. He lives only to go bowling, but is mistaken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with funny consequences. The Dude is played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, a potbelly, a ponytail and a pair of Bermuda shorts so large they may have been borrowed from his best friend and bowling teammate, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman). Their other teammate is Donny (Steve Buscemi), who may not be very bright, but it's hard be sure since he never is allowed to complete a sentence. <p>Los Angeles in this film is a zoo of peculiar characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus (John Turturro), who is seen going door to door in his neighborhood on the sort of mission you read about, but never picture anyone actually performing. The Dude tends to have colorful hallucinations when he's socked in the jaw or pounded on the head, which happens often, and one of them involves a musical comedy sequence inspired by Busby Berkeley. (It includes the first point-of-view shot in history from inside a bowling ball.) <p>Some may complain The Big Lebowski rushes in all directions and never ends up anywhere. That isn't the film's flaw, but its style -- ala "Go" and "Swingers". The Dude, who smokes a lot of pot and guzzles White Russians made with half-and-half, starts every day filled with resolve, but his plans gradually dissolve into a haze of missed opportunities and missed intentions. Most people lead lives with a third act. The Dude lives days without evenings. <p>Definitely a light hearted allround enjoyable movie -- something that deserves more than 9 reviews at Amazon! (as of this  writing)</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>After hearing a lot of hype about it, I finally cracked and got The Big Lebowski. While it certainly didn't bump No Country For Old Men from the top spot of my favorite Coen Brother films, it still didn't make me regret buying it either. I would rank it at number two. I actually can see myself growing more and more in to it as I watch it a few more times. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, the Dude. The Dude is a mellow unemployed bowler with a laid back attitude about everything, except his Persian rug. He also has really has a thing for White Russians and pajamas. His character was actually the first thing that pulled me into the story. Jeff Bridges doesn't play The Dude, he IS The Dude.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges has a solid supporting cast as well. John Goodman in one of his five appearances in a Coen brother film, is actually hilarious as Walter. My favorite moments are the times that he tells Steve Buscemi's character "Shut the f**k up, Donnie!" I really enjoyed this movie all the way through, but it could have been better. One thing I had a problem with were the dream scenes where the Dude would either be flying over Los Angeles, running from Russians with scizzors, or some other psychedelic figure. This is just my own personal nitpicks. Fortunately, there are only a few of these dream sequences. Besides that, my only other complaint is that, as extreme the events of the film were, I never really felt excited. In the end, The Big Lebowski is funny enough, and the performances were great. So this movie was worth the purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Why do so few films develop a cult following which increases in number and intensity each year? For example, The Big Lebowski. Can you think of another film which has an annual festival in its sole honor? (It was held this year in Louisville.) I was mulling about this as I recently saw it again. Much funnier this time. For me, the same is true of Young Frankenstein. Films never change but we do. So how have I changed? If The Big Lebowski is even funnier the next time, what does that reveal about me? More mulling awaits me.<p>Meanwhile, given the variety of screenplays they have co-authored, produced, directed thus far, Joel and Ethan Coen cannot be accused of predictability. Who else has created a body of work as varied as theirs? Blood Simple (1985), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Fargo (1996) The Big Lebowski (1998), O, Brother, Where Art Thou? ((2000), and The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Each has its own loyal and substantial following. Fargo remains my personal favorite but, over time, as I keep changing, perhaps The Big Lebowski will replace it. <p>Few people know that, in fact, the Coens collaborated on its screenplay with members of the Monty Python Flying Circus, Hunter Thompson, Ken Kesey, Salvador Dali, and William M. Gaines. How else to explain the absence of a coherent plot? Fortunately, we have an especially interesting cast of characters in addition to the two Jeffrey Lebowskis (Lebowskes?): "The Big's" wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who creates serious problems for "Dude" because she owes money to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) and is kidnapped, with a ransom of $1-million demanded; "The Big's" daughter Maude (Julianne Moore) who really should join a flying circus; Jesus (John Turturro), a champion bowler who prefers blue language and purple clothing; Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), probably "Dude's" best friend; and Donny (Steve Buscemi), another of "Dude's" close friends. Much time is spent on consuming White Russians as well as on bowling, kidnapping, cursing, extortion, sex, and...<p>For many of us, this film is an acquired taste. I enjoy it more each time I see it; others, I realize, will not see it through to completion. For them, it makes no sense. In this context, I am reminded of Henry Ford's observation that whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.</p></br><a href="../users/A20TJ5P97W5MS1.html">A20TJ5P97W5MS1</a><br/><p>What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? Is it being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the cost? Isn't that that makes a man? The Big Lebowski is a film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski who is referred to as "The Dude". This is arguably the most clever movie ever made. This is a fact that is strongly supported by a legion of hardcore dedicated fans world wide. The Big Lebowski is not a cult film - it is the cult film. It has a zen like leisure to it scarcely ever found before or after it came out. You don't have to be a real slacker you can just watch one on television. Aside from all the amazing sensationalism there is a also a great film here as well. The film is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep. To understand this film I highly recommend you make a couple dozen strong White Russians, sit back, and enjoy. The Dude abides.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>I first saw Lebowski as the second of a double feature.  My friend and I were a little early for the main show and saw the end of Lebowski, didn't really think much about it.  We saw the main show and i think we stayed for a bit of Lebowski.  I had never heard of the Coen brothers nor this film and it certainly was silly....However I ended up liking it in spite of myself.<br /><br />Now, years later I watched it properly, from beginning to end...and I've seen a number of the Coens' other films and have due respect for them.  And I think I like this almost the best of all.  I loved Oh Brother, but that was mainly for the sound track.  What I like about this is it's so unpretentious and joyously dopey.  It's blessed with a terrific cast--they must have had a wonderful time making it, unhampered by the pressure of having to make a serious art film.  And the fun comes across.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, for sure. One thing that did bother me was the excessive use of the f-word.  I'm no prude but really....If somehow that word were prohibited from film making the Coens would be out of business.  Still I'll take that over all the blood and gore of some of their other films.  One missing toe is the worst you'll find here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I don't know which edition is the best to buy.  I don't think the Dude would much care what format you put him into or if a bowling ball came with the DVD or not.  In the end the Dude just takes each day as it comes, seemingly content to having survived another odd experience.<br /><br />The movie pretty much starts and stops and occasionally comes to a crashing halt just like the Dude's car.  It is a pastiche of noir and kitsch elements loosely held together by the Dude having to deliver a ransom for a rich man's young girlfriend, Bunny, and soon finds his life completely turned upside down by events.  The Coen Bros. humorously capture the laconic LA scene, forcing the Dude to have to face some rough rides and tough broads (Julianne Moore), before finally getting a clue to what is actually going on.  Walter is there to help him out, played with the bravado you have come to expect in John Goodman, but usually ends up making an even bigger mess of things.  Buscemi comes across as odd man odd out in this strange bowling trio.<br /><br />If you are used to the tight, plot-driven movies of the Coen Bros. you may be disappointed by this one, as it is played entirely for comic effect.  There really isn't much there to hang the Stanger's ten gallon hat on.  It is what it is.  Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A laid back slacker (Jeff Bridges) and his high strung buddy (John Goodman) get caught up in a complex kidnap scheme.<br /><br />"The Big Lebowski" has amassed a huge cult following, so I came to this film with high expectations.  I enjoyed it, but I must admit that I don't see why it has inspired such devotion that annual conventions are held and books have been written in its honor.  However, it has an offbeat rhythm and there may be more than meets the eye at a first viewing.  The Coen brothers devote as much screen time (or maybe more) to bowling and the men who enjoy such simple pleasures as they do to the busy machinations of the crime and the schemers behind it, which suggests that they have something to say about what really matters in life.  I own a copy of the film, I will certainly watch it again, and I suspect that it will grow on me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 2/04, 6/06, 10/10<br />Rate: 8<br /><br />6/06: I don't think there has been a film noir that is aimed to be so hysterically funny and yet be a true film noir until I saw The Big Lebowski. In the film, there is a bunch of awesome characters, an insane plot, and load of profanity words should be considered as poetry. Jeff Bridges develops his character as The Dude so perfectly attuned to Sam Spade, Jake Gittes, and Philip Marlowe but in a little bit crass way. What's interesting about The Dude is that he doesn't possess much of lifelong interests except for a few things: weed, bowling, and White Russian. It is definitely one of the most well made films noir. I know the picture is so out of the element, considering the amount of profanity, drug use, sex, and hysterical subplots, but remember this: The Big Lebowski stayed true to boundaries of film noir because there is a mystery, a missing girl, a supposedly femme fatale, a regular guy who happened to become a sleuth by a freak luck, and some tragic moments in sort of a funny way. Who steals the movie besides The Dude? Of course, it is John Goodman as Walter Schobak. He was just so funny. The wild accusations The Dude made (again, Jake Gittes), I admit he made a perfect sense, however how silly it sounds, out of a baffling mystery. All in all, The Big Lebowski is very well-done.<br /><br />10/10: The Big Lebowski, as great as it is, doesn't really hold up well against test of time. It's just that I am turned off by the momentum killer of the bowling dream scenes. They don't seem to add much to the film. At the same time, I found John Goodman's character to be bit of an annoyance. Still, it is a very funny picture that certainly had its moments here and there. The acting by the cast was equally very good, and they really made the movie themselves. I loved some of the spoofs of the film noir elements in The Big Lebowski The Big Lebowski, and they add more punch to the overall comedy. What I liked the most about the plot of the film is that how stupid the Dude is and how effortless he is in solving the mystery of the tale. It is like he goes from one footprint to another by random accidents. All in all, The Big Lebowski is worth watching for any fan of film noir genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This was the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, so I was not attuned to the fine points of the re-release "Collector's Edition".  I just enjoyed the creative Coen brothers masterpiece of characters and vibrant yet dark and twisted plot.  The Big Lebowski is just a fantastic engaging steady stream of laughs.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges (the "Dude" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.<br /><br />The Big Lewbowski is a hilarious comedy noir full of colorful bizarre characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>I just now recently watched this film, and I can't believe I waited this long to finally see it. This is a really good film..very funny..and in my opinion, the best Coen Brothers film..(though there's still a couple I haven't seen yet!) The basic plot that jump starts the film is kinda silly, but its so silly its great..then the story just evolves from there..from things getting bad to worse for "The Dude" and his friends! The performance of Jeff Bridges as this "dude" is classic. And don't forget John Goodman as the dude's bowling friend and sidekick, Walter. As with most Coen brother's work..the dialogue is hilarious and fantastic..especially the interacting of Bridges' and Goodman's characters. I just can't believe that I've missed out on this film for this long! Definitely recommended to anyone that enjoys funny dialogue and unforgettable characters!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>In "Big Lebowski" (1998) -a weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique dry and more often than not dark humor, sit back, laugh out loud, and have fun. Big Lebowski is IMO one of the top funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interaction, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus, etc but the story is truly secondary to the beautiful craziness of the movie. I've read many reviews that call Big Lebowski a mess, saying that the story is convoluted, call it misfire and deranged, with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' "Fargo" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey "the Dude" Lebowski. I agree that "Fargo" is Coens' masterwork but it does not make BL any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. How wrong the prediction was. "The Dude" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast -ex hippie and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, more Jewish than Tevye Viet Nam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, "sweet prince" Donnie (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, even more than just the characters for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby boomers. Our younger son came home for Christmas holidays couple of weeks ago, and we were talking about and quoting BL, one of his all time favorite movies in our conversations - we always do. He gave me the DVD couple of years ago for my birthday, and the movie has become one of my favorite comedies since that time, too. Ironically, I did not like it much after the first viewing ten years ago. It seemed too surreal, loud, and strange. Now it is different - I can't get enough of it. While our son was visiting, Big Lebowski was shown on TV in the beautiful crisp HD presentation. Once again, I laughed so much and so hard that I was afraid to ruin my rug which really ties the room together in the same manner Dude's was. Great and immortal fun, THE cult picture for as long as people watch movies.<br /><br />While writing about Big Lebowski, I looked up the Coens' resume. They've made only 13 films, and all of them are treasures, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime (2006). I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, "Burn after reading" - Brother Coen don't make bad movies, they don't know how. Their films should not be missed - they all are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures, in short, first class entertainment. There are only two working directors whose movies I always see upon release in the theater, preferably, during the first weekend - Woody Allen and the writing/directing team, Ethan and Joel Coen.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Ace filmmaking team Joel and Ethan Coen ("Fargo") took more than a few pages from Raymond Chandler's seedy L.A. noir novels to create this absurdly comic caper masterpiece. Bridges is riotous as the unflappable aging hippie who finds himself embroiled in double and triple extortion plots--think Phillip Marlowe on a bag of weed--while superb sidekicks Goodman and Buscemi get to sling around a lot of ripe witticisms. Also great is John Turturro, playing a vulgar-mouthed champion bowler named Jesus, and Julianne Moore, fetching as an "erotic artist." In typical Coen fashion, the camerawork is wildly offbeat, the dialogue sharp, and the performances goofy and intriguing. Don't miss this kooky homage to the weird world of noir.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This was one of the weirdest movies that I have ever seen! It was also one of the best Coen brothers movies that I have ever seen. There is a very simplistic storyline revolving around this guy named "the Dude". His real name is Jeff Lebowski, and one day he comes home to find these thugs at his house asking him for money that he obviously dosent have. You see, there is another Jeff Lebowsky that lives in the neighborhood. He is a wheelchair bound millionaire who lives in a mansion. The thugs finally realize this, get mad, and ruin the Dudes oriental rug that is in his living room. It was the rug that "tied the whole room together" as the Dude says. So, the next day, the Dude sets off to the millionaires house to complain and get a new rug. He eventually gets caught up in a lot of stuff that happens later on, like whenever the millionaire's young wife gets "kidnapped", and they ask the Dude to drop off the ransom. <p>Lots of other crazy stuff happens from there on out, and I'm not giving away anymore, so if you haven't seen it, SEE IT! Its absolutly goofy and fun to watch! <p>The only problem that I had with the film was the unnecessary, pervasive language. Definitly not for children.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is nothing but a remake, or maybe the original (I would know if I had checked the dates: but you know, laziness, and it is funny to remain fuzzy, like the Coen Brothers themselves) of what we know under the title of "Pulp Fiction". The Coen Brothers get rid of the shuffling time line and have episodes and chapters in order, but it is just as intricate as the other, except that it is harmless, more or less, and funny in the punk beatnik post 1968 style if you like that and the unemployed who play the Greek philosophers.. It means that the mistake in "Pulp Fiction" becomes the rule here and everything is over-reacting and mis-targeting the true victim of the explosion, of temper of course, never of any fire-arms, though quite a few are moving and travelling around, just like bowling pins and bowling balls. That's a way of looking at  suburban social sprawl that deserves some attention and time. The best debunking of pulp fiction is in the bar-diner scene. A lot of noise and ruckus for very little. I like the breaking in, out and through of all sorts of cars. The Coen Brothers don't seem to like cars probably because they are the best representation of American wastefulness and extreme vain arrogance. But "Pulp Fiction" seems to debunk cars too though in a different way.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A17O7AGDZPOJSS.html">A17O7AGDZPOJSS</a><br/><p>This movie was recomended to me by of all people my father.

It started slowley growing on me man, My fourth and fifth viewing of the movie well ... umm... like I had been smokin some Tie stick man.... and like it was just far out especially the Halusination scenes. With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too.  The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self "THE DUDE" you will be saying "SHUT THE F**K DONNIE" etc.  One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>The Coen Brothers' 1998 masterpiece "The Big Lebowski" is a classic in every sense of the word. From its tight plotting to great characters to a string of great quotes, this is truly one of the best movies ever.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude, a stoner livin in L.A. who enjoys bowling and being lazy. One night, a group of thugs mistake him for a millionaire with his name, and pee on his rug and demand money. Jeff decides to settle things by visiting the elder millionaire who posseses the same name as him. The wealthy Lebowski refusese to compensate for the rug, angering The Dude. However, when Lebowski's wife Bunny (Tara Reid) is kidnapped, he enlists The Dude's help. The Dude is ordered to make a ransom drop, to which he reluctantly accepts. Things go well until The Dude's friend Walter Sobchack (a riotous John Goodman) decides to tag along, managing to complicate manners. The Dude is then plunged into a world of intrigue, encountering hialrious situations, killer nihilists and the perfect match for him, the esoteric artist Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore).<br /><br />This film is a true classic. The special edition dvd comes with a making-of documentary, a photo gallery and few other extras.

And this is just what this movie has to offer; eccentric characters, weird plot, funny dialogue and aimless situations that ultimately set the mood  for the picture. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare and John  Turturro, all Coen regulars and all deliver great performances and draw  uniquely weird characters. Newcomers to the Coen zanniness, Julianne Moore  and Philip Seymour Hoffman are very promising actors and are also great in  their roles. But kudos go to Jeff Bridges and John Goodman who both give  excellent performances and are very funny together. Not as good as other  Coen films but very funny, weird and entertaining. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 7!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>Well, I'm giving anything having to do with The Big Lebowski the most stars you can give. It is only the greatest thing since sliced bread. Every scene, every actor, every line. This movie is perfection. It's hard to pick because they all stand out, but John Goodman especially knocks it out of the park in this one. More than a movie, this is part of my life and a lot of other people I know too. So... do you need the special edition? No. Don't get it unless you don't already own the movie to begin with. The special edition one is a bummer and don't waste the money because you have to slip the rent under the landlord's door later.

I'd estimate that the combined income from all their projects is less than 10% of what "Titanic" made. <p>Nonetheless, one of their productions, "Fargo", made the AFI's Top 100 list. What's more impressive is that voters on the far more democratic Internet Movie DataBase put 4 of their 7 films on the site's Top 250 list. <p>"The Big Lebowski" is one of those four movies. It has the definitive Coen signature, which can be described as the ability to show how ordinary people accidentally find themselves in extraordinary situations. These are usually criminal in nature. <p>In "Blood Simple", there was a dead body that wouldn't stay buried. Unable to have children of their own, a couple - a cop and an ex-con - found a solution when a rich couple had sextuplets in "Raising Arizona". They figured that, if they kidnapped one of the infants, no one would miss it. Frances McDormand, who is Mrs. Joel Coen in real life, stole the show in "Fargo". She played a Minnesota policewoman investigating one of the dumbest crimes ever committed. <p>"The Big Lebowski" is an enormously funny story about mistaken identity, a kidnapping and a missing rug. <p>Jeff Bridges, who's had a very up and down career, gives his best performance since 1993's "Fearless", a highly recommended film. <p>Bridges' character refuses to answer to his last name, Lebowski. Irrevocably stuck in the 70's, he insists on being called The Dude. About the only things he does well are bowling and smoking illegal substances. <p>His best friend, Walter, is trapped in an even worse time frame. He thinks he's still in Vietnam. As Walter, John Goodman gives what is arguably his best screen performance. <p>The real fun begins when Russian thugs burst into The Dude's apartment. Taking a bath in a candle lit bathroom and listening to groovy 70's tunes, our stoned hero doesn't get really mad until the intruders ruin his favorite rug. <p>These villains demand that The Dude's wife repay a lot of money she owes. This presents a problem because The Dude isn't married. Said wife, aptly named Bunny, is married to someone else - The Big Lebowski [David Huddleson], a creepy old man whose daughter Maude is older than Bunny. <p>Maude also becomes a problem. She has her own thugs, despises her father and is convinced Bunny kidnapped herself. As Maude, Julieanne Moore is even better than she was in "Boogie Nights". She also gets to make one of the most memorable entrances in the history of motion pictures. <p>By now you are perhaps thinking that this movie is wacky. If so, you are not only right, but that's just the beginning of the picture. <p>The brothers Coen are relentless inventive and outrageous. In "The Big Lebowski", they even find a way to scold themselves for the profanity that is rampant throughout the movie. Even the foul language seems more satirical than prurient. <p>Joel and Ethan seem to live happily in their own dimension. Personally, I enjoy their distorted view of reality. Or is it really distorted? You decide.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>The inventive minds of the Coen brothers have brought us some unbelievebly brilliant films in the past. Everything from the suspenseful film noir &quot;Blood Simple&quot; to the hilarious &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; But by far my favorite Film of thier's is the hippie, fever dream of a movie, known as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is the Coen Brother's homage/spoof of the old Raymond Chandler detective novels.But instead of a tough gritty private eye we get an old burnt out hippie (known as The Dude) who has a passion for interleague bowling.The poor guy gets drawn into a convoluted mystery when his rug is soiled (&quot;the rug tied up the entire room, man&quot;) and he is mistaken for a millionaire named Lebowski.From that moment on the Dude goes through a crazy quilt of a city known as Los Angeles encountering every weirdo that the full moon can bring out (feminist artists, pornographers, a gang of nihilist Germans etc.)Actor Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. Nobody seems to want to leave this poor guy alone! He is thrown into a mystery when all he wants to do is bowl and get stoned! Special mention should be made of actor John Goodman, who plays the Dude's totally obnoxious, Vietnam obsessed, buddy.Goodman practically steals the film as he rants and raves and keeps getting the Dude into deeper and deeper trouble.Everything in this film is well done including a smart script, inventive set design, phantasmagoric, dream-like, special effects and a wonderful soundtract that includes Bob Dylan, Ry Cooder, CCR and the Gypsy Kings.This movie is dead on funny and will leave you laughing even after multiple viewings.Buy this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Two young brothers from cold Minnesota must have had a rich fantasy life in the midst of mid-western snowstorms.  Their Fargo was a sly satire of prairie folks.  But before there were Fargo and Academy Awards, there was The Big Lebowski, which for actor Jeff Bridges is his signature career role, The Dude.<br /><br />The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.<br /><br />The similarities stop there.  Dude is a middle aged longhaired, hippy slacker with a bowling ball. His pal John Goodman is a Vietnam freak-out converted to Judaism.  Together they meet the Fritz brothers, the nympho-artist, and assorted freaks on the way to solving a mystery that really doesn't matter.  This one is for laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>The only new feature on the "Collector's Edition" DVD is the remastered picture and sound?

I also would have made somewhat more of a coherent narrative, although I might concede the necessity of absurdist scenes like 'Gutterballs.'<br /><br />There's plenty to like, though:  the chameleon actor Jeff Bridges, a native of L.A., is perfectly suited to the role of the Dude; the Stranger is not totally necessary, either, but he is wonderful; Steve Buscemi and John Goodman are hilarious, especially the latter, with his constant refrains about Vietnam; and then there are the usual hijinks and screw-ups related to kidnapping and other crimes for which the Coen Brothers seem to have a very strong affinity.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>I dunno why I'm bothering to write this review, as I don't have too much too say and I'm just gonna annoy people, but I feel the impulse.  Anyway, it seems like 'The Big Lebowski' is the most popular Coen brothers film for people in my age bracket, but I can't entirely get into it.  It's got some funny parts, and the main characters are all charming enough and all, but it just seems like it's trying too hard much of the time.  For example, the major dream sequence towards the end: Lame.  Doesn't work, trying too hard.  Furthermore, the film as a whole just generally goes nowhere.  Considering these characters that's pretty much all that could happen, but it just really starts to drag after a while with no focus.  I guess my problem is I don't like the Coens as much when they're doing pure comedy. (And I'd probably have to pick 'Blood Simple' as their best movie, which is, of course, their most purely dramatic movie.  By the way, don't make the mistake of ignoring that film, as it seems like more than a few Coen fans have.  It's amazing.)  Frankly, I think their sorta inexplicable, oddball comedy works best when it's juxtaposed with the violence and darkness.  Though that's not all that's at the heart of 'The Big Lebowski's relative weakness, as I like both 'Raising Arizona' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' better than it as well and they're both really light hearted.  Still, though I don't think it requires any repeat viewings, 'The Big Lebowski' is definitely worth one look, anyway.  Even when they're pretty of the Coens can make something quite a bit different and more interesting than what you'll usually get at the movies.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>Fargo is close to perfect; multiple viewings only make it better.  Perhaps the Coen brothers decided that for their next effort they would just have fun.  Who knows?  But where Fargo is disciplined, structured, and perfectly timed, with well-drawn characters that live on the screen - The Big Lebowski seems lost from the opening credits, swerving around in a fog of passive stupidity, acted upon rather than acting.<br /><br />This, is course, is due to the nature of its protagonist, The Dude, played with convincing sloth by Jeff Bridges.  (Rumor has it that Bridges prepared for the part by smoking pot incessantly, drinking heavily, and going for days without changing his clothes - what a pro!)  To burn an entire sentence describing the action would be to squander perfectly good English words - this movie celebrates its pointlessness gleefully.  However, what it lacks in traditional film staples like motivation, characters worth caring about, development, and meaningful conflict, it returns in the form of quirkiness - and nobody does quirkiness quite like the Coen brothers.<br /><br />John Goodman is insufferable as Walter, the deranged vet.  Every second he's on screen, somewhere, somebody races to the bathroom.  As Donny, Steve Buscemi is hilarious - no one since Chaplin has made so much out of so little dialogue.  John Turturro is amazing as Jesus, the diabolical bowling maniac clad in purple.  Tara Reid's Bunny is compelling and visually pleasing, while the great Julianne Moore provides the movie with one of its most memorable scenes.  Naked except for a leather harness, and suspended high in the air above a massive canvas, she soars through space, hanging on a wire, frantically hurling paint as she goes.  Such a scene would make even an awful movie wonderful, and The Big Lebowski, while flawed, is not awful.<br /><br />The other truly sensational scene is the bowling dream, a Busby Berkeley-like hallucination The Dude has after being knocked unconscious.  This too is marvelous enough to redeem the picture.  No discussion of The Big Lebowski would be complete with a mention of the three Nihilists - painfully thin men dressed in black who hunt The Dude with their weapon of choice - ferrets.  Nobody will be seated during the horrifying throw-the-ferrets-into-the-bathtub scene!<br /><br />In short, there's enough fun here to make the trip worthwhile.  TBL is not a great movie, at times it's like the idea of a movie that's too lazy to get out of bed, but the Coen brothers are just so good, and so good at being funny, that the trip is always worthwhile - even if there's no destination.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>At his moment in the history of American film, I wonder if the Coen brothers aren't our most interesting filmmakers. Even their misses are more interesting than most other's hits. Of all their films, I personally believe that THE BIG LEBOWSKI is the finest film they have made yet. <p>If in MADAME BOVARY Flaubert attempted (and succeeded) at writing a novel without a heroine, in THE BIG LEBOWSKI the Coen brothers made a film without a hero. Jeff Bridges plays the title role of Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski, who isn't so much everyday as considerably below nondescript. He is poor, unambitious, unobtrusive, and unspectacular. His only goals in life appear to be bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. That "The Dude" could be the center of a motion picture seems spectacularly absurd. That the movie succeeds despite such humble assumptions is a testament both to the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges. I have long considered Bridges to be one of the most underrated performers in the movies today. Interestingly, it may be the movie in which he was most playing himself. I saw a segment of BIOGRAPHY on A&E on Jeff Bridges, and his wife mentioned that in this film he was pretty much playing himself, and, in fact, wore the clothes he wears in everyday life in much of it. Gotta love that.<p>On one level, this movie is absurd. Intentionally absurd.  The various elements, in the hands of lesser individuals than the Coen brothers, might fall apart into something dumb. Instead, they meld it into something remarkable. John Goodman's diatribes about the boys in Vietnam, or his dedication to the Jewish Sabbath (despite not being Jewish), or the many jokes about Nihilists, or Goodman's awe at being in the semi-presence (the man is unconsicious and in an iron lung) of a man who wrote most of the episodes of the TV show BRANDED, or John Turturro's absolutely demented turn as a Hispanic bowler, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's marvelous turn as the personal assitant to multi-millionaire Jeff Lebowski, or Sam Elliot as the seemingly omniscient "The Stranger" all are elements that improbably blend together to make an absolute masterpiece. Bizarrely, the more absurd the Coen Bros become, the better the film becomes. <p>The cast is as good as one can possibly imagine. Jeff Bridges, has I mentioned, is just perfect in the lead. John Goodman and Steve Buscemsi are just as good as his bowling partners/best friends. Goodman's frequent blow-ups are among the best moments in the movie. Tara Reid has gone on to larger roles since this film, but she has never been better than in the small but crucial role of Bunny Lebowski. Peter Stormare (notable before this as the more insane of the two murderers in FARGO, the one Frances MacDormand catches trying to put the leg of Steve Buscemi into a pulping machine) is just incredible as the leader of the "Nihilists." Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Ben Gazzara, and Juliane Moore all make a good movie even better. And Flea, of the Chilli Peppers, makes a small appearance as one of the Nihilists.<p>This is just a great film. It isn't just a must see, but a must see over and over. Few films of recent years have so many moments that I enjoy recalling as this one. And although OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU! and THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, the two films that have followed THE BIG LEBOWSKI, haven't been quite up to its level, I still look forward to a new Coen brothers film more than just about any other. <p>One other note. The music for this film is just incredible. One of the most striking moments occurs when the viewer is assaulted with a brutal version in Spanish of "Hotel California." It is worth noting that the person responsible for assembling the songs for the sound track was none other than T-Bone Burnett. Although O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? was not a great movie, it did feature a spectacular soundtrack. T-Bone Burnett was responsible for the music of both films.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I must admit, I think this tries very hard to be counter-cultural and it has really great actors in it, but alas it just didn't hit the mark for me.  It is a hollywood production at heart, even if it has quirky details.  So it was striving to be like an Indie film, sincerely striving.  That made it boring to me.  Nothing to savor.  This is the only Coen film that failed for me, as I am a big fan of their other work.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless your like lazy bowlers who get into improbably wierd adventures.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>A Movie I don't think I would watch again,despite watching it before and then a 2nd time, not because I couldn't understand it or wanted to but because I just did.

The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, and watching the teaser trailer made me think it was going to be another Kingpin, man. I wasn't wrong, but thankfully, it didn't focus that much on the bowling, dude. This film is a tad off the wall, man. The words "dude" and "man" are littered amongst the dialogue, you try to block it out, but they seem to emphasis the words each time they say it, dude. Seems to have a few reasonably "big" names, including John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and Tara Reid, but it doesn't seem appear to have that big a budget, man.<p>Jeff Bridges looks older and slightly greyer than the only other role I've seen him in, `Starman', dude. Steve Buscemi plays a quiet character: he gets ignored, he doesn't know what John Goodman is talking about most of the time and subsequently gets told to shut up, man. The classic line "dude where's my car" is uttered so obviously whoever made that, was watching this, dude. Julianne Moore's non-geographical accent gets on my nerves, and she just has to appear naked, man.<p>The phone seems to constantly ring in this, particularly in the first half, for no apparent reason, and no one seems to answer it - just there to get on the viewer's nerves, dude.<p>The scene with the naked chick being thrown up and down accompanied by high-pitched music - what exactly was all that about, man? A scene for the guys and what do the girls get, dude? John Goodman's stomach, man.<p>I laughed a couple of times, but the best bit was when John Goodman throws a bowling ball into the bad guy's nether regions, dude.<p>Judging by the ending, they must have run out of storyline, or money, man. Also, according to the back of this DVD, it was 98 minutes long, but its 116 minutes, and is listed as 127 minutes in a movie book, dude.<p>This film is a meandering series of events, vaguely connected, with no real ending, man. You definitely have to be stoned or drunk to watch this, and I was neither, dude.<p>Extras include a good teaser trailer; a very boring making of; and cast and filmmakers biogs, man.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>which, when you consider that against many other movies, ain't so bad. Nevertheless, I've seen 'em all and this is definitely their dud. As usual, the Coen Brothers are showing off their ability to create extremely strange characters, along with their signature blend of fantasy and reality, and nifty camera work. However, the plot is not all that coherent, and the characters, for all their oddity, are not that compelling. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out hippie leftover("the Dude") who, by way of having the same name as a millionaire, gets himself involved in one misunderstanding after another regarding the disappearance of the millionaire's wife. However, John Goodman steals the show as his bowling partner, a Vietnam vet with a hair trigger temper and a knack for springing into military style action when the Dude's passivity allows him. Together, they screw up one thing after another in trying to disentangle the Dude with the circumstances. What I imagine the Coen Brothers were trying to achieve here was to make the Dude into  some sort of modern Zen/Tao master/independent maverick who, by virtue of his ignorance and willingness to just let things happen to him, ekes himself out of intrigue. My belief that this is the aim of the movie is supported by Sam Elliot's narration of the story in a cowboy hat, attempting to assign some importance to the Dude's actions and style. It doesn't really all come together, really, 'cause theres nothing good about being "a dude", no matter what prism you filter him thru.<br />I'm no prude. But the f-word is bandied about so many times in this movie you get tired of hearing it. It was funny when the Soth Park kids did it, but here it grates. I imagine alot of people are going to think this is a great movie because of that and the lead character's casual and frequent pot use, and I suspect that those who thought this was one of the greatest movies theyve ever seen must have the same smoking habits as the Dude.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>After watching Fargo, I read about this movie and thought that I should see it because I just loved Fargo. But, this movie was very strange. Very strange and weird. The cast in this movie is simply amazing with Jeff Bridges, the brilliant John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jullianne Moore and John Turturro. But, the movie just didn't do it for me. It certainly had some good jokes and great acting but it had WAY TOO MANY CURSE WORDS and was just so weird. I mean, it's weird when you see a topless lady on a trampoline going up and down on the screen. And that happened a couple of times. Weird. Also, if you decide to watch this, make sure that you aern't sensitive towards the F word because it's used A LOT. I mean, there rarely is a sentence that John Goodman or Jeff Bridges doesn't use it. When they didn't, I was like: "Dude! It's a miracle!"<br /><br />So be prepared to hear a lot of naughty words. I mean hundreds and hundreds of them, every 10 seconds, you'll probably hear one. So, that kind of frustrated me. Also, the weirdness was like over the top. I mean it was so weird. When Jeff Bridges would be high and have those weird visions or when the topless lady would jump up and down. I mean there was some pointless and weird stuff. I guess when the dude thinks that he's flying is pretty funny.<br /><br />Anyway, now to the plot. The plot was about a guy named Jeffrey "the dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken with another Lebowski guy who is really rich. The dude gets really peeved when some guys mistake him for the rich Lebowski and pee on his rug. So, the due is mad. The dude is into doing drugs, drinking white russians, and bowling with his pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goddman). Donny is really funny and says really random stuff. Walter is a hot temepered Vietnam vet. When the rich Lebowski's wife is kidnapped, they ask the dude to deliver the ransom. But, Walter, Donny and the dude get into a lot of a mess with the kidnappers, the cops, a porn ring and some german wackos who threathen to remove the dude's "johnson". The plot is great and there are some good funny moments. Believe me, there are some good laughs. Walter's great as is the dude. But, Jesus (John Turturro) is really weird and pointless in the movie. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Busemi are all excellent in the movie. As is Jullianne Moore. But a lot of F words and a lot of random weird stuff make this one dissapointing. Personally, I feel that the Coen Brothers must have been on drugs while making this because it's very weird.<br /><br />"No, I'm the dude. Or his dudness o el duderino." That was hilarious as was Walter's hot temper and Donny's stupidity.<br /><br />But, the weirdness of this movie was just too overwhelming, the conclusion was gruesome and disgusting and could have been done differently (no biting needed) and I don't know about everyone else, but I don't like hearing the F word said SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!<br /><br />As the 2nd Coen Brothers movie that I have seen, I strongly recommend the masterpiece that is Fargo, but not this one. Well, I'm still going to give Barton Fink and Raising Arizona a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>What are you people who rave about this movie smoking.  It simply stunk, and I wasted a buck to rent it (not to mention an hour before I fell asleep).  My wife now refuses to let me rent anything.  (My last selection was Son of Rambow, so you see why).  What the hell - not funny, no plot, and who wants to watch an ugly guy walk around in boxers and an ugly bathroom.  Whoever gave this more than 1 star (I wish I could have given it 0) is an idiot!  The Coen Brothers have done some good work - Fargo and Old Men, but this one was a dud.</p></br><a href="../users/AB1UMC7SB9D7Z.html">AB1UMC7SB9D7Z</a><br/><p>This movie is very personal to me.  The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.<br /><br />That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent.  I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.<br /><br />First of all, the dialog specifically.  Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned.  This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible.  Was the dialog even written down?  Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character.  It's amazing to behold.<br /><br />Secondly, the storyline's general arch.  Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back.  In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly.  The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations.  Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully.  This movie could not have ended any other way.<br /><br />Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.  Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly.  Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.  Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.<br /><br />And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance.  This was long overdue.  I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.  Now we have all the more materials to use to love this work of art better than ever before!<br /><br />--PolarisDiB</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a hilarious comedy that disguises itself as something so simplistic, but ends up being nothing of the sort.  If you're looking for a movie with a meaning or a solid and concrete plot, this may be something to skip.  If you're looking for an out-of-control and outrageous comedy with memorable characters and some of the funniest lines ever to be spoken in film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is something that is definitely worth checking out.<p>The story revolves around a man by the name of Lebowski; actually, he prefers to be called &quot;The Dude.&quot;  A couple of thugs mistake him for a different Lebowski and ruin his most prized rug that really tied the room together.  Well, The Dude isn't going to stand for that kind of &quot;unchecked aggression&quot; (even if he is one of the laziest human beings on the planet).  When he tries to get the other Lebowski to compensate him for his ruined rug, well... let's just say things get very complicated.  And his psychopathic bowling buddy, Walter (who is also a Viet Nam Veteran), doesn't make things any better when he tries to help The Dude with his problems.  But hey, everything's gotta work out in the end, right?  He's The Dude!  He is the man... or at least he better hope so, for his sake.<p>This is one of my favorite comedies.  Although it is almost impossible for me to do the film justice by reviewing it, I have to because it is a movie that I love and watch on a daily basis.  The dialogue and characters are so entertaining and fun to watch that it is almost impossible not to become captivated by the film.  Jeff Bridges is amazing as The Dude and takes his role to the limit.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever and really steals the show for the majority of the film.  Even though he's only in the movie for a short amount of time, John Turturro is HILARIOUS in his two scenes.  The movie is brilliantly written and directed.  The Coen Brothers have made another gem; that much is for sure.<p>Be warned, this is no kiddy movie.  If you get easily offended by movies with foul language, STAY CLEAR FROM THIS MOVIE!!  Every other word in the movie is the f-word, and in fact, according to the IMDb, the f-word appears in the movie 267 times.  So please, take that under consideration.  As foul as this movie is, I think it's necessary and works perfectly for the movie.  It makes the characters what they are.  If you've ever seen the watered-down &quot;TV version&quot; of the movie, you'll know that it quickly loses its spark and appeal that was so well-established in the regular version.  The language is a necessity in this kind of environment, so it's better to avoid the movie if that's going to upset or offend you.<p>The DVD doesn't have a lot to offer, so I'm hoping that one of these days a fully-loaded special edition will come out.  Until then, this is what we're stuck with.  The picture and sound quality really shines in this movie.  You can watch the movie in widescreen or standard format.  Special features included are cast/crew information, a teaser trailer, and a 30 minute interview with the Coen Brothers.<p>&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a comedy to remember, although it's not a movie for everyone.  It's not a movie to watch if you're looking for something solid or with a standard formula to it.  The film is a wildly unpredictable journey into the unknown.  The film really does a great job of standing out from the other &quot;predictable&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; comedies that we are plagued with.  A five-star movie all the way.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>With the "The Big Lebowski," the Coen brothers may not have created a comedic room. But the characters and situations they concoct are endless fascinating. Jeff Lebowski, a 40-somethng slacker who calls himself "The Dude," has been confused with another Jeff Lebowski, who is a multi-millionaire with a high-spending wife. When thugs attack The Dude, thinking him to be the tycoon, an unlikely plot is set in motion in which The Dude is charged with coming up with the money the wife owes.<br /><br />TBL never stops spinning the unexpected. The Dude loves to bowl, and his team consists of an former Vietnam vet (John Goodman) and a hapless hanger-on (Steven Buscemi). Between them, the trio hardly has enough brain cells to flush the john, but lurch along, trying to save the girl while making some money or themselves. One things that's funny about the film: The Dude - pot-bound, vacuous and benign - emerges as the biggest adult. Goodman thinks he is the leader, but his wacky schemes almost always flop. Another funny thing is the gang of misfits the Coens assemble to tell their tale - a naked expressionist artists (Julianne Moore), a gang of gothy German nihilists, a mysterious cowboy (Sam Elliott) and a team of competitive bowlers led by a jumpsuit-clad man named  Jesus. What the film lacks in outright hilarity and topicality, it wins by the sheer audacity and skill of shaping this gang of weirdos into a semi-coherent storyline.<br /><br />Worth seeing, whatever it's about.</p></br><a href="../users/A25UZ7MA72SMKM.html">A25UZ7MA72SMKM</a><br/><p>There have been a few movies over time which have portrayed private eye characters that are quirky, or losers, or both ... but this one takes that concept out into left field and then keeps going into some completely unexplored area way beyond left field.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges ("the Dude") and John Goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco. Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in "The Big Lebowski" than I have in a long time during a movie.<br /><br />There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the "punch line" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh!<br /><br />Warning, after this movie you may experience strange sub-conscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>Hard to believe, but this is only the second time that I watched this marvellous shapeless flawed jewel of a failed master piece. I thought I must have watched it a dozen times. How else can I have told and quoted scenes and dialogues for the last 10 years? Imagine the surprise when details turn out differently from expectations, or rather from imagined recollections.<br />This is surely not the best movie ever made by the Coens, but it is such great fun.<br />What did the Dude say after 5 dips of his head in the toilet bowl, asked where the money was? Let me have another look, it must be in there somewhere. Or something like that.<br />What did he say when the gangster shows him the bowling ball and asks: what is this? No, he does not say: can't you see it is a golf ball. He says what I put in the headline.<br /><br />What made me watch it again today? First of all, watching Bridges as Bad Blake yesterday reminded me that I wanted to revisit Lebowski since some time. Second, I had a discussion in a comment thread around here about the fact that comedies age. Some that I remembered as hilarious from decades ago, like Polanski's vampire joke, or like Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, have on revisit turned out to have become stale. I wanted to check if Lebowski is stale already. Good news: it isn't! But it is a mess of a movie. Never mind, invest two hours of your time and enjoy it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>On the heels of their 1996 masterpiece of sly humor "Fargo", Joel and Ethan Coen made "The Big Lebowski". It lacked the intensity of the sharpest Coen brothers films and failed at the box office only to become a cult classic, basis of its very own subculture, and one of the Coens' most analyzed films. The world of "The Big Lebowski" is familiar territory: the Coen brothers like to play with the idea of a fundamentally disordered universe, the world of film noir with a darkly humorous edge. The humor in "The Big Lebowski" isn't as dark as usual, though, owing to the fact that its protagonist is a laid-back, aged hippie whose feathers don't ruffle easily, dropped into a Chandleresque mystery that boggles him about enough to annoy even a stoner peacenik.<br /><br />Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski by two thugs who break into his apartment, rough him up, and pee on his rug. As this is obviously unjust, the Dude decides to seek compensation from the other Mr. Lebowski, the rich old man whose young trophy wife apparently owes someone money. Mr. Lebowski (David Huddleton) is reluctant to pay up, but when his young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears and there is a ransom demand, he thinks the Dude is just the man to deliver the money. Being a basically agreeable fellow, the Dude agrees but inadvertently involves his bowling partner, a highly strung Vietnam vet named Walter (John Goodman), who is more a liability than a help. Meanwhile, the Dude's new rug is stolen.<br /><br />Even the pauses in the Dude's speech were scripted, but this is still one of the most memorable performances of Jeff Bridge's long and impressive career. The Dude is hilarious and endearing and wise without wanting to be. He wants to drink his White Russians and bowl. This is film noir without a noir protagonist. Instead of imploding in a fit of existential angst, the Dude reacts to the confusion and injustice by trying to go with the flow -or trying to ignore the issue. The world doesn't let him; it turns him into a reluctant detective. "The Big Lebowski" is replete with staples of film noir, from identity confusion to rapid dialogue. But the Dude offers a unique reaction to the dilemmas of a world that doesn't make sense. It's hilarious and, at the same time, an interesting perspective.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2008 10th Anniversary edition): The 10th Anniversary edition offers two featurettes, a comedic introduction to the film (4 ? min), Production Notes (text), and a theatrical trailer (2 ? min). "The Dude's Life" (10 min) interviews the cast about their characters and what made the Dude so popular. In "The Dude Abides: The Big Lebowski Ten Years Later" (10 min), the cast talks about the evolving perception of the film and about the dialogue. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`The Big Lebowski' has been hailed as one of the greatest cult classic films of our time, and I just might have to agree.  The Coen brothers rarely disappoint (honestly, `Intolerable Cruelty' was a mess but aside from that they usually strike gold) and `The Big Lebowski', while not their smartest film, may be one of their most entertaining.  In all honesty, `Fargo' is a better film, but nothing in `Fargo' can match the brilliance that is Jeff Bridges as the iconic `Dude'.<br /><br />So, `The Big Lebowski' centers around two men with the same name.  There is Jeffrey `The Dude' Lebowsky; a pot-smoking, White Russian drinking, unemployed slacker, and then there is Jeffrey `The Big' Lebowski, a handicapped multi-millionaire with a trophy wife named Bunny who has gotten herself in debt with some very dangerous men.  Those men, attempting to get their money, come after `The Dude', mistaking him for Bunny's husband.  Thus starts the tumble that is the Dude's involvement in a kidnapping scheme that pits him against some very strange (and albeit hilarious) people.  Teamed with his bowling buddies Walter and Donny, not to mention Lebowski's (the `Big' man) estranged daughter Maude, the Dude attempts to make some quick cash by playing as the go between for Lebowski and his wife's kidnappers.<br /><br />The plot is simple and doesn't work too hard to embellish itself, but the brilliant script work and the flawless acting help make for some of the funniest moments and most memorable dialog in recent memory.  John Goodman really works well with the Coen brothers.  His performance in `Barton Fink' is seriously one of my favorite supporting performances of all time, and here in `The Big Lebowski' he dominates as the Dude's best buddy Walter.  Buscemi (who is also a perennial Coen star) doesn't have as much to do as he did in `Fargo' but he makes the most of it.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is hilarious as Brandt; his facial expressions in the limo with the two Lebowski's is one of my favorite scenes in the film.  Tara Reid plays a variation of herself as Bunny, and Peter Storemare is hilarious as the Nihilist member of the techno pop band `Autobahn'.  The character of `The Big' Lebowski is a tad clich&eacute;d, but David Huddleston is hilarious enough to make up for that.  Julianne Moore is fantastic, and I mean that, as Maude.  I seriously am starting to change my opinion of this actress.  She has been lauded over and over and seriously up until this past week I didn't understand why, but her performance here (and more notable in `Short Cuts') is starting to change my mind.  Everything about her character play here is hilariously on point.<br /><br />But nothing compares to `The Dude'...nothing.  Jeff Bridges is in all honesty one of my favorite actors; he may even break top ten for me.  He just always sells it, even when he's not mind-blowing he has that consistency about his work to where it is always solid.  His performance here is not only solid, but it is mind-blowing.  Comedic-wise he just devours this film, becoming this character from this inside out.  He beautifully builds layers of apathy within a character that is deeper than his roots, but most importantly he understands the dialog and `how' his character would sell that dialog, and he soars.<br /><br />`The Big Lebowski' can be labeled another Coen triumph, to rest on the shelf along with `Fargo' and the more recent `No Country for Old Men' as iconic cinematic experiences that one shall not soon forget.</p></br></body></html>

Who am I to argue? Even after almost 50 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.I  I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!<br /><br />The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.<br /><br />The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown.<br /><br />The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.<br /><br />This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. You'll have fun watching this, too, I guarantee it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Still hilarious 50 years after its release, Some Like it Hot stays funny for 120 minutes by reinventing itself every half an hour or so and coming up with new ways to be funny--watch it if you haven't.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>2009 marks the 50th anniversary of this release by Billy Wilder.

In both capacities he won the Oscar award more than once.<br />No matter what film genre he tried, he delivered a remarkable opus.<br />He had filmed many outstanding comedies as "The 7th Year Itch" (1955), "The Apartment" (1961) and "Irma la Douce" (1963); also deep human drama as "Sunset Blvd" (1951) or a WWII German POW camp "Stalag 17" (1953).<br />Almost all of them were big box office hit at their release.<br /><br />Obviously Wilder had the knack for comedic genre. The three films above mentioned and the present one are more than eloquent support of this quality.<br /><br />The story is as follows: in 1929 two innocent musicians involuntary see mobsters massacring mobsters. The killers try to eliminate them as dangerous witness.<br />So Joe & Jerry are on the run. They desperately look for a way to evade Chicago and save their skins. Miraculously there is a Girls Orchestra departing for Miami and two members suddenly desert them. Joe & Jerry quickly mutate to Josephine & Daphne and join the gang.<br />An unforgettable ride starts then and there. Sequences on the train connecting Chicago & Miami are anthological.<br />Joe/Josephine falls in love with sculptural singer Sugar Kane, but he is a "she" and barred to propose openly, so a tantalizing game is engaged.<br />Parallel to these events Daphne/Jerry is courted by a millionaire infatuated by "her" charms.<br />Crowning all this madness the Mob move into Miami for a Convention, doggedly followed by Detective Mulligan and the "witness hunt" reassume.<br /><br />Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Joe E. Brown give their best, building one of the best cinematographic comedies of all times!<br />George Raft as the classic Boss and Pat O'Brien as the Detective make their contribution.<br />I must make a special mention to the more than good black & white photography delivered by Charles Lang, who was eighteen times Oscar nominated and only once awarded between 1931 and 1973.<br /><br />If you like comedies do not let this one pass by!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TV6SBCWT7P8S.html">A2TV6SBCWT7P8S</a><br/><p>Recently this movie topped the list of the American Film Institute's top 100 funniest movies ever made. After having seen this a few times I am inclined to agree with them. This movie, quite simply, is the funniest movie ever made! Directed by the legendary director Billy Wilder, with great performances by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe, and with a fantastic plot and script, movies don't get any better than this!<p>Essentially, Some Like it Hot is about two musicians who are forced to flee after having witnessed a gang murder. In order to get jobs and escape the gangsters, they dress up as women and participate in an all-girls band. The results are sidesplitting as the two men attempt to maintain their act in the midst of a trainful of beautiful girls, having to dance with really strange guys, and finally when around the beautiful Monroe. <p>The acting is great, the script is hysterical, and the situations can never be equaled. This is really America's funniest movie, and if you haven't already seen it - what are you waiting for?</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 7/12<br />Rate: 8<br /><br />7/12: Billy Wilder had a knack for turning his films into gold, and Some Like It Hot was one of them. Maybe it's the writing...maybe it's the direction...maybe it's the performances...maybe it's everything. This one was pretty much performance driven. However, I found the storyline to be weak and uneven at times. Whenever the mob guys showed up, Some Like It Hot wasn't what I hoped for overall. When the attention was shifted back to the trio, it's a very, very funny picture. Of the three, Jack Lemmon gave the best performance. Tony Curtis was always a talented actor and earned his due respect with his work. Marilyn Monroe was fair but largely buoyed by the two male leads. In fact, I can't really think of a film that she was a standout, alone from the rest of the cast. Let's not forget one more great performance: Joe Brown as Osgood Fielding III. All in all, Some Like It Hot is a funny picture, but I feel the mob angle took too much away from the central focal point of the comedy as the audience can see the rest of the band outright disappeared after the train. AFI had voted the film as the greatest comedy of all time. Please...</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>One of the funniest movies ever made.  To see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag is in itself, sweet, but the whole story is side-splitting.  Jack's and Tony's characters must dress as women and join a girls' band to escape being massacred by mobsters.  Marilyn is one of the band members and immediately starts getting very chummy with them, explaining all kinds of personal information under the category of "girl talk."  These two men are drooling over her and she is none the wiser. Then a wealthy elderly man (Joe E Brown) falls in love with one of the "girls" and his attempts to seduce "her" is hilarious. You must re-view this film every few years to have a "complete life."</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing and storyline!<br /><br />Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in Florida!</p></br><a href="../users/AT07UZQQR7ZEH.html">AT07UZQQR7ZEH</a><br/><p>On a recent Saturday night, in a back bedroom at my parents' house, I was feeling so lonely and desolate.  I realized how Marilyn Monroe might have actually committed suicide, even in the middle of an otherwise very happy week.  I put a restored studio print of Billy Wilder's SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) into my DVD player.  Within one minute after the opening credits, I was smiling.  At the 20 minute reel change, I was actually feeling happy over the audacious blend of B&W gangster drama and snappy Roaring 20's comedy.  By the time Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis were in drag on the train going to Florida, as part of an all girls band with Marilyn Monroe, I was laughing out loud and feeling wonderful.<br /><br />? Recently voted the #1 Best Comedy of all Time by the American Film Institute, HOT just might be the funniest movie you'll ever see.  Lemmon (Best Actor Oscar nominee) and Curtis are in incredible form as "Daphne" and "Josephine", hiding out in Sweet Sue's all girl band after being witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929 Chicago.  Marilyn, as Sugar Kane, has a comic field day (and deserved an Oscar nomination also) sharing a train upper berth with Daphne, a romantic tryst on a yacht with Curtis as an oil millionaire, and three wonderful songs.  Meanwhile, Daphne does a mean tango (and gets engaged!) with Joe E. Brown as a millionaire staying at the Florida hotel.  (Location filming was done at San Diego's evocative Victorian era  Hotel Del Coronado.)  And note the songs that Monroe sings and how each is darker than the previous one:  "Running Wild", "I Want to Be Loved By You", and "I'm Through With Love."  The lady is just incandescent, helped by Oscar-winning Orry-Kelly gowns.<br /><br />The screenplay here (another of the film's six total Oscar nominations), by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, is incomparable.  The plot is expertly constructed, and every line of dialogue is either hysterically funny or a reaction to something hysterically funny.  I have never seen Curtis this good (playing three different roles in the performance of his career), Marilyn this delectable, or Lemmon this pricelessly funny.  But Joe E. Brown also gives the performance of a lifetime as he tangos with Lemmon's Daphne and does not care that Daphne is really a man.  And George Raft and Pat O'Brien have field days sending up their 1930's Warner Bros. screen images.  It is little touches, like Raft ready to smash a grapefruit in a gang member's face near the film's end.  Comedies just don't get any funnier than SOME LIKE IT HOT, or better constructed and with such complex characters.<br /><br />And the Oscar-nominated B&W cinematography and art direction/set decoration are exquisite in their shadings of inky black, blinding white, and a dozen shades of gray. This is one of the most visually beautiful B&W movies I have ever seen, especially in a remastered print.<br /><br />Finally, this special edition of SOME LIKE IT HOT that cheered me up so much on Saturday night and that I am reviewing has almost 90 minutes of wonderful bonus material:  a lengthy chat with Leonard Maltin and Tony Curtis (who looks better now than in 1959); a fond reminiscence of the fabulously funny, never-topped train sequence by four surviving members of the Sweet Sue band; a Virtual Hall of Memories that has literally dozens of production stills taken on the set (including glimpses of the drag makeup in color and why the movie had to be shot in B&W); and original theatrical trailers for not just this Billy Wilder masterpiece, but also half a dozen other Wilder movies.  They will give you a glimpse at how much HOT has been restored visually and aurally.<br /><br />Is SOME LIKE IT HOT really the greatest comedy of all time?  There are so many other favorites of mine fighting for the same title, including TOOTSIE, DR. STRANGELOVE, something silent with Chaplin or Keaton or Lloyd, and especially Stanley Kramer's incomparable IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD.  But HOT is probably in my top five as an enduring masterpiece, now and always.  Watch this beautiful studio print DVD, the one with the bonuses, and feel wonderful toward the whole human race.  You will be laughing and giggling for days afterwards.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This is Billy Wilder's comic masterpiece. I have loved this movie ever since I saw it on TV as a child in the sixties. Starting with a clever script co-written with his longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, Wilder has concocted a fast-paced farce set in 1929 that encompasses Chicago speakeasies, geriatric Florida millionaires, men in drag and of course, Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators. This 1959 classic brings these disparate elements together into something quite serendipitous, peaking both as a whip-smart comedy with zingy one-liners and as a bracing look at mistaken identities, sexual and otherwise.<br /><br />Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon portray Joe and Jerry, a couple of out-of-luck musicians on the lam from Spats Columbo, a kingpin gangster who stages the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, which of course through a cruel twist of fate, the boys witness. They go undercover as Josephine and Daphne to join Sweet Sue's all-girl band for an engagement in a fancy Florida beach hotel. Chaos ensues from the minute they do the gender switch and get entangled with ukulele-strumming Sugar Kane (ne&eacute; Kowalcyzk) on the train and later with a smitten aged tycoon named Osgood E. Fielding in Florida. Of course Spats and his thugs re-enter the picture, and then the chase starts anew. There are so many rib-tickling scenes that it's hard to choose the best, but for my money, top honors go to the out-of-control party in Daphne's upper berth on the train, Daphne's maraca-shaking enthusiasm in accepting Osgood's marriage proposal, and the cross-cutting between Daphne and Osgood's increasingly carnal tango and Joe's faked impotency as a sex-trap for Sugar aboard Osgood's yacht under the guise of Junior, the supposed scion of the Shell Oil fortune.<br /><br />Curtis is a revelation as Joe/Josephine/Junior, showing real skill as a farceur and playing off his matinee-idol looks to great effect. I love how Wilder sets him up as the snarkier of the two as Joe but then as the more conservative one when he turns into Josephine. His Cary Grant imitation as Junior is also spot-on hilarious. Lemmon is at his comedic zenith as Jerry/Daphne in what has to be one of the funniest performances ever captured onscreen. Almost every line he utters puts me in a state of hysteria, and the joy is in how he plays Daphne intially with a giggly insecurity but then finds confidence and a cathartic release in being a woman. The interplay between Curtis and Lemmon is synchronized like a fine instrument, and what's more, neither thankfully goes the standard burlesque route as women.<br /><br />Although she is top-billed due to her stature at the time, Marilyn Monroe really plays the subordinate role of Joe's love interest as Sugar, but she makes the most of a relatively decorative part. Looking yummy and exuding her unparalleled star charisma, she is sexy, funny (Wilder hands her some surprisingly sharp lines to deliver) and when she is getting the "fuzzy end of the lollipop" within the context of Sugar's implied alcoholism, Monroe is quite touching. When she is onscreen, you can't take your eyes off of her, her legend assured, especially looking zaftig in her shimmering gowns and seductively singing three numbers of the era in her inimitable, whispering fashion. Wide-mouthed Joe E. Brown steals all his scenes as Osgood, and George Raft brings his familiar tough-guy style to Spats, the type of role he has probably played more than a dozen times in his career. This is likely Wilder's best film if only for the fact that he assembled the perfect cast for a perfectly realized comedy based on the most contrived of concepts. A must-see with of course, the classic ending line, "Nobody's perfect!".</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q13PHEXGR48Q.html">A2Q13PHEXGR48Q</a><br/><p>Some Like it Hot is a classic comedy that fully deserved the nod as the #1 comedy of all-time according to the American Film Institute.  Joe and Jerry are two down on their luck musicians in Chicago who cannot find a job.  When they accidentally witness a gangland murder, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the musicians must find a way out of town.  Disguised as women, Josephine and Daphne, the two join an all-girl band heading to Florida.  Joe takes a liking to one of the band members, Sugar, and Jerry must deal with an old millionaire who falls in love with him.  What follows is some of the funniest stuff ever put on the screen.  With a great cast, a perfect script, and a jazzy musical score, Some Like it Hot is a can't miss movie.  If you haven't seen it, buy this movie.  It will keep you rolling around on the ground throughout.<br /><br />  Marilyn Monroe shows some of her comedic ability, along with other abilities, as Sugar Kane, a ukelele-playing singer in the band searching for a young millionaire to marry.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are perfectly cast as Joe, "Josephine," and Jerry, "Daphne," two musicians who must disguise themselves as women to escape the wrath of the mob.  The chemistry and dialogue between Curtis and Lemmon is the high point of the movie.  Joe E. Brown is excellent as Osgood Fielding III, a persistent millionaire who takes a liking to Daphne.  George Raft plays mob boss Spats Colombo with Mike Mazurki and Harry Wilson as his henchmen.  The movie also stars Pat O'Brien, Nehemiah Persoff, Joan Shawlee, and Dave Barry.  The Special Edition DVD offers widescreen presentation, "A Nostalgic Look Back" a great 30-minute interview with Tony Curtis and Leonard Maltin, "The Sweet Sues" a featurette with interviews from members of the all-girl band, an extensive interactive photo gallery, a pressbook gallery, a Some Like it Hot trailer, and trailers from six other Billy Wilder movies.

Now assuming the identies of Daphne and Josephine, romance, the mob and utter confusion collide to create one of the sweetest comedies of all time.<br /><br />Just the ending is worth the price of the film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>This is the top comedy on the AFI listing, which you could take to mean that it's the best comedy ever written as far as the AFI is concerned. Certainly it touches on many very interesting points, especially for a black and white movie from 1959. First, it puts Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in the roles of women for the entire film, pretty much. They have to deal with sexism, pinching, and all the rest. It's very much a movie about the things women have to go through.<br /><br />That being said, the movie also makes very light of women. The women's band isn't supposed to be any good - it's a lowest-of-the-low novelty that Marilyn only went to in order to escape men using her. The girls all crave alcohol constantly, and Marilyn's main object is to find a rich millionaire to take care of her.<br /><br />Unfortunately for her, her two new "female friends" of course are men. One promptly begins pretending to be a millionaire solely to get in bed with her. The other is forced to seduce a *real* millionaire in order to cover for his friend.<br /><br />It is really amazing to think this movie was out in the 1950s. In current times, we think of the 50s as tame periods with parents sleeping in separate beds and kids being sweet and respectful. Just take a look at Marilyn Monroe's outfits! Those would be rather risque in modern times, never mind back then.<br /><br />It is extremely interesting to hear the interactions about what men and women can and cannot do, and about the nature of relationships. There are many very intriguing and "under the cover" commentaries going on, in the guise of comedy and lightheartedness. You have to wonder how many people left the theater and had just a tiny bit more open mind than they did when they went in. It's certainly not of the same level as many other movies I have seen - but again, this was the 50s. That they could have done it at all, and had it been widely accepted, is quite an achievement.<br /><br />A must-see to get a sense of where many modern movies got their start.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Long before "Tootsie" and "Mrs. Doubtfire", Wilder gave us this comic, gender-bending masterpiece, which came at the very end of the conservative `50s, providing a preview of the more liberated decade to come. Here the director is in pure comedy mode, and pulls off a tricky premise brilliantly. Lemmon and Curtis make an ideal comic duo, Monroe sparkles as the object of their sisterly affections, and Joe E. Brown nearly steals the picture as a dotty millionaire besotted with Lemmon's Daphne. A howl, truly.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Billy Wilder shows us once more his great skills as director.

This starting point will origin a progressive mistake comedie when they decide escape from a sure death, dressing femenine clothes.<br />Never before in the cinema there has been such a lot of laughable situations and suggestive jokes.

Also included is a Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but one wonders if a dialog-heavy film like this should really need a surround soundtrack.  Dialogs in both the mono and the 5.1 tracks sound perfectly clear and understable.  The surround sound only comes into use during the occasional music and gunfight sequences.  I do applaud the inclusion of the original mono track, which quite a few recent DVDs of older movies do not provide in the hope of enticing new DVD owners with 5.1 audio.<p>The video transfer looks great -- images are sharp, levels of black look realistic (you can clearly see and feel the velvety texture of a black robe Monroe wears), signs of wear and tear are virtually non-existent.  The picture aspect ratio is 1.66:1, which is not the 1:85:1 ratio used for the original US theatrical release and for all previous US letterboxed laserdisc releases.  The 1.66:1 ratio adds a little picture to the top, but doesn't really affect the composition.  The video is also non-anamorphic, so the resolution is not as high on a widescreen TV as it would be with an anamorphic DVD.  There is also no English optional subtitles, but there are yellow optional French and Spanish ones.<p>I would have gladly paid a higher price if they had included better supplementary material on the Special Edition DVD, such as the audio commentary and home movies that were put on the Criterion laserdisc made in the early 90s.  The extras on the Special Edition DVD include a lively but superficial 30-minute new interview with Tony Curtis reminiscing about the film, a rather uninteresting 12-minute interview with the actresses who played the girl band members, a segment called &quot;Virtual Hall of Memories&quot; that is essentially a still gallery, and trailers of 7 Wilder films including SOME LIKE IT HOT; all the trailers are in poor video condition.  The most interesting extra is a reproduction of a pressbook for the film, but the pictures are blurry and the smaller text is illegible.  I am disappointed that we never get to hear from Jack Lemmon or Billy Wilder, both still alive, on this DVD.  These extras are not impressive, so one may consider buying the movie-only edition for a cheaper price.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Billy Wilder's most popular comedy finally receives the deluxe treatment it deserves. MGM previously released this classic comedy in a nonanamorphic widescreen version a couple of years back. While that edition looked pretty decent this anamorphic transfer puts any previous editions (including my much favored laserdisc edition) to shame. Wilder's comedy operates as a spoof of gangster films and a comedy about gender roles. Jerry (the late Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis) are two musicians on the lam when they witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. With Spats Columobo (George Raft) and his men looking for the duo they go undercover as musicians cross dressing and joining an all female band headed for a gig in Florida. Becoming a woman allows Joe/Josephine to spent time with Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) the latest woman that catches Joe's fancy. Jerry/Daphne  on the other hand finds himself romanced by a rich man (Joe E. Brown) who won't take the hint as Jerry tries to blow off his advances.<br /><br />And you thought the 50's were tame. One of Wilder's richest 50's comedies "Some Like It Hot" continues to be very funny inverting our expectations constantly and playing with the roles that Jerry and Joe take on with their new identities. Joe's eyes open the most as before he was a pretty ruthless womanizer. Becoming a woman puts him in the crosshairs of every male insight and he's on the receiving end of all the smirks, comments and passes that he would have used with Sugar before his change. Wilder mixes social commentary so deftly with comedy (like Hitchcock's work with suspense and social commentary) that at his best--and he's at his best here--it reminds us how entertaining a movie can be without being heavy handed. It's also filled with some marvelous in jokes (for example Colombo played by George Raft observes a thug flipping a coin and comments, "Where did you pick up that cheap trick?" Raft of course did the exact thing in one of his signature roles in "Scarface" from 1932).<br /><br />A great movie looks even better in this sharp looking transfer. The black and white imagery of the film looks gorgeous. Originally Marilyn Monroe lobbied to have the film shot in color which Billy Wilder felt wouldn't work for this comedy (he persuaded her to agree to shoot in black and white when he showed her make up tests for Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in color where their make up as women made them look slightly green) while the film certainly would have looked great in color the sumptuous cinematography by Charles Lang ("The Magnificent Seven", "Wait Until Dark") looks extremely good in this wonderful looking transfer. Detail is quite good and blacks are solid with a nice array of different textures evident in the transfer. Audio is presented in the original mono and sounds fine.<br /><br />For those that are into such things the special features here are a huge improvement over the previous edition. We get a commentary track compiled from comments by the late Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and I.A.L. Diamond's son (working with the comedy writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel--honestly I could have thought of better writers to pair with Diamond's son). While the insights aren't exactly a revelation it is an enjoyable commentary track.<br /><br />We also get two terrific documentaries on the making of the film. The first features a mixture of new and older interviews from the cast and crew. The second documentary "The Legacy of `Some Like it Hot'" is packed with trivia about the making of the film, Wilder & Monroe's relationship on the set and the difficult time Wilder had making the film with his leading lady including footage shot in the 80's of Wilder and Diamond.<br /><br />Finally we get "Memories from the Sweet Sues" featurette with members of the women who played in the band, an interview with Tony Curtis entitled "Nostalgic Look Back" where Curtis reveals that actor/voice artist Paul Frees did much of his voice as Josephine because he had difficulty reaching the high voice. We also get the imaginatively titled but unimpressive "Virtual Hall of Memories 3-D Tour"  The original pressbook appears on the DVD as well and we get reproductions of various lobby cards.  Finally we get previews and the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Far more impressive than the lackluster previous DVD releases "Some Like It Hot" looks solid in this re-release although the film could look a bit more vibrant. The featurettes are, for the most part, very good and the compiled commentary track adds loads of trivia (some of which is duplicated in the featurettes) about the making of the film. I do wish that a film historian such as UCLA professor Howard Suber had been involved in some way to help provide context for the movie but that's just personal preference. A fine release that could have been great with a wee bit more effort on the part of Sony/MGM.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D.html">A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D</a><br/><p>In 1929 during the St. Valentines Day massacre, two traveling musicians, witness one of the hits initiated by the mob.  The only way the duo can think of to avoid being discovered is to join an all female band playing in Florida as women.  Joe is looking forward to the gig, so that he can spend more time with Sugar while Jerry is horrified to find himself fighting off the advances of a rich suitor.  Joe the consummate womanizer finally gets to see what it is like to be on the other side of the coin to see what he has been dishing out for years.<br /><br />Many see this as a ground breaking movie especially for the 1950's with the theme of cross dressing and gender roles, but I just enjoyed Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon giving some of the best comedic performances of their careers, and Marilyn Monroe shining her brightest.  It is laugh out loud funny, and a movie you will watch over and over again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the MGM Special Edition DVD of "Some Like It Hot".....<br /><br />MGM..I have one word for your transfer of this great classic to<br />DVD..."ZOWEEEEE!" What a terrific package you have put together of this 1959 Black and White treasure.  Thank You!<br /><br />Like Marilyn herself, this film is irresistably charming. The immortal lines, the fabulous cast and the wonderful direction by Billy Wilder makes for non-stop fun. It's a film that will be enjoyed for years to come now on DVD and by the whole family.<br /><br />The time is 1929. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are struggling musicians who happen to witness a murder, in a garage, on St Valentines day. The mob lead by "Spats"(George Raft) is after them. Their only hope is to hide out with a traveling band. The band happens to be an all girls band. The guys, don women's clothing(and look scrumptious) and bunk in with the gals,<br />including the very sweet and sexy "Sugar"(Monroe) and the fun begins. From the moment they spy Sugar ("When she moves, it's like Jell-o on springs")they loose their hearts and so do we.<br />Tony falls for Marilyn("I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop"), Joe E. Brown("Zoweee!") falls for Jack, and the thugs are hot on their trail. You just won't want it to end, and even when it does you'll find yourself smiling just thinking of it.For sure it is the "sweet end of the lollipop".<br /><br />As I mentioned  MGM has put together one terrific package. The transfer in the theatrical release widescreen(1.66:1), the black and white film is sharp and clear, and the sound remastered in DD5.1 surround is a most welcomed enhancement.(It may also be viewed in the original mono if you choose).There are also some additional perks. The special features include an interivew with Tony Curtis by Leonard Maltin. Tony seems to be just as<br />enthusiastic talking about it now as he must have been while filming(But FYI for parents of young kids, the interivew is PG),<br />there's a featurette of "Memories from the Sweet Sues"( remember Joan Shawlee's great line..."....every girl in my band is a virtuoso - and I intend to keep it that way"), and much more(see tech info for complete list of extras). It also may be viewed in French or Spanish(mono) and has subtitiles in those languages  as well.<br /><br />An wonderful edition to any DVD library. I highly recommend this DVD of this definitive "screwball comedy". It's well worth the money. And I leave you with Joe E. Brown's immortal line....."Nobody's Perfect!"...enjoy...Laurie<br /><br />VHS:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VTFZQ">Some Like It Hot</a><br /><br />also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BK8DS0">Marilyn Monroe: Diamond Collection</a></p></br><a href="../users/A3EUSH8DPW75LR.html">A3EUSH8DPW75LR</a><br/><p>SOME LIKE IT HOT is a classic for many reasons.  The film may seem a little dated to some viewers but what keeps it forever great and irresistible are the superb performances by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe.  Filming it in black and white helped greatly to believe the two men being accepted as women.  And it also helped make Marilyn stand out even more with her effervescent and transcendent beauty.  But when looking at a blu ray version of a film that has seen much life on dvd a buyer must know if double dipping is really worth it.  Especially where SOME LIKE IT HOT came out with a superb dvd transfer years ago.<br /><br />To put it simply, the film honestly looks and sounds great on blu ray and is a vast improvement over even its best dvd transfer.  There is much clarity improvement in the video and the crispness in detail is vivid.  Facial closeups are particular standouts.  The black and white ratio is perfect and the film has not been overly enhanced or tried to be cleaned up as blu rays often are.  The intended grainess is still there which adds character to the film.  But seeing Tony and Jack in their female getup with the picture so clear is amazing and nothing can surpass how Marilyn comes across in this blu ray version.  When she first walks by the train and the steam comes out you know what picture perfection you are in for.  And every time her face appears, be it out of a train sleeping bunk or just entering a scene you can see every feature and fine detail of her face in all its glory.  The picture takes on its own life when she is singing I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU.  Just the spotlight highlighting her face whenever she sings is your proof of the blu ray improvement.  The sensual gift and aura that was Marilyn Monroe takes full advantage of the blu ray.<br /><br />And the audio is a huge improvement.  The audio now is in a DTS Master 5.1 and the sound will come out all your speakers gloriously.  And again the highlights are Marilyn's songs.  Sadly the extras here are exactly the same as on the last dvd release.  Luckily the retail price of this film is not high.  Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and particularly Marilyn give career highlight performances and it is amazing to believe the difficulties they had filming due to Marilyn's insecurities.  With this film you get a fun farce with endearing performances that stand the test of time.  And the blu ray is a must if you are a fan of the film or anyone in it.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>Marilyn Monroe is my all time hero, but even I have to admit I don't like all her movies. Some Like it Hot is a comedy that anybody can enjoy time and again. The reason it was shot in black and white (for those who don't know) was because Jack and Tony's makeup gave their faces a greenish tint on color film. The jokes, one liners, and slapstick make this a classic that will live forever. The last line of the movie makes a stand as one of the all time greatest gags.<p>You better believe Marilyn sings in this one too. 'I wanna be loved by you', 'I'm through with love', and my favorite 'Running Wild' show her singing talents that she was never appreciated for in her day. <p>In the tradition of the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, and Laurel and Hardy, this movie has withstood the harshest test of all movies, time.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two musicians from Chicago that witness St. Valentine's Day Massacre, which the mob is fully aware of.  The two musicians must skip town to save their lives and they decide to join a female band that is going to Florida.  This is where Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon) appear.  On the train ride to Florida they both meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) who they both find immensely attractive, but their situation does not allow them to openly express their feelings for her.  Some Like It Hot is an interesting film because it flirts with issues of homosexuality, but also gender identity.  The structure of the film conceals these issues in a clever manner, since it would probably not be very politically correct to address these issues in 1959 when homosexuality was considered a mental illness by doctors and mental health professionals.  The film is a brilliant comedy that offers many laughs and also pondering for those who need contemplative meditation.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>This film is automatically on any list of greatest comedies and is, in fact, ranked #14 among the American Film Institute's of "America's Greatest Movies," period. Although nominated for seven Academy Awards, it received only one (Orry-Kelly deservedly for Best Costume Design) which I think is ridiculous. This may well be Wilder's greatest achievement. It has lost nothing since first released in 1959. The basic situation is that two struggling musicians, Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemon)  inadvertently witness gangland murders reminiscent of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and flee the bloody scene, fearing for their own lives. Desperate, they disguise themselves as women (Josephine and Daphne) and join Sweet Sue's All-Girl Orchestra. Joe/Josephine is immediately attracted to Sugar Kane, (Who wouldn't be?) The situation is  complicated by Osgood Fielding III's attraction to Jerry/Daphne. Fielding is played by Joe E. Brown to whom Wilder gives the best line as the film ends. Gender-reversals, cross-dressing, and all the confusions and double entendres they permit are brilliantly coordinated by Wilder as we follow the development of several different relationships.<p>Over the years, Wilder's impact on other directors is evident in films such Tootsie (directed by Sydney Pollack) and Mrs. Doubtfire (Chris Columbus), both of which are highly entertaining but neither of which has the depth and cohesion which Some Like It Hot does. Of course, there are several precedents such as various Shakespeare comedies and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. In almost all of Wilder's films, there is an edge (sometimes a very sharp edge) with which he locates and reveals human imperfections with surgical skill. (The Apartment offers an excellent case in point as does.) My own take on this film is that whatever social satire it contains is subordinate to initiating and then sustaining what many would call a "romp" or "sex farce." Few other directors have Wilder's range. I find it almost incomprehensible that the same person who directed this film, Some Like It Hot, also directed Five Graves to Cairo (1943), The Lost Weekend (1945), and Sunset Boulevard (1950). <p>The DVD version obviously  offers clearer image and sound but also supplementary material which I also appreciate, notably the &quot;A Look Back&quot; documentary with Leonard Maltin and Tony Curtis as well as the Sweet Sues Featurette (The All-Girl Band) which provide a context within which to appreciate even more this uniquely entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are two musicians in 1929 Chicago; by accident they witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre. To avoid detection by the gangsters that are after them, they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girls band headed for Florida. In the band is Marilyn Monroe, and Curtis falls in love with her. Joe E. Brown is a rich playboy in Florida who falls for Lemmon in drag.<br /><br />It's one madcap scene after another as Billy Wilder puts all the principals through their paces. The script is brilliant - always suggestive but never crass. Monroe, a bane for the others to have to work with, was a knockout to look at in those gowns she wears. George Raft is the gangster heavy, and he's got two inside jokes that are terrific: the coin flip from SCARFACE and the grapefruit-in-the-puss bit from the Cagney movie THE PUBLIC ENEMY. That great music is provided by Matty Matlock and the best of the 1950s west coast jazzmen. Everything is done just right here; there's not a single false move. It's all wonderful fun and top-notch entertainment. Definitely worth a watch. (Brown has the classic last line.)</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>When Hollywood started making the lists of the Greatest Movie of All Time, or the Greatest Comedy of All Time, etc.--I was skeptical: how could any person or group really decide those honors after a century of films?<br />(And I've never forgotten that THE EXORCIST was left off the AFI Greatest Films list, which is a crime when you consider that overrated films like FARGO did make the list).<br /><br />But I didn't have a problem when SOME LIKE IT HOT was voted as the Best Comedy of All Time.<br />It's a funny idea, it's got an incredible cast (Jack Lemmon still makes me laugh out loud--especially his scene with Marilyn Monroe in the bunk on the train), and it still works.<br /><br />I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, so my personal favorite comedy is NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, but I won't disagree that SOME LIKE IT HOT should be at the top of the list.<br /><br />I'm laughing just thinking of my favorite lines.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H2JJ3GEMJN1.html">A13H2JJ3GEMJN1</a><br/><p>SOME LIKE IT HOT has been called the greatest comedy movie of all time. That's a pretty big niche to fill and, let's face it, individual opinions will vary. I have several personal favorites. THE GREAT RACE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, HARVEY, TOOTSIE, IT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD and A SHOT IN THE DARK come to mind, and I could name some others. Nor do I try to rank them in any particular order. I love them all, and this one sits right up there with them all on my shelf.<p>Individual favorites aside, this film is just very funny. Curtis and Lemmon are wonderful together as two down-on-their-luck musicians who find themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time and, disguised as women, join an all-girl band to get out of Chicago. Could these guys pull off such a stunt in real life? Probably not, but that doesn't make the situation any less humorous. Hysterical scenes and great lines abound. Monroe brings just the right amount of coquettishness and vulnerability to provide a center of gravity for all the madcap antics going on around her. At just over two hours in length, it's somewhat longer than your average comedy, but there's no reason for that to be a problem with a movie as entertaining as this one. <p>SOME LIKE IT HOT isn't my all-time favorite comedy, but it's a genuine classic and one I'm happy to have in my collection. In addition, this DVD has some nice extras, including a 30 minute interview with Curtis, the movie's only surviving star. The one drawback is that the movie was filmed in black-and-white, but for anyone who likes classic comedies, this is one DVD you want to have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>Some Like It Hot (Referred to as SLIH) the best film Billy Wilder ever made. He is one of the classic directors Hollywood has ever produced and he assembled the best cast and crew ever in this film. Voted as the American Films Institutes number one best comedy of all time. SLIH is the peek of comedy at its best.<p>With a cast that includes my favorite actor of all time - the late Jack Lemon - Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis, SLIH is a hysterical romp of the twenties that show two musicians running from Chicago mobsters because they saw a crime (a killing) being committed. The antics of these two musicians leads them to a three-week stint in an All Girl band. So, they dress for the occasion. Let me tell you - there nothing more funny then seeing Jack Lemon in drag. And with Curtis as the Straight-Man (I mean Straight-Women) as his sidekick - the laughs are large.<p>Marilyn sings up a storm in this one and plays a not-so-bright blonde who is trying to stay away from Saxophone players. (They keep dumping her.) The scam works until Curtis falls in love with Sugar (Monroe) and then has to play another phony - a rich millionaire with a yacht.<p>The DVD extras are very cool. There is a great interview with Tony Curtis on the making of the film. He is the only surviving cast and crewmember left. There is also a great interview with four of the girls in the band. They all talk about Marilyn's problems and issues and the fact that working with Billy Wilder was the best thing they had ever done. There is also a photo retrospective with a lot of behind the scenes shots.<p>This is a must for those fans of the comedy film. This film is fun energetic and just plain laugh a lot a minute. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. 8-6-02</p></br><a href="../users/A37S3ACL57LN62.html">A37S3ACL57LN62</a><br/><p>It is no wonder Monroe is a legend and it is no wonder this movie remains a favorite. It is set in 1929 with clever lines in the beginning telling what is to come later in history like mentioning the stock market crash and the divorce of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. Marilyn is magnetic and sexy despite that fact that she was pregnant during the filming and heading toward her mental instabilities. This is probably her best film because it combines both her enormous appeal with a truly great script and supporting cast.<br /><br />This movie is lighthearted and innocent, with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressing as women to run from the mob and falling for the beautiful blondes in the Sweet Sue all female band. They each instantly fall for Sugar, played by Monroe, but it is Curtis' character who dresses as a rich oil tycoon strangely similar to Cary Grant's screen persona, who wins her over.<br /><br />Don't miss this incredible film, one of the last of the golden age of Hollywood!</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p><p><br />Director: Billy Wilder<br />Format: Black &amp; White<br />Studio: Mgm/Ua Studios<br />Video Release Date: May 1, 2001<p>Cast:<p>Marilyn Monroe ...

There is great depth in the understated analysis of male/female conventional behaviour. However, while most of the critical reviews here seem stupefyingly dumb (the plot isn't realistic, the gangsters are murderous, etc) I do have to agree with those who think it is just a little too long and a bit verbose. As usual, I can't understand why so many people think it is necessary or useful to summarize the plot; so I won't. Joe E.Brown has a truly remarkable face. Both Curtis and Lemmon are excellent in their multiple roles --- given that there is just too much dialogue written for them. Although why so many people think that Curtis speaks like Cary Grant beats me. Nobody talks like that. The first time I saw this movie I didn't know he was imitating anybody --- least of all Cary Grant. Perhaps that's the way Grant sounds to Americans. Deadpan George Raft is superb in his part as Spats, better than in any of his gangster films. Marilyn is an impossible, unbelievable dream. So ripe, so luscious, like a slightly bruised peach.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>A.F.I's choice for the funniest movie ever made, is indeed quite funny.

Much ,much better than their  later outting &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;. A excellent fast paced,  humorous, movie which deserved to get Lemmon an Oscar nomination, but  unrightly over-looked Curtis and Monroe! Top moments are Monroe singing  &quot;Running Wild&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;I'm Thru With  Love&quot;, I couldn't stop laughing when Curtis ,dressed up like a woman,  actually kissed her after the song! I enjoyed the scenes with Brown and  Lemmon out on the town, dancing the tango. And of course the famous ending  scene.

Although there's a fair amount of sexual innuendo for a 1959 movie, it's very mild by today's standards and "Some Like It Hot" is suitable for viewers of any age 10 and up.

Recently voted the funniest American film ever in AFI's poll of the 100 Funniest Movies, it never fails to entertain. The pairing of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon is pure magic. Each may not have been Billy Wilder's first choice for their respective roles, but one cannot imagine anybody else playing them now. As for Marilyn Monroe, she is the fragile, beautiful heart of the entire film. Her Sugar Kane is tragic, funny, sexy, and adorable all at the same time. I read how some of her lines had to be written out and displayed for her to read out while filming, and somehow this doesn't take away at all from her performance. She WAS Sugar Kane, always reaching for but not quite getting the sweet end of the lollipop. Jack Lemmon almost takes the entire movie as Daphne, his female alter-ego. How subversive this movie must have seemed in 1959, when a top male star could be seen reveling in his feminine side! As with "Sunset Boulevard" and "A Foreign Affair", the true strength of the film is the cast. Each person was letter perfect in their role. All of Billy Wilder's films should be essential viewing for any film buff. What he had was a true eye for talent in his acting roles, demontrated again and again in all his films, the knack for knowing who to put in what role. How many potentially great films have been hampered by questionable casting? It is a true gift, and not many really have it. This truly set Billy Wilder apart, and helped him turn this outrageous story into the classic it is now. Get this film for your collection, you won't regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>This one shows up on Turner Classics every once in a while, but I hadn't focused till the other night. There's something creepy about dressing like a woman. Some burly men may have no qualms, but I find transvestites, ahh, uncomfortable.  I know.  It's me and there's nothing wrong with that.  In Some Like It Hot, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are cross-dressing to escape some killers.  They're not very attractive as women, which allowed me to enjoy the sex identity farce.  Farce in America means screwball comedy.  If Monroe crawled into my Pullman berth to sleep, hmm -- Lemmon pops one no doubt, and I'm not sure it was in the script if you know what I mean.  Then he's swarmed by bunches of scantily clad ladies and the fun escalates.  Monroe wears two dresses that give an interesting illusion.

That does not explain my mild amusement or indifference to this prohibition-era gender-bender or why the American Film Institute ranked this as the funniest comedy of all-time(?!).  Let's see bumbling musicians witness Saint Valentine's Day Massacre and go on the lam as girl musicians.  Hijinks ensue.  One of the musician's has to fend off the advances of a lech while the other pretends he's Cary Grant so he can make beautiful music with Marilyn Monroe.  I'm in hysterics.

Things really get hot when the band's ukulele player Sugar Kane (Monroe) falls for Cary Grant sounding "Shell Oil" Junior (Curtis again) and a relic playboy named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) falls for "Daphne."  Complicating these budding romances is "Spats" Colombo who also is in Florida looking, with his henchmen, to snuff out the only two witnesses of his gangland shooting.<br /><br />There is unforgettable and hilarious dialogue between Osgood and "Daphne" at the end of the movie.  As well, the most unforgettable line in this entire movie is the very last line and it's delivered by Osgood.  (After this last line is delivered, the screen fades to black with jazz music blaring.)<br /><br />All actors do a good job in their parts.  There is a fantastic chemistry between Tony Curtis (who plays Joe/ Josephine/ "Shell Oil" Junior) and Jack Lemmon (who plays Jerry/Geraldine/Daphne).  (Note that Tony Curtis' "Josephine" voice was dubbed by another actor as Curtis couldn't speak high enough.)  I have to give special kudos to Jack Lemmon who, in my opinion, does an outstanding job throughout this movie.  (He's the one who says the line that titles this review.)<br /><br />This movie has lots of energy from its opening credits to its end.  This is partly due to the acting but also partly due to the distinctive jazz music that can occasionally be heard in the background.<br /><br />There are ten songs in this movie, four performed by Marilyn Monroe.  (Note that this movie was released three years before Monroe's death.)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2001) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one disappointing extra of Billy Wilder movie trailers.  (I'm not judging the DVD on this since extras are optional not mandatory.)  Also, be aware that there are no English subtitles but there is closed captioning.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a hilarious classic comedy starring the legendary Marilyn Monroe!! I guarantee that if you see this movie, you won't get "the fuzzy end of the lollipop."<br /><br />(1959;  2 hr;  16 scenes;  black and white; wide screen)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm a recent member of the Billy Wilder fan club, but I'm quickly rising in the ranks for in all honestly I have yet to see a film he has done that has not met with my wildest of expectations.  At the moment I've only seen four, but all four (`Sunset Boulevard', `The Apartment', `Double Indemnity' and now `Some Like it Hot'; in that order) are five star films and would most likely make my top 100 films of all time.<br /><br />`Some Like it Hot' has been a film I have been itching to watch for a long time now.  I remember seeing the stage production quite a few years back (at a dinky dinner theater at that) and I remember loving it, even if the production values were a little weak.  The story was cute and well executed and I just knew that the film must be stellar, especially with Lack Lemmon in the lead (just love that guy).  Still, I had never pushed myself hard enough to actually see the movie.  That is until the other night when it was playing on TCM and I just knew I had to take the opportunity to actually watch this classic.  I was so pleased with the end result, a comedy that works on every level brilliantly, that I had to watch it again immediately after the credits began to roll (the beauty of a DVR).<br /><br />`Some Like it Hot' tells the story of two band members, Joe and Jerry, who wind up on the run after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  With no where to go they decide to don drag costumes and join an all female band on the road to Florida.  Once there both Joe and Jerry (or should I say Josephine and Daphne) meet many obstacles in their hideout, not the least of them is lead singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, the boozy blonde who has sworn off love until the right type of millionaire comes along.  While Joe tries to become that millionaire, Jerry finds himself dodging the advances of Osgood Fielding III, a skirt chasing divorcee (multiple times now) who is enamored with Daphne's feminine charm.  Couple this with the advancing threat of gangster and you have one perfectly complete comedy that hits its mark every single time.<br /><br />The script is flawlessly crafted, delivery smart and sassy dialog as well as off the wall gags and brilliant character development, allowing us to get to know everyone in the cast and grow to appreciate their predicaments.<br /><br />The script is embellished by the stunning cast.  In all actuality it stuns me that only Lemmon was singled out as Oscar worthy (he was the only actor in the bunch to receive an Oscar nomination; losing to Charlton Heston) when in fact the entire cast is flawless.  Yes, Lemmon is the comedic highlight, and his antics are surely best-in-show, but Tony Curtis should have also received a nomination alongside his screen partner for delivering a truly tender and believable performance as the lovelorn Joe.  Marilyn Monroe, who won the Golden Globe for her performance, should have also received a nomination, for her performance is iconic.  She is the superlative example of what an enticing ditzy blonde should be, and she sets the standard that so many other actresses have failed to live up to.  Joe E. Brown steals every scene he's in as Osgood, and his lack of an Oscar nomination is truly saddening.<br /><br />But this movie is all about Billy Wilder, a director who understands his actors and understands his material and works to deliver a complete film, one that covers all the bases so-to-speak and lives up to his name.  So far I've seen four masterpieces by this man, and I have a feeling that the rest are just as impressive.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I bought the new collector's edition of 'Some Like It Hot' a few months ago and I am just getting around to watching it. The film is a classic with Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe in top form with help from a great cast of character actors. This Billy Wilder film has held up really well and now it's got a worthy release. The new 2 disc edition sports a ton of extras and a fantastic print and transfer!</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>A ad for a current theatrical comedy touts it as being in the same &quot;gross-out&quot; league as &quot;National Lampoon's Animal House&quot; or the recent &quot;There's Something About Mary.&quot;  Well, I, for one,  do not find the childish antics of such fare to be worthy of my attention  or my dollars.<p>&quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; remains an all-time comic  tour de force with witty dialogue, side-splitting slapstick, and great work  from principals. <p>Jack Lemmon, who proved several years later his  dramatic range scores in his role as Jerry(Daphne).  His solution to the  &quot;marriage&quot; problem between his female alter-ego and the rich  playboy played by legendary funnyman Joe E. Brown is priceless.  <p>Tony  Curtis, who in drag resembles Eve Arden, shows his comic flair with a deft  impression of Cary Grant.  It was not until many years later, as the Boston  Strangler - in the film of the same name - would he receive praise for his  acting.  Curtis is great in &quot;HOT.&quot;<p>Finally, Marilyn Monroe is  magic as Sugar.  A much better actress than she is given credit, Monroe  brings childish charm and innocence in what was probably one of her best  characterizations.<p>&quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; has lost none of its  heat!</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>MGM continues to insult the intelligence of the DVD consumer with this 'special edition' of one of Billy Wilder's all time great romantic comedies.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are witnesses to the Valentine's Day Massacre.  To stay alive the boys shave their legs, dress in drag and join an all-girl's band fronted by sulty singing sensation, Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).  Featuring Monroe's inimitable renditions of &quot;Running Wild&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot; this is a keeper in every respect.<br />Unfortunately MGM Home Entertainment has done a terrible job of remastering the print.  Though the black and white picture exhibits exceptional contrast and clarity, the obtrusive inclusion of edge enhancement, artifacting, aliasing, fine detail shimmering and digital grit make for a really unattractive visual presentation.  The sound has been remixed to 5.1, but the dated fidelity shines through.  Still, the audio is presented at an acceptable listening level and without much distortion or echo.<br />Extras included a trip down memory lane with Tony Curtis that is overly long and really dragged down by Curtis' flamboyant hamming it up for the cameras.  Oh well, I can't imagine too many people are asking him to shave his legs these days.  Bottom line: If you absolutely must have the film I guess you could waste your money on this version.  My hope is that someone at MGM will want to revisit this classic at a later date and with a more reputable transfer.  Here's to hoping.  Besides - nobody's perfect!</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>"Zoweeee!"<br /><br />The American Film Institute ranks this Billy Wilder gem as funniest of all American movies.  And it's hard to imagine any film, foreign or domestic, that could top this timeless masterpiece about two skirt-chasing Chicago musicians (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis), on the run from the mob who don drag and discover love while hiding -- and performing -- with an all woman band headed to Florida.<br /><br />The screenplay by director Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond is unerring as it mixes desperate comedy and a convoluted battle of the sexes.  Marilyn Monroe, though often half-naked, maintains her innocent, sexy and vulnerable personae as disappointed-in-love lead singer Sugar Kane.  (With what's on the screen, it's hard to believe Monroe was on her worst behavior during the troubled shoot.) Lemmon starts tightly wound, becomes ever more unhinged and then snaps into a dangerously comfortable mode as his "Daphne" character is pursued by the amorous and enamored retiree Joe. E. Brown Curtis, in his perfect Cary Grant-voiced alter ego, is feckless as he tries to get Sugar to help him feel passion.<br /><br />The pristine Special Edition disc features a revealing conversation with Tony Curtis and Leonard Maltin, a featurette on all-female bands (for more on girl bands, read the sensational "Swing Shift" by Sherrie Tucker, Duke University Press, 2000), behind-the-scene images, pressbook gallery and trailers from Billy Wilder films. A perfect, must-own film.  From MGM.  (1959, Not Rated, Widescreen, 122 Minutes.)</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>Like Marilyn herself, this film is irresistably charming. The immortal lines, the fabulous cast and the wonderful direction by Billy Wilder makes for non-stop fun. It's a film that will be enjoyed then, now and forever by the entire family.<br /><br />The time is 1929. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are struggling musicians who happen to witness a murder, in a garage, on St Valentines day. The mob lead by "Spats"(George Raft) is after them. Their only hope is to hide out with a traveling band. The band happens to be an all girls band. The guys, don women's clothing(and look scrumptious) and bunk in with the gals,including the very sweet and sexy "Sugar"(Monroe) and the fun begins. From the moment they spy Sugar ("When she moves, it's like Jell-o on springs")they loose their hearts and so do we.<br /><br />Tony falls for Marilyn("I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop"), Joe E. Brown("Zoweee!") falls for Jack, and the thugs are hot on their trail. You just won't want it to end, and even when it does you'll find yourself smiling just thinking of it.For sure it is the "sweet end of the lollipop".<br /><br />For those looking for the DVD -  MGM has put together one terrific package. See my DVD review for details of transfer and feautres here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXCR">Some Like It Hot</a>.<br /><br />A wonderful addition to any VHS or DVD library. This is THE definitive "screwball comedy". Well worth having. And I leave you with Joe E. Brown's immortal line....."Nobody's Perfect!"...enjoy...Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I'll never know why the AFI and a lot of other well-meaning folk  believe this is the best comedy ever. In its time, perhaps the predicament of its characters may have been outrageous (drag dressing in the "square" America of the 50s, the unawashed depiction of the chicago mob/jazz scene etc) but it is contentious whether it would appeal to viewers of all generations and affinities. <p>That is not to say that the movie is not a hilarious charmer. Despite some longueurs, especially before we reach with Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemmon) to Florida or towards the end of the movie when romance is allowed to flourish at the expense of comedy, I would recommend this to anyone in a blink -- even those who dread "old" movies. <p>For one thing, Lemmon is very, very funny and convincing; I find Curtis a little staid but interesting in his role overall; and the movie has some pretty funny situational gags that hit the right notes. But as the title on the Amazon page suggests, this really is an out-and-out Monroe flick who is arguably in the most vivacious DumbBlonde number of her career. Do they make woman like that anymore? <p>Secondly, in its romanticism, SLIH bristles with the clever sexual innuendo of yore, a certain finesse that is clearly amiss in the in-your-face adoloscent comedies of our times (Something About Mary, American Pie, etc). Much of the dialog between Monroe and Curtis/Lemmon is priceless. <p>Thirdly, one facet of the movie that gets crowded out by all the celebrations of Marilyn and all the gags is that this was a *real* gangster movie even before the Mario Puzos of the world had written their first word about Corleone. I wonder if Billy Wilder was kidding about "Hot" or about setting the movie in 1929 Chicago. The garage massacre scene, the opening police shootout etc are all a must-see for anyone interested in the reality of those times (the beginnings of organized "mob", Prohibition etc).<p>Whether one sees this as a top humour flick of all time or not, this still remains a classic in its own right, with some legendary comedy numbers from great names of Hollywood. Highly recommended to own, not just to rent.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>Why's that? Well, because musicians Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon just happened to witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and have to skidaddle off to Florida disguised as the newest members of an all-girl band, Josephine and Daphne.  Even with all the stress that would cause, the guys (or girls?) manage to find love complications, as Tony develops an interest in band singer Marilyn Monroe, and Jack (in his Daphne disguise) finds himself hotly pursued by millionaire Joe E. Brown. And if that isn't enough, it just so happens that the Florida resort hotel the band's playing at has been chosen for the gangster convention, so the very mobsters Tony and Jack are fleeing wind up right in the elevator with them. Plenty of comic situations abound.<p>In addition to Curtis, Lemmon, Monroe,and Brown, the cast also features George Raft as the mobster who ordered the Chicago hit, and Pat O'Brien as the cop tracking Raft down to Florida. All are good in their respective roles. While &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; was recognized as the top comedy of the century by the AFI, I really wouldn't consider it the FUNNIEST picture I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong; it's quite hilarious, but Numero Uno? There would be a lot of competition for that slot in my opinion. Just to name a few, in no particular order: &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on My Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;Moonstruck&quot; are all ones to make me laugh hysterically. <p>Be that as it may, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is probably the best work of the three main stars, and for that alone, it's worth a peek if you haven't caught it yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>This has got to be the most hysterically funny movie ever made.  I almost got carpet burns from rolling on the rug laughing.  Billy Wilder's direction packs a laugh a minute, and shooting the movie in black and white  takes us right back into 1929 Prohibition.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are  hilarious as the drag team of Josephine and Daphne on the lam from  witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, and who else but  Marilyn Monroe could have played the airhead Sugar Kane? As if this trio  wasn't perfection itself, Joe E. Brown almost steals the movie right out  from under them as the superannuated casanova who falls in love with  &quot;Daphne&quot;; maybe he/she is not all Joe E. Brown supposes, but so  what; as Brown says, in the most devastating punchline ever written,  &quot;Nobody's perfect&quot;.  This movie is going to keep viewers cracking  up for generations to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>"Hot" is the perfect word to describe Billy Wilder's comedy masterpiece - along with "outrageous" and "sophisticated." Two out-of-work musicians - played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon - are driven by desperate circumstances to impersonate female musicians in an all-girl band that's headed to Florida. It is winter in 1930's Chicago, and they've just witnessed the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. George Raft plays one of the gangsters responsible for the shooting, and he's hot on their trail; as is Pat O'Brien, a police detective determined to catch Raft.<br /><br />On the train ride to Florida, it isn't easy maintaining their cover while playing footsie with the band's gorgeously seductive singer, Sugar, played by Marilyn Monroe. She delivers a couple of really sultry numbers. When our cowardly heroes reach lush, tropical Florida, and an exclusive resort for retired millionaires, they think their problems are over. But they're just heating up. One of the millionaires, played by Joe E. Brown, takes a liking to Lemmon's female persona; and Curtis decides to pursue Sugar by doffing his wig and female padding and donning a blue blazer and captain's cap, a la Cary Grant. But things get even more complicated, and hot.<br /><br />In order to pursue Monroe, Curtis blackmails Lemmon into keeping Brown occupied on shore while he and Monroe take advantage of the millionaire's yacht. In one of the great, classic scenes of cinema, we cut between Curtis and Monroe making love on the yacht, while Lemmon and Brown dance away the night at an outdoor restaurant. Curtis convinces Monroe that he has become frigid because of a lost love, so she decides to try to cure him. Cut to Lemmon and Brown dancing a tango to the same tune Billy Wilder used in Sunset Boulevard for the New Year's Eve party. Cut back to Curtis and Monroe kissing - he's starting to thaw. Cut to Lemmon and Brown dancing - they exchange a long stem carnation between their teeth. Back to Curtis and Monroe - his glasses are becoming fogged. Lemmon and Brown - they've blindfolded the orchestra!<br /><br />When the two red-hot lovers meet back at their room, Lemmon tells Curtis that he's engaged. "Who's the lucky girl," Curtis asks. "I am," Lemmon coos, as he plays the shakers he's brought back from the restaurant. Curtis is stunned: he's done such a good job convincing his friend that he's a girl, Lemmon's ready to pick out china. Now he has to try to undo it, but it's not going to be easy:  the deluded Lemmon is thinking about the alimony checks he'll collect if the marriage doesn't work out. It's all a lot of really outrageous - and sophisticated - fun.<br /><br />Some Like It Hot was a high point in the careers of its three stars, as well as its director. Curtis and Lemmon would pair up again in The Great Race (1965), a wonderful Blake Edwards slapstick spoof, and make many more films as well - but this was one of their best. Monroe, on the other hand, appeared in only three more films before her death at the age of 36 in 1962 - so this was definitely the high point of her career. Billy Wilder would make about a dozen more films; but since this was his best comedy, it was a high point for him, too. Some Like It Hot was nominated for six Oscars, but only won Best Costume Design for a Black-and-White film, because it was competing against Ben-Hur, which swept the Oscars that year.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>SOME LIKE IT HOT is nothing short of classic cinema, directed by the brilliant Billy Wilder.  Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two jazz musicians who witness a Valentine's Day massacre.  One of the hoods responsible for this blood bath, "Spats" Colombo (George Raft) knows that the guys witnessed what went on and is out to knock them off before they squeal to the cops.  These two guys need to get out of town--fast.  What better way to do so but to join a travelling band?  There's just one catch.  It's an ALL WOMEN'S jazz band.  Details, details.  And, in the words of one of the characters, "Nobody's perfect."  The two don wigs, girdles, skirts, and heels, and promptly apply for work with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and her ensemble.  This is only the beginning of a series of hilarious, outrageous and wildly entertaining events.  What's more, just to make matters more complicated, Joe falls for Sugar and must adopt a second alter ego, apart from his role as her bandmate, and acquires a spot-on Cary Grant accent to go along with that persona.<br /><br />This film is remarkably progressive and timeless.  It's amazing to think that SOME LIKE IT HOT was made in the 1950s.  Marilyn Monroe absolutely sizzles in her role as Sugar Kane and sings one of her most memorable songs, "I Want To Be Loved By You."  She truly is the epitome of sexiness.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are hilarious and Joe E. Brown plays a smitten millionaire who promptly falls in love with Lemmon's female alter ego on the spot.  I won't divulge more plot twists, but, I will say that this film puts contemporary screwball comedies to shame.  This is completely incomparable.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Jack Lemmon was a great actor in dozens of great films, but Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis were never better than in this Billy Wilder classic.  Ms. Monroe and Mr. Curtis share a scene on a yacht that is both funny and guaranteed to raise the pulse of any heterosexual man with a heartbeat.  Tony Curtis also does a great Cary Grant impersonation when he is trying to woo Ms. Monroe, and not wearing drag to avoid the Chicago gangsters that have tracked them to Miami.  The story is absolutely ridiculous, but the cast runs with it with so much gusto that you can set aside any thoughts about how realistic the story seems to just enjoy the witty dialogue and the hilarious situations that these memorable and likable characters find themselves in.

Arguably, the three of them bring their best performance of their careers. Each one of them in this movie uses a different comedy style, and with very effective results.

Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon star as Joe & Jerry, two Chicago musicians in the 1920's Prohibition era, who on down on their luck. They accept a job playing for mobster Spats Colombo (George Raft) at his funeral parlor which is a front for a speakeasy.  The police raid the club and shut it down and they again out of work.  They go to a musical booking agency where they learn of a dream job down in Florida, with all transportation and expenses paid, with a band who need a saxophone and bass player (which happens to be the guy's instruments).  The offer is a set up from the secretary, who Joe stood up for a date, as the catch is that it's an all female band.  Joe tries to convince Jerry to take it by dressing up as woman, but he refuses and they accept another job in Urbana.  While on their way there, they stop for gas when they inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  They are spotted as witnesses and are set to be rubbed out when they try to get the all girl gig and are surprised when they get it.  When then see to two in full drag wobbling on heels to the train with the new names of Josephine & Daphne.  It is on the train where the real humor of the film comes through.  They met the lead singer of the band Sugar Kane Kowalczyk played by a never sexier Marilyn Monroe.  Each of them try to gain her favor, but Jerry ends up being hit on by a lecherous Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) who is completely taken with Daphne.  The interplay between Mr. Lemmon & Mr. Brown is filled with perfect comedic timing and is a seminar in farcical comedy.  During their time in Florida, Joe tries to win Sugar's heart by meeting her out of drag character and pretends to be a millionaire.  All the while Spats has come to Florida and he finds the two musicians and wants to rub them out finally.  In the end, Joe, Jerry & Sugar escape on Osgood's yacht where he proposes to Daphne.  Daphne makes up a bunch of different reasons why they can't marry to which Osgood replies he doesn't care.  Finally Daphne rips off his wig and I declares "I'm a man" to which Osgood delivers one of the best closing lines in film history, "well, nobody's perfect".  The film was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Mr. Lemmon), Best Director and Best Screenplay, but only took home one award for Costume design.  The film was recently voted the number one comedy of all-time by the American Film Institute.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Made in the days before sex is blase in movies, this movie was very hot, with the voluptous twirlings and seductions of Marilyn Monroe and the crazy, transvestite antics of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, not all that bad looking.

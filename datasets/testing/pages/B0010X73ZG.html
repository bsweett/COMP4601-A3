Much like the overlooked Dreamcatcher, The Mist takes the viewer on a thrill ride packed with characters who represent the extremes in everyday life.  But isn't that what you are supposed to do in a film about the microcosm of society pressed into two hours?  I am not going to give any simple recap of the film, because reviews like that are useless.  Here's what you need to know...if you like creepy, gut-wrenching horror that packs an intelligent and unapologetic punch, then The Mist is right up your alley.  This is the fun, classic King at his best (a la Creep Show).  There were two items that bothered me about the film, however.  The "creature" too similar to the ones from Dreamcatcher....and, if we're going to use a "parallel dimension" as the cause for the creatures...I think more creativity could have gone into their design.  That being said, this movie is clearly in my top ten horror films of all time list.  Highly Recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2SNUORW55MZWO.html">A2SNUORW55MZWO</a><br/><p>If you are looking for a scary movie that wraps everything up nicely at the end with a feeling of hope, don't watch this movie. If you want to see a scary movie that sticks true to itself until the very end, this is the movie for you. I have never seen a movie so pure in it's genre. There is no happy ending here and why should there be? The movie's ending is different than the book, but I was so happy to see that the new ending is just as evil and insane as the rest of the movie. Frankly, I was shocked and surprised. This is a great story about a group of people trapped in a grocery store after a mist rolls in and covers the place. What's lurking in the mist is pure evil and the suspense will keep you barely able to breath. The acting is great, the special effects are awesome, but what sets this movie apart for me is the ending. One of the best horror films I have ever seen, top 3 of all time, but make sure you go into this movie expecting a pure horror movie complete with a horrific ending. If you want to watch insanity unfold, you should step into The Mist.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>The army's "Arrowhead Project" has poked a hole into another dimension and it may be open for good.  A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage.  David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out.  While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero.  The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist.  A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days.  The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks.  A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....<br /><br />Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world.  I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do.  I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book.  It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.<br /><br />This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination.  That part of the movie follows the book pretty well and I enjoyed it.  The acting is very good and I even wanted to shoot Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the main leader of the fanatic group.<br /><br />Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>I already own the dvd version and this is certainly not the most stunning HD release, I've actually had issues with it loading and it skipped around visually at least 4 times that forced me to back scan and make sure it wasn't defective. I use my PS3 for watching Blu-ray movies and this is the first Blu-ray that has skipped around in a glitchy way. I still need to watch the B&W version, so yeah.</p></br><a href="../users/A4SY5RCGC5CH9.html">A4SY5RCGC5CH9</a><br/><p>I adore Stephen King books and I consider "Mist" as one of his masterpieces but to my great surprise and delight this adaptation by Frank Darabont actually IMPROVED the original story! And this is not an easy thing to improve the work of such a master! In fact many Stephen King works (including masterpieces) were wrecked once filmed (just consider the horrible fate of "Pet Sematary" or "Children of the Corn") - well not this time ladies and gentlemen! Here we have a work on the same level as in "Shawshank redemption" and "Green mile", which is only normal considering that Frank Darabont directed those movies too.<br /><br />I do not want to provide spoilers, but simply by looking at the cover of the DVD you already know that the mist is the key element of this story, and that the action will mostly take place in a supermarket - and also that for the people trapped inside, leaving the said supermarket is not really an option, because of the above mentioned mist... The rest is for you to discover...<br /><br />Any Constant Reader of Stephen King will probably howl with delight during the first scene of this movie - I certainly did! Also please do not miss the title of the newspaper one of the customers is reading in the waiting line in the supermarket just at the beginning of the movie - it is a very pleasant joke addressed to Constant Readers..)) I liked it very much.<br /><br />However the jokes and delights will end quickly. This is a VERY tough and extremely dark horror movie, with a great lot of death and suffering - including many of the most likable characters! And after all this comes the ending, which is as shocking as the crucial moments in "Seven" and "Shutter Island". It WILL shock you and probably hurt you - so beware and in fact if you feel a little bit down or vulnerable, you should absolutely postpone watching "The mist" until a better moment! That is a serious warning - please do not take it lightly!<br /><br />King's short story "The mist" had some elements which I always considered as weak spots and didn't like (although I absolutely love the whole story) and Frank Darabont made the choice of not correcting them, to stay faithful to the original text. I think he made a honorable choice, although King's obvious dislike of US armed forces is the only weak spot in this otherwise extraordinary story - me for one I simply refuse to believe that in a situation of extreme danger for civilians, highly trained professional soldiers (all volunteers!) who swore a solemn oath to protect the citizens of their republic from any danger, just abandon helpless women and children and choose the cowards way out! But this is just one minor glitch and after all stranger things happen...<br /><br />Frank Darabont changed however the original story by developing more the character of "the enemy inside" and especially by extending the story beyond the original ending, which was already shocking, but finally left the final fate of the heroes a mystery... In the movie there is a real ending and it is a very surprising and extremely painful one - it is even more horrible than any ending in Stephen King's books! But I believe this is a necessary thing, because this achieves the lesson we learn - and this movie in my perception is a very Christian one, unlike the original story. And here are the Christian teachings which I identified in "The mist":<br /><br />1) "Beware of false prophets who are like wolves coming dressed in sheep skins" (beginning and middle of the movie)<br />2) "Thou shalt never deliver God's children in sacrifice to Moloch!!" (second part of the movie)<br />3) The suicide is a deadly sin!!<br /><br />and last but not least!<br /><br />4) Hope is a major Christian virtue - so if you abandon yourself to despair, beware, because this is even worse than sin - IT IS AN ERROR!!<br /><br />This movie shocked me horribly but also made me think a lot and I count it as one of the best modern horror films and one of the finest cinematographic adaptations of Stephen King prose. I recommend it greatly - to buy, watch and keep!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q.html">A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q</a><br/><p>The Mist has been on my, "want to see" list since I saw a trailer for it how many months ago. I remember listening to the audiobook of Stephen King's novella when I was younger. I picked it up because it has this great cover of some tentacle reaching up under a door and boasted of a "fully surround sound experience".<br /><br />The Mist was directed by Frank Darabont who directed The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. Two Stephen King books that translated very well onto the big screen. I was looking forward to another Darabont/King collaboration.<br /><br />Starring Thomas Jane (The Punisher) as David Drayton, Marcia Gay Harden (Mystic River) as the religious-crazed Mrs. Carmody, Laurie Holden (Silent Hill) as Amanda Dumfries, and William Sadler (The Green Mile) as Jim this movie was held to a strict budget and time frame which created the perfect mentality for a horror film.<br /><br />Following a freak electrical storm, a mist creeps into a small town. David and his son travel to the grocery store the next day for supplies. While there a man, bleeding from his nose, comes running in warning the people to stay away from the mist.<br /><br />The crowd looks on as the mist envelops the parking lot.<br /><br />There are those who aren't sure what to do, some who want to go home to their children, and others who think something sinister at work. Mrs. Carmody believes it's the wrath of God come upon the town for their sins. Before the end of the film, she will have converted a large following to her beliefs.<br /><br />How will anyone escape the mist? Whenever someone tries to escape to their car, they are "taken" or eaten by whatever inhabits the mist.<br /><br />There is alot of foul language in this movie and the graphic content is high as well. Plus the ending may not be what you're expecting and, depending on how you look at it, could very well upset you.<br /><br />The film makers did a fine job with what they had. (Actor/budget-wise)</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>i can not say i have seen one bad Stephen King movie. the mist is creepy and exciting at the same time. this movie is really good. it's a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A129YBX5BVNW2.html">A129YBX5BVNW2</a><br/><p>"The Mist" is another superb adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King story, but this time instead of redemption, Frank's going for terror - hoping to get you to soil your jockeys or at least nibble your fingernails more than you normally would. He achieves a bit of both actually in this terribly endearing Seventies-feel Sci-Fi schlock fest.<br /><br />First up, Darabont cleverly doesn't go for big names in the lead roles - there are faces in there you'll recognize (William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn - who were both in the mighty "Shawshank Redemption" for instance), but it's mostly actors you vaguely know or don't recognize at all. It has the effect of making their predicament more real - ordinary townsfolk locked into a battle for survival - where common sense quickly takes a back seat and bravery becomes a luxury few are willing to deploy...<br /><br />Here how it goes - the Army's been experimenting up in the mountains (aren't they always) and have unleashed something nasty on our world (don't they always). As the 'mist' creeps in over a small US town after an unnatural storm, half the not-so-bright populace gets trapped in the local supermarket where it becomes quickly evident that it's probably not a good idea to go outside into the dense creeping fog, because people who do tend to either not come back or get eaten. Ropes that were attached to torsos - fall limp, there's a sound; a scream and someone's entrails end up on the potato chips stand...(thoughtless of them you have to say)...<br /><br />All the usual elements are in place - the irritating stupid ones who do something they shouldn't and end up as fodder, the lying Army types covering their uniformed asses, the wise old ones who sacrifice for the young, the cowardly big talkers who then sit in corners and whinge - the women who are ballsier and brainier than the men - all manner of parents who are just trying to protect their families...the resourcefulness and guts of those who do fight back and win...<br /><br />Darabont also cleverly ratchets up the tension by having no music for ages so that when the sinister synth drone does kick in - it really kicks in - and when the wailing vocals of Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance on "The Host of Seraphim" comes in towards the end - it has the emotional impact of a fist in the face. It's on an album called (not surprisingly) "The Serpent's Egg"...<br /><br />Toby Jones is superb as the grounded Supermarket owner, Thomas Jane as the father who must keep safe his son at all costs and Andre Braugher as his difficult neighbour who doesn't buy into the hysteria and conspiracy theories and pays the webbed price.<br /><br />But the film belongs to Marcia Gay Harden who is stunningly effective as the town's religious zealot who seizes her it's-the-wrath-of-God moment with non-stop apocalyptical-jabbering. Of course after two days of ranting about sins and the End of the World and her being God's conduit, she begins to make twisted sense to the terrified folks desperate to placate the beasties outside. Enter the inevitable Lord Of The Flies scenario - a sacrifice must be made...<br /><br />There's something terribly old-fashioned about The Mist. It wants to make your girlfriend go "yew!" a lot and it achieves this on several occasions with genuinely squeamish aplomb. Coming over a bit like an Irwin Allen Seventies epic, The Mist is basically a very, very good B-movie.<br /><br />For Blu Ray owners - the special effect creatures are Jurassic Park meets Alien meets the bug scene in King Kong - creepy, scary and deliciously icky. The Blu Ray images are really clean and crisp and even when huge things lurk over cars in a blurry haze, you still see their monstrous outlines and 'feel' their size as the pumped-up audio does its thing. The 'black and white' version on Disc 2 is even creepier and a very clever addition.<br /><br />By the time the unexpected and staggeringly downbeat ending finally comes (some have truly hated this though) - you know someone has done their job right, because you've been rightly and royally entertained. And more importantly - you've rooted for these people - so much so that you end up thinking about them and their decisions - days later...<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>The realism of the people and small-town settings portrayed here draws us in and bands us together with the party trapped in a grocery store, waiting out the coming of whatever ferocity is in the surrounding mist. The camera work and lighting puts us right in the faces of the frightened, beleaguered shoppers. I felt as if I were walking directly behind the store manager, peering over his shoulder as he circulates around the store, whispering counsel, quelling rising tempers, helping to plan escape. Toby Jones does a brilliant job in this part, a total departure from his role as Truman Capote in "Infamous."<br /><br />All the actors turn in compelling, realistic performances as each in turn gets spotlighted in the beam of whatever improvised light the shoppers devise when night falls and their power is cut.<br /><br />However, I can't be quite as enthusiastic about the creatures that strike out of the mist. Sometimes these artifacts, with their improbably akimbo limbs and their almost human, craning, questioning faces - even seem to be vaguely comical. With all the advances that have been made in fabrication and CG effects in recent years, these menacing arthropods still didn't seem to match the frightening realism of the attackers in decades-old movies such as "Them."<br /><br />Still, the movie is worth watching. It will take you out of yourself into that store-under-siege.<br /><br />Not all of the bonus material on the DVD is as worthwhile though. The Director's commentary is a little flat and uninformative and you can skip it unless you have a lot of extra time. It will be enough to listen to the Director's chat with Stephen King, from whose early short story/novella this picture was drawn. And you can also listen to just the commentary accompanying the movie's outtakes to get enough of an idea of the budget techniques used to create the effects in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>I had given up on Stephen King adaptions. But I have to say, this movie was great. It leaves you with a feeling of dread. The huge monster walking over the truck at the end was just terrifying and inspired such a feeling of Armegeddon and Apocalypse. There is no happy ending here. You will leave the cinema very disturbed by this movie.<br />I was trying to figure out if it really was Armegeddon as told in the Bible, or if it was government experimentation gone wrong. The film depicts events as told in the book of Revelations about the end of the world. You will be guessing right up to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The Mist is an absolutely stunning horror movie. It has everything a monster movie should have such as suspense, panic, terror, madness with some powerful performances to boot. The premise is simple. A mist settles on a town and shoppers find themselves in a supermarket defending themselves from monsters that appear in the mist... and then having to defend themselves from each other. It leaves you asking the question "are the monsters on the inside or outside?"<br /><br />That dichotomy is what drives the film. It is very much about human behaviour under extreme duress in this survival horror as people doubt there are monsters and go outside, go outside anyway for a cause or to save somebody or a family member, start a cult inside that blames "unbelievers" or form separatist movements to plan an action of escape from the mystery mist that brings with it a wrath of monstrous proportions.<br /><br />The ending grabs you by the scruff of your neck and rattles you emotionally. It is the sort of ending you thought Hollywood never had the brass pair to make and yet when it comes you wish it hadn't. Not that the twist isn't good, it delivers a punch, but rips your heart out with it. Never has a film explored such dark realms as this has. You can't say in the end that you enjoyed the mist, but you can say that you lived through it. Unforgettably depressing but stylish and enduring, it is still a must see and daring brilliance.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>Since I am a big fan of John Carpenter (who is given homage at the beginning of the character has a painting of "The Thing" poster), I was excited to give this a rent a few months ago, and ultimately add the Blu-Ray to my collection.<br /><br />There are of course similarities to such old school movies as "The Fog" and "The Birds" (the scene where Marcia Gay Harden starts her religious rant, definitely must have been a tribute to the scene in "The Birds" where Melanie Daniels slaps the other woman to come to her senses).<br /><br />The plot itself is borrowed from many other movies, where government experiments are to be faulted for outbreaks, plagues, irresponsible human testing etc etc etc, but the overall story, of being trapped in that situation, and not being able to go more than 30 ft, without getting devoured by the unseen-well that never gets old!<br /><br />I favored the Black and White version, because the colors and shadows were more pronounced, but both versions were a fun ride. I had hoped for a different ending, where everone does not get shot, but I have to admit, it added extra terror and sympathy for the lead character. I enjoyed the scene where the big creature crosses in front of the car. I realize the CGI was not touted to be particularly advanced but that scene actually had an existential feel to it. The combination of the creature's sounds and the awe at its might, was effective.<br /><br />Overall the acting was very exaggerated, but I wonder if the film makers didn't intend it be a little tongue in cheek. I'll need to watch the extras to find out. PQ/AQ 4/5, as the picture was a little soft in parts,and the sound not quite as powerful as I thought.<br /><br />This movie is a good time, and worthwhile for fans of the genre!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>There has been -- and probably will be for some time -- speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from Stephen King's novella by the same name: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451223292">The Mist</a>. There's good and bad in equal measure, depending upon your stance on Hollywood Horror versus the literary kind. But let's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end...<br /><br />Equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn, the novella (published in 1985 in a short story collection entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451168615">Skeleton Crew</a>) was, well, phenomenal. It is the type of story most horror fans associate Stephen King with. Compartmentalized. Freakishly different. Plays on morality. Just flat-out good writing. King did well back in the 70s and 80s, but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly bad <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743417682">From a Buick 8</a> and the equally putrid <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074343627X">Dreamcatcher</a> (which was made into a very unfortunate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRUM">film</a> starring Morgan Freeman). What exactly happened to Mr. King, I'm not sure. He hadn't had his brush with death (yet) and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine (most notably the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743424425">The Shining</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169514">It</a>). Regardless of past or more present works, Mr. King did get lucky with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption</a> in that he got Frank Darabont to write the screenplay and direct. The Shawshank Redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world, and it is one of my top ten favorites. The transfer from book to film went exceptionally well, and this was in no small part thanks to Darabont's work. Darabont did similarly nice work on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDU">The Green Mile</a>, but it didn't quite reach the heights that Shawshank did. But when I saw that Darbont was attached to this film, I leapt at the chance to watch it.<br /><br />Needless to say (because of my cool acceptance rating), I found The Mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas. But let's start with the good...<br /><br />The creature effects. The combined work using CGI and stop animation was excellent. KNB EFX Group as the Special Effects crew and CafeFX doing the Visual Effects showed us some eerily nice work. The ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZN802W">Into the Wild</a>) stars as Mrs. Carmody, the bible-thumping, old-testament wielding, blood-seeking, Christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella. I hated her in the novella and I hated her here, meaning that Gay Harden pulled off a very good performance.<br /><br />Any further positives however (save one), get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters. Too many times we get the `shock' effect simply for shock effect, rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation (i.e., people of differing backgrounds at each others' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation). Characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before. People leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them. Main actor Thomas Jane who plays David Drayton could have been played by just about anyone, meaning that I didn't find his portrayal of this character memorable (whereas Gay Harden nailed her role) And the list goes on...<br /><br />Getting back to the ending -- and my final positive note -- I have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium. In the novella, Mr. King leaves the ending fairly ambiguous. Which I liked. I liked a lot. And here, in the film, that gets changed to a much more somber ending. Although I liked the fact that Darabont didn't sugarcoat the final act, I do think he could have kept King's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions. But let's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre, which is why it got a semi-positive rating from me.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I reread the novella again in Skeleton Crew before watching the movie.  It had been many years since I had picked it up, so I wanted to refresh my memory.  After watching the movie I can say that the director stayed fairly true to the source material.  Little things here and there are fiddled with, but the King story is basically brought to the screen the way the author wrote it.  The biggest change is the ending.  Where the author left a rather ambiguous ending, the director gave a very definitive and dark ending that reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode with the astronauts in the desert.  All in all it is a pretty faithful adaptation to the story.  As far as Stephen King movies go, this is a winner.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O5T5VAQ3TD17.html">A3O5T5VAQ3TD17</a><br/><p>This is an awesome movie, great special effects, this is def. a movie to own, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Yeah, it ends differently than the story.But it sure gives you something to think about.

Films like JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING and David Cronenberg's remake of THE FLY are about as great as you can get, because not only are they excellent horror films with taut and terrifying moments, they transcend the genre itself. Where Carpenter's THE THING is at its heart a story of utter paranoia and distrust and Cronenberg's THE FLY is a star-crossed love story set against the backdrop of the over-extension of man's reach, Frank Darabont's THE MIST is about how easily and quickly society can break down to its basest and ugliest forms when confronted with a seemingly apocalyptic threat.<br /><br />Thomas Jane (in what should have been a star-making role) plays David Drayton, a mild-mannered artist in a coastal Maine town who finds himself as the voice of reason when an eerie mist blows into town which may or may not be concealing an army of preternatural forces, trapping a small but substantial section of the townspeople in the local supermarket. He, along with his young son Billy (a nicely-cast Nathan Gamble) a pretty young schoolteacher Amanda (played beautifully by Laurie Holden) and a wonderfully crotchety old lady (played by Frances Sternhagen), along with a few others, are trying to hold their ground and their grip on an already-tenuous situation against local Bible-thumping lunatic Mrs. Carmody (played a little too over-the-top by the usually understated Marcia Gay Harden) who is using some unusual coincidences to prove that this attack is the wrath of God, and using the other townspeople's fear to cause a threat within the store that rivals the threat from without.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss this film as simple escapism, but it is so much more. Great performances by Jane, Holden, Sternhagen and supporting players Andre Braugher and William Sadler put this film above the recent flurry of classic horror remakes, watered-down Japanese-to-American retcons and the "torture porn" sub-genre that have been masquerading as horror films, and it does so with great writing, great effects, great direction and the single most disturbing ending of a film since David Fincher's SE7EN.<br /><br />The last horror film that I saw that seemed truly original and terrifying and iconic was Victor Salva's JEEPERS CREEPERS. While this film may not be quite as visceral as that, it's still been five years since that film came out and since then, for the most part, Hollywood has been cranking out films like THE RING, THE GRUDGE, remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN and THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and the ad nauseam SAW series and its fellow torturers HOSTEL and TURISTAS. Every so often, a terrific little indie horror gem like Lucky Mckee's MAY or John Fawcett's GINGER SNAPS will pop up, but that's all they do. THE MIST is the only horror film to come out of Hollywood in the last 5 years that has had any lasting effect on me, like the great horror films of the 70's like HALLOWEEN, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, or some of the greats of the 80's like THE THING, THE FLY or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. All of these films transcend the genre as THE MIST does, and it really seems like this is a dying breed of horror film when this film does half the business of lesser recent entries like I AM LEGEND, or 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, where, while decent films, are hardly the films that are likely to keep you up nights haunting you. THE MIST will either haunt you or anger you, but it will provoke debate, especially with an ending that may be on the level of nihilism that rivals that of Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.<br /><br />For my money, this was one of the very best films of last year, and I can only hope that in the future, this is a film that will be revisited and rediscovered as many of the now-classic horror films have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Of the 108 Stephen King adaptations for film or TV, I am only familiar with a handful of them - 16 to be exact (counting also the film under review). Frank Darabont joins a list of remarkable past alumni (Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, John Carpenter) with this well-crafted monster movie with pretensions. Actually, Darabont is no newcomer to Stephen King territory - having already based three of his four feature-length movies on his work! - but this is the first movie I've seen from the director and, perhaps significantly, the only one of the three which is horror-related.<br /><br />Frankly, I wasn't even aware of the film at all before reviews of its DVD release started cropping up through my Amazon friends. As far as I can recall, theatrical release wasn't spread so widely, perhaps the name Stephen King (because of rampant overexposure over the years) nowadays no longer enjoys the same crowd-pulling effect as it did during his heyday. Still, judging by that modest crowd of actors assembled for the film and its clearly intentional "realism" (read a flat, made-for-TV look and relatively restrained gore), the film-makers hardly endeavored to boost its box-office chances any. Besides, we have lately been literally invaded by monster/alien movies so that it isn't hard for one (even as solid as this one is) to get lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />This story takes place in a small seaside American town that wakes up one morning to find itself enveloped in a mysterious cloud of thick mist. Soon enough, it becomes abundantly evident that this houses a barrage of slimy, unnaturally-enlarged and very deadly creatures of the bugs variety. To this tried-and-tested formula, Darabont and King add other much-used elements (religious fanaticism, military incompetence, scientific experimentation, impending apolcalypse, etc.) but take them beyond their bleakest and most ironic possibilities. The last half-hour, in fact, is where the film gets all choked up in message-mongering - complete with an overwhelmingly melancholic score. Indeed, learning that Darabont has even "presented" his own original black-and-white vision (as opposed to version) of this film on DVD only adds smoke to the fiery theory that this was intended from the start to be much more than a mere monster movie. Despite good work all around and the best intentions, THE BIRDS (1963), it certainly ain't...<br /><br />Anyhow, the festering tensions between the diverse factions trapped (for most of the film) inside a supermarket and the inherent suspense present in the group's generally unsuccessful excursions on the "outside" are skillfully handled and, despite the anonymity of the actors involved, some of the townspeople are blessed with full-blooded characterizations, most prominently Marcia Gay Harden (as the unbalanced, ultra-religious spinster). Most viewers won't fine the characters in this film intriguing but you can't deny Marcia Gay. I was pretty tired the night I watched it but it never let me take even a yawn! The story was superb with great thrills and suspense, but the thing that intrigued me most was the story had some realistic touch. Altogether I have to say this movie is not worth a miss.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>If you loved Alien or Aliens, you will love this movie.  Some characters were a bit over the top, but the movie had it all - a little comedy (some really quirky characters, such as the Bible lady), a little sadness (some of the major characters end up dying), and a lot of edge-of-your-seat drama (very thrilling scenes of humans vs. alien creatures).<br /><br />The ending was shattering, but very realistic.  All in all, I would have given it a 5 if it had toned down the swearing.  One of the best movies I have seen period.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things:<br />-It seems to be influenced by HP Lovecraft; they are all otherworldly bugs and shapeless monsters.  Definately some of the freakiest monsters ever put on the screen.<br />-Also, special effects are pretty good.<br />-There are only a few bad scenes of violence, but they are exceptionally brutal, and serve to make everything scarier!<br />-Even scarier than the monsters are the people.  Most of the movie focuses on how everybody reacts to the situation, and there are many mixed and wild reactions.  Many people act dumb and irrationaly, and few are sensible.  This makes for very realistic and intense drama.<br />-As a whole, it is a deep, brutal exploration of human nature in an extreme apocalyptic situation.  The whole film is very thought-provoking.<br />-It's not corny or cliched like some of the other Stephen King works.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />-The ending was exceptionally brutal, and can be seen as either good or bad.  I think it could have had a happier ending, but as it is in the film, it does leave you thinking and feeling bitter.<br />-Sometimes, you just want to punch these stupid characters in the face (then again, this could be a good thing too, because the drama really absorbs the audience).<br />-From what I hear, it's not as accurate to the original book (especially with the ending).<br /><br />This definately goes above and beyond my expectations.  It's not the typical horror flick; it's an intense thought-provoking study of people under pressure.  The result is explosive, and unfortunately, highly believable.  Even though it is stylistically similar to "Dreamcatcher," or "The Thing," it is more akin to "Children of Men" or "Pan's Labyrinth." Because of this, it is frightening on all levels, and would consider this to be one of the best Stephen King-inspired films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>After a raging storm that knocks out all power, David Drayton and his young son Billy head into town for supplies.  Along for the ride is neighbor Norton, whom David doesn't normally get along with.  Before leaving home, David and his family wonder about the strange mist hovering over the lake.  Once in town, he discovers the power is out there too, and the checkout lines in the grocery store are long.<br /><br />Then, they notice the mist rolling across the store's parking lot.  They hear screams, and a large earthquake-like thud shakes the store and silences the air raid siren.  A man runs into the store from the mist, informing the people that there's "things" out there.  Now trapped inside the store, the large crowd wonders what to do and who to believe.  Shopper Mrs. Carmody, a crazy lady from town, works the desperate crowd into a frenzy of religious fanaticism.  There ARE things in the mist, tentacles and large bugs and flying daemons, and as Mrs. Carmody preaches the end of the world and expiation via blood, David must find a way to save himself and his son, and the few who follow him.<br /><br />I can't help but compare the movie to the story, which I've read several times and consider it one of King's best stories (before he lost his talent and began writing drool).  In the book, King really captured the crowd mentality when people are shoved together in a tight place.  It didn't work as well in the movie translation.  In my summary of the plot, I tried to stay true to the movie, which in all fairness follows the book quite well until the ending.  I was disappointed in the movie for several reasons.  The director used all unknown actors, no big names to anchor the film.  The acting was rather wooden, and Mrs. Carmody should have been older and fatter (plus I miss the bright yellow pantsuit she wore in the book).  The FX was ok but not spectacular.  The scriptwriter changed the ending, and not for the better.  What this film really needed was a bigger budget to make it work; it's not grisly enough to be 'B' horror, and not performed well enough for mainstream films.  All in all, it turns out to be just a mediocre film that didn't live up to my expectations.  Rent, don't buy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>On the two disc edition of The Mist, on disc 2 there is a glorious Black and White version of the film, with an introduction by the director Frank Darabont.  Darabont says he originally wanted The Mist to be in B&W and be a throwback to the 50's and 60's horror movies such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013D8LAE">Night of the Living Dead</a>, which I felt it had a lot in common with.  Darabont says this can be considered his director's cut.  I knew he directed two other King favorites <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWQU">The Green Mile</a>, but I didn't realize his other contributions to the horror genre, until I checked out IMDB.  Starting in 1980 as a production assistant on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JXVP">Hell Night</a> and going on to write the screenplays for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0780630866">A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5RM">The Blob</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X76XC">The Fly II (Collector's Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767811097">Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</a>.<br /><br />The Mist is an entertaining, at times infuriating, tragic horror film filled with fun scares in the form of 50s and 60s era monsters lurking in the mist outside and the uglier monsters inside that apply to our present day, a true creature double feature.<br /><br />Darabont reminded me of Romero and his use of horror and social commentary.  Here he makes an atmospheric horror movie, our main character, David Drayton, played by, Thomas Jane, (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002E233">Deep Blue Sea</a>) designs posters for horror movies, followed by a big storm, and ultimately has David and his son (mom at home) trapped in a supermarket with the towns people.  Similar to the mall in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9QIK">Dawn of the Dead [Blu-ray</a>] evil lurks outside the market, not in the form of zombies that can be seen, but old school monsters that lurk out in the mist.  That's the surface of the film, but as we go through the layers we find much more, such as the monsters that lurk inside the supermarket.  Human nature, when afraid and backed into a corner and the role the military plays once the smoke clears are some of the movie's other factors.<br /><br />The Black and White Version is the way to go, to get that old school feel the director intended, even the way the title on the dvd is written is like an old monster movie.

He had done a great job with King's prison tales <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000399WI">The Shawshank Redemption</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CWQU">The Green Mile</a>, but is equally good at working on King's thrillers.<br /><br />***This may contain some spoilers.  I think I'm vague enough, but some like to be warned of any potential spoilers within a review.  So, here's your warning***<br /><br />This film is based on a novella, a short novel that is usually less than 150 pages, which helps to keep this film tightly focused on a small band of people trapped in a supermarket as a strange mists surrounds an entire town.  Within this mist are incredible monsters that are very effectively produced as part CGI and part puppets.  They do look frighteningly real and not as obvious special effects.  As with any of these "band of survivors" kind of films there are an odd collection of characters, but I can't label them as stereotypes and that is a welcome change for this genre of film.<br /><br />All the actors bring a real and human quality to their characters.  Thomas Jane, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00002E233">Deep Blue Sea</a>, King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRUM">Dreamcatcher</a>, and husband to Patricia Arquette of NBC's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBNMS">Medium</a> for which he had a role on two episodes, has always been something of an action actor with passing acting abilities, but here the director gets a sincere and highly emotional performance out of him.  Andre Braugher as the initially hostile out-of-towner, turned nice guy, turned angry guy, turned determine guy is performed quite well considering the complexity of the actual role.  You see the tension with him all the time, but you also see a "nice guy" trying to come out and get along with others who struggles with insecurities.  In addition, there is Toby Jones, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NOIX48">The Painted Veil</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341SC">Infamous</a>, as a shift manager who is keenly insightful about people in general, but believably so.  The supermarket is rounded out with the likes of Frances Sternhagen who graces any film she's in, William Sadler who is great at playing semi-villains, and the ever reliable Jeffrey DuMunn who is no stranger to starring in King films.  Lauren Holden as a kind of a stand-in wife/son to Thomas Jane's character and his son while trapped at the supermarket and is good in her role.  She may be best known as the macho cop in the horror film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCFO0I">Silent Hill</a>.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't note the Oscar-winning actress Marcia Gay Harden's role as the sick, sadistic, Bible thumping, I'm against the world, bitter religious zealot Mrs. Carmody.  In the Stephen King world this is the Christian stereotype as it was in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385086954">Carrie</a> novel.  King himself admits that he has had a very negative view of Christians prior to his near fatal car accident, and often painted them with the same brush he painted Mrs. Carmody.  Even prior to his accident he was beginning to lighten up on his view of Christians and his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451933028">The Green Mile - Six Volume Box Set</a>is a good example to that softening of King's views.  Having said this, Harden plays this role a bit over-the-top at times, but is still convincing.  She does eventually become a caricature of sorts, but she is very compelling to watch and I give her kudos for that kind of performance.<br /><br />As much as the actors make this a very enjoyable film, much credit for the success of this highly effective horror film is the writing and directing by Danabont who just knows how to handle King's stories.  King often fought with his publishers when he had downer endings.  Publisher hate it when an author kills off the heroes in a story or evil appears to win, but King, to his credit, never flinched and has had numerous stories in which his main characters die and evil won.  I admire that with King and some of his most effective stories have been the ones with downer endings.  I'm not saying who dies in this story and who doesn't in this story or if the evil in the mist wins as I don't believe in spoiling someone else's enjoyment of a film, but this adaptation is very faithful to the novella and it does have a strong ending.  In fact, the ending is quite shocking, moving, harrowing, and just plain jaw-dropping.  I doubt anyone would see it coming which makes it all that much more effective.<br /><br />This is an outstanding horror film that is worthy of a place in your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The Mist<br />Directed by Frank Darabont<br />Starring Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, Toby Jones<br /><br />Weinstein Company | 2007 | 126 min | Rated R | Sep 16, 2008<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Two-disc set (2 BDs)<br />Region free<br /><br />Frank Darabont hasn't directed many movies, but three of them are in my collection. The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are both adapted from Stephen King stories and so is The Mist. Despite its lower budget, The Mist is another strong entry from Darabont.<br /><br />The thing I like about Stephen King is that most story elements are based in the real world. We can identify with the type of town and the characters who inhabit it. He usually changes one or two things to transport us into another world. In this instance, the other element is the mist. We learn that it has leaked through from an entrance to another dimension, along with some of the creatures from that reality.<br /><br />The exposition is handled well and draws the viewer into the situation. After a brief description of David Drayton's (Jane) home life, he travels into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and neighbor Brent Norton (Braugher). While the three are shopping in the local supermarket, a man runs in with blood on his face warning that there's something in the mist.<br /><br />Some of my favorite stories examine what happens when society breaks down. Stephen King seems to enjoy writing about it too. The Stand is one of the best novels dealing with the psychological effects of a catastrophe and The Mist delves into the same territory. Imagine the situation. You're in a store and a mist descends outside. A man runs in injured and shouts a warning. Do you listen, or do you ignore the warning and assume it's a natural phenomenon?<br /><br />Some people are deeply rooted in routines. They know how much they earn and live one or two paychecks away from disaster. Their routine means that they rarely have to think about anything out of the ordinary. They may excel in one or two known situations, but be completely out of their depth when facing the unknown. That's when we see who the real leaders are. Who will crumble and who will adapt and remain calm under pressure? Will anyone lose touch with reality completely and start behaving in unpredictable ways? Would you steal to feed your family or kill to protect someone? The Mist shows what happens in just such a situation. The results are interesting to say the least.<br /><br />My favorite character is Ollie (Jones), the assistant manager of the store. He's a great reminder of how people are not always what they seem. Looking like an older version of Radar O'Reilly, he's able to step up and make a difference in a crisis.<br /><br />Darabont doesn't spend a fortune on special effects, but the result is convincing to me. As the story unfolds, we see a variety of creatures. Some of them are close to creatures we know while others are like nothing we have ever seen.<br /><br />Another interesting choice from Darabont is the use of sound in the movie. Most entries in this genre would feature music heavily during every action scene. Darabont chooses to just show the events as they happen without trying to influence our mood with music. There are a few muted sound effects for most of the movie, but nothing more. The result is that we are drawn into the situation even more as if we are left alone to think about how we would handle the situation. The one exception is in the last few minutes of the story when The Host of Seraphim (Dead Can Dance) is played during a pivotal scene. Its impact is greatly enhanced due to the absence of music in the remainder of the movie.<br /><br />Darabont changes King's original ending. It's a brave choice and will annoy a lot of people. King remarked that he wishes he had thought of it. It's a resolution of sorts and it's certainly not typical Hollywood fare.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />The Mist Blu-ray package consists of two discs; one showing the movie in color and the other in black and white. Darabont is known to prefer the black and white version as it adds to the intended feel. While I like both, I slightly prefer the color version. Detail is good in both and there's nothing to complain about. It's not up there with the best the format has to offer, but it's more than adequate.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The movie is driven by dialogue and is as much a character study as a monster movie. With no music for the vast majority of the running time, this is not the type of movie to show off your sound system. It handles everything it's supposed to without going over the top.<br /><br />Special Features 4/5<br />The commentary track goes into considerable depth and is an excellent addition for those who want to know how everything was done. There are also 15 minutes of deleted scenes, a "making of" feature and a discussion with King and Darabont. There are several other features focusing on certain scenes or special effects. Overall, over two hours, and a good supplemental package that's worth seeing at least once.<br /><br />The Mist is a fun world to visit for two hours. See it if you are a fan of horror or psychological drama and enjoy a decent Blu-ray presentation.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Frank Darabont's "The Mist" would have made Howard Phillips Lovecraft proud, even if he would have had to leave the house to watch it.<br /><br />Bank on it: when you see a Stephen King film that does NOT INVOLVE direction by Stephen King and the material is excellent in the first place, you're in for a terrifying ride: ("Salem's Lot", "Pet Cemetery", "The Shining" all attest to this) this film is a case in point.  Thomas Jane gives the same performance he always does but it works as the befuddled, terrified and courageous Everyman David Drayton<br />makes a simple decision with tremendous consequences: he goes to the grocery store.<br /><br />The sheer mystery and grotesque nature of what goes on is convincing by virtue of the relatively banal, provincial setting: relations between annoying townsfolk and the "artist" (Drayton) escalate when the fantastic is finally introduced into their own lives.  The scene in which the teenage boy makes an unwise decision to be a tough guy in front of the other locals lets you know what you're in for.  Andre Braugher is in this movie for about five seconds and I have no idea why: he's such a great actor and I would have been curious as to how his character would have dealt with the situation if he hadn't denied it was happening, or thought it was an "inside joke" being played by the locals.  Scarier than the things outside, though, is the religious fanatic played by Marcia Gay Harden, known as Mrs. Carmody to anyone who even skimmed the novella: the ultimate bad religious, the most irritating and horrifying phenomena in perhaps the entire tale, she takes full advantage of the situation to impose her blasphemous view of the Old Testament on the dumbstruck crowd, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters.  When the young marine is offered up to the looming horror outside as "Food for the Gods", one can barely watch.<br /><br />But the ending: this is key here.  You will never see it coming and it is absolutely perfect.  Great!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>In 1920, H. P. Lovecraft wrote a short story called From Beyond about an alien environment inhabited by horrific creatures that overlaps with our own environment. Stephen King often gives credit to Lovecraft as inspiration for his Horror writings (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/042518160X">Stephen King's Danse Macabre</a>).<br /><br />Therefore, it's no surprise--and perhaps not a coincidence--that King wrote a story circa 1980 called The Mist that explores what might happen if a window to that alien environment was inadvertently opened...wide...releasing a dense mist filled with monsters. (The Mist was later published in one of King's collection of short stories called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451168615">Skeleton Crew</a> {1985}.)<br /><br />Fast forward to the late 2007 release of a feature film adaptation of The Mist. But what's really interesting is that the director of The Mist is the same guy that directed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption</a>...Frank Darabont...so my expectations for The Mist were very high! (Darabont also directed King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDU">The Green Mile</a>.)<br /><br />And my high expectations were met in the film adaptation of The Mist...mostly. The story in the movie is very loyal to the book (as I remember anyway...I read it more than 20 years ago!): A monster infested mist descends on a small lakeside town, and we follow the perils of a group of townspeople trapped in a grocery store when the mist hits. On screen, some of the actions and decisions by the terrified captives are a little hard to grasp, and the movie has a truly haunting and affecting ending that was much more depressing than the book's. Otherwise, the story from the book seems completely intact.<br /><br />There's great suspense. Good acting. I was thoroughly entertained. And unlike too many film adaptations of King's Horror stuff...The Mist was very well done and preserved a lot of the prose, shock and character of the original story.<br /><br />Any Horror fan should enjoy The Mist, and any fan of King and the original story shouldn't miss this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>This is of course not your standard dumb monster horror flick, not with a King novella as material and Darabont doing the movie. But it is also not quite satisfactory.<br />There is too much being in two minds going on here! Just look at the reviews, so many of them: so many are absolutely enchanted, so many others are totally put off. That must mean something.<br />The reviewers' split mirrors quite appropriately the film's own schizophrenia: it is about important issues of the American society of today, about its separation in camps, about the split of modern and scientific rationalism versus the spirit of biblical literalism. Pragmatism versus Old Testament is the main message. But the plot is based on the horror vision of science gone wrong, of monsters born out of the hubris of military scientists.<br />How can one get disentangled from that spiderweb? One can't easily, and the ending has a nice touch of futility. Don't get too logical about the ending, many will be frustrated by it, one can even argue that it is not logical, but it is certainly a powerful message.<br />Before watching the film, I knew little about it and somehow hoped that it would be creative with using mist for horror. Then the fact that the mist is actually just hiding monsters came as a bit of disappointment, it somehow cheapened the film. On the other hand, the monsters are quite good, with a distinct Boschian quality. Finally, the main monster is of course good old M.G.Harden who preaches the fear of an apocalyptic kind of god very effectively. Sort of a Lady of the Flies.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>I thought that this movie was a lot of fun! There was the usual mayhem that arises very quickly when people are trapped in one place together, within a day or two in books and movies they start acting crazy and give aliens and monsters reasons to mock us, for trying to end our lives when things go wrong or there is no way out. Well this was no exception, when a small Maine town ( hey it's a King story, of course it's in Maine) gets enveloped in a thick, cloying mist, those fortunate enough who have escaped early can wave goodbye to their friends and family members because something strange is happening and the chances of any survivors are glum.<br /><br />When David Drayton and his son make a quick trip to the supermarket for supplies after an electrical storm, they have no idea that the store will be their salvation and damnation at the same time. Once the store door closes and the fog closes in, screams in the distance tell everyone that this is no ordinary case of bad weather, not only is it mysterious but it houses creepy creatures that honestly scared and shocked me. The first time David encounters the blood hungry things in the mist is an unforgettable experience, paranoia adds another layer of terror as people who don't believe him need to see it for themselves and that is the beginning of the end. This horror flick was a lot of fun but also kept me in great suspense for almost the entire time, a little draining but worth it except I don't recommend getting too attached to any characters....some of them didn't last very long, and the ways their last moments ended were truly excruciating.<br /><br />The movie was pretty fast paced; the acting realistic enough and the creatures were not all CG, so that was refreshing. Highly recommended for lovers of suspense and terror and of course banging endings, this one was shocking and quite honestly very raw, almost painful in a strange way when no amount of relief the ending brought could erase the events that perspired before the last minutes.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Filmmaker Frank Darabont has a real affinity for Stephen King's stories having previously adapted two of the author's non-horror tales (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEDU">The Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) and with his latest film he tackles another King story, The Mist, which comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451168615">Skeleton Crew (Signet)</a> collection of short stories. Darabont's film thankfully flies in the face of the two prevailing trends of gruesome torture porn horror films and lame J-horror remakes to deliver old school scares for a truly satisfying horror film.<br /><br />Darabont does an excellent job establishing the characters, the dilemma they all face, and then pitting them against each other. Some critics had problems with the shrill, Bible-thumping character of Mrs. Carmody as being an easy caricature; however, by the end of the film, all of the things she has said come true. As anyone who has read any of Stephen King's fiction or seen one of his adaptations knows, a recurring motif is how the internal squabbling of a large group of people is as much of a threat as the horror that threatens them. King shows how fragile the trappings of society are and how it only takes one thing to trigger its collapse.<br /><br />What is so refreshing about The Mist is how flawed the characters are as represented by David, a movie poster artist and the film's hero. He gets scared and makes mistakes but rises to the occasion when needed. Is he any less of a hero for doing what he does in the film? Darabont raises some fascinating questions about the notion of heroics and this is nicely realized by Thomas Jane's wonderfully layered performance. The filmmaker has created a clever, tension-filled apocalyptic monster movie that has the balls to go out on such a daring sucker-punch of an ending that really ticked off some fans of the original novella. Darabont's film remains true to the spirit and vibe of King's story despite the radical reworking of the ending.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. He spends the bulk of the track pointing out how he cut costs on this modestly budgeted film and gives credit to the crew members who helped him make it, in particular, the effects people. Darabont goes into the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but the highlight is his explanation/justification of the film's controversial ending. As always, he delivers thoughtful observations and imparts loads of information.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Darabont. One scene provides an interesting bit of insight into Brent's character. There is more of David and Ollie trying to convince the others early on about the outside threat. Also included is more of Mrs. Carmody's religious ramblings.<br /><br />"Drew Struzan: An Appreciation of an Artist" is a profile of this prolific movie poster artist. He has done some of the most memorable posters of all time, including ones for the Star Wars films, E.T. (1982), Blade Runner (1982), and the Indiana Jones films to name but a few. Darabont points out that the introduction of David working in his studio in the film is a tribute to Struzan.<br /><br />There are three Webisodes hosted by Darabont that provide a behind-the-scenes look at three scenes in the film and show what it looks like on the set juxtaposed with final product. We get to see how they did various practical effects in these scenes.<br /><br />Also included are three trailers.<br /><br />The second disc features a black and white version of the film that Darabont claims, in his introduction to it, is his preferred version because it was intended as an homage to classic horror films of the mid-1960s.<br /><br />"When Darkness Came: The Making of The Mist" takes a look at the origins of the film. Stephen King sings Darabont's praises and talks about how he trusted the filmmaker with the material. There is plenty of on the set footage where we see the cast and crew in action. None of the major studios wanted to do it but Bob Weinstein gave it the greenlight so long as Darabont agreed to do it cheaply and in very little time. This is an excellent look at how this film came together.<br /><br />"Taming the Beast: Shooting Scene 35" takes a look at the scene where the mutant bugs and birds invade the supermarket. It's the most action-packed scene in the film and was a challenge to shoot and coordinate because it involved a tricky combination practical and digital effects, lots of extras, and stunts.<br /><br />"Monsters Among Us: A Look at the Creature FX" examines the designs for the various creatures in the film. He employed effects legend Greg Nicotero and illustrator extraordinaire Bernie Wrightson to design them and make them exotic-looking yet realistic enough so it seemed like they could really exist. It was a mix of CGI and practical mechanical creatures and puppetry.<br /><br />Finally, there is "The Horror of It All: The Visual FX of The Mist" which takes a look at Caf&eacute; FX's work on the film's visual effects. Their main guy used to do prosthetic effects and so he had an idea of what would be practical and what would be CGI. His company had very little time and we see the various stages of the effects. We also see how various effects shots in the film were achieved.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>The army's "Arrowhead Project" has poked a hole into another dimension and it may be open for good. A massive and violent thunderstorm pounds a small town in Maine and does tremendous damage. David Drayton (Thomas Jane) takes his young son and his neighbor into town to get supplies and to see what is going on as the power is out. While at the grocery/hardware store an all obscuring mist rolls in and takes visibility to zero. The store is full of customers and a man runs in screaming that there is something in the mist. A man who goes outside is heard screaming and the customers close the doors of the store and prepare for the worst.<br /><br />The customers separate into 3 main groups, those who want to leave, those who want to stay inside and a group forms around a fanatic telling everyone it is the end of days. The store's generator shuts down and a clerk goes out to fix it and he is killed by a monster that attacks. A few try to leave but they either disappear into the mist or are heard screaming as they die....<br /><br />Stephen King's imagination runs wild in this story and the result is a very good storyline full of terrifying creatures let loose into this world. I am a Stephen King fan and own just about everything the man has written and I loved this story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the director and screen writers take liberties with the storyline and change the ending to create some closure that the novella didn't do. I feel that the ending of the movie is just too sad and for me I did not enjoy the movie as well as I enjoyed the book. It is still worth watching but just be aware that if you read the book that the movie is different.<br /><br />This movie features great special effects and they are right out of Stephen King's imagination. That part of the movie follows the book pretty well and I enjoyed it. The acting is very good and I even wanted to shoot Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who is the main leader of the fanatic group.<br /><br />Watch this movie; you will like it if you like Stephen King!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Okay, to start of, I read the short story that this movie is based on, and I must say I was pleased with how well it followed the story. Okay, and also, the acting is great, and the thrills and suspense of this movie are top-notch. The characters are good, and the way they play out is great. The reason I only give this movie 3 out of 5 stars is because of the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone just in case you haven't seen it, I'm just gonna say that it was such a heart-wrenching gut-punch, it was just so... Man.

The acting was decent all around, but nothing special. The CGI looked below par at times, but was effective and chilling for the most part. The biggest complaint most people will have is with the ultra depressing ending. It is totally different from the book, and it doesn't really seem to fit the rest of the movie. I must admit that I liked the anti-hollywood approach Frank Darabont took. Not a bad try from a great Stephen King adapter. I mean this guy did give us The Shawshank Redemption (which was even better than King's book) and The Green Mile.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>When it comes to scary movies, monsters don't do it for me.  Vampires, werewolves, alien beings--they are all entertaining, but not scary.  People terrify me; human fraility scares the crap out of me.  Which is why "The Mist" has long been one of my favorite King novellas: sure, it's a monster tale, but the REAL monsters in the story aren't the ones out in the mist--they're the ones inside the store.  In some cases they are obvious; in others, not.<br /><br />When I first saw "The Mist," I thought it was a good B-movie, with a classic ending (truly one of the best in horror cinema).  I was disturbed more so than usual, but not absolutely floored.  But I thought about it.  And thought about it.  It's been almost a year since I first saw it; I recently watched it a second time (in black and white this time, btw).  And I was terrified.  The special effects are pretty good, though at times they get in the way of the actors.  Let me stress that--the actors, here, are the true stars, not the special effects.  Thomas Jane is phenomenal; Marcia Gay Harden is chilling.  Frank Darabont does a brilliant job of bringing King's tale to the screen (even King himself has stated he wished he'd thought of this ending).<br /><br />The story, for what it's worth, centers around a group of people trapped inside a convenience store.  Outside the plate-glass windows is...the mist.  The mist and the deadly, flesh-eating creatures that lurk in it.  The real story of the movie, the real meat (and the real scary stuff), is what happens to the people trapped inside the store--how they cope with it, to who and what they turn to for comfort.  This is a film that tackles the topic of what would happen when ordinary citizens encounter something truly alien--not something we're halfway familiar with, but something completely outside our capabilities for rationalization.  What WOULD happen if strange beings appeared from practically nowhere and began eating your loved ones?  How would that affect the human psyche?<br /><br />That's what King's tale tried to explain; Darabont's film follows suit.  It is a haunting, subtle film that will stay with you long after it's over, thanks in part to (what I consider to be, at least) one of the greatest horror movie endings ever.  You should also, if given the chance (which thank God you are, on the two-disc edition), watch the film in black & white.  The effects come off as a little cheesier...but that's half the fun.  Because, with a film this dark and disturbing, we'll take the fun wherever we can find it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Critically acclaimed writer and director Frank Darabont ("The Majestic") has proven himself quite adept when it comes to crafting hit feature films based upon some of author Stephen King's best-selling novels. His previous attempts, "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile", resulted in great critical and commercial responses upon being released to theaters, and have found a special place in the hearts and minds of many movie fans along with becoming valued parts of many movie collections. So, when Darabont chose his next film to be based upon the novella "The Mist", yet again written by horror-master Stephen King, expectations were understandably high in regards to his undeniable talent for crafting such excellent films based on novels, a task not easily accomplished by even the most gifted of writers or directors. The downside to being as successful as Frank Darabont has been in his previous adaptations is that, eventually he's bound to make one that doesn't quite resonate as strongly with his audience. Well, it seems that that moment has finally arrived with the release of the box office disappointment, "The Mist", starring Thomas Jane ("The Punisher") and Marcia Gay Harden ("Mystic River").<br /><br />"The Mist" is the story of a small New England town, that one seemingly normal day becomes immersed in this mysterious mist that appeared out of nowhere. At first the local townspeople believed the mist to be nothing out of the ordinary, that is, until one of their neighbors comes storming into the local supermarket scared to death and bleeding profusely from wounds he claimed occurred via creatures hidden within the mist. Now, these ordinary, everyday people must try to stand together to fight a series of extraordinary enemies, while trying to maintain their own sanity and keep their fears from tearing them apart.<br /><br />I have enjoyed Frank Darabont's previous adaptations of Stephen King novels, I found the prison drama "The Shawshank Redemption" to be a very solid drama, with incredible acting and storytelling on display; although I don't consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made as some might. Darabont's next effort was the death row drama "The Green Mile", which to me, was the more superior film of the two Stephen King adaptations that he had made thus far. So, like many moviegoers I believed that his next attempt "The Mist" would be just as good, if not better, than the previous two; however, I was wrong.<br /><br />"The Mist" is, for the most part, an entertaining drama with some horror mixed in from time-to-time. The story is well-paced, featuring plenty of strong character development, and very sharp, well-written dialogue, which is not surprising given Frank Darabont's acclaimed skills as a screenwriter. Where the movie goes wrong, for me at least, is in the final 30 minutes or so of the film. When the people trapped in the supermarket begin to pick sides, it seems realistic to the point that in most cases any human being is going to try to find like-minded individuals in desperate times, such as those depicted in this film; however, I find it somewhat unbelievable that after only being trapped in the supermarket for a mere two days the people would snap so easily with common sense and rationale to the point they were willing to kill over their differences rather than finding a way to survive. Also, the final closing moments of the film were a little too disturbing for me, and essentially removed any sense of entertainment I had been feeling towards this movie, thus causing me to dislike this movie a great deal. I understand that the ending was probably realistic under such dire circumstances, although I would think had I been in those characters' shoes, I wouldn't have made such a rash, and as it turned out, rather unfortunate decision until it was clear that there was no hope left, and even then I'm not sure I would have gone with it. Some of you readers out there may disagree with me on that, and that's fine, but I would think you'd have to admit that their reasoning for taking the actions they took seemed a little impulsive, especially when the strange noise they heard wasn't like all the previous ones, which they previously had no problem waiting to discover just what was making the noise, so the fact that they gave such a knee-jerk reaction seemed out of character for each of them in the scene. I know I'm being quite vague about my dislikes for this film, but if you haven't seen the movie, and are still planning on viewing it, I don't want to ruin the specifics of what takes place in the closing moments.<br /><br />The actors in "The Mist" were very talented group, each delivering very convincing, and believable performances given the strange circumstances occurring to the characters within the movie. Thomas Jane was a great choice to portray the loving father and impromptu leader of the trapped locals within the supermarket, as he created a very realistic character that was full of strong qualities mixed with a dose of arrogance that created a very palpable tension at times between him and some of his neighbors from the town. Marcia Gay Harden was surprisingly very convincing as the religious fanatic that feeds on the fears of her neighbors, seizing an opportunity to convert them to her beliefs of God, and isn't remotely bothered by the means in which she gains followers. The rest of the cast was comprised of various character actors, which I personally don't know the names of though I recognize them from other movies I've seen them in. Each of them did a wonderful job in bringing realism and a mostly neighborly quality to their characters. The downer to having such a solid cast in this movie is that when the craziness begins to set in around the halfway point in the film, some of the actors didn't really sell the change as convincingly as others and it really stood out in places, and was a bit of an annoyance for me.<br /><br />One aspect of "The Mist" that surprised me the most was the excellent CGI work done to create the monsters. Now, I wasn't surprised that the CGI was so well-crafted, I mean in this day of modern cinema there's just no excuse for bad CGI, but for me I didn't expect there to be all that much, if any, CGI to be used in the film. I wasn't aware that there were going to be monsters hidden in the mist, so that was a very welcome and enjoyable surprise. And kudos to the special effects department for creating such creepy, even somewhat disturbing, versions of our various insects and bugs; such as, spiders, flies, mosquitoes, and so on. I thought by including monsters with the mysterious mist (which may have been in the novella, I wouldn't know because I haven't read it) was a good way to separate this movie from "The Fog" which was a movie about another small town being plagued by a mysterious fog that brought death and despair to the townspeople.<br /><br />"The Mist" was an entertaining drama/monster film for the first 90 minutes, but the last thirty minutes of the movie really brought the entire experience down for me. It's sad to have a movie that is so well-written, directed, and acted, be felled by somewhat unbelievable, and in some cases disturbing, plot twists to the point that I was glad when the credits rolled so I could soon begin erasing this movie from my mind. Some people will probably still enjoy "The Mist" regardless of the problems that plague the latter portion of the movie, but for me I'd rather watch the much better Stephen King adaptations from Frank Darabont, and put this one out of sight, and out of mind.<br /><br />"The Mist" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Essentially an unaccredited remake of John Carpenter's "The Fog," "The Mist" is a 50's style B-monster-movie done with 21st Century special effects.  It's the oldie about a group of random strangers trapped in an enclosed space - in this case, a local supermarket - while some unknown threat lurks in the world outside.  But because it's based on a Stephen King novella, it comes with a veneer of deep-think philosophizing to make it seem better than it actually is.<br /><br />It all begins when a strange mist rolls into a small New England town, harboring within it a menace of an indescribable and deadly nature. Local artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is the requisite everyman character who becomes the agreed-upon leader who helps the people trapped in the store cope with the crisis.<br /><br />For the most part, this is standard-issue stuff, with each of the stock characters falling into his or her assigned role - be it the soon-to-be-proven-wrong skeptic, the soon-to-be-cut-down-to-size (in some cases, quite literally) big-mouth braggart, and the curled-up-in-a-fetal-position quivering jellyfish, among others.  Heck, there's even an annoying scripture-spouting end-of-days religious fanatic (deliciously played by an over-the-top Marcia Gay Harden) who gets on everyone's last nerve, and who is really just the crazy ornithologist and her drunken detractor from the diner scene in "The Birds" rolled into one and then writ large.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is filled with people doing and saying some truly unlikely and stupid things, but the second half has a bit more bite to it as it explores the ways in which desperate people will turn on one another through fear and superstition, and, in so doing, become a greater threat to their own survival and safety than the thing outside.  But its bleak, oh-so-predictable "ironic" ending makes us pine for the days when "The Twilight Zone" managed to do this sort of thing on a weekly basis with a whole lot less hyperventilation and fanfare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FFPPPIOSI36M.html">A1FFPPPIOSI36M</a><br/><p>For a monster movie, this is a great film.<br /><br />The premise is simple, a mist (that spawns all types of monsters) surrounds a supermarket, trapping patrons inside. When somebody goes outside, they get killed in gruesome fashion. While it may appear that there is safety inside, since it is a grocey store , with big plate-glass windows, it is just a matter of time before the monsters get in. What I just described is your basic silly monster movie. The premise is ridiculous and it is unimportant what caused this phenomenon.<br /><br />What makes this movie good, is that the focus is on how the people inside of the grocery store try to cope with each other. There is betrayal, hysteria, allegiances and other relationships which actually is the primary focus of the film. There is a pragmatic and doting father with his son, a crazy religous zealot, mindless small-town yahoos, a pompous lawyer and other representatives of opposite polarities which make the human survivors much more monstrous towards each other than the dinosaur/monsters lurking outside. Like George Romero from "Night of the Living Dead", some of the melodramatic conflict is a metaphor for real life issues like racism, religous fanaticism, zenophobia and desperation.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. The main knock on this movie is the extremely dark and downer of an ending. The ending is not typical of a mainstream "happy ending". The ending is not stupid and it is consistent with the plot and progession of the characters. I think the ending is not appreciated because this was a cheesy monster movie with a real serious and emotional ending.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is better than 90% of horror movies out there.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>this is good movie its kinda different and special effects are great the monsters look real and the people seem real except some or all seem little bit dumb to me, i wouldnt act like any of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>2007's "The Mist" is director Frank Darabont's third stab at a Stephen King story, after "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile."<br /><br />THE STORY: A strange mist falls upon a Maine village wherein numerous townspeople hold up in a supermarket. Within the mist lurks strange insect-like creatures, big and small. Two groups slowly develop within the market: 1.) The sane group who just want to work together and survive and 2.) The increasingly-lunatic apocalypse mongers.<br /><br />Let me first address what doesn't work, and then we'll look at the film's many positives:<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The initial set-up of the story is fine until about the 35-minute mark when I started rolling my eyes at the character stereotypes and their unbelievable actions. For instance, Andre Braugher, who plays Thomas Jane's black neighbor, insists that Jane and a handful of others are cruelly joking with him about a tentacled creature that killed a grocery boy. The man is ridiculously paranoid of imagined slights and it's just not believable.<br /><br />Then there's the cliched self-righteous, hate-mongering, doomsday-obsessed "Christian" played by Marcia Gay Harden. I'm not saying people like this wacko don't exist (after all, Jesus plainly stated "There will be false prophets; you'll recognize them by their fruits"), it's just that she doesn't come off believable. She also lacks the charismatic flair necessary to convert half of the people to her lunatic fringe.<br /><br />These are just two examples; there are more cartooney stereotypes that tempted me to tune out, the worst being when the wacko group attempts to sacrifice a guy for their deliverance. The word that kept coming to my mind was "Dumb." But I accepted this dumbness and persevered on the grounds that the people in the store are obviously a microcosm of American society, a melting pot of different beliefs and cultures. Hence, most of the people are TYPES rather than realistic individuals.<br /><br />Another negative is that a full 90-minutes of the 2-hour runtime takes place IN the supermarket (or adjoining pharmacy), which gives the film a confined vibe. Alhough this didn't bother me much it could wear out its welcome for some people. The good news is that the ending is truly worth the wait.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: I was wondering what explanation would be given for the mist and the creatures. I figured the revelation would be another roll-your-eyes moment but they came up with a plausible explanation.<br /><br />Some have criticized that all the characters are unlikable, but this isn't true at all. For instance, Thomas Jane is a great protagonist. All hell's literally breaking loose but he keeps his head at all times. The only other film I've seen him in is "The Punisher." He's just a great ultra-masculine leading man in the manner of Eastwood, Heston, Reynolds, Stallone, Bronson, Brando, etc.<br /><br />There are numerous other likable characters like the beautiful Laurie Holden who plays the schoolteacher Amanda. She becomes Jane's companion-in-place-of-his-wife and substitute mother to his son. Amanda is truly spiritual, full of love, mercy and compassion. She's the antithesis of the Pharisaical Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). For instance, Carmody goes on and on with her religious blather and Amanda simply responds, "You're too Old Testament."<br /><br />Amanda wouldn't say this unless she was familiar with the differences between the Old and New Testaments. This would indicate that she's likely a Christian of some sort, which is substantiated by her truly loving spirit (not that non-Christians can't be loving, so don't get me wrong; just that agape love is the core fruit of the Christian faith, which is why Jesus taught that false prophets can be plainly recognized by their lack of this fruit ~ Matthew 7:15-23. Agape love is one-and-the-same as the "fruit of the spirit" detailed in Galations 5). Why do I point this out? Because it's tempting for Christians to write off "The Mist" due to the character of Mrs. Carmody, who doesn't paint Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.<br /><br />But, again, Jesus said there would be people like this, and there ARE. They're counterfeits. Notice during Mrs. Carmody's solo prayer in the bathroom where she essentially boasts of herself to God, a definite Pharisaical trait. Amanda then enters the restroom, full of love and understanding. Carmody responds with venomous, horribly insulting words, a clear indication that she's not truly what she claims to be.<br /><br />I'm a Christian and am therefore in contact with believers all the time and I can honestly tell you that the majority of Christians don't even remotely resemble Mrs. Carmody. Most Christians in my social circles sincerely walk in love and try to serve God even while they're flawed human beings who have weaknesses and make mistakes. And, yet, there are some hateful legalistic zealots like Mrs. Carmody. One woman I know insists on being addressed as "Apostle Harris" at all times, even though she's not an apostle in the remotest sense. She's got to be one of the most joyless, unkind, hostile people I've ever met (she once "rebuked" me for not praying over a cupcake!!!), yet she masquerades as a supposed Christian leader. Nothing could be further from the truth. She's false, pure and simple.<br /><br />As noted above, the story starts to feel overly confined due to the one-dimensional setting, but the climax is truly worth the wait [NO SPOILERS]. At about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark the film takes on a truly mysterious and awe-inspiring vibe as a handful of people escape into the forboding mist. The score at this point becomes equal parts ominous, beautiful and otherworldly.<br /><br />The potent ending is controversial. Some hate it but it makes a powerful point: Never give up hope because you never know how close you are to the dawn.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: I highly recommend seeing "The Mist." Even though it recalls other mystery/horror films like "Night of the Living Dead," and "Aliens," not to mention "The Fog" and "Messiah of Evil," it possesses its own uniqueness. Yes, some of the characters and characterizations are cartooney and contrived, but -- again -- the characters are meant to be a microcosm of multicultural society. Besides the ending is incredible (even if you oppose one certain aspect) and the story truly is thought-provoking. It successfully provokes the viewer to ponder long afterwards. My wife and I had a nice long discussion on the various social/religious issues and other points. This is a sign of a very worthwhile picture despite its obvious dumb elements.<br /><br />GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Suffice it to say I was impressed. This is one of the best transfers of a Stephen King story in many years. The acting, screenplay, sets, and special effects were great. You feel you are part of the action. You will identify with this group of people being stranded in a grocery store with only a thin plate glass window keeping the horrible creatures outside from devouring them. I know I was on the edge of my seat and found myself drawn in by the great character development. The trip of a small party to the Drugstore next door was harrowing. Each person in the store was very believable. Including the religious zealot that was drawing people to her camp for the "End of Days". Once her camp starts snatching people to throw to the creatures a small group lights out to find rescue. The ending is remarkable and somewhat poetic. I highly recommend this if you enjoy horror SciFi movies. Great quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to see "Maximum Overdrive", "Phantoms", and "The Relic". - C.

This, I felt, had a stronger storyline and the characters were more flushed out. You got to know the people and root for them to make it. In Cloverfield, I really didn't care if the people lived or not. They were all kind of annoying.<br /><br />Inside the store, it was like it was right out a Twilight Zone episode. Brilliantly done. The CGI on the monsters was...umm...bad. But if you overlook that, this is just a perfect suspenseful horror movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I bought this film, sight unseen, because Frank Darabont has done flawless work with 2 other King adaptations (Shawshank & Green Mile). Aside from being a rip-off of John Carpenter's "The Fog", I expected a whole lot more. I simply didn't find any originality in the goings-on, with the exception of the excellent, ironic ending. After reading previous reviews, I must say I thought Andre Braugher played his annoying character fairly well, and the usually reliable Marcia Gay Harden was, indeed, over the top. (Piper Laurie might've done it better, since it's what she does well). Thomas Jane was fine, as was Laurie Holden; there are other King connections, too, with fine performances from Jeffrey deMunn (Green Mile) and Frances Sternhagen (Misery). The monsters weren't terribly original, and it just seemed like the film was lacking focus during the middle part. The ending, however, was so totally devastating that I'm glad I stuck it out. I await Mr. Darabont's next film, which I hope will be his redemption.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>A lot of horror films lately have fell into 2 categories: the so-called "gorno" type films where the film contains some of the more vile and disgusting imagery this side of Cannibal Holocaust while the other believes by putting in a whole bunch of scenes that make audiences jump and preferably has a creepy kid. The faults are of course gore disgusts, doesn't scare and having a bunch of scenes that make people jump out of their seat doesn't stay with you long enough to get under your skin. "The Mist", directed by Frank Darabont, at least approaches a horror movie by filling the film with tension and unease; it's just too bad it makes some faults with other things as well.<br /><br />Artist David Drayden is heading to the store to pick up some supplies after a particularly violent storm and a strange mist coming from the mountains. Just thinking it's routine, it turns even more strange when the mist rolls into town, blanketing everything and one citizen screams of things within it. While some are skeptical, others see proof that they are essentially trapped by the things that lurk on the outside as well as threatened by those that are in the inside, but not monsters necessarily but people.<br /><br />One of the hardest things to accomplish in a film, especially in the horror genre, is to have characters people watching will care about so that when they go, a feeling of sadness comes. The Mist strives for this in scenes where we get to know some of them but a lot of them are written so one-dimensionally or lacking that it's hard to feel anything for them since there's just not a lot for them to do. Then there's some dumb decisions and illogical choices that it's hard to take what they do and feel something from it. One character I thought worked well, which was Toby Jones as grocery store bagger Ollie while the one that got the most attention (though I didn't care for her) was Mrs. Carmody played by Marcia Gay Hayden who portrays her with such frequent Bible-talk that you feel if any comeuppance should come to her, it's simply because she's annoying and not what she's saying or represents.<br /><br />As a horror film, does it succeed? Well it does to a certain extent since there is some scenes of attacks and bug-related goodness and the servicable-but-not-stellar effect work gets you going but the emphasis on the human characters unhinged and without authority restraints doesn't give it as much creepiness but then there's some scenes like a pharmacy visit that work exceedingly well. As far as the ending is concerned, it's one where emotionally it might watch the feel of the film but doesn't really connect for some reason, either the overbearing music or acting but some feel it's the right kind of ending for this film or it's either too depressing and the ending worked or you didn't like it because of what it did.<br /><br />In many ways the Mist reminds me of a music band that is very musically accomplished but has a terrible singer. You could have things that work well (the direction, tone) but there's always that nagging thing that you can either forgive and keep listening or can't get past that one thing that brings it down.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Stephen King has gotten some really bad adaptions (and you stinkers know exactly who you are ) and some decent ones, tv strangely enough.  This one isn't too bad though I agree with those who say the changed ending ruins the ambiquity of King's original tale. Tom Jane turns in a decent enough performance, interesting CGI. Not a bad one to watch on a Saturday night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Mist (Frank Darabont, 2007)<br /><br />Wait, this is Frank Darabont? The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile Frank Darabont? The guy who actually managed to make two of the four half-decent feature-length Stephen King film adaptations in existence (Misery and 'Salem's Lot are the others-- don't you dare bring up The Shining) made... this? To be fair, though, the first hour and change is pretty good. But man, I can't remember the last time a Stephen King adaptation blew the ending so badly. I probably should have known what I was getting into when I saw the cast was led by Thomas Jane, who has a string of awful movies behind this one (including the should-have-been-stillborn King adaptation Dreamcatcher), but I still held out hope. How terribly wrong I was.<br /><br />Jane plays David Drayton, the successful artist who, the morning after a big storm, goes into town with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) to get some food and supplies to fix the picture window, through which a tree crashed. While they're in the store, a thick mist rolls into town, and brings nasties with it. Drayton and his neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who aren't entirely fond of each other, are trapped in the store with a number of other refugees, including the demented Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious nut who slowly begins to convince the people that the mist is a plague from God, and requires human sacrifice. Some army folks from the top-secret base up the hill, however, might have a different explanation-- if anyone can get them to talk.<br /><br />Like I said, the first hour isn't bad, even if Darabont does break one of the cardinal rules of a good monster movie (don't show the bad guy too much). After that, it goes way, way downhill, turning first into a mindless action movie and then into... I'm not sure I have the words to describe what it becomes next. Imagine the cheapest, most suck-out ending you can think of, and then multiply it by three. I mean, it doesn't even work within the context of the scene that came just before it, for heaven's sake. And King actually liked it? This is the guy who wrote "Survivor Type"? I weep.<br /><br />Turn it off after the first hour, and it's fine. **</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Sorry but this is one of those run-of-the-mill monsters in the dark or creeps in the fog movies. The monsters are not scarier. The victims are standard group.  Some are heroes, some are rats, and some are just fillers.  If nobody gets out alive, we will be better off.<br /><br />The miracle is how they can think of new deadly fog things for two hours and seven minutes without getting bored.  It's a wonder that somebody can watch for two hours and seven minutes without using the fast-forward button.  I suggest that you keep the fast-forward button handy right after the beginning credits.  You can push it until the ending credits, and you will have saved two hours and nearly 7 minutes.<br /><br />Basic story Mist finds town, people hide in store, some people stick nose out, nose does not return.<br /><br />Both "The blob" and the "Deadly Mantis."

Plus, it's a story I'd rather remember the way I visualized it while reading it than anything that would end up on film.  I wouldn't have given this movie a second thought if it hadn't been directed by Frank Darabont, who's probably the best at sticking to King's books.<br />The Mist is a story of a group of people stranded in a grocery store surrounded by a thick mist full of Lovecraftian beasties.  Of course when you get a group of people together in this kind of horror movie situation, they tend to fall into the usual cliched categories of good guys and bad guys.  It then becomes more of a character study of human behavior, and the outside threat becomes secondary.  It's a premise as old as Night of the Living Dead, but it's a premise I've always found fascinating.<br />All in all I thought the movie was good.  With a few minor exceptions, Darabont is pretty much letter perfect with the King story.  The acting was all around decent and the pacing was good.  My only real complaints come with the creatures.  I don't care what anyone says, fully computer generated monsters do not look good.  They look like something from a video game, and I think it's a cop out to use them.  Animatronic creatures with computer enhancements would have been good because it would at least look like something was actually there with the actors, yet fluid moving enough so it didn't look totally fake.<br />The big controversy about The Mist is the ending.  No one will shut up about, so I guess I won't either.  This is the biggest difference between the novella and the movie.  King left us with an open, "choose your own ending" type of ending for the story.  Darabont leaves us with a grim Twilight Zone type of ending.  Darabont's ending left a real bad taste in a lot of people's mouths(including my wife who complained about it for the rest of the friggin night, totally ruining her mood and depriving me of the nookie I thought I'd be receiving.  Thanks, Frank!).  Of course if Darabont had used King's ending, people would have been whining about that too coz it robs the audience of the closure they so desperately need.  It's a true case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't".  I didn't hate Darabont's ending as much as most people did, though I didn't love it either.  I love the flipping of the bird to a Hollywood ending, we certainly need more of that kind of spirit in big budget movies.  It does have it's lapses in logic though.  NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SPOILER THAT YOU NO DOUBT ALREADY KNOW:  A suicide pact is formed and carried out way too abruptly.  Sure the situation seemed hopeless, but it could have been much more hopeless.  You think you'd hold off on such a life changing decision until it's absolutely down to the wire, especially if your friggin' son is concerned!!  Oh, well.  The film had already been on for about 2 hours at that point, so I guess Darabont just wanted to cut to the chase.  But I do like the suicide and what came afterwards, it's the final slap in the audience's face.  It was just way too abrupt to be remotely realistic.<br />Stephen King writes in his notes in Skeleton Crew that if The Mist were a film, it'd be low budget, in black and white and shown on a drive-in screen.  What a wonderful thought, what a wonderful dream.  Unfortunately in this day and age it will never happen that way.  But I do have to say that for today's state of horror films, The Mist is one of the best we'll see, and Darabont made this great King story probably the best it could have been made.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LXG7XUQNZO6E.html">A2LXG7XUQNZO6E</a><br/><p>Folks, I'm a picky person when it comes to handing out a 5 star rating because I'm a firm believer that ratings like this should be reserved for films that are not only incredible but have weathered the test of time and public opinion. I believe a 5 star film is a film that will be discussed, analyzed and even debated years after we're long gone. A 5 star rating, to me, doesn't mean a film has to be perfect, it just means it's about as entertaining and as well-crafted as you can get for that particular subject matter. That being said, imagine my surprise after watching this when I blurted out, to nobody in particular, "That's a 5 star movie. No doubt about it."<br /><br />The Mist is the undisputed heavyweight champion of Stephen King adaptations bar none. Not too many years ago I was convinced nothing could top Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption until I saw 1408, which I felt was the best King work I'd ever seen on the big screen, but I was wrong on all counts. The Mist takes the prize as the best King work I've EVER seen adapted for cinema. It had everything a viewer could ask for including a hero, a villain, a conspiracy, creatures, gore, love, anger, hate, innocence and even human sacrifice!<br /><br />Thomas Jane isn't what I'd call an acting powerhouse but he is good at what he does and some of his best roles are the "everyman" character. I think he shined even more in this film considering the large majority of the cast in this were relatively unknown and therefore incapable of upstaging Jane and chewing the scenes he was meant to chew. I think the only other person that was able to match Jane's intensity was Marcia Gay Harden as the head honcho religious nut.<br /><br />I've heard quite a few people mention that some of the CG featured here wasn't as great as it probably could have been and I would have to agree to an extent but it's nothing intolerable, just a few small issues here and there. Aside from that there are all sorts of amazing monsters and disgusting gore to entertain fans. I highly recommend this film!</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This movie is the BEST Horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novel. The special effects are lively. The plot is suspenseful and full of twists. The acting is good.<br /><br />What I like the most is it REALISTICALLY deals with ORDINARY PEOPLE'S psychology. For example, when it was clear anybody who left the supermarket would be killed, a lady asked "Who wants to escort me to my car? I need to pick up my children from home". All the men and women would not help her. It emphasized the fact that when death is lurking around, everybody is for himself.<br /><br />From my interpretation, this film also conveys a message that "When human beings play God, the consequences are extremely unbearable."<br /><br />**** Warning. SPOILERS. Please do not read the comments below if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the movie. ****<br /><br />There are two situations that back up the message above. First, the military experiments opened the window to the other world. That was when  the monsters came to town.<br /><br />Secondly, at the end, the male character took the matters in to his own hand. Instead of letting other people decide their fate, he made decision for them. It turned out to be more disastrous than it should.<br /><br />This mvie is on my list of BEST HORROR MOVIES of All Time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3K8TYU7UOUTR0.html">A3K8TYU7UOUTR0</a><br/><p>The Good: Awesome (and I do no use that term lightly) special effects. The monsters in this film were designed by the great Bernie Wrightson, and they are terrifying, diverse and original. The effects were created with a combination of CGI AND models using stop-action animation, and they are really jaw-dropping. This combo of techniques raises the effects above the weightless CGI clutter seen in most films. This is one of the few films about which I can honestly say is worth watching for the special effects and the monsters.<br /><br />The Bad: All the bad that is inherent in Stephen King's novels - meaning cardboard characters and glaringly writerly dialogue; all which serve as a platform Mr. King's childish politics. The characters always feel like "types" and the dialogue he gives them always feels like sudden speeches out of the blue. Nothing ever, ever feels real or natural. With King, folks are very bad (meaning conservative or religious) or very good (meaning liberal and vaguely undeclared religiously). His heroes are always full of jibes and speeches contemptuous of politics, the "govment," and any remotely organized religion. His villains are always quoting the Bible (usually from the Book of Revelations), work for the United States Government/Military, or are intolerant rural (always rural) racists. He also likes to throw in a "strong, independent woman", usually middle aged, completely non-sexual, with a heavy, Maine/northeastern accent, in every novel for good measure.<br /><br />The Ugly: Without giving up the end, suffice to say it is an ending done by a filmmaker determined at any cost to have a shocking ending. I dislike a tacked-on happy ending as much as the next person, and so much of king is soaked in sugar, but this film's conclusion is ugly just for the sake of ugliness.So ugly, in fact, it left me wondering if perhaps the filmmaker was telling us the "crazy" zealot was right all along: perhaps the mist really is a God wrought punishment, and God really is the vengeful Old Testament God, pointing his bloody finger at, well, who exactly? The brave and the liberal? A confused, cheap-shot ending, to say the least.<br /><br />Recommended for the monsters (who seem better scripted than the humans) and nothing else. --Mykal Banta<br /><br />Post-script: It seems the near fatal auto accident that Mr. King suffered seems to have completely upset him in some troublesome ways. The author now finds it perfectly acceptable to have his "good guys" shoot those characters he doesn't like in the face, at close range, in cold blood. There is, of course, the obligitory explainations of "having no choice," but this is nonsense. None of Stephen King's heros seems to understand the concept of a warning or wounding shot, which in the situation depicted in the film would have had devastating effect. Perhaps this was a filmmaker's addition, but none the less, post-accident King seems to revel in ugly brutality in ways pre-accident King would not have. Has the Liberal King become so bankrupt of ideas that killing is the only solution?</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>This was a fun movie. I'm not a big fan of horror flicks, so don't watch'em with any regularity. But, I do enjoy survival thrillers or whatever the specific label is that applies to "The Mist". (I can't remember right now. There is a well used label for just about every type of movie.) Anyway, I like this type of horror flick where you have people trapped, surrounded by some sort of monsters, they struggle to survive, fight the monsters, and then try to escape. The most interesting thing is the fighting that goes on between the people trapped together. Now, that is what works best in "The Mist" to me. The scariest monsters ultimately become some of the people your stuck with. And the movie is ultimately about us and our society. Well it's human nature too, that we are faced with, perhaps just as much as whatever has to do with America. The made-up monsters and nightmare scenerio in which a diverse group of people, a cross section of citizens -sometimes from very different backgrounds, becomes an exploration of real world social problems. Honestly, put me up against the monsters unleashed upon the town anyday, over some of the townsfolk(or city folk, to be fair). (I'm serious. You do NOT want to be trapped with Jesus Junkies if you want to survive.)<br /><br />Why the 1 Star deduction: Rating systems like this are kinda silly anyway, but 5 stars only go to works of perfection like "The Shinning" which is a perfect horror film classic. CGI is abused like hell by filmmakers these days and it's a shame. If they're going to use it I wish they'd use it well. You can tell when they cut corners and did not spend that extra time (and money)fleshing out the details of a creature. If you ain't got the funds to do it right, just leave more up to our imaginations please. Our imaginations are not all ruined by countless hours of video game play. A great idea is to still use puppets and models with CGI which can have incredible results. In several years all this CGI cr*p (&lt;-I don't know what words we can use on Amazon)is going to look much worse to us than it already does, leaving films of this period as dated as 1950s adventure films that used stop-motion puppets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>There wasn't one monster in this movie, not one giant slug, bug or slimy flying thing that frightened me as much as the human monster, that thing we become in a crisis, born of fear and panic.  I am not a big Stephen King fan, but I am always impressed by his ability to show us the monster within us, that being much more dastardly and devious and dangerous than any other creature that might pop out from under our bed.<br /><br />This movie started out much like any other Stephen King movie, a group of people are trapped by unseen forces (in MAINE!), they break into factions quickly, those that believe quick action is best, those that think waiting it out is best, those that aren't thinking much at all, just shaking in fear in the corner praying.  Soon they discover a bit of what they are facing, but as time goes on, fear takes over and it becomes apparent that it is much more dangerous to remain inside with the others than to risk your life to the unseen monsters outside.  That sure says a lot about us as a society.<br /><br />This movie made me wonder how I would handle myself in a similar situation, because other than the giant flying bugs and creatures with fangs, this sort of crisis could happen at any time. Natural disasters happen and so can being trapped with others, and as people get hungrier, more desperate, they might do anything, and things can always turn into a sort of modern day witch hunt, as we look to blame and seek solutions in unlikely ways.  I love a movie that makes me think, even if it's disturbing!<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this film.  I liked that it made me think.  I didn't like what it says about us as humans, but, hey...the truth hurts!  It was disturbing, made me cry, and I probably won't be watching it again.  Do I think it's worth seeing...YES!  Give it a try.  It's worth one night of uneasiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE MIST has the full panorama of responses, from those who find it 'the best of the Stephen King story adaptations' to those who find it a feeble attempt to wed science fiction with biblical predictions. Frank Darabont  has consistently brought King's popular horror stories to the screen with great success.  For this film he's gathered a substantial cast, used computer generated graphics well, but in the end the result is a confusing mishmash of story versus sermon versus actors being overwhelmed by some really strange upstaging creatures.<br /><br />David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a graphic artist who manages to weather a freak storm only to discover a mysterious mist hovering over his backyard lake.  Going to town with his young son to get supplies at a Food Store he joins the other townsfolk in the gossip about the mist which now engulfs the town: could it be due to some experiment at the military post lab in the mountains?  The store's generator sounds like it is fumbling, and while brave David tries to fix it (mind you, in this town with no electricity, the lights in the main store remain on....), he sees the back wall buckling and hears a bizarre noise.  Returning to the storefront, David informs the crowd of his findings, but his descriptions are not believed - especially by the town psycho Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) who sees all things in relation to her channeling of God via her knowledge of the Book of Revelations, and the pessimistic out-of-towner Brent Norton (Andre Braugher), who has a running disagreement with David. But gradually David gathers some sensible folk (Toby Jones, Chris Owen, et al) to accompany him to the generator room and against David's warning, the back door is opened by the young stock boy and huge tentacles enter from the mist and consume the lad. Thus we have two factions: those who side with Mrs. Carmody's religious zealot need to sacrifice people to the outdoor monsters now flying about the store and those who are convinced they must fight the offenders with force and escape.  The mess of a story is further confused with overlay of father/son devotion, mass hysteria, mob rule, revenge on the military for loosing these 'other world monsters' on the public,  and 'what do we do if this is the end of the earth'.  How it all winds down may satisfy some and may irritate others.<br /><br />So why rate this film with two stars instead of one?  Marcia Gay Harden gives a bravura performance as the crazy Mrs. Carmody and Toby Jones offers a solid representation of the stable man as a clerk in the store who keeps his wits about him. Thomas Jane is Thomas Jane, and for an action hero, he seems to melt with the circumstances.  The movie is long, silly, not scary, and suffers from a weak script.  For those who are entertained by this sort of story it may be worthwhile.  For those who are fatigued by the same old line of good versus evil in the form of gooey huge monsters, pass on this film.  Grady Harp, March 08</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>It's difficult to rank the Stephen King works that have made it to the silver screen.  Among them, I'd rank Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile as the best two.  With that said, I believe no higher praise can be given to one of his works - considering the aforementioned duo are 5-star classics - than to say The Mist probably drifts its way into the award ceremony and snatches the bronze medal with a flesh-tearing tentacle.  It should come as no surprise then, that Frank Darabont was the writer/director of all three.<br /><br />The setup: A dense mist that rolls in from the nearby military science facility envelops a coastal town, causing townsfolk to congregate at the supermarket for supplies.  When otherworldly creatures begin to emerge from the mist divisive factions form.  Some spurred on Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) - a religious zealot whose fire and brimstone sermons prey upon scripture ignorance and fear of the unknown to spawn a cult-like following - believe the monsters to be an Old Testament prediction come true, while others, led by pragmatic but terrified everyman David Drayton (Thomas Jane), scramble to protect themselves and attempt to rationalize the mounting deaths from monsters...some of which did not come from the mist.<br /><br />Ultimately this film successfully explores the erosion of humanity and logic in the face of extreme terror.  It's akin to sacrifices atop pyramids because the volcano gods needed to be placated.  Much of mankind will eventually devolve towards beastly behavior when faced with a catastrophic situation that cannot be explained.  In that regard, I believe the movie is incredibly believable; psyches would fracture and reason would disappear if monsters appeared out of nowhere and began killing us in an array of terrifyingly lethal methods.<br /><br />The entire production of this film is superb.  Everything from acting to FX is nearly perfect in my opinion.  One aspect, however, stood out more than ever before.  The score exudes the very essence of the onscreen mood, and composer Mark Isham absolutely rips emotion out of the viewer's chest.  The Host of Seraphim is, in and of itself, a masterpiece of emotionally challenging music that loops infinitely in my nightmares.  It captures the haunting nature of the entire movie and perfectly accompanies the tragically surprising ending that suggests even the most reasoned of us all, when we believe hope is lost, has a monster lurking within.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></br><a href="../users/A161ANWB62G3M8.html">A161ANWB62G3M8</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic film. The direction (from the man who filmed "The Shawshank Redemption") is spot on, and after 30 minutes you will find yourself completely pulled into the situation.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and inventive story that has the power to shock, and by the end I was stunned by what had happened. This is suspense / horror cinema of a very high standard.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>To say that I wasn't expecting much from this film is an understatement. During a recent trip to my local movie store, they were getting rid of all their current back stock of DVD's and I was able to purchase this gem for $2.50. My wife is the horror fanatic and also the one who put it in. I was sitting in the kitchen, working on my novel, when I started to crane my neck over the counter to watch what was going on. Andre Braugher is one of my favourite actors of all time and he unfortunately is in too little offerings these days.<br /><br />I complained when it started, saying: "here we go again, another Stephen King adaptation full of no-name / B-list actors in a made for TV drama. Lemme guess, some toxic sludge escapes during a power outage and acts like a growth compound on the surrounding wildlife?"<br /><br />How wrong I was, and how quickly I got sucked in.<br /><br />I'm not going to include any spoilers in this, as this is a film that folks that love the genre, love Stephen King -- must see and continue to watch to the bitter end. While some may bemoan the ending, you have to come to terms with the difference between a bad ending and an incredibly disturbing one. This film has an incredibly disturbing ending and bothered me well into the next day - not a bad ending. I wouldn't want to be cast into that scenario for all the gold in the world. The Mist is an excellent film* (note I said film and not movie) that I would've paid to see in the theatre and would've purchased on DVD for full price. It's too bad that they didn't market this film better as the Studios are doing much more for Sci-Fi / Horror these days than they used to.<br /><br />The special effects are also a bonus and not gratuitous, over the top or unnecessary. Frank Darabont has really made a very well-crafted film and worthy of some kind of mention.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just for the sake of things, I watched this movie a second time. Knowing full well what was coming, and having prepared myself mentally, I have to say that it *does* hold up after multiple viewings and actually took an even darker turns in my mind as I realized what I was about to witness again as the film progressed. I'm very surprised that more people aren't talking about this film. It's some of the better, and unexplored, Stephen King material.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>When I first heard of THE MIST, I was thinking it was a remake of the 1980 flick, The Fog, with Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. Oops. No such luck. Instead I found myself in a Stephen King movie, which was quite fine by me. I've enjoyed several of Stephen Kings other books and films including The Stand, Stand By Me, The Tommyknockers, and even the Langoliers, but I had never read this one. It begins with an inside joke where an artist is painting a movie poster for a Stephen King novel and has other famous movie posters displayed as if he had painted them. We meet the family, the neighbor, and soon, half the town. And then THE MIST rolls in.<br /><br />Most of THE MIST takes place in a supermarket and most of the movie is typical Stephen King. We get to know a group of ordinary people who start to show their true colors as the pressure mounts. And the pressure mounts, you betcha! We have all sorts of creatures coming out of the mist to eat our frugal shoppers. But we also have our very own annoying humans inside the store, including an "unstable" Christian woman who constantly preaches her own version of the Bible and the end-of-days. As the movie progresses, we lose more shoppers until... I can't give away the ending, but I do have to talk about the ending. It's a very bad ending. And, apparently, it wasn't Stephen King's original ending. It's an ending that belongs in a different kind of movie, not a jump-out-of-the-mist-and-go-boo! movie. I mean, THE MIST is a modern B-Movie, and we all have certain expectations that go along with those. For instance, when the boy and girl make out, we know they're the next to die. Check. When anyone smiles or think they've made it, they're about to die in a particularly gruesome way. Check. And when our heroes risk everything to put an end to what's been dogging them, we expect ... well, we know what we expect and that box was definitely left unchecked.<br /><br />If it weren't for the ending, I'd have gladly given THE MIST higher marks for knowing that it was a Saturday matinee monster movie. Unfortunately, at the very last minute, it tried to be something more important, which is exactly what I did not want.<br /><br />Stephen King himself is quoted as saying, "The ending is such a jolt--wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending." Well, this person does!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>"The Mist", based on the novella by Stephen King, has a small group of people holed up inside a supermarket after an all-encompassing impenetrable vapor cloud rolls through the entire town.  It doesn't take long before a local man bursts through the doors in a blind panic, blood on his face and clothes and ranting about "something in the mist" that dragged his friend away.  From there we are led on a moderately-paced ride of suspense as strange and frightening creatures emerge from the fog, the death toll increases and the main characters make a last ditch effort at escape only to meet a fate worse than what awaits them outside the safe confines of the supermarket.<br /><br />For those that have been reading all the customer reviews (positive and negative alike), the ending has already been spoiled (and had it not been, I would've had no qualms about spoiling it myself - it's THAT BAD).<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think it speaks for itself.  Let me just say that it's like slapping down $40 for a great steak...and then getting food poisoning.  I did feel pretty sick to my stomach, steak or no steak, after watching the last ten minutes.  It's artistic license at its worst.<br /><br />I was also disappointed to see a talented director like Frank Darabont make a mockery of his previous efforts with an ending designed for maximum shock value.  Instead of giving the story the dignity that it deserves (and King actually SANCTIONED this new and horrific twist), Darabont instead has managed to churn out a movie capped by an outrageous denouement that has absolutely no artistic merit.  For fans of Darabont's previous work (Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile), be forewarned - you will have the distinct urge to turn the other cheek at his future releases.  Anyone can shock and/or surprise, but if they do so with proficiency and artistry, they are to be commended.  There is nothing commendable about what Darabont has done to rework one of Stephen King's best stories.  On paper, "The Mist" remains a masterpiece.  On film, it is a near disaster.<br /><br />Having gotten that out of the way, I feel should I point out the movie's strong suits.  The first is the design of the creatures that wander through the mist, especially the larger ones.  Two giants who make appearances first at a halfway point through the film then the other in the last fifteen minutes are quite a wonder of conceptual design.  The screenplay is also good but I do feel that some of the characters are extreme, the religious fanatic in particular played by Marcia Gay Harden.  Of course, every good story needs a good antagonist, someone whom the reader constantly wishes would receive their comeuppance.  To quote from another of Darabont's films (The Shawshank Redemption), "His Judgment cometh and that right soon."<br /><br />Second is the wrenching performance of the film's lead actor Thomas Jane as the film's protagonist David Drayton.  Although I hated the ending, I thought Jane gave a commendable portrayal of a man tortured by his decision.  Also noteworthy is Nathan Gamble as David's son Billy - his performance was neither trite nor maudlin in the least.  Harden is a bit much with her fire-and-brimstone rhetoric as the sanctimonious Mrs. Carmody while the rest of the supporting cast blend in with one another.<br /><br />Bottom line: the film is excellent up until the last ten minutes.  Had a different ending been used and the "gotcha" ending (to quote another reviewer) became an alternative ending, I would've been much happier with it and would've even considered adding it to my collection of DVDs at home.<br /><br />What a shame...</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>This is a review of the story/movie, not the disc.<br /><br />As with many a Stephen King story, there is often a mesh of twisted scriptures, at least one literary Christ figure, horrible things from the unknown, and at least one underlying moral. This has got a blender-full of all of that... but in the famous words of Blendtech, "will it blend?" Not exactly.<br /><br />After a harrowing storm, the lead character, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) heads to town with his crotchety neighbor and son to get supplies to fix a broken window. A strange mist is seen over the lake, but dismissed as storm after-glow and they head to the local food mart, full of every stereotypical character from the one-horse town.<br /><br />As the mist envelopes the community, military vehicles are racing to and fro and the air raid siren goes off. A bloodied old man runs to the store, proclaiming that they need to lock the doors - something in the mist took a local. Took them. Yeah- and they believe him. You gotta start this story somewhere.<br /><br />Enter local loon and Messiah-in-waiting, Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden). As always, Harden is the consummate actress. She couldn't act poorly if forced to at gun point - so bravo for her, but thumbs down for this looney portrayal of a scripture twisting nutjob that half the occupants of the store begin to nearly worship and some end up killing for her on command.<br /><br />The mob rule mentality - ok, I'll buy that. People are basically evil by nature - we need constant enforcement by society, parents, laws and faith to keep us from killing each other - when threatened by a definitely lethal unknown, with no reasonable hope of rescue, people will sacrifice their own mother if it makes them feel better.<br /><br />For someone who can quickly turn to the pages of her Bible she had conveniently stowed away with her in her purse, for just such an occasion, Carmody is foul-mouthed and not too hip on scriptures as she purports. She refers to the book of "Revelations" - in absolutely NO VERSION of the Bible is this book in the plural. It's a common mistake, but in a final script, laughable.  While Carmody is the voice of chaos, Drayton is the voice of reason - yet he is akin to a John the Baptist at first - a lone voice crying in the wilderness.<br /><br />A handful of the store occupants go to the loading dock to see why the generator is failing. Despite Drayton's warnings that he heard 'something' eerie outside the door, the testosterone is raging too high for these small-minded country folk who resent education and success, and they must prove themselves by venturing into the mist. I do tire very much so of this stereotype of the simpleton in the small town who has no respect for those with an education, yet those who are college educated are by definition, sound, logical and always right. Uh... no. But ok, we roll with it... the eerie music continues...<br /><br />As you expect by the music, sweat, testosterone and raised voices, the source of the eerie sound that Drayton heard, comes through the door opening via an extremely nasty set of tentacles that come right out of the worst nightmare you've ever had, after having seen cockroaches, then getting food poisoning. The thing is viciously strong, almost intelligent, full of rage and spikes that will take the flesh off an elephant with merely a love tap. The machismo men that were all hell-bent for leather to fix the generator stand like monuments as the poor lad gets eviscerated by the unknown goblin thing that eventually pulls him into the mist.<br /><br />Even the remnant of a tentacle chopped off with an axe is not enough to convince an otherwise apathetic crowd. Drayton's crotchety neighbor is delusional in his refusal to even look at the evidence, and races to his death with other disbelievers to prove that they're right, as they march out the door, into the mist. Can you say "dismembered body parts?" Oh yes, the flesh eating monsters know to leave parts behind just to scare the rest of their food - that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />Night falls, and we're not just talking tentacles anymore. We've got some jurassic freaking mosquitos that can suck the lava out of a volcano for breakfast and some bat-looking things - it's like Pandora's box threw up in this little town. The mist is all kinds of messed up. It's the stuff that Noah purposefully did not take on the ark... and it's attracted to light and these idiots are all pointing giant spotlights out a window at night into a white fog, but somehow they actually see outside instead of their own reflections. Yah - physics takes on unique properties in this store. The phones don't work. No cell phones. No land lines - but the power just goes on for days in this one grocery store. Yup.<br /><br />Tensions mount. One bathroom, no showers, lots of folks who all have their own issues, all getting mind bent over this house of horrors going on outside - thinking of their loved ones who are likely already being digested and pooped out - not a recipe for normal thinking or calm attitudes.<br /><br />Considering Anne Frank, her family and 2 other families were hidden away successfully in an attic for 2 years with Nazis constantly looking for people who were hidden away, and they still remained civilized, these people are ready to eat their own young after just 2 days. Well, maybe not their own young, but Mrs. Carmody is more than willing to sacrifice your son to satisfy God's wrath.<br /><br />Thanks to 3 young military officers (two of which hang themselves... giving you a hint of how well they thought the situation was going to play out) trapped in the store, the truth comes out as to what the mist is, and where these creatures have come from. It's not good, and I don't want to spoil it for you... it's a believable explanation - I mean - other than "you're just having the worst nightmare you've ever had," there really isn't another one that's feasible in my opinion.  The concern is, will this ever end? Will the creatures ever leave? Is this a local or world-wide phenomenon? Is there any hope other than just being the last one to be unkown critter vittles?<br /><br />The morals are many in this tale:<br />-don't jump to conclusions<br />-two days is not long enough to decide that this will last forever without end - how about a little more faith & endurance, people?<br />-suicide is rarely a choice that in the end solves your immediate problem... you're still dead<br />-let calmer heads prevail<br />-even the calmest head can lose reality when surrounded by crazies and craziness for days<br /><br />The special effects are GOOD. The Foley sounds are GOOD and eerie. There's a lot of blood, dismemberment and sinew - not one for kids or for expectant mothers. The story is all over the map. A little less drama in the store would have made more sense. The movie just goes on forever. Tensions are so high, people in the theater laughed out loud when certain characters were killed... out of a sense of relief that their blathering dialog would finally end. The movie loses a couple of stars for the out of balance portrayal of Mrs. Carmody - no one there with sensible counter arguments to her non-sensical ramblings on how this was proof that God was heaping his wrath upon this town for such sins as splitting the atom! Yes, we all remember that one from Deuteronomy! I didn't buy the sudden devotion/following this crazy lady had in just what appeared to be 36 hours. She spoke with authority, but was kooky and over the top - I think in a real world scenario, it would have taken at least a week for her to get that kind of following. When you think you're going to be eaten alive by a hideous, heartless unknown (I mean,it's not like it's a bear that's got cubs to feed or anything), the last thing you want to hear is the nagging, raised voice of a woman... and I AM a woman, and I don't want to hear it. Someone would have strangled her before she had more than a handful of followers were this to (God forbid) play out in real life.<br /><br />There were also continuation errors - most notably, a revolver that had been used several times, magically is fully loaded after being dropped by the gunman, after he is consumed by one of these instruments of God's purported wrath. I did find myself on the edge of my seat in spots - the acting is very good and the unknown is often far scarier than the known. This movie could have been a lot better. A LOT better. It was worthwhile seeing ONCE. I don't buy a DVD unless I plan on viewing a film repeatedly - this is one I never ever have to see again. It's scary, bloody and insulting on purpose - and in the end, it is ultimately a story devoid of happiness, hope or reprieve. I suppose in a way, as a Stephen King story, it's a resounding success in that it is a story that haunts you - but doesn't real life do that, anyway? In the end, you will leave this film utterly disappointed and depressed - I just don't see how anyone could have a different perspective after seeing it. If that's what turns you on in a movie, by all means - watch with impunity!</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>Prior to this movie release, of all the stories by Stephen King, only the non-horror ones were any good.  Theatrical releases such as Christine and Dreamcatcher were utterly horrible, while the made-for-TV horror movies such as The Tommyknockers and the Langoliers were also bad.  On the other hand, the non-horror ones were excellent.  These included Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Green Mile, and Misery.  Then came The Mist, released in 2007.  This adaptation of a short story is probably the best horror movie released this decade that was not based of a Japanese story.  Though based on a short story, the movie clocks in at over two hours; long for a horror movie.  The plot is very believable, and the casting is excellent.  No big names in this movie, instead the story has a cast of a dozen characters that drive it forward; all of whom play important parts.  The ending is also great.<br /><br />As to the content, there is some gore, but it is not excessive.  There is some violence, but it does not dominate the story, and instead is only an extension of certain subplots.  The scenes requiring special effects are kept to a minimum, but those scenes are extremely well done and all the monsters look quite real.  Most importantly, there are no stupid scenes in the movie.  There is no scene of a guy running from a monster and then tripping.  There is no scene of some lady hiding from a monster, and then giving away her presence by tripping.  Each and every scene was well thought out and well done.  All in all, a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>Two things right off the bat can be said about this film.<br />#1. This is a real nail biting, genuinely scary apocalyptic monster movie.<br />#2. The last five minutes bring the statement in #1 in question.<br />I really loved this movie.  It had an intensity that has not been matched in a long while as far as thrillers go.  The characters were all excellent and those you are suppose to care about you actually do.  Which makes the filmmakers decision to conclude it the way they did really disapoint.  I am a huge fan of non-Hollywood endings, but the final moments in THE MIST are so completely bleak they tarnish the film and leave the viewer with a cold rock in the gut that makes the film unwatchable for the second time (it's hard to find truly good movies these days, but when one pops up it's usually the best the 2nd time around-IMO).  The ending is a fine example of either hate it or love it, and would have received 5 stars from this reviewer had the finale been tweaked a touch, and I do mean a touch.  It's a true shame to enjoy something so thoroughly (there are some real nail biting moments, the pharmacy scene was just flipping crazy) to have it culminate into something akin to a delicious piece of fruit with a rotten center.  Almost a fantastic piece of horrific escapism, THE MIST missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>One night a horrible storm ravages a small Maine town.  The next morning the clean up begins.  Dave Drayton (Thomas Jane) notices the strange mist moving across the lake and though it seems unusual, it doesn't seem to concern him much.  He goes into town with his son, Billy (Nathan Gamble), and their next door neighbor Brent Norton (Andre Braugher) to pick up a few supplies from the local supermarket.  Everything appears normal.  Then Dave and others in the store notice police cars, firetrucks, and military vehicles driving down the main road in front of the story at high speeds.  Soon sirens ring out and an older man runs into the store yelling that there is "something in the mist."  The doors of the store are closed just as the strange mist that Dave saw earlier on the lake covers everything outside.  Screams are heard, the power goes out, and the earth shakes.  No one knows for sure what's exactly outside in the mist, but the few people that leave the store to check things out aren't seen from again.  The store has emergency generators, but they begin acting up.  Dave and a few other volunteers try to fix the generator and soon discover that there are monsters in the mist.  Those in the store begin dividing into different factions.  There's those like Dave, who though nervous and frightened, keep their wits about them and try to figure out the best course of action.  Then there are others like Brent who decides that action needs to be taken immediately and leave the store.  There are many who aren't sure what's going on.  Then there's Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Wallace) an eccentric woman who proclaims that the mist has been sent by God to cleanse the Earth in preparation for the final days.  Some of what Mrs. Carmody says is reasonable, but her self-righteousness minus any compassion and mercy turn her into an apocalyptic cult leader.  One by one those in the store succumb to Mrs. Carmody's cult-preaching, proving that what's happening inside the store may just be far more deadly than anything out in the mist.<br /><br />THE MIST is an adaptation by Frank Darabont of a Stephen King short story.  Darabont wrote the script, directed, and co-produced THE MIST.  I really like Darabont as a director.  I have a friend who once said that if Darabont only directed five or six movies in his life, it would be enough because each of his films is so well-crafted.  THE MIST is Darabont's fourth film and if he continues his pace, he probably only will direct five or six films in his life.  But, that's okay.<br />THE MIST is almost a perfect adaptation of Stephen King's original story, with a few slight changes.<br /><br />Mrs. Carmody.  It may have just been me, but it seemed like Mrs. Carmody was more than just a kooky lady with some eccentric religious beliefs who becomes caught up in a sacrificial fever. Instead, it seemed to me that Darabont was using her character to vilify anyone who has religious beliefs.  For instance, there were a couple of times when she would say something that I would agree with, but I found myself shuddering because her statements were not backed by her actions.<br /><br />However, Mrs. Carmody's portrayal is minor compared to the one huge alteration.  King's story is ambiguous and no one knows what happens to the characters but the story ends in "hope".  I guess that ending didn't satisfy Darabont because he took King's story and extended the ending and turns the hopeful ending into one of the bleakest and darkest endings I have ever seen in a movie.  Darabont still remains one of my favorite directors, but it does make me wonder if Darabont, whose previous films were ones filled with hope, compassion, and faith (THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, THE GREEN MILE, and THE MAJESTIC), is taking his career in a different direction.<br /><br />Overall, THE MIST is a monster movie filled with psychological horror and an ending so bleak it might just make you sick.  For a bit a trivia, be sure to notice THE GUNSLINGER poster that Dave is painting at the beginning of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>Tried to like it, but this movie lost me pretty early on with a totally unrealistic scenario. The townsfolk are trapped in a supermarket, with some unknown killer mist outside. One woman wants to go out to find her kids who she left at home. Others respond that the mist might be poison gas. She self-righteously asks if anyone will escort her. The men silently refuse - and the film makes it clear that they're to be ashamed of themselves!<br /><br />Not only that, THEY LET HER OPEN THE DOOR AND LEAVE! That's right, she might be dooming them all to poison gas, but not only is she "the good mother" in this movie, they don't even try to stop her from possibly killing them all! Now that's not normal human behavior.<br /><br />There are many other scenes that just don't make sense at all. Some men cut off a tentacle and later try to convince the others that there's a horrible monster outside ... without showing them the tentacle. Why not just BRING IT AND SHOW THEM? I was getting really annoyed by this time. And there are many other scenes where people just STAND STILL to be killed, rather than running away.<br /><br />There is the stereotypical religious (Christian, what else?) nut calling for human sacrifice and spewing vulgarities and hatred, but that's OK, because, you know, Christian viewers are not going to bomb your building or anything, so it's totally OK to offend them. And it's "brave" and "edgy", too. And everyone knows that's what they're really like, right? But Christophobes will be totally satisfied, if you know what I mean, wink wink. (There is a mention that she is "unstable", but the whole religious-people-are-scum aspect will make a big impression upon ignorant viewers.)<br /><br />The ending was somewhat disgusting (not visually, but logically). You could see it coming a mile off. Again, a scenario where people are not behaving like real people at all, just to score a cheap ... something.<br /><br />Most of the monster effects are neat, especially a behemoth near the end - a real H.P. Lovecraft vibe.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Two hours worth, mind you. Vacant, gory, cgi-laden snoozer. Marcia Gay Harden does the best she can as a religious nutcase, somewhat satisfying to see her die but other than that this is boring as all get-out.

Based on Stephen King's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451223292">The Mist (Previously Published as a Novella in 'Skeleton Crew')</a> and written and directed by Frank Darabont. Dozens of customers are being trapped in a supermarket when a strange fog covers up their town. They finally find out that alien animals are hidden in the mist. Stupid monster movie that uses all the genre clich&eacute;s and is, in the end, just a rip-off of George Romero's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9QIK">Dawn of the Dead [Blu-ray</a>]. If you're looking for a genuine monster movie, take a look at Joon-ho Bong's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PKG8TW">The Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>. This one is already forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>The trailers for "The Mist" made me shudder for all the wrong reasons - I thought, "here's Just Another Horror". But now, having seen it, I can report that "The Mist" is - in places, at least, pleasantly surprising, and overall, isn't half as bad as you might think.<br /><br />The plot isn't anything out of the ordinary, and you could be forgiven for assuming that Steven King and screenplay writer Frank Darabont copied and pasted scenes from "The Fog" and "The Birds" to come up with this : Freak storm gives birth to a thick mist blanketing the town, and spews out numerous beasties that corral a group of people in a local supermarket - including David Drayton (Jane) and his son Billy (Gamble), their neighbour Brent Norton (Braugher) and local religious zealot Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). Escape seems hopeless and the locals become more and more restless as their numbers slowly decline. Et cetera et cetera. But "The Mist" wisely goes more for a Hitchcock-style suspense feel than a Carpenter all-out-horror motif, and this, frankly, saves the movie from itself.<br /><br />The acting's pretty average, with some good performances (Thomas Jane, Frances Sternhagen and Andre Braugher), some great performances (Marcia Gay Harden, Nathan Gamble) and - of course - some truly lousy performances by histrionic extras ("There's something in the mist!", "It's in the mist!", "No wire hangers ever!", and so forth. Well, maybe not that last one, but you get the picture....). The screenplay (by Frank Darabont) is competent and nicely paced - within fifteen minutes we're in the thick of the action (although this does cause somewhat of a drag around the midway point, but hey, by then you've been watching for an hour, and another hour won't kill you...) - and, histrionic extras' dialogue notwithstanding, the script provides a functional, utilitarian dialogue that forwards a well-made, suspenseful movie. The ending is unexpected and very, very unsettling - and definitely contributes a great deal to my three-star rating.<br /><br />Direction is very good, there's one supermarket-in-chaos sequence just before the movie's mid-point that is very nicely done, and the special effects, surprisingly, are absolutely fantastic. CGI is well-animated and unpretentiously showcased, and while there are one or two points where the beasties look fake, the mist itself is convincing, and the creatures, for the most part, look plausible.<br /><br />The biggest problem with "The Mist" is that it's not very original. I haven't read the story that spawned it, but this movie version doesn't really do anything new. It retreads some very familiar waters with competent polish, though, and if you're in the mood for an undemanding suspense/horror movie with plenty of decent elements to it, this might be just what you're looking for.<br /><br />Recommended for rental - unless you're a huge King fan, in which case this two-disc version is your best bet.</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Mist / B0010X745K<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie. The premise is fantastic - spooky mist rolls in, carrying horrifying monsters with it. Yet the actual execution is terrible - the dialogue will make you want to pierce your eardrums for relief and, really, is it too much to ask that human characters actually act like real humans? Apparently so. Here is a list of things that need to be removed from the movie.<br /><br />(1) Black people are not a monolithic group who automatically band together because of their shared skin color in times of turmoil and then promptly follow the stupidest person straight into peril. I was actually really disturbed by this development. Just my opinion.<br /><br />(2) Religious hysteria is compelling and interesting. 30+ minutes of preaching is NOT. Note to writers and directors: Americans do not need 80% of the Book of Revelations quoted at them. Believe me, most of us are familiar enough with the concepts, if not from personal experience at church, then from cultural icons like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842329129">Left Behind</a>. Exposition is good. Ham-fisted repetition is not. Trust your audience.<br /><br />(3) Alpha males should not immediately begin shopping for their next wife in the face of a crisis. We know the wife is dead. He knows the wife is dead. But for the love of Pete, let's have a short grieving process before the "Are you going to be a good step-mother?" interviews begin.<br /><br />(4) Being an attractive female does not equal "good with kids", nor does it equal being an automatic volunteer to take over the alpha male's child for 95% of the ensuing crisis.<br /><br />(5) I actually liked the ending. I thought it was a brave attempt to face reality head-on. However, having said that, don't have a ridiculous cop-out ending to tack on to try to make the choice a blatantly false one. That's just cheap.<br /><br />These complaints aside, the monsters are creepy and it's not a bad ride if you put the Closed Captions on and fast forward through most of the dialogue. There's even some camp appeal here, which is why it's staying on our DVD shelf for a little longer, at lease. But there is much better out there.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Horror and humor walk a very thin and blurry line, don't they?

Get Sean Penn to believably play the leading man in a romantic comedy.<br /><br />#2. Get Kevin Costner the actor to play a role that even slightly differentiates from him being the real life Kevin Costner.<br /><br />#3. Successfully adapt a Stephen King horror film into a movie without completely sabotaging the script (see Kubrick's The Shining).<br /><br />Frank Darabont, while having formerly been able to adapt The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile with great success, and while Meathead (Rob Reiner) managed to do the same with King's The Body (which was adapted into Reiner's Stand By Me), the horror aspect of King's writing has provided many director's with very little success. A quick glance at past failures read likes a Who's Who of pathetic filmography:<br /><br />Cujo (1983)<br />Silver Bullet (1985) - I actually like this one<br />Maximum Overdrive (1986)<br />Needful Things (1993)<br />The Dark Half (1993)<br />Thinner (1996)<br /><br />1990's Misery and the pre 1980 King films notwithstanding, seldom has a director managed to pull of a successful adaptation, especially those King films that had dealt with the supernatural like 1983's The Dead Zone or 1989's Pet Sematary. It's not a knock on King, just a telling fact that his style of writing doesn't always translate well to modern film.<br /><br />Then came The Mist. Darabont sinks his teeth into this one and the result is a very entertaining film that will keep the viewer entrenched for the long run. If ever someone was capable of taking a King book and translating it to the big screen, Frank is the man; however, The Mist at times seems a little too forced and many of the characters simply seem hollow throughout, which contrasted with Darabont's former King films, is a bizarre observation to make considering Shawshank and The Green Mile were heavily inter-laden with character development. Here, however, the story is the main character, and the principle players seem nothing short of h'orderves for an ending that Darabont no doubt put together as the measuring stick for the entire film. I have to say, the ending of this film will stay with you and is as powerful a horror finale as I've ever seen.<br /><br />This ending is the result of a plot that deals with a tiny town in Maine, where perhaps fifty townsfolk, including a father (played by Thomas Jane) and his son, find themselves trapped in a grocery store when an ominous mist rips through town, bringing with it dangerous, unseen creatures that proceed to rip a number of the doubting townsfolk to pieces. It is classic King, and when it's all said and done, Darabont stands to have almost pulled off the impossible, and that is something to be commended.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>While "The Mist" has an abundance of "creepy crawlers," especially the skyscraper-sized one that appears near the film's end, it is not those which are the most frightening.  That title belongs to Marcia Gay Harden's "Mrs. Carmody," a religious zealot who manages to throw the seeds of mistrust into the grocery store as the assembly tries to map out its strategy to deal with marauding horde outside the doors.  The screenwriter crafted a character that truly believes that she is "the messenger of God" and that only she can weed out the true "evil" and she manages to turn others to her side, resulting in brother turning against brother.<br /><br />The film also allows fair screen time from the "minor" characters, giving each significance and even "noble deaths."  Great performances are delivered by star Thomas Jane, Laurie Holden, Frances Sternhagen, Andre Braugher, Ollie Weeks, William Sadler, Sam Witwer, and young Nathan Gamble as Jane's son.  In fact, much praise should be given to the remaining cast members who manage to show what happens when "mob mentality" takes over.<br /><br />Like any good "monster" film, they are kept at a minimum, springing out at the right time to effectively maximize the fear quota.<br /><br />A plus on the DVD is the inclusion of a B & W cut of the movie, further solidifying its 50's monster movie origins.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Frank Darabont's and Stephen King's third collaboration is a return to expected territory for Stephen King, and an unexpected turn to tightly wound horror for Darabont.  However, if the movie title evokes memories of John Carpenter's `The Fog' and its risible recent remake, don't be fooled.  Firstly, the horror when it happens is more intense, and secondly the movie sets out to be much more than just another creature feature.<br />So what happens?  It's a standard small Stephen King-style American town, following a storm.  A cross section of the town's society are in the supermarket when a mysterious fog rolls in - then a man runs out of the mist with blood on his face saying `there are things in the mist - they took my friends'.  So, the townsfolk hole up in the supermarket, and then follows the fascinating part of the movie. The creatures make their presence known, and an explanation of sorts for their appearance presents itself, but that is hardly the point.  It is the interaction of the townsfolk as they polarize, latent resentments surface and they feel the need to unite under a cause or leader, that the movie focuses on.  If the unhinged bible-basher is somewhat over the top (if not downright offensive) it is more than made up by a great cast, acting their hearts out - even a remarkably good Thomas Jane.  The controversial ending I think is perfectly in tone with this theme of exploring what people will do, and transcends the film from a mere creature feature or straight to DVD King movie, to a genuinely interesting piece of work that will spark thoughts and conversation long after the movie is over.<br />All in all, a thumbs up to this one, with gore in places and a moderate air of tension, but stirred to great effect with an interesting exploration of human nature.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>"The Mist" (based on a story by Stephen King) is a movie about monsters but not the ones you would expect. After a massive storm, a dense mist descends upon a small town in Maine, bringing with it a swarm of giant, blood-thirsty insects. When the monsters arrive, artist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane), finds himself and his young son trapped in the local supermarket with a large group of townspeople and it doesn't take long for him to realize that these people must band together if they hope to ever leave the store alive.<br /><br />Although this is a monster movie, in the traditional, tentacles and fangs, sense. The giant insects get very little screen time. In a two hour movie, I only counted about six appearances of the insects and these are all relatively short, albeit, very gory (you may prefer to watch a different movie, if you happen to have a weak stomach). Instead, writer/director Frank Darabont (who also directed screen adaptations of two other Stephen King stories, "The Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile"), focuses on the monsters inside the store, that is, the humans, in particular Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a fundamentalist Christian who is even more dangerous than the monsters outside.<br /><br />This is really a film about how humans behave in extreme situations. I read somewhere that one of Stephen King's favourite novels is "Lord of the Flies", and in a way, "The Mist" can be seen as being a variant on "Lord of the Flies", with adults rather than children. As with "Lord of the Flies", the message of this film is that if you take people out of their familiar surroundings and scare them enough, they will become savages - not exactly a message to restore your faith in humanity.<br /><br />This is a very well made film, with acting that is, in general, excellent (give or take a couple of the supporting actors). It's not as good as "The Shawshank Redemption", but few films are. I didn't particularly like the ending, but it is consistent with the general message of the film and I can accept Darabont's decision to end the film this way. Be warned however, that this is not a fun film. If you want a fun film about people being trapped in a shop by monsters, see the "Dawn of the Dead" remake. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a thoughtful, adult horror movie, then this is the way to go.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>"The Mist" (based on a story by Stephen King) is a movie about monsters but not the ones you would expect.

It is sharp, has good color, and for the b/w version, has high contrast.  However, it does have a fair amount of grain to it (could be bad if you're expecting a crystal-clear transfer; could be good because it adds to the visceral nature of the film).<br />*Contains deleted scenes, several fascinating featurettes, webisodes, and trailers (same stuff as from the 2-disc DVD set).  It's all contained on disc one.  Disc two has only the black-and-white version of the movie (with an introduction).<br />*The movie itself seems to be influenced by HP Lovecraft; the monsters are all otherworldly bugs and shapeless monsters. Definitely some of the freakiest monsters ever put on the screen.<br />*Also, special effects are pretty good.  Maybe not the best, but better than most other Stephen King based movies.<br />*There are only a few bad scenes of violence, but they are exceptionally brutal and quite scary!<br />*Even scarier than the monsters are the people. Most of the movie focuses on how everybody reacts to the situation, and there are many mixed and wild reactions. Many people act dumb and irrationaly, and few are sensible. This makes for very realistic and intense drama.<br />*As a whole, it is a deep, brutal exploration of human nature in an extreme apocalyptic situation. The whole film is very thought-provoking.<br />*Most of the story is close to the original novella by Stephen King; only the ending is different (see below).<br />*It's not as corny or cliched as some of the other Stephen King works.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*The ending was exceptionally brutal, and can be seen as either good or bad. I think it could have had a happier ending, but as it is in the film, it does leave you thinking and feeling bitter.<br />*On the minus side, the ending is radically different from the original novella.<br />*Sometimes, you just want to punch these stupid characters in the face (then again, this could be a good thing too, because the drama really absorbs the audience).<br /><br />This definitely goes above and beyond my expectations. It's not the typical horror flick; it's an intense thought-provoking study of people under pressure. The result is explosive, and unfortunately, highly believable. Even though it is stylistically similar to "Dreamcatcher," or "The Thing," it is more akin to "Children of Men" or "Pan's Labyrinth." Because of this, it is frightening on all levels, and I would consider this to be one of the best Stephen King-inspired films ever made.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>Synopsis: The '07 release `The Mist' unfolds like a Lovecraftian nightmare come alive in a small rural American community.  Cloaked within a dense, inexplicable mist that engulfs the town lurks a collection of phantasmagorical creatures ranging from what appears to be large, mutated dragonflies and spiders to enormous monstrosities that would answer to such diabolical names as Shoggoth, or Cthulhu if this film had been adapted from a H.P. Lovecraft novel. Though no mention of the nefarious Necronomicon is ever mentioned surely some blasphemous occult conjuring must have been going on in that top secret military base located on the outskirts of town that released these other dimensional beings into our world.<br /><br />David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his young son are trapped inside a supermarket with a group of terrified town residents and unfortunate travelers with a storefront wall of glass serving as their only protection from the mist and the horrors that await outside. Thoughts and emotions run wild within their precarious refuge. Some escape into denial, some fall into religious hysteria and some contemplate suicide. Only a brave few seem willing to face the truth and plan an escape, or die trying.<br /><br />Critique: `The Mist' is an exciting, harrowing film that firmly held my interest from beginning to end. Christopher Lambert look-a-like Thomas Jane delivers a solid performance as the strong and valiant David Drayton who is forced to not only suppress his own personal fear of the incomprehensible menace outside but deal with the mounting emotional onslaught of those around him. I also enjoyed the performance of Laurie Holden as the level-headed but vulnerable Amanda Dumfries and Marcia Gay Harden as the unstable religious zealot Mrs. Camody. On the negative side I wish they hadn't done the too often repeated alien incubation sequence. It was great in `Alien' but enough is enough. The religious fanaticism subplot was also a little over-the-top for my tastes but it certainly wasn't enough to spoil my enjoyment of the central storyline.<br /><br />When all is said and done it's definitely the Lovecraft inspired monsters in the mist that capture my imagination. I keep seeing in my minds eye those final moments of the film as the valiant few drive through the fog and view all the mayhem and destruction wrought by these creatures. The sounds of their unearthly bellowing and glimpses of unimaginable horror as they move in and out of sight within the thick mist are accentuated by the haunting soundtrack provided by Lisa Gerrard. This is truly an unforgettable image that will stay with the viewer for quite some time.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Frank Darabont, the man who brought The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile to the big screen, adapts Stephen King once again with The Mist; which ranks as one of the very best adaptations of the horror author's works.  Thomas Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) stars as David Drayton, a movie poster artist living in Maine who, along with his young son (Nathan Gamble) is trapped with other survivors in a supermarket when a mysterious, deadly mist rolls into town; with something even deadlier lurking inside the fog.  Making matters even worse are the biblical ramblings of Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), who believes this is a sign from God, and soon demands that sacrifices be made.  Combining old school horror, social commentary, monster-flavored shocks, and more commentary elements of religious fanatiscism; Frank Darabont has managed to craft a modern day horror classic that does not disappoint.  Jane gives one of the best performances of his career, and though Marcia Gay Harden's character doesn't get much sympathy, she is very effective in her role regardless.  With wonderful CGI creature, monster, and makeup effects from the good folks at KNB, a great cast that also includes Silent Hill's Laurie Holden, Toby Jones, Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Alexa Davalos, and Jeffrey DeMunn, and one of the most unforgettable and unsettling endings in a mainstream movie in recent memory; The Mist isn't only one of the best King adaptations ever filmed, but one of the best horror movies released in quite some time.  All in all, whether you are a King fan or just a horror fan in general, you should definitely see The Mist.  You will not regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>You all know by now, I tell it like it is. And here's how it is with this movie: half good, half bad.  That sums it up neatly.<br /><br />The first half is a tightly paced, suspenseful thriller.  Expertly executed, I was fully engrossed for the first hour or so.<br /><br />But then, whoa nelly!  What happened?  Pretension crept in, and suddenly we're watching something that the filmmakers obviously considered more "important" than a monster movie.  And I'm sure many would agree with me - the second half is ultimately more important than the first half.  A great pay-off can compensate for an uneven start.  But a killer start isn't going to really look so good after a soggy, half-baked conclusion.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything.  The movie is fun enough, and worth a rental.  But suffice it to say that when it was over I started thinking of all the movies this one cribbed bits and pieces from.  Let's see, "Night of the Living Dead" (and the other Romero 'Dead' films, for that matter), "The Fog", "Tremors", and about at least a hundred others.<br /><br />As a God-fearing Christian, I took minor offense to the old lady character who preached throughout the movie about how all the scary events taking place signaled the end of days.  We're not all like her and I'm frankly tired of seeing good Christians portrayed in such a bad way.  Peace be with you.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>At its core, "The Mist" (based on the Stephen King novella) is a classic "humans trying to survive against monsters" tale.  However, thanks to King's brilliant storytelling, a human element is introduced into the mix that takes the film to new psychological heights.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Mist" tells the tale of a small American town suddenly attacked by a variety of bug-like creatures.  After a terrible windstorm causes the town's residents to gather in the general store for supplies, they all find themselves trapped in the rather confined space as a curtain of mist blankets the entire city.  Whenever someone ventures out into the mist, however, they do not return alive.<br /><br />There are two reasons why this film is so interesting/entertaining:<br /><br />First, the special effects and alien creatures will have you on the edge of your seat.  One almost has to wonder if they did not inspire JJ Abrams' creature in the later "Cloverfield" picture, as the films are very similar in that regard.<br /><br />What truly sets the film apart, though, is that it is as much about humanity as it is about monsters.  As the bewildered townspeople struggle to determine their next move, all their personalities begin showing in crisis mode.  There is the religious zealot, the rednecks ready to fight at the drop of the hat, the natural leaders, and the "lemmings" willing to follow the loudest voice in a mob-like mentality.  In typical King fashion, it is a tale of humanity's struggles more than the paranormal aspect.<br /><br />Overall, then, "The Mist" is a great "monster flick" also including large doses of human drama.  It was a great Stephen King story, and the transfer to the big screen is almost impeccable.  Unless you are a bit squeamish, you will find this interesting on both the "horror" & "psychological" levels.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y0HX12MCT6OR.html">A1Y0HX12MCT6OR</a><br/><p>I think it depends on how people see human nature. Personally I loved this horror movie 20 minutes on because the truly frightening aspect of it wasn't so much the mostly shrouded monsters, but more so how people act in dire circumstances. If I were in that situation with my neighbors and townsfolk and they all as Tom Jane said "have all their electricity turned off and the s*** scared out of them, they're willing to believe anything". It's a very bleak and unflinching look at humanity, but look at Nazi Germany, look at the Donnor Party, look at the Salem Witch Trials for a few examples if you think that people would act like a rational team in horrible circumstances. Just thank the stars most of us haven't had to be in that situation.<br /><br />The monsters themselves were unique and original, and they kind of reminded me of Silent Hill 1, with very insect/dinosaur shapes. They did look a little cheesy which I think was Darabount's way to tribute to the 50's monster movies. Still their corny look was played completely sober and all of the deaths looked very gruesome and painful.<br /><br />Maybe the reason I liked the Mist so much was because of how dark and bleak the whole experience was, a man dies in vain trying to save his DoA burned brother, a local town brutally murders a local soldier, and of course there's the pitch-black ending. There were no hollywood touches on this, no silly comic relief, the cute widdle kid was pretty much comatose with fear the whole time (which is a way more realistic portrayl of kids in horror movies than I usually see). It's very refreshing to see a horror movie pull no punches.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>I usually reserve five stars for stuff like Schindler's List, Sound of Music, Almost Famous, Fear and Loathing, etc...<br /><br />What surprised me the most:  1. a stephen king adaptation usually always gets butchered, and/or is horrifyingly bad. 2. I can't believe Dimension Films put out something that was actually stunning.<br /><br />Like others have said, the ending, 'UNREAL' Absolutely unreal...I just love the way the movie was filmed almost documentary style, ya know, like it doesn't look like it was done on 35mm, and just the way the film, as I am sure others have stated more fluently than I, transcends the emotional and psychological rollercoaster of something supernatural like this, rather than from just a horror, gore, B Movie, Wes Craven/John Carpenter standpoint.<br /><br />Really,really, really well done.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>After a strong storm in the Maine area, the local artist Dave Drayton drives from his house nearby the lake to the supermarket with his son Billy and his arrogant neighbor, the lawyer Brent Norton, to get supplies. Along their way, they see a heavy mist and later, military convoys, police and firefighter trucks, ambulances heading toward it. While in the supermarket, a frantic bleeding local arrives crying that there is something alive in the mist and the manager closes the entrance door while the place is encased by the mist. When David, another client and two employees go to the back of the store to start the generator, they open the back-door and the cashier Norm is hold and dragged by fierce tentacles. David and the two survivors succeed to close the loading door, and when they tell the people what happened, Brent does not trust on his words and believes it is a prank and the God-fearing woman Mrs. Carmody preaches the Apocalypse and that she is the vessel of Lord on Earth. Sooner the group discovers that they are under siege of blood thirsty creatures from another dimension that have reached our planet through a window open by a failed military research. Further, the crazy Mrs. Carmody has many followers and is becoming dangerous and dangerous in her speeches. Without alternative, a small group leaded by David decides to take the chance to escape from the supermarket and reach his car, hoping to get out of the mist. "The Mist" works as well as a traditional horror movie, with several genuinely scary sequences. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>Sartre, perhaps, said it best: "hell is other people," i.e. we do a good enough job making life difficult for each other here on Earth, so who needs demons?<br /><br />Following a violent storm that wrecks his studio, illustrator David Drayton takes his son Billy into town for supplies.  Once there, however, an unnatural mist traps them in the supermarket.  The situation goes from inconvenient to horrific when they discover there are monsters in the mist; but mistrust and paranoia lead quickly to a situation inside that is more unsettling than the unknown horrors around them.<br /><br />I just saw this for a second time, and was once again impressed by how effective it was in its dark simplicity and how much it resembled the old school 50's and 60's horror thrillers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC0">The Thing from Another World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a>.  It puts the focus on the human drama, and the way that fear and mistrust can make human beings worse than any monster.  Marcia Gay Harden's apocalyptic power grab was truly frightening, and it's rare that commercial Hollywood filmmakers have the guts to deliver on a premise as scary as this one, and carry it through to the finish.  Compare the ending of this film, which is smaller scale but to my mind more effective and in its own way sublime, to the ending of Steven Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTI">War of the Worlds</a>, or to the ending of any other conventional Hollywood horror film and it will be clear how unique Darabont's approach was here, that managed to ramp up even on the darkness of Stephen King's original vision.  I'll take this kind of inventive and thoughtful horror anyday over torture porn like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UNYK3A">Hostel</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>There isn't much more to say that what I've stated in the heading of my review. Plus, what others have said in their "mini-dissertations." Who says that all horror movies have to have a happy ending? This one certainly didn't. And it more than leaves you saddened and depressed (it'll wear off); but that is a good thing, because you'll never forget this movie if just for the ending. Wow!<br /><br />Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, Tobie Jones, Andre Braugher, Frances Sternhagen and the rest of the cast give tension-filled and sometimes maddening performances in this thriller (more so than the actual monsters). Those who think that Marcia Gay Harden as the wacked-out Bible-thumping Mrs. Carmody overdid it, have never been around religious zealots as she portrayed. Believe me, I've gone to churches where there are such self-righteous, "Fire and Brimstone" fanatics all but condemning you to Hell without warning. Which made her character all the more real and frightening.<br /><br />This movie is unforgettable. And Thomas Jane's final scene makes it so.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>I am always devided when it comes to book to movie adaptions as alot of times they ravage the story.

The effects are done well considering, the plot is very suspenciful (fear of the unknown), and the premise of how the mist/whats in the mist came to be is not explained but briefly suggested at and very interesting. I love movies that leave you thinking and captivated ie: 28 Days/Weeks Later and the Mist is no exception. Over all a great movie, this one will leave you captivated and looking over your shoulder and staying away from dark corners for days to come.

'The Mist' is a great example of taking the best from the old and the best from the new and blending them together for a damn good thriller! The FX are very good, the atmosphere is creepy and the tension is high in this well acted deliberately paced horror/sci-fi throwback to the days of drive-ins! I couldn't help but think of my old PS2 game 'Silent Hill' a little watching this film, with it's thick mist and sirens hauntingly sounding in the background. The two disc DVD edition is especially nice with a cool black and white version on the film, plus enough extras to keep any monster fan happy for a while!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE MIST was a terrific short story (ok, a "novella") that seemed impossible to make into a movie at the time it was written (the early '80s). Due to King's various creatures slithering, buzzing, or towering above like walking skyscrapers, I figured a movie would never materialize. Thank God for Frank Darabont! He uses just enough cgi to keep things interesting. After all, the hideous monsters in the mist are only as frightening as the  human monsters that emerge during the invasion. The folks trapped in the grocery store become their own worst enemies, nearly dooming themselves without much help from any titanic terrors! Marcia Gay Harden (The Dead Girl) is perfectly twisted as the bible-waving Mrs. Carmody. Mr. Drayton (Thomas Jane) tries logic, common sense, and other such useless tools in a hopeless attempt to reason w/ the unbalanced prophet, who soon gathers a group of mindless followers! So, while an army of creatures lumber about outside, the humans fight an epic battle of wills inside. Very well done. Yes, the ending is different from the book. It's also a dark, merciless final&eacute; to this tale of building dread. So, if you can only handle happy endings, you might want to watch YOU'VE GOT MAIL again instead...  P.S.- I liked all the characters in this.

There have been some films that were extraordinarily bad, some that we extraordinarily good, and some that were just so-so.<br /><br />"The Mist", however, is one of the films that holds up well when compared to the original story, except for the ending. The book ends with a slight hope for the future, whereas the film had a "Twilight Zone-ish" ending. Why Frank Darabont (who did amazing work with "The Green Mile") chose to make such a change is beyond me, but I guess in the long run, it did have more of an emotional impact.<br /><br />I was able to identify with the characters and their initial plight (surviving Hurricane Katrina was similar to what the townspeople went through during the aftermath of the storm, though on a MUCH smaller scale)and I truly cared about what happened to them.<br /><br />A simple trip to the supermarket quickly turns into a nightmare and the pace and suspense of the film never lets up until the very end. The special effects are quite convincing and the performances by the actors are very well done.<br /><br />Overall, "The Mist" is a very good horror/suspense film that should keep you quite entertained for the two-hour running time. You will want to keep the kiddies away from this one, though. Lots of swearing, graphic violence, scary creatures, and a bit of gore.<br /><br />Not recommended for the feint of heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>This is a great movie, very entertaining.

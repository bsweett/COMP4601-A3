It has it's sad and even depressing moments but it's still uplifting and touching. How many movies do we get about living life to the fullest ? The answer is simply, not enough. Sure we all aren't rich like Nicholson's character so we all can't see the world before we die. But the movies heart is in the right place and it's well acted with gorgeous locations.<br /><br />  I think the problem is that critics have just gotten too used to handing Rob Reiner movies one star and this one didn't deserve it at all. Nicholson and Freeman both have charm and the movie has some too. Maybe there's something wrong with me, I didn't see the Davinci Code as being that bad either lol. But I liked this movie and am ready to stick up for it if I have to.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>Two world-class actors work together and have a hellacious time, and we get to share that fun.  And we get to see Rob Morrow practice medicine again.<br /><br />The plot's wildly improbable and pretty simple:  two guys learn that they are going to die, and assemble and execute a list of things they will do before they kick the bucket.  BTW, the scene where Morgan Freeman gets his initial cancer diagnosis (on a cell phone, which is also improbable) is wonderfully performed.  There are other scenes which reminded me of my wife's career work as a family advocate;  she takes care of family members and visitors of emergency room patients.  Arguably the first part of the movie is just like a day at work for her and for millions of other doctors, nurses and caregivers.<br /><br />One item on the bucket list was "to kiss the most beautiful girl in the world."  In this movie, Jack Nicholson's character gets to do that by kissing his granddaughter, whom it looked like he'd never met before.<br /><br />I shared a song with the most beautiful girl in the world many years ago, called "The Waters of March," written by Antonio Carlos Jobim.  The lyrics sound like nonsense;  my girl and I used to debate what they meant.<br /><br />But the last words of the "doggerel" are, "It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart."  While looking at the Pyramids, Morgan Freeman tells Jack that the ancient Egyptians believed that, at death, you were asked two questions to gain admittance to heaven:  did you have joy, and did you bring joy to others.<br /><br />Mayve Jobim and the ancient Egyptians synched up.  Death is surely the end of all strain, and what matters is the joy in your heart.<br /><br />Nicholson tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of erotic joy to Freeman;  Freeman's decision to decline the offer regains him his marriage.<br /><br />Freeman tries to attain heaven by bringing his brand of family joy to Nicholson;  Nicholson's immediate reaction is rage, anguish and withdrawal, wonderfully acted (reminded me a little of Nicholson's work in "Carnal Knowledge").<br /><br />But the common thread was family.  Shelby Mustangs, Himalayas and skydiving aside, family is what brings us the greatest joy, and we can only get what we give.<br /><br />So, kiss the most beatiful girl in the world, and don't put it off.  Embrace your family and find the greatest joy there is.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a relatively happy man.  Carter is a self-taught man with a thirst for knowledge that is never quite quenched.  He has three children, a devoted wife, and is an ace mechanic.  A telephone call one morning from the hospital changes everything.  The operation he had months before was unsuccessful and has terminal cancer in the brain.  Carter finds himself in the hospital participating in a "promising" experimental treatment.  Carter's roommate in the hospital turns out to be none other than the CEO of the hospital, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson).  Edward has built a fortune and an empire by turning failing hospitals around into relatively profitable businesses.  However, as Edward soon learns profitable hospitals aren't necessarily customer friendly or the nicest places to stay.  Edward has a similar illness as Carter and the men from two different worlds soon develop a friendship.  One day, while waiting for his test results Carter begins writing a "bucket list" a list of all the things he would like to do before he "kicks the bucket".  When he receives news that he only has about six months to live at the most, Carter abandons the idea.  Edward, however, won't allow Carter to give up so easily and together the two men take off on a journey around the world living out their every whim, from skydiving, to eating lunch on one of the Great Pyramids, to racing expensive sports cars.  Along the way the two men learn a great deal about friendship and themselves.<br /><br />THE BUCKET LIST is a fairly engaging, sentimental movie.  The movie has a strong emotional appeal, especially if anyone has lost a parent or parental figure in their lives.  Freeman and Nicholson make a great team and I wish they would have done more movies together in their careers.  On the negative side, the opening and concluding segments of THE BUCKET LIST are a bit confusing.  Also, I was a bit disappointed that the film didn't have more of Carter and Edward participating in more adventures.  Despite the confusing moments and a lack of adventures, THE BUCKET LIST is still a pretty decent film with a lot of heart and an important message about living life to the fullest.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are room-mates in a hospital that Cole actually owns. He insisted he was running a hospital and not a vacation spa, and there were no private rooms. Two patients to a room, no exceptions.<br /><br />They both have cancer, and both have terminal diagnoses. So Cole, who has way more money than he knows what to do with, proposes they spend their remaining time doing all the things they want to do before they die. The term "Bucket List" came from a professor where Carter went to college who asked them to compose such a list as a philosophy class exercise.<br /><br />So they do it. Some of the scenes are pretty funny, such as their skydiving adventure, their driving race cars, and so on. But it is also very thoughtful as they sit in a classy restaurant over caviar and talk about family matters.<br /><br />I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but one item stands out. While in India visiting the Taj Mahal, they talk about funeral plans. Carter says he wants to be cremated, his ashes put in a tin can and buried somewhere wild. "Like a Chock Full of Nuts can?" jokes Cole, "The heavenly coffee!"<br /><br />The last scene is Cole's assistant placing a second Chock Full of Nuts can in the cairn at the top of a snow-capped mountain.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This movie made me wish I could die with a rich person. How great it would be to really live life before passing away. It might make your passing easier. This is a good movie about two guys, who never met before they shared a hospital room together. They are both dying from cancer. After they were told how long they have to live they made a bucket list. For those who don't know what that is. It is a list of things to do before passing.... Kicking the bucket. They set off together to do all of the things on the bucket list. In the end they were both happy to have known each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A3T0OTH5072YRE.html">A3T0OTH5072YRE</a><br/><p>I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and try to catch one of his movies now and then.  The Bucket List I had heard a lot about but never really gave it much thought one way or the other.  But the late night movie bug caught and it was available, so I finally got my chance to see it.<br /><br />When billionaire hospital owner Edward Cole ends up in his own hospital, he never expects to make a friend in auto-mechanic Carter Chambers.  However, the two do strike up an unlikely bond and on the spur of a moment decision, after being handed their "death sentences" for cancer, they decide to fulfill a bucket list.  Or rather a list of things to do before they kick the bucket.  They go sky diving, travel the world, but eventually Carter realizes he should be at home with his family.  Edward is not so confident in this change of events though and isn't sure how to take it when Carter tries to give him the same gift of realization.  They both don't have that long to live, but its still hard to decide what to do with their lives.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Edward Cole: Jack Nicholson<br />Carter Chambers: Morgan Freeman<br /><br />I really like these two actors but don't think that this is their best performances ever.  They still do a good job but while polar opposites of each other at times, sometimes it seemed a little too contrived.  Freeman's character was a little too sage while Nicholson's was a little too out there to be believable sometimes.  Still, it was nice to see them pal around.<br /><br />For a plot this moved along pretty good.  It was interesting, albeit a bit unbelievable at times but since its a movie I'm allowing to suspend reality for a bit.  It was interesting to see some of the stuff on the bucket list, although it seems a lot of it would be standard for everyone (go on safari, travel the world, etc.) but some of it was unique to the characters and that was nice.  Some of the scenes were a little cheesy and you could tell they were backdrops instead of the actual place which was a surprising thing to me considering when the movie was made.  I also don't remember much of the music which means that it must have just been background filler.<br /><br />Not a bad movie but not the most excellent either of these two have done.  I'd probably watch it again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>I don't normally pick comedies, but was very happily surprised by this one.  Two guys bond while sharing a hospital room, sharing terminal cancer.  There is real chemistry between them, a give and take by two men who have virtually nothing in common.  One is a hard-nosed businessman, the other a mechanic with a wonderful self-taught mind.<br /><br />The plot revolves about a list of things they want to do before their time is up.  Nicolson is rich, so he invites Freeman on a tour of the world, where they skydive, attempt to trek in the Himalayas, and stay in exotic locales, crossing things off the list as more and more is revealed about the characters' lives.  They change each other and then make major steps in their lives.<br /><br />Sure, this is a tried and true formula, but these actors pull it off with true originality and excellence.  I laughed, was moved, and delighted in the philosophy of life that emerges through the journey of the film.  It is genuinely beautiful and very fun.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UFV4HALV2OXW.html">A1UFV4HALV2OXW</a><br/><p>Self-made tycoon Edward Coles (Jack Nicholson) finds himself sharing a hospital room with auto mechanic and family man Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). During chemo treatments they form a bond which intensifies when they both learn that their treatments have failed. With Cole's cash, the two men work their way through a combined list of things they want to do before they "kick the bucket." Funny and uplifting, The Bucket List is a story about friendship and redemption.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EHTFVSD0H7I6.html">A1EHTFVSD0H7I6</a><br/><p>I should have loved this film. I really like Nicholson and Freeman. I also enjoy a good dramedy, even those about death -- one of my all-time favorites is Better Off Dead. It must be very difficult to pull off funny when the subject is death, so to do so is impressive. The Bucket List tries, and sometimes gets very close... but I didn't love this film. It was okay. I don't regret the time invested, but, I'm not adding it to my library.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />There was a manipulative feel to it, at times too much emotion, and others a lack that seemed extreme even when taking the grieving process into account. And I really didn't like the characters. The actors did a great job with the material. But there were moments where I ended up scratching my head and wondering where the inappropriate emotion was coming from, or how in the world that choice was made. I will admit that I just lost a near dear one to lung cancer and the hospital scenes were tough to watch. But I don't think that affected my feelings about the characters.<br /><br />Freeman plays a hard-working, responsible family man, Carter. He's sacrificed his whole life for his family. Nicholson plays the part of a rich playboy, Edward. Edward owns the hospital where Carter is living during cancer treatment. Edward is diagnosed with cancer and ends up as Carter's roommate because Edward is infamous for publicly stating from his soapbox that "there are no private rooms etc.etc." Predictably, they hate sharing and each other until treatment and struggles bring them together in a brotherhood of the suffering and dying. They begin a bucket list..."things to do before I kick the bucket." Actually, Carter does and the items on the list are evidence of his life of responsibility and service. But then Edward and his deep pockets get involved and the adventure is on.<br /><br />I struggled with Carter's embracing of some of Edward's foolishness. I didn't like Carter's wife which was probably the goal otherwise Carter would have just looked selfish for taking off on the mad adventure around the world. Maybe I've been wrong about things. I always thought that I'd look back and feel that my life made a difference in others' lives because of relationship, not because of my experiences and exploits. Ultimately, that is kind of the end message. But it takes a long, twisted road to get there.</p></br><a href="../users/A32T2H8150OJLU.html">A32T2H8150OJLU</a><br/><p>*spoiler alert*<br />Nicholson and Freeman play two elderly men who meet when they unexpectedly find themselves sharing a hospital room, and as they battle cancer.

Nicholson plays Edward Cole, and is rich; Freeman (Carter Chambers) isn't (he's a mechanic).  Chambers is married; Cole is married to his work.  Both are seriously ill, and given months to live.  Chambers starts jotting on a pad, curious about the note, Cole picks it up.  Chambers is not happy, but allows that it is a 'bucket list', i.e. a list of things to do before one dies.<br /><br />Cole decides to make both of their lists a reality.  First on the list, skydiving.  Then, racing a Mustang 350 race car, Mount Everest and other things.<br /><br />When the movie came out, the reviews were mixed, and I wasn't that motivated to see it.  However, one came to me, and I watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Both actors do a good job allowing the audience to understand a bit of how it is to face one's last illness.  Both Cole and Chambers grow from knowing one another; the single Cole grows the most.<br /><br />Recommended.  It's a good movie and I enjoyed watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>When this film first hit theaters back in 2007, it spawned a whole collection of "Bucket Lists" (a list of things to do before you "kick the bucket", as the saying goes).  It seemed a little sappy and contrived ("can those two old goats really carry a film these days?" was one of my mindsets), so it took me until now to see it.  I wish I would have "relented" sooner!<br /><br />Basically, the plot of this film centers on two characters: the filthy-rich, uptight Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and the family-loving, laid-back Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  The two happen to meet while sharing a hospital bed, and (though grudgingly at first) begin to form a bond over their advancing ages.  When Cole notices a strange "Bucket List" scrawled out on a napkin by Chambers, he decides to make the list a reality.  The two gallivant around the country together, embarking on such journeys as skydiving, seeing the Pyramids, and climbing a mountain (to name a few).<br /><br />In terms of evaluating the overall plot of the movie, it is always sincere, bordering on downright sappiness or pure cheese.  If you can get past the idea that the two "old codgers" are doing things that would completely tax men half their age, the story will suck you in.  If not, you won't buy in and thus miss the emotional payoff in the final scenes.<br /><br />However, whatever credibility issues arise from the plot, the film is so superbly acted that it almost doesn't even matter.  The chance to watch such legends as Nicholson and Freeman work their magic together is an opportunity that should not be missed.  These men, contrary to the "pretty boys" and "sex symbols" of the current generation, are the cream of the crop in terms of dramatics and emotional performances.  So, even if the plot doesn't hook you in, just watching those two stalwarts act will provide much enjoyment!<br /><br />Thus, though not an instant classic or anything like that, "The Bucket List" is a charming little film that will make you laugh, perhaps even shed a tear at the end, and leave you contemplating your own life and relationship with those around you.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>United by a common fate, two terminally ill strangers share a room in a hospital and become the best of friends.  Together, they draw up something called a "bucket list," a catalog of things they've always wanted to do in their lives but somehow never got around to doing.  This includes jumping out of an airplane, getting a tattoo, driving a racecar and touring the planet (luckily, one of them is rich enough to own his own jet) - all before "kicking the bucket."<br /><br />Sort of a "feel-good" movie about death, Rob Reiner's "The Bucket List" pretty much plays out as one would expect it to, with a predictable and episodic script (by Justin Zackham) that wobbles uncomfortably between whistling-past-the-graveyard humor and courage-in-the-face-of-death sentimental uplift (the latter being particularly evident in  Morgan Freeman's stentorian voiceover narration and Marc Shaiman's tinkling-piano score).<br /><br />Like the solid professionals they are, Freeman and Jack Nicholson both rise above the cliches of their respective stereotypes: Nicholson's of a gruff, billionaire playboy (true typecasting if ever there was any) who's been successful in all areas of his life except where it really counts, that is to say as a loving husband and father; and Freeman's of a stolid, conservative family man who's never learned to just cut loose and enjoy life to the full.  Now, just as they are about to meet their maker, these two polar opposites get a chance to teach one another valuable lessons on how to make the most of what little time remains to them.<br /><br />All told, there's nothing particularly striking or memorable about "The Bucket List," but the actors make it worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term.  It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love.<br /><br />Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly  diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy.  Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need.  Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other.<br /><br />Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine.  But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.  Grady Harp, June 08</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>The Bucket List tells the sensitive and well thought-out story of two older men who are diagnosed with cancer so severe that they have six months to live--or maybe a year if they're lucky. Look for stunning performances from both Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers and Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole. Beverly Todd also acts her heart out as Beverly Chambers, Carter's wife.<br /><br />The action begins when Carter Chambers, a working class black man, and Edward Cole, super-wealthy self-made rich white guy who actually owns the hospital they're in become roommates in the oncology ward of the hospital. At first Carter and Edward don't exactly hit it off but it isn't long before they forge a friendship. When they each learn that by coincidence they have six months to a year to live, they embark on a trip to accomplish certain lifelong dreams and personal goals before they die. The list of things to do is called The Bucket List because it's a list of things to do before they "kick the bucket."<br /><br />Of course, because Edward Cole is wealthy many scenes in this movie become almost miraculously possible. They travel the world by private corporate jet; and they live more in just a few weeks than most people ever do in a lifetime.<br /><br />Of course, life has its ways of surprising just about any of us; so still the plot could go just about anywhere. How will Beverly, Carter's wife, react to all this? Will she understand and remain patient while Carter lives out a few lifelong dreams or will she want her husband home NOW? Will Carter and Edward be able to keep their cool when they are stranded in Asia during a monstrous snowstorm and they are not allowed to fly? What happens if one of them gets very sick along the way? What about Edward's refusal to make up with his daughter who disowned him long ago--will he ever decide to approach her or will he remain obstinate in his refusal to even meet with her? The results may surprise you. No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!<br /><br />As a cancer survivor who is finishing my own chemotherapy soon, I will add that some of the side-effects of the chemotherapy they receive are exaggerated. However, I think director Rob Reiner added these elements to the film to make it somewhat more dramatic.<br /><br />Overall, The Bucket List is an excellent movie; and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman turn in superlative performances that proves these guys can still act better than the vast majority of actors ever could. Beverly Todd does a great job as Carter's wife; and Sean Hayes also does well as Edward Cole's personal assistant Thomas. I highly recommend this film for fans of these terrific actors; and people comfortable with the subject matter will appreciate this motion picture as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>(3.5 *`s)  You've probably seen the previews, so much elaboration isn't needed, but `Bucket List' is still a worthy journey even if the plot is laid out for you already.  Sweet, sage, and funny, Rob Reiner delivers another heartwarming gem that's rejuvenating to watch.<br /><br />They couldn't be more opposite.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy owner of hospitals where the frills are fleeting at best.  "We run hospitals, not health spas," Edward brashly tells his potential clients.  "Two guests to a room, no exceptions."  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is mild and wise.  He is a mechanic at a garage supporting his family, but is an academic at heart and a trivia expert who would make Cliff Claven blush.  A fellow colleague is always trying to stump him with questions from a trivia book, and Carter's favorite past time is to blurt out the answers (questions really) while watching 'Jeopardy'.<br /><br />You guessed it.  They both have cancer and have to share a room in one of his hospitals.  Thomas* (whose real name is Matthew, but is too hard for Edward to keep track of) is his assistant.  He can't have his own room because it would be bad PR not to follow his own rules.  Edward does get top service by his doctor (Rob Morrow who plays a far different MD than he did on `Northern Exposure'.)  The odd couple take a while to warm up to each other.  Each is absorbed in his own interests, and each has foibles that would annoy anyone.<br /><br />As their prospects both turn terminal, Edward comes across Carter's "bucket list".  Meant to be a whimsical exercise from Carter's philosophy professor, it gets them thinking about using their precious last moments to do what they haven't done before.  Edward has the money but Carter has the wisdom, so sorting out their priorities turns from a final blessing to a final battle.  Carter, who always wanted to be a history professor, decides to take up Edward's offer to take a whirlwind tour of the world and discover the joys of skydiving and race car driving to name just two.  ("You gonna drive it or give it a dress?" asks an impatient Edward to Carter the mechanic who would truly appreciate the opportunity.)<br /><br />This is all to the chagrin of Virginia, (also Ginny)[Beverly Todd], Carter's devoted nurse wife.  ("You're a fool who's figured out a way not have cancer," she chides her husband.  And to Edward:  "My husband is not for sale.")  Carter rekindles Edward's ability to think deeply.  He offers Edward the challenge that below the surface relationships and getting one's house in order really matter.  It's not just about the fun.<br /><br />Once they're on the road, they have several disagreements.  One of the best merits of the movie is how it can transition from fun and funny to philosophical.  Some may find the whole affair ponderous, but I loved the way both grapple emotionally, physically, and intellectually to the challenges that death provides.  If you liked books and movies like '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008L3SE">Tuesdays with Morrie</a>,' then surely 'Bucket List' should appeal to you.<br /><br />We've all seen "The Little Old Lady from Pasadena" routine so often:  Gramps or granny is in a hot rod, saying displaced things like "cool" and "far out."  It usually is funny and offensive at the same time.  This factor couldn't be more remote from the film.  There's never a bitter aftertaste when watching the elderly men doing young things.  It's all done thoughtfully and tastefully.  The dialogue is excellent.  The jokes are funny; the questions posed are interesting, but without the dead ends, for they provide some thoughtful answers as well.<br /><br />Watching this film reminds me that watching a three-and-a-half-star film can sometimes be more rewarding than watching a full five-star film.  In the end, 'The Bucket List' is a feel good movie with some substance that should be put on your movie "list".<br /><br />(*Sean Hayes whom I recognized, but didn't figure out 'til late to be the 'Will and Grace' star in a far different role.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson is as good as it gets for crazy in love with life, and Morgan Freeman is as good as it gets for smart, thoughtful, and good to the core.<br /><br />This movie is one that I got, skimmed through, dismissed, and then sat down and watched all the way through.<br /><br />It is NOT a depressing movie, nor is it a "joy" movie.

The drama never becomes melodramatic; the movie never drags on or drags you down. There is a pureness of heart and a beauty in the script. There is friendships between the two characters that clearly stems from the actors respect of each other. The script is well done, but so is the direction. The movie is as funny as it poignant, as philosophical as it is perpetual. The movie's message might not be all too different from many other movies - find the joy in your life, seek your family, enjoy your last days to the fullest. Yet, the message is delivered in a wonderful way. The movie relies on Jack Nicholson's performance (more of the same unlikable, filthy rich grumpy old man, we've become accustomed to), but the unsung hero is Morgan Freeman - he brings humanity and humility to the movie and to his character.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>In real time & in this movie. Still in fine form. Jack Nicholson (Ed) & Morgan Freeman (Carter) meet in the hospital & become fast friends. Ed is lonely & fabulously wealthy. Carter is a scholarly mechanic with a large loving family & wife of 45 years. The movie may skew a bit to the older crowd but anybody can appreciate this movie. Besides, what over-50 guy has not composed a bucket list of sorts, things to do, places to see before death? Both men are given death sentences, months to live. They compose a list. Being asymphtomatic & having all of Ed's money to play with they begin, much to Carter's wife, Virginia's consernation. Beverly Todd cannot be 65 years old. A good looking woman. She wants Carter to die quietly in her arms. They do the things, racing a Cobra Shelby on a course, jumping out of a plane, visiting the pryamids etc. as they fly around the world (Ed has a private jet). It becomes a buddy/road trip. There are challenges that each has problems with such as Carter being faithful to his wife & Ed reconciling with his grown daughter. It is all done with humor & heavy doses of pop-philsophy. I can see director Rob Reiner fingerprints all over the place. It is all pretty entertaining. The ending of the movie is of course pre-ordained. Even that is amusing. Ed's words of wisdom that men over 60 can relate to: "Always know where the nearest bathroom is, never waste a hard-on & never trust a fart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>I thought this was a really good movie.  It starts off rather slow, because the two characters wanted to build up a relationship and establish a storyline while they stayed in the hospital, but if you're willing to wait 30 minutes or so, the interesting parts of the story get going, and you begin to see a very original and interesting style of story-telling involving a combination of emotion and comedy.<br /><br />One thing you can pretty much count on from the very beginning is to be crying by the time the film reaches its conclusion.  You pretty much KNOW you'll be crying by the end, and that the happiness between the two characters isn't going to stay like that forever.<br /><br />I will say I agree with the many reviewers that the film deserves to be considered one of the very best written films of the year.  It does every single thing right from the storytelling, to the emotions, to keeping the viewers watching.  It's just a great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>What the devil was I thinking?  When Rob Reiner's THE BUCKET LIST first appeared in theaters, I passed.  I saw the trailers--two old coots kicking up their heels before cashing in their chips--and thought the film looked too contrived and superficial.  Well, I caught the ending of the movie on cable recently, then couldn't wait to view it again, which I did (several times).  This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and I've seen some intense movers and shakers.<br /><br />It's a given when a film features talent like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you are going to get excellent performances.  And both actors deliver:  Freeman as a lifelong mechanic whose true ambitions were thwarted by circumstances; the irascible Nicholson as a curmudgeonly tycoon.  Both characters are suddenly thrown together by terminal illnesses, yet through all the turmoil and heartache a fast friendship develops.  The friction between them as they first meet, the adventures they share as they go through their respective "Bucket Lists", make up the movie's most comedic scenes.  The skydiving scene, in particular, was very effective for me, as it was readily apparent both Freeman and Nicholson were actually freefalling through the air during the scene.<br /><br />The actors themselves could have kicked the bucket.<br /><br />Yet the ending was what moved me the most.  Because we as the audience have developed an attachment to the characters, it becomes very difficult to watch as they meet their respective fates.  The interaction between the two in the end--the total and complete way each man has made a change, for the better, in his friend's life--makes for one incredibly poignant climax.  THE BUCKET LIST covers the full range of emotions; easily one of the best bittersweet movies in many years.  Highly recommended.<br />--D.

Maybe it's a clue for all us to start on our bucket lists sooner rather than later.  Still, as a film it's not very memorable.  I saw it a week ago and I'm just remembering that I watched it and needed to post a review.  Nicholson is Nicholson and of course Morgan Freeman is narrating.

Hopefully I'll be around a long, long time, but you just never know. This is an enjoyable movie with a more than capable cast especially in the two leads. I can watch these guys in just about anything, and Freeman could recite the phone book and I would listen.<br /><br />The movie is kept on a comedic level through most of the story, probably because we would be crying all the way through this film if it weren't! Believe me you will shed a tear before it ends, but through the middle of the film, I found a lot of the "Bucket List" "high jinks" to be rather artificial at times. The second half of the film is much better and it is also where it redeems itself. It's a good film with great actors that will hold your interest, but it's far from perfect. The DVD transfer is very good, the extra material is very sparse.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This movie was so good. it made me cry at the end of the film.

This was a very good touching movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AFFVUZEGP1FDQ.html">AFFVUZEGP1FDQ</a><br/><p>This movie brought tears to my eyes. It was wonderfully performed by the one and only Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. The story is about two men, Edward, a rich businessman, and Carter, a mechanic. Both men have cancer and are roommates in the hospital. Thinking they will die, they go on a trip around the world trying to fulfill Carter's (Freeman) bucket list: A list of things to do before you kick the bucket (aka die). Throughout the movie, the men deal with their fears, families and foster a great friendship. The movie has a great message and a good story. It is honestly a fantastic movie to see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I will admit, I did hesitate to watch this movie given all the hype and publicity. I finally broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did.<br />I've read some other reviews and agree with some of them.<br />But, what I got out of this movie goes a lot deeper.<br />This movie speaks to me of the ties in human nature. The ties to family, to our work, our identity, our ideals, our religion and even to strangers. There are countless ties that bind us each and every moment of every day. How tight the tie is depends on the moment, the situation, other who are present.<br />In this movie, the main characters loosen their ties and focus on themselves. They set out to accomplish things they wish they had done in their life....before their death.<br />This movie also shows how reaching a dream isn't done alone. Whether we think about it or not, we do not live alone in this world. However, how much consideration do we often have toward each other? Even those who are 'invisible' to us most of the time?<br />I can't begin to tell you how deep you can go with the thoughts provoked in this movie. But I will tell you this. If you see only one movie to shake the cobwebs out of your brain and make you aware of 'Life'... this should be it.<br />Cudos to Rob Reiner and all that went into this movie. Definiely a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>The Bucket List<br />Version: U.S.A / Region Free<br />VC-1 BD-25<br />Running time: 1:37:04<br />Movie size: 19,146,608,640 bytes<br />Disc size: 21,407,716,158 bytes<br />Average video bit rate: 22.97 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby Digital Audio 5.1 640 Kbps English / French / Spanish<br />Subtitles: English / French / Spanish<br />Number of chapters: 23<br /><br />#Featurette: "Writing 'The Bucket List'" (HD, 5 minutes)<br />#Music Video (SD)<br />#Trivia Track<br />#Interviews (SD, 39 minutes)<br />#Featurette: "Making the Music Video" (SD, 5 minutes)</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's really virtually impossible not to like a movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in it.. they add a sense of gravitas to anything they are in - and there is pleasure to be had in watching their contrasting styles spark off each other.<br />Here, the play two men, both suffering from cancer, sharing a room at a hospital (in a rather contrived set up).  After some preamble to fleetingly show that they are actually not well, they create a bucket list - a list of things they want to do before kicking the bucket, and since one of them is rich, set out to work their way through the items, learning about themselves and each other as they go.<br />It works because the leads are strong, particularly Freeman.  Nicholson overplays, but then the writing does call for it.  It does stumble however in the script department from time to time... For example, Freeman talking to Nicholson - "You once said you're not everyone. Well, that's true-you're certainly not everyone, but everyone is everyone."  It's not exactly Shakespeare.  The concept of terminally ill men skydiving, climbing mountains and traveling the world somewhat while barely catching their breath also stretches credibility.  Morgan Freeman does his trademark stately voice over, which only serves to remind you of The Shawshank Redemption, and the comparison is not favourable.  And while the male bonding is fun to watch and some of the one-liners funny, the warmth of affection Freeman narrates for the Nicholson character never seems quite justified by anything his character does.<br />Those quibbles aside, it's fun, warm and fuzzy round the edges, has some decent performances, and is short enough not to outlast its welcome.  Not a classic, but thumbs up nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>I must say, I really enjoyed this movie.  The character stayed true thoughout, the screenplay doesnt give a quick fix to what we know are deep seeded issues.  Nicholson is fantastic in this, he is much like his character in Term of Enderment, he is at times funny and at time heart breaking.  Freeman gets the less showing part, but as always he is solid and thoroughly likeable.  Sean Hayes does a predictable turn as Nicholsons assistant, but he is good none the less.  I read reviews of this film when it came out and most were less than glowing, so I was reluctant to get the DVD..that was a mistake, not only did I enjoy this movie to the utmost, but I plan to watch it several more times..if for no other reason than to watch the amazing cinemaphotography that opens the film and to listen to John Mayers perfect "Say", that ends the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The movie is entertaining, funny and poignant at the end.  We all have a list of things we want to do or accomplish in life, but haven't.  The "Bucket List" gives us a chance to see and live our dreams through the two elderly men,  Carter Chamberlain (Morgan Freeman) a happily married auto mechanic, and Edward Cole (a billionaire playboy).  Both happen to share a hospital room and both have terminal cancer with just months to live.<br /><br />When Edward Cole (who has billions and wants to spend it) was trying to convince Carter Chamberlain to take the time they had in remission to do things on the bucket list, he compared how fast the last 45 years of his life had went and how fast the coming months would go by.  Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?<br /><br />If you can take the leap of faith that terminal patients can run off for months without a care and enjoy every minute they have left - you get the message of the film and enjoy the life, love, laughter.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Formulaic? yes  Sentimental?  yes  Transparent?  yes<br /><br />But hey, feel good and have some fun?

Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, and Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers give great performances as men who are already past midlife and appreciating their waning years. Edward as a captain of industry, and Carter as a father and trivia buff. When they both find themselves next to each other in the hospital with cancer and a few months to live, both their lives change. The greatest change is for Edward. The movie is not to preachy but it shows us some of realism of being terminally ill with cancer. We see the impact it has on each man in his own way.<br /><br />For the fun of it Carter had started to create a "Bucket List" based on a class he had taken discussing what they wanted to do before they die. Carter throws it away when he learns of his final fast approaching fate. Edward finds it and decides it's the best course of action for them to have one last fling of life before they die. The rest the movie we see them travelling around the world, racing cars, and skydiving. The conclusion of the movie we see they go their separate ways with different priorities but then meeting again in a dramatic way when one is near death. The message given is a good one for anyone that has a family or friends they have alienated. Good quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch "Secondhand Lions", "The World's Fastest Indian", and "Finding Forester". - C.

Having now seen the film I ask the film's critics what they have been smoking.  Nicholson and Freeman riff off each other like they've been working together for years.  What were they expecting, "Hamlet"?!  Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them.  Considering that the film deals with cancer patients it could have been maudlin and saccharine.  "The Bucket List" earns every ounce of emotion and tears it engenders from the audience.

I really like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman and ultimately, I think that's what sold me about seeing this and now I'm glad that I did.<br />The chemistry between Morgan and Jack was amazing.  This is definately one of the most fun and uplifting movies I'd seen in a while and yes I cried in it, but also there were moments of laughter too.  Edward Cole (Nicholson) is wealthy and through his money, he and Carter Chambers (Freeman) do things like touring the world, race car driving and skydiving.<br />Other than the cheesy dialogue and some predictability, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's a feel good movie with a lesson that you shouldn't need to have a death sentance over you to start living.  Also being faced with death doesn't mean you can't live out the rest of your time rather than fall into depression and accept your fate.

A young audience will for the most part find this to be silly, irrelevent and unrelated to where they are at the present time in life, while the older, fifty-five plus viewer (like myself) will view this as a wake-up call and cause one to re-evaluate what one deems important and worthwhile. This film is truly a reflection of real life, the young unconcerned with the inevitable and the questions it posits, the aging begrudgingly accepting and learning to deal with the allotment of time remaining.<br /><br />Yes this is a film designed to draw a specific audience and stars two of Hollywood's most respected senior actors to attract that target group. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are superb and play off each others strengths magnificently. If you're looking for something a little bittersweet and thoughtful populated with some of the most breathtaking scenic landscapes on the planet why not give this one a try. Who knows, it might just inspire you to compose your own bucket list.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A long time ago, Carter Chambers' philosophy professor suggested that his students compose a "bucket list," a collection of all the things they wanted to do, see and experience in life before they kicked the bucket. But while Carter was trying to define his private dreams and plans, reality intruded. Marriage, children, myriad responsibilities and, ultimately, a 46-year job as an auto mechanic turned his concept of a bucket list into little more than a bittersweet memory of lost opportunities and a mental exercise he occasionally thought about to pass the time. Meanwhile, corporate billionaire Edward Cole never saw a list without a bottom line. He was always too busy making money and building an empire to think about what his deeper needs might be beyond the next big acquisition or cup of gourmet coffee. Then life delivered an urgent and unexpected wake-up call to both of them. Carter and Edward found themselves sharing a hospital room with plenty of time to think about what might happen next--and about how much of that was in their hands. For all their apparent differences, they discovered they had two very important things in common: an unrealized need to come to terms with who they were and the choices they'd made, and a pressing desire to spend the time they had left doing everything they ever wanted to do. So, against doctor's orders and all good sense, these two virtual strangers check themselves out of the hospital and hit the road together for the adventure of a lifetime--from the Taj Mahal to the Serengeti, the finest restaurants to the seediest tattoo parlors, the cockpit of vintage race cars to the open door of a prop plane--with just a sheet of paper and their passion for life to guide them. Adding and crossing items off their list while taking in the grandeur and beauty of the world, they grapple with the difficult questions and the even more difficult answers that plague all of us. And, without even realizing it, become true friends.  This movie is full of well-earned rueful humor. What a gift. Two of the world's greatest actors come together and create movie magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Plagued with post-production difficulties (evident in its truncated 97-minute length), "The Bucket List" managed to rake in $175 million worldwide. However, Rob Reiner's directorial skill deserves something more substantial than this manipulative piece of schmaltz. The film's selling point is the first-time pairing of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, the Oscar winners display little chemistry in their scenes together. Nicholson overacts in desperation to keep the shuck and jive afloat, but "The Bucket List" is dead on arrival.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>The phrase "the bucket list" has become part of our culture.  The concept is to make a list of all the things you want to do before you die and then do them.  Seems like a good idea.<br /><br />This 2008 film, staring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is based on this concept.  These two men are fine actors.  They bring their years of experience, subtleties of expression and past fame to their roles of two terminally ill cancer patients who meet in the hospital and then go off to live their dreams before they die. Nicholson is the rich one who can finance all sorts of adventures for the two of them.  Freeman is the hardworking family man who has worked all his life as a mechanic and never got a chance for a formal education. Together they make a good team and their performances are excellent.<br /><br />The script, however, leaves much to be desired.  First of all, it is NOT a comedy although its publicity makes it seem so.  Second of all, it is just not real.  Terminally ill patients don't have the stamina to go sky diving, big game hunting in Africa, etc.  Freeman's life is all family and just too sickly sweet.  Nicholson's final reconciliation with a daughter who hates him contains no surprises.  And the film itself, instead of being uplifting, is actually sort of depressing.<br /><br />However, this movie has one big redeeming value.  It makes a person think about his or her own life and what is really important.  And if a film can do that, it has achieved something more than just plain entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Just about everybody I know who watched this movie really loved it.

Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.<br />On my personal bucket list, missing this DVD will be item #1.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Film master Akira Kurosawa made one of his most quietly powerful films in 1952's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLMU">Ikiru</a> about a government paper-pusher who learns he has six months to live and takes stock of all the things he has not done with his life. By comparison, Rob Reiner's output as a director has been less than stellar for well over a decade (consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D8L1K">Alex & Emma</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMGICS">Rumor Has It...</a>). This time, he appears to be going for a partial remake of "Ikiru" times two with this lugubrious, feel-good 2007 dramedy with components of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF6">Terms of Endearment</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790731517">Grumpy Old Men</a> thrown in for good measure. The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clich&eacute;s that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?<br /><br />The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000507P8">The Odd Couple</a> until they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his "bucket list" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.<br /><br />As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voiceover and wizened wisdom he has been providing since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4ZWS">The Shawshank Redemption</a>. And why cast an actor as exuberantly animated as Sean Hayes (the indefatigable Jack on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009Y3RW">Will & Grace</a> for eight seasons) in such an impassive role as Edward's officious factotum Thomas? He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette,  just a five-minute short, "Writing a Bucket List" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, "Say", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song. I suggest renting "Ikiru" instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>'The Bucket List' is a film showing two masters of their art in fine form. Both Nicholson and Freeman manage to pull off the perfect mix of comedy and poignancy in this film without becoming too cheesy or schmaltzy. The premise is actually very simply (2 terminally ill patients working their way through their own Bucket list) but manages to capture their relationships, fears about dying, philosophy about life and more besides in it's short but very sweet 90 minutes. I was kept thoroughly engaged the whole time and enjoyed every minute as they worked their way through a variety of experiences, from sky diving, getting a tattoo, to kissing the most beautiful girl in the world and a whole host of other things. This made for a fun film, with the right elements of humour and sadness and made a serious point about relishing your life without hammering the point home. It left me wondering about what experiences I've yet to try and with an all round good feeling. You can't ask much more from a film really. Great story, great acting and well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>I approached this movie with minimal expectations, given the number of reviews I had read that trashed it.  This is no masterpiece, but not a terrible flick.  Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play characters who have little in common, save for the fact that they each have diagnoses of terminal cancer. To pack as much life as possible into their limited time, they collaborate in writing a "Bucket List," a to-do list of things to do before they die:  skydiving, car-racing, world travel, etc.  In the end, the Grim Reaper wins out but not before the characters find meaning in their lives.<br /><br />Of course, such an endeavor is facilitated if you leave your family or have a multimillionaire buddy and a private jet to bankroll such a quest.  You must suspend your disbelief for much of this movie.  For example, Nicholson's character has his head shaved but is in the hospital long enough for his hair to grown back.  What kind of HMO is he on?  The movie's end is somewhat of a formulaic tearjerker, so have some Kleenex on hand.<br /><br />In the end,  we are all terminal.  We do not know if we have days or decades left to live.  Perhaps this movie will inspire viewers to compose their own "Bucket List" and get busy living their dreams.  Not a masterpiece, but not a bad movie either.</p></br><a href="../users/A13D1WTFEMS9VH.html">A13D1WTFEMS9VH</a><br/><p>I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Their acting here is, as usual, superb. However, this is not a comedy -- unless you find terminal cancer a knee-slapper. I don't want to pay money to see someone who is undergoing chemotherapy racing to the toilet to vomit. But I dunno, maybe it's just me. I had to watch a few 'Three Stooges' episodes to get undepressed. For funny, I'll take a good poke in the eyes any ol' day.</p></br><a href="../users/A25QJBK33C4O0R.html">A25QJBK33C4O0R</a><br/><p>I see another reviewer here at Amazon.com is recommending purchase of this flick (see review titled: Don't Hold Back).  I'm not trying to be contrary, but I'll disagree a bit with that recommendation.  Not because the movie isn't worth it, but more because the Blu-ray disc version is relatively sparce on extras and also because the long-term value for this disc/package doesn't seem high enough to get over the threshold I'd would normally set for recommending purchase versus rental.<br /><br />The film itself is certainly worth viewing, so at least do yourself the favor of renting via Unbox or any other service you prefer.  While the subject matter is sad and somewhat depressing (two victims of cancer or other terminal diseases bond while sharing a hospital room) to begin with, the journey the two individuals make is heartwarming and somewhat uplifting.<br /><br />The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 97 minutes.  The first major portion of the film deals with the main characters finding out about their illnesses and living through (mostly suffering through) treatment for same.  That segment is fairly depressing and not necessarily easy to get through.  It is worth watching just to educate yourself on what life with cancer or a tumor is like, and especially what life while being treated for such things would be like.<br /><br />Once past that part of the film, the story that was promised in trailers and advertisements for the movie comes through, that of a pair of friends that go off to do the things on their 'bucket list' -- a list of things to be done before kicking the bucket.<br /><br />Seeing these two great actors playing these roles and doing a great job in portraying their characters is well worth the price of admission here.  They both are living legends, and both do a great job of playing believable characters.  Additionally, the director for the film is none other than Rob Reiner, himself a legandary director.  A genuine A team of talent.<br /><br />See this movie.  It is most definitely recommended viewing.  Purchase decision really comes down to what you want from a Blu-ray disc or DVD package.  Basic movie? It's here.  A few extras? Yeah, there are a few here, and those that are here aren't bad, but overall the bundle is weak and leaves the feeling that there should have been more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I expected this film to be a comedy. There were a few funny scenes, but the overall seriousness of the main character's medical prognosis dominates the tone of the movie.<br /><br />Nicholson does very well with his role, but it's the same type of character we've seen him play many times before. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. Both are excellent actors, but they really aren't treading new territory with this outing.<br /><br />Also, the story is rather predictable and the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />So why 4 stars?<br /><br />This movie has a lot of heart and delivers a beautiful message. It causes the watcher (or it SHOULD cause) to reflect inward and take a good look at himself (or herself). What am I doing with my life? How is my life affecting others? How do I want to be remembered?<br /><br />Sappy? Yes. Sentimental? Yes.<br /><br />But life can often be those things. How we deal with death is just as important as how we deal with life (I think Captain Kirk once said words to that effect, but I digress).<br /><br />Give this movie a try and watch it with a loved one. I guarantee the ending will make you smile.</p></br><a href="../users/AY46DEOJJYFTW.html">AY46DEOJJYFTW</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman take what could be a formulative, syrupy script and create convincing characters grounded in truth and feeling. From the first baritone note of Morgans character you know you are in the presence of a man you like and care about. What other actor could bring so much to his character as Jack Nicholson, whom Morgan Freeman has to ask his loyal assistance(Sean Hayes), is he crazy? Of course, he is, he's Jack, and we love him. Rob Reiner pulls the strings on this serious film with adequate doses of laughs and creates a moving piece. You might know where it's headed but you will find yourself pulled in and unwilling to turn away. The movie tries to answer some lofty questions, is life about whoever has the most toys wins? or is the measure of a man measure by those who measure themsleves by you? It is a moving and enjoyable treat.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Miss-matched buddy dramedies are a dime a dozen these days.  Very rarely do they star two juggernaut actors like Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  Very rarely are they this devoid of merit.  I'm bewildered at how poorly conceived this film was, when you consider the names involved.  I really wanted to see this.  Sure, it looked corny and unappealing on the outset, but it also stars one of the greatest actors ever (Nicholson) and one of the more understated and nuanced of his generation (Freeman), so the possibilities were endless here.  Instead of challenging these two men to provide us with something insightful and profound, we are left with a film that casts Nicholson as the loudmouthed jerk and Freeman as the quietly sincere `wise' soul.  Seriously, why are such great actors relegated to playing the same character in every film?  Why couldn't Nicholson be the quiet one for a change?  Why can't we see Morgan Freeman boss people around and show lack of personal regard for everyone around him?  I just want something to differentiate this from the last dozen movies these two have starred in.  YUCK.  Seriously, this is saccharine to the hilt, and the forced upon comedic aspects feel redundant and underwhelming.  Thankfully, even when handed the same boring predictable loaf of a character these actors seem to do their best with the role, so they make it at least somewhat watchable (they have great chemistry), but this is a generic story with no arc that isn't 100% predictable.  I just want to slap someone in the face right now.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>Morgan Freeman a mechanic,and Jack Nicholson a billionaire are two<br />roommates in a cancer ward.

It is the same as every other "what-to-do-when-you-know-you're-going-to-die" movie.  Nicholson seems to be trying to recreate his "As Good As It Gets" character.  All these things aside, this really is a good movie at it's core.  It is still well done and worth watching.  Anyone who has lost someone to the scourge of cancer will be touched.  Don't expect anything drastically new, but do expect a quality film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Bucket List" can be best summed up as "Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman pose for green screen postcards." Freeman and Nicholson open the movie enjoying their favorite vices;for Freeman,it's a cigarette,while Nicholson drinks in the scent of rare coffee. Both are stricken with cancer. They find themselves in the same cancer ward.<br /><br />Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) suffers from lung cancer,as if it's divine retribution. He's surrounded by his devoted family. Alone, gazillionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) suffers from brain cancer. Rob Morrow,the policeman from CBS' "Numbers",stars as his joking doctor. Both Cole and Chambers learn they have only a year to live, so they live it up. There's TONS of exposition looong before they go on their Epic Journey.<br /><br />With green screens as their backdrop, Cole and Chambers enjoy skydiving, racing on the Great Wall of China, seeing the Taj Mahal and the pyramids of Egypt. (Why not Junction City,Oregon,home of the Scandinavian Festival,or Hobbiton USA in the Northern California redwoods?) It's very cliched.<br /><br />"Bucket List" is,despite the leading actors' talents,and Freeman's omnipresent narration,deadly dull.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FNES0QEBJZD1.html">A1FNES0QEBJZD1</a><br/><p>Well, it is easy to see that some love this film while others dismiss it as an overly sentimental mishmash so I won't bother to go into the story lines and plot development.  Personally, I like this movie, a lot.  Aside from some typical over the top acting from our boy Jack and Morgan Freeman's typical wise old guy persona, the movie works for me, and as others have stated, delivered a new phrase in our lexicon.<br /><br />However, if you are expecting a greatly increased quality from the blu ray version...don't.  The audio is strictly a 5.1 lossy offering and not DTSHD.  For a dialogue driven film like this, it really doesn't make much of a difference.  There is very little use of the surrounds for your home theater system to make use of.  The video quality is good, nothing outstanding but good.<br /><br />There are a number of extras but no deleted scenes or alternates.  The interview between Rob Reiner, the director and Morgan Freeman was done over a television hookup so that when the camera focuses on Morgan, the interlacing is very, very apparent and I found it distracting.  The whole interview, while some interesting things were mentioned seemed as if the two of them were doing nothing but saying how wonderful they both were.  It got boring.<br /><br />For me, the movie is a 5 star treat, nothing heavy but the end does make me well up.  I do wish the audio were mixed better which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

That alone makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> a treat. It features both men at the top of their game. Nicholson as the millionaire hospital magnate and Freeman as the lowly mechanic strike an unlikely friendship while commiserating over their cancer. It's easy for movies about the elderly and death to take on an almost didactic air. However, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> is a much more subtle about two imperfect men trying to find an appropriate way to spend their last few months on Earth. This is an emotionally powerful film, made more so because it mixes comedy and tragedy so poignantly. I felt like every laugh was so good-natured, while every tear was so meaningful. It's been far too long since I've felt like I'd want to buy a recent movie. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAF4MA">The Bucket List</a> is an exception - I'll want to keep this one just as a reminder that how we die is at least as important as how we live.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>While thoroughly enjoyable this film was completely predictable.  The plot proceeded as expected, and Nicholson has seemingly played a variant of fly-be-free unseemly older man goes off-the-rails in at least two other films.  He does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill.  Freeman's character experiences and expresses a wider range of feeling and transition, and it is he the audience comes to identify with most.  The message of the film is uplifting, though decidedly more humorous.  At times it seemed to not know if it was a drama or a comedy. Approach it with humor and it won't disappoint.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I'll just say that this movie is wonderful!

It has something for everyone.<br /><br />'The Bucket List' features Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).  These two great actors do not disappoint.  Both Cole (a wealthy curmudgeon) and Chambers (a family oriented auto mechanic) have terminal cancer and are given but a few months to live.<br /><br />This unlikely pair become great friends throughout the movie.  They begin developing a 'bucket list' - items that they have always wanted to do before their deaths.  The roster of 'to do' items includes such things as skydiving, driving race cars, visiting the Great Wall of China, laughing until you cry, and viewing something truly majestic.<br /><br />Due to Cole's unlimited financial resources, they are able to fund their dreams.  They also come to realize what things are really important.<br /><br />There are many funny parts along with the somber ones.  I think it is well worth watching.  I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33TBHM3O9AY17.html">A33TBHM3O9AY17</a><br/><p>As a long-time fan of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, I expected to see some strong performances from these two great actors.  Although they didn't live up to some of their earlier great roles, neither were they disappointing.  Both did yeoman's work in their roles as aging men from very different life backgrounds, one phenomenally rich and the other a humble laborer, who found common ground in their battle with terminal cancer.  Both are forced, without regard to wealth or social status, to come to grips with both their own mortality and their past failings.<br /><br />The first half hour or so of the movie was less than gripping, and at times maybe even a little tedious, but once it moves into the meat of the storyline it takes on a new life (although even at this it seems a bit too contrived and just missed a fourth star).  In their quest to live full lives in their last remaining months, and thus to try to undo a lifetime of squandered opportunities, they stumble upon something far more valuable -- true self-understanding, true friendship, and, most importantly, redemption.<br /><br />I hate spoilers, so I won't give any clues except to say that the end of this frequently humorous, frequently poignant tale is delightfully unexpected and equally poetic.  This is not a great movie, but I would characterize it as a good one that will, or at least should, prompt each viewer to stop and think about his or her own approach to life, and to pursue the most important things while there's still time.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Let me ask you a question, if you could know the date or at least the approximate time frame of when you were going to die, would you want to? If you did choose to find out, would you live out the remainder of your days in fear of that final moment, or regretting things you may or may not have had the chance to do? On the other hand, would you take whatever time you were allotted to do your best to live your life to its fullest potential? That is a question, and is essentially the basic theme, that is presented in the new comedy/drama "The Bucket List" starring Morgan Freeman ("The Dark Knight") and Jack Nicholson ("The Departed").<br /><br />"The Bucket List" is the story of two complete strangers, one is a cantankerous billionaire named Edward (Jack Nicholson), and the other is a very kind and wise mechanic named Carter (Morgan Freeman), who find themselves in the same depressing situation when they discover they both have the same prognosis... cancer. Rather than letting this sort of news send them headlong into the depths of depression, these two men embark on an inspiring journey to see and experience many of the world's greatest sights and adventures; showing to everyone around them that just because your time is short, that does not mean your life is over already.<br /><br />Director Rob Reiner ("A Few Good Men"), along with writer Justin Zackham, have done a very good job of balancing an incredibly serious subject matter that hits close to home for many viewers, while at the same time injecting the story with a hefty dose of humor to lift the mood of the film. For some, mixing such a serious subject with comedy may seem offensive or disrespectful, but the story never becomes so humorous that the primary subject ever becomes watered down or treated lightly. I also like that along with the very well-written story, the movie poses some thought-provoking questions that will cause you to think about whether you would like to know when or how you will die, and what exactly you would do with that knowledge. It is always nice when a movie is willing to become a little more than just entertainment and good storytelling, allowing itself to create some form of discussion over its subject matter or themes.<br /><br />Regarding the stars of the film, it's not surprising that the two lead actors do a terrific job, after all both are veterans of the film business, and their performances have never once disappointed me in any film. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were the absolute perfect choices to play these two characters; and through their growing friendship, respect for each other, and the realistic problems and challenges they must face, along with the cleverly written dialogue, we are effectively drawn into their lives, easily relating to and becoming emotionally invested in them. Actor Sean Hayes, best known for TV's "Will and Grace", is the witness to the inspiring adventure these newfound friends embark upon, and his own sarcasm fits in perfectly with Edward's sardonic nature and Carter's keen intellect and quick wit. Every member of the cast did an excellent job of gracefully moving back and forth between the serious nature of the disease plaguing the two leads' lives and the humorous moments spread throughout the film, never once failing to appropriately portray either side of the situation.<br /><br />"The Bucket List" is the perfect example of what has been dubbed a dramedy by many people; it's a mixture of a drama and comedy, never becoming solely one or the other. The cast is perfect, giving the characters a depth and realism that is needed for a film such as this; the script is well-written and crafted to perfectly balance the gravity of the situation with some light-hearted humor. Overall, this is just a really good movie that will undoubtedly hit closer to home for some more than others, but it still should be seen, as it is an inspiring example of not letting your life's circumstances, grave or otherwise, get the best of you.<br /><br />"The Bucket List" is rated PG-13 for language and sexuality and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>Enjoyable movie that reminds us that life is short and precious time can be wasted in the pursuit of empty goals and ambition.<br /><br />This movie reminded me not to take for granted:  my health, my family, my friends, my faith.<br /><br />It reminds you what is important in life and not to lose sight of it.

A serious and lighthearted film all rolled into one!  Yes, that's what it is.  A journey of discovery, and of coming to terms with death and the measure of one's life.<br /><br />And like life, we get both laughter and tears.<br /><br />Well done!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>In this movie, the characters played by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman could not be more different.  Jack is a white millionaire while Morgan is a black mechanic.  Jack has virtually no family whereas Morgan is surrounded with a loving wife and children.  Jack is reckless and daring while Morgan carefully considers his moves.  Jack is a man without faith whereas Morgan's life is centered on his faith.  They meet in a hospital room where they find out that their days are numbered.  Instead of staying around to die, they set off with their "Bucket List", which contains the things they want to do before they "kick the bucket".  In what is certainly the "fun" part of the movie, they circle the globe and participate in the activities that they've dreamed about all their lives.  There is humor, pathos, and a bit of philosophy thrown in.  Reality rears its ugly head, particularly during the first part of the movie, but these two great actors carry it all off with grace, humor, and aplomb.

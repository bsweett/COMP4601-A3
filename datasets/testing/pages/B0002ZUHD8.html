The movie attempts to take the legend out of the Arthur story and place in within a semi-historical context.  The story the movie tells takes place towards the end of the Roman Empire (in fact, just about 25 years prior to Rome's actual fall) and just prior to the beginning of the Dark Ages that will sweep over most of Europe. Artorious Castus (Clive Owen), otherwise known as Arthur, is the leader of a special group of knights taken from their homeland by Rome and sent to the Empire's farthest realm, Brittain to defend the border along Hadrian's Wall for 15 years.<br /><br />Arthur has become a living legend in Brittain over the past 15 years and tales of his deeds have been told to the Pope in Rome. Arthur espouses a spirit of democracy, giving all a chance to speak, making plans together sitting around a round table. His methods are unorthodox, but successful and his men will follow him anywhere.  Lancelot, Galahad, Tristan, Gawain, and Bors are all that remain of the many who first sat at the table 15 years before.<br /><br />On the eve that Arthur and his knights are to be discharged, the Bishop gives them one last assignment.  Rome is abandoning Brittain to the Saxons. However, the Pope's favorite "son" and assumed heir, Alecto, are in danger of being killed by the invading Saxons. Arthur and his men are ordered to rescue the boy and his family and deliver them safe through Hadrian's Wall. It's a dangerous journey. Not only are the Saxon's a problem, but so are the natives--people Arthur have been fighting and killing for the past 15 years. But the times are changing and the land and people yearn to be united and to be free.<br /><br />KING ARTHUR has several things going for it.  First there is the acting. Clive Owen gives a great performance as Arthur, presented the legendary hero in a way not seen on screen before. There are several other good secondary performances (including Ray Winstone as Bors), but Keira Knightley is particularly interesting to watch as the pagan princess Guinevere.  The battles in the movie are quite action packed and enjoyable to watch. There's also a lot of great scenery. Then there's the concept, placing the Arthur story in a real historical context is something that really hasn't been done before.<br /><br />However, with all that KING ARTHUR has going for it, it suffers terribly from the one thing that ruins otherwise great movies more than any other, a bad script. The mission Arthur and his knights go on isn't all that cheesy and seems realistic.  The great battle literally on ice is a wonderful idea that was used to it's potential. However, it's all ruined by cheesy dialogue and copy-catism.  The last 20 minutes of KING ARTHUR (not including the final wedding scene) is a cheap rip-off right out of BRAVEHEART. Almost everything from Arthur's speech, to a sword in the ground, to the swelling score, and certain battle formations are copies that look almost identical to scenes from BRAVEHEART. Except, in KING ARTHUR the scenes come off as being comical (instead of a teeming army of poor Scotsman, Arthur delivers a passionate speech about not taking away our freedom to 4 knights). So much effort, wasted on one major scene and a few bad lines of dialogue and instead of getting a moving masterpiece on the possible historical King Arthur, we're left with an average movie that gives us an aftertaste of having seen this before in a much better way.<br /><br />This special edition of the DVD includes several features including an alternate ending, several featurettes, the usual director commentary, a knight trivia game, photo galleries, and an X-Box game demo.  I liked the trivia thing the most.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>&quot;King Arthur&quot; wants to be all things to all people. Fortunately, the stylish direction, sharp performances and flavor of the time saves this film from falling into &quot;TV movie&quot; territory. In this retelling of the Arthur legend, we're given a more &quot;realistic&quot; take on Arthur. Based on evidence that Arthur may have been a Roman soldier serving in Britian, we meet a man who values honor, democracy and always remains true to his knights. <p>Arthur and his knights are indentured servants forced to serve in the military for Rome. They've done their time and expect the new Bishop to provide them with papers giving them their freedom. The Bishop has other plans, however, and asks Arthur and his knights to go on what amounts to a suicide mission. They're charged with saving a Roman family surrounded by invading Saxons. To do this Arthur must travel through hostile territory where native Brits led by Merlin ambush and attack the Romans with regularity. <p>Arthur agrees because of his duty to Rome but also so he can see Lancelot, Gwain and the rest of his surviving knights (there are only six now)return to the homes they gave up when forced to serve Rome. <p>Well directed by Antoine Fuque, &quot;King Arthur&quot; follows in the wake of John Boorman's early 80's retelling &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Beyond the basic characters, there's little in common between the two films. That's to the former films advantage. The splendid action sequences and beautiful cinematography as well as the strong performances save &quot;King Arthur&quot; from becoming &quot;Robin Hood Price of Thieves&quot;. &quot;King Arthur&quot; compares well with other films looking at the same themes although the characters are sketchy at best and we're never given any background on any character except for Arthur and Lancelot. The other knights kind of melt into the background because of this. <p>&quot;King Arthur&quot; provides an enjoyable evening of entertainment but it isn't without some severe flaws. Luckily, the talent of the director, cast and the production values overcome any shortcomings in the bold, imaginative but underwritten script.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Enjoyment of this film depends on expectations.  And so, if you don't care about historical reality or Academy Award winning performances, this latest version of the King Arthur myth is a great couple of hours of pure entertainment.  It's set in the year 405 and tells a rather modern version of a courageous and wise Roman King Arthur, who leads a band of brave knights into a variety of battles.<br /><br />In a short prelude to the main action, the audience learns that these knights have been forced into involuntary servitude as young boys because they come from a tribe of great fighters whose lives the Romans spared because of their bravery.  Their names are familiar - Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Tristan, etc. and they are bonded in the way that men at war bond.  These are the years, however, of the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, which has Arthur questioning his own loyalty.  After all, his own mother was a Britton, one of the conquered subjects of Rome.  And he's also the kind of king who believes in freedom and justice for all even though its centuries before these concepts became popular.  But no matter, as played by Clive Owen, he sure does look good in his armor, as do all the knights, who seem to be able to move around quite freely in their seemingly restrictive garments.<br /><br />Enter Guinevere played by Keira Knightly, an 18-year old beauty, who is so pretty that she steals every scene she's in.  But this Guinevere, however, is no damsel in distress.  After she is rescued from a torture chamber by the good Arthur, we soon learn that she is a woman to be reckoned with.  Not only does she stand the snow in a low cut gown and shoot arrows at the enemy, she also has another costume which looks like a leather bikini with just a narrow leather strap over her chest to bring out her cleavage.  This is appropriate since she is supposed to be from a matriarchal pagan tribe and for this scene she wears body paint.  In this outfit she carries a sword and fights one-on-one with the Saxon bad guys as their red blood splashes on her in strategic places.<br /><br />I thought the casting was wonderful.  The prelude of the young boys taken away to fight grow up to look pretty much what we would expect them to look like as adults. Lancelot is dark with curly hair for example.  One of the young boys is chubby and he grows up to be a knight called Bors, who is a big lovable giant of man played by Ray Winstone who is cast as the loving father of a dozen children and is seen sometimes holding a baby who looks exactly like him.  I liked the idea that there were no super stars in this production.  This allowed me to see the people as characters, rather than the latest box office draw.<br /><br />The battle scenes were great.  This was because it was possible to follow certain characters which fleshed out the storyline.  Later, the extras on the DVD explained the difficulty of training all the extras to ride horses, fence and generally look authentic.  The main characters' fights were great also, mostly because they really looked like they were fighting, including the exhaustion that must come after a day of heavy swordplay. I applaud the director for this as well as the film editor, because in a film like this there is a lot of footage to choose from and decisions have to be made as to what to leave in and what lands on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />This is not a film that will grip my emotions and put tears in my eyes.  But it certainly did engage my attention.  That's why I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"King Arthur" is the first film to attempt to place the legend of King Arthur in its proper historical timeframe. Although King Arthur's legend gained popularity in the late Middle Ages, it refers to the exploits of an unknown warrior-king in Britain of late antiquity. In "King Arthur", screenwriter David Franzoni makes Arthur out to be a Roman-Briton Commander of a group of Sarmatian knights who act as a sort of special forces unit to protect Roman interests in 5th century Britain. As the Roman Empire plans to pull out of Britain, leaving the native population and invading Saxons to fight it out, the visiting Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti) gives Arthur (Clive Owen) a final order. He and his 6 knights are to escort a Roman family to safety whose estate is in the path of the Saxon General Cerdic's (Stellan Skarsgard) ruthless advance. The Woads (normally called Picts), a Celtic people whose relentless attacks have Rome on the run, share Arthur's disdain for the Saxons. So politics makes strange bedfellows, then as it does now.<br /><br />Contrary to the film's hype, "King Arthur" isn't attempting to be historically accurate. Although it is generally accepted that the source of Arthurian legend was a king and/or military leader of late antiquity, the identity of this person is hotly disputed. To my knowledge, there are 3 major schools of thought on the subject and some minor ones. King Arthur is thought to have been either: Lucius Artorius Castus, a 2nd century Roman stationed at Hadrian's wall who commanded a group of Sarmatian cavalry, as King Arthur does in this movie. Or, Ambrosius Aurelianus, who led the pivotal defeat of the Saxons at Badon Hill circa 500 A.D., as Arthur does here. Or, Riothamus, a 5th century British king. King Arthur is an amalgamated legend, in the way that the legends of Robin Hood or Black Beard started with one person and were amended with the exploits of others as the centuries passed. The fact that Sarmatians were cavalry and their tradition of being buried with their swords at the head of the grave leads one to believe that these warriors were, indeed, the inspiration for much of the mythology surrounding knights of the realm. The legendary King Arthur won 12 battles, including the Battle of Badon Hill, as Ambrosius Aurelianus did. These 2 men, who lived 3 centuries apart, are both Arthur. But the story, itself, that is presented in "King Arthur" is fiction.<br /><br />As for the movie, "King Arthur" may be the murkiest film I have ever seen. Many scenes take place at night., but those in daylight aren't much brighter. I might have wondered how it is possible to make a snowscape dark, if I had not learned from the bonus features that it was done with CGI. It's unfortunate that so much detail is hidden in shadow, but it does create an oppressive effect. Britain looks very cold and very dark in every frame. The blue body dye that the Picts traditionally donned in battle is one of those little pieces of history that just begs to be filmed. But it would have had more visual impact had the lighting been more realistic. The Picts actually didn't wear clothes with their paint, and why they are called "Woads" in this film is a mystery to me.<br /><br />"King Arthur"'s performances are fine but unremarkable. The knights are probably the most interesting characters, but they are usually in the periphery. Acclaimed character actor Ray Winstone entertains with a nice over-the-top performance of Bors, the loudest knight. Some fine European actors were corralled for foreign roles, but they are given little to do. The fabulous Stellan Skarsgard is the Saxon General Cerdic. I've always thought that Skarsgard could make any character believable, and maybe he does as much with Cerdic's few lines as is possible. Somehow he gives the man weight by whispering all the time. But Cerdic still comes across as a one-dimensional villain -although a scary one.<br /><br />There is a lot of very modern talk of "freedom". As is common in period pieces, these are conspicuously contemporary characters in an ancient drama. So "King Arthur" is not intended to be a historical document. Its grittiness and modern ideals turn the shiny Arthurian legend on its end and attempt to create an interpretation of the myth that strikes a chord in the 21st century. I don't think it succeeds in that. The script just isn't very good, the characters poorly drawn, their actions incomprehensible, the situations implausible, and the whole thing is drab and overprocessed. But "King Arthur" is an  action film, even if it isn't anything more, and I enjoyed it at that level.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary, a roundtable discussion with cast and crew, an alternate ending, an optional trivia track while viewing the film, a photo gallery, and an audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua. In "Blood on the Land: Forging King Arthur" (18 minutes) the cast, principle crew, director Antoine Fuqua, and a historical consultant comment on the origins of the King Arthur legend, the film's characters, and the sets. "Cast & Filmmaker Roundtable" (16 minutes) is a discussion of Arthurian legend, the movie, and filming by screenwriter David Fanzoni, Keira Knightley, Clive Owen, director Antoine Fuqua, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), and Hugh Dancy (Galahad). The "Alternate Ending: Badon Hill" (4 minutes) puts a slightly different philosophical spin on the death of the knights in battle. It's too contrived, even for a fairy tale. Skip it. "Knight Vision" allows you to enable an optional track of subtitles that provide production and historical trivia during the movie. The "Producer's Photo Gallery" includes color and black-and-white stills. If you insert th DVD into your XBox, you can view a "King Arthur XBox Game Demo". In the audio commentary, director Antoine Fuqua talks about making the film and the meaning that the story of King Arthur holds for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>I walked into this film not knowing what to expect and I really was surprised how much I enjoyed it. I never  saw Clive Owen in anything before this and I must say he was great as Arthur. He has a strong screen presence that I was surprised by. Kiera Knightly is also really good as Guinevere. Kiera Knightly is gonna be a huge star. I think she was even better here than she was in Pirates of the Carribean. She's believable in tough women roles where she doesn't take crap from anyone. She's also very sensual and sexy, the camera loves her and she can act too. So yes she's going places. <p>  Sure there has been lots of King Arthur films but most of them focused on the same story. They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere. <p>  The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. The battles are fantastic too.  They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just gave us the same story we've seen many times before  but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warririor guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail. The movie is about love, characters with real emotions, friendship and freedom. It's not a great movie but it's a really good movie and deserved a lot more of an audience than was there when I saw it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen, 2004). Runtime: 142 minutes.<br /><br />"King Arthur" sheds the legend and theorizes the true story of the British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries, who led the defense of Britain against Germanic invaders (the Saxons) in the early 6th century as the Roman Empire was crumbling.<br /><br />This is Medieval-British Isle flick in the tradition of the three 1995 films "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX95">Braveheart</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/079283366X">Rob Roy</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141601">First Knight</a>," as well as 2006's totally underrated "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPFCPE">Tristan and Isolde (Widescreen Edition)</a>," which I feel is the best of the batch.<br /><br />"King Arthur" is my second favorite, followed by the underated "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00406UK7S">Centurion</a>" from 2010. "King Arthur" is visually gorgeous, shot mainly in Ireland, but also Wales and England. It has a good assortment of actors, including Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot, Keira Knightley as Guinevere, Ray Winstone as Bors, Stephen Dillane as Merlin and an outstanding performance by Stellan Skarsg?rd as the Saxon villain, Cerdic. Although I'm not a huge fan of Keira she certainly has a striking face, utilized to great effect in this film, and she looks awesome as a blue-painted Pictish warrior (i.e. a "Woad").<br /><br />The soundtrack is good and is sometimes reminiscent of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2WP7O">The Last of the Mohicans</a>" (1992), but blander and nowhere near as overpowering.<br /><br />The theme here, other than duty and war, is that of finding one's true home and calling. Many of us dream of "home" as some far-off place to find in the near or far future, but home may be closer than we think. We just need to be open and open our eyes. This reminds me of this story of a Texas minister who wanted to move to a place with small lakes & springs, etc. and the LORD told him it was ALREADY there on his property, he just had to use his imagination and create it. So he made some small lakes on his property with seven springs, as well as other modifications. Later, when his father was visiting, the subject of vacationing came up. His dad confessed that he enjoyed coming to his son's house rather than traveling elsewhere because it was so beautiful and peaceful that it felt like paradise. The minister learned a lesson: You might be sitting on your paradise (or "home") and just don't realize it. In short, quit looking for the greener grass somewhere else and simply open your eyes!<br /><br />FINAL WORD: I put off seeing "King Arthur" all these years for no particular reason and, after finally viewing it, I must say it's much different than what I expected. I expected another take on the legend like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800141601">First Knight</a>" or "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305558167">Excalibur</a>" (not that those two films are in any way interchangeable), but "King Arthur" is totally different. It's got a unique story, full of savage Medieval action, but it also possesses an undeniable air of beauty and reverence with quite a few epic/dramatic moments.<br /><br />GRADE: B+ or A-</p></br><a href="../users/A15YPJLKLZS0MK.html">A15YPJLKLZS0MK</a><br/><p>This retelling of the King Arthur mythos leaves little in the way of a plot, outside of several battle scenes. Excalibur is ten times better in the Arthur mythos than this wannabe iconic flick. Still for devotees of Arthur, it's not bad, just missing some (movie) magic. As a straight battle film, it's o.k.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Arthur and his knights of the round table, alive in Roman times? This puts the story into a whole new territory. The film follows the Arthurian legend we've all come to know in such films as Excalibur but without all the myth and magic. It recounts Arthur from youth to his rise as king. The destiny that surrounds Arthur becomes the very fabric of his legend. It takes a mythological figure and brings him to life as a real man. The movie itself is fantastic from the wonderful casting to the well written script. The action sequences draw you into the story instead of leaving you removed with shock and awe at the cgi! It is a wonderful film that will appeal to many and is worthy to be in anyone's collection.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: All the special features are carried over. This is the best the film has ever looked but it does not stand out. I was shocked considering Disney usually produces the finest products. Understand that the film's color tones are yellow and blue which is an obvious choice by the director. It clearly looks sharpened up on Blu-Ray but it isn't a demo disc. Nothing stands out. The audio is also lacking which leads me to an overall disappointment. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it get the blu-ray. If you love this movie as much as I, upgrade. If you are a casual fan, than don't. Ultimately, it is a must own film.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is pretty good. it has some very good battle scenes in it. this movie is about the story of the untold story of king Arturs life. if you watch the movie you'll understand on what i'm talking about. it's a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WP0GOTX13MG4.html">A2WP0GOTX13MG4</a><br/><p>The story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table has seen countless screen adaptations.  There have been some retellings closer to the legendary fable such as 'First Knight,' and then you get ingenious spoofs such as 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail.'  What they all have in common is that they pay tribute to the elments of the legend in some respect:  the sword Excalibur, the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere, the kingdom of Camelot, the Round Table, etc.  Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of countless movies and TV shows (such as 'Pirates of the Carribean') offers a new twist on the familiar tale.  Under the direction of Antoine Fuqua, 'King Arthur' attempts to tell a story of Arthur without all the mysticism and mythology.<br /><br />Without ruining the movie, here is some basic plot information:  Arthur is the son of a Roman that married a Briton.  He has been put in command of a group of Knights that are transplants from Samatra, a kingdom far to the East in Europe that was conqured by Rome.  The Samatran Knights serve Rome in exchange for one day gaining their freedom.  Just when it looks like they are about to gain their freedom, the Saxons invade Northern Britain, and the Bishop from Rome has one last job for the Knights.<br /><br />Some of the elements of the classic Arthurian tale do still exist in this movie, including Excalibur (but it has no mystical powers), the round table, and most of Arthur's legendary knights.  Merlin even makes an appearance, but he is much less of an ally to Arthur than you might expect.  Keira Knightly plays a Guinevere that although starts off as a damsel in distress, is hardly the typical fair maiden waiting for the heroic knight to rescue her.<br /><br />While the movie purports to tell a story of Arthur that is truer to fact, it can't be taken as entirely true.  First, Lancelot appears to have been an invention of the French courts once the story of Arthur had crossed the English channel.  Yet, he still appears in the movie as Arthur's right hand man.  Ioan Gruffudd does and admirable job playing the straight forward sidekick to Clive Owen's Arthur.  Second, while the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church did suffer from a fair amount of corruption, the level displayed by each in this movie seems to be way over the top.  Third, while I commend the creators of the movie for not just dressing up Arthur's Knights in suits of shining armor, and attempting to give them a more periodic look for the Fifth Century, some of their look was just a little too modern for my taste.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, the movie does have its strengths.  The movie appears to have been well researched (although not all the things that must have turned up in that research made it into the movie).  Arthur uses Roman battle techniques against the Romans, including the use of a great deal of smoke.  While this makes it hard for the enemy to see, it frequently made it difficult for the viewer to comprehend what was happening.  To counteract this, the costume department created uniforms for the various peoples in the movies that made it fairly easy to tell who was who.  The Romans were clearly Romans decked out in their traditional roman garb and battle standards.  The Saxons had a very definite nordic look to them.  The Celts/Picts show up in lots of leather and skins and frequently paint themselves blue and grey.  The special effects work that was done to get the look of Arthur's England (out of Ireland no less) was quite impressive as well.<br /><br />The DVD contains a fair amount of extras.  There is a 'making of' featurette that I found quite interesting.  It runs about 18 minutes, but I'd like to have seen more.  The making of the movie was at least as interesting as the movie.  There is a "round table" discussion between some of the cast, director, producer, and writer of the movie.  While it does shed some insight into the movie, it seemed to fall prey to the usual pitfalls of such features:  too much of a lovefest, too much congratulatory back slapping.  The DVD also contains a diretor's commentary, a X-Box Demo for the game based on the movie, and some other features.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie.  It was a bit long, and the spaces between battles tended to move too slowly.  While it may be more historically accurate than other Arthur movies, it simply isn't THE definitive tale because it just can't be.  The climatic battle scene starts off a bit confusingly and is often times difficult to tell what is happening.  All that being said, it was a refreshing look at the story.  I'd recommend it to anyone that likes Arthur, movies will large scale battles, and adventure movie fans.  I'd give the movie about 3.5 stars, but after viewing the DVD extras, I fell the DVD is worth about 4.5.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Historians and scholars will debate the King Arthur mystery for many more centuries. Are they accurate? Will there ever be a consensus? Probably not!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hollywood will produce each depiction for the public to dissect. The "King Arthur" (2004) DVD follows Artorius (Clive Owen) as half Briton half Roman. His knights are made up Sarmatain fighters. The Romans conquered the Sarmatain Empire, so as a condition of survival all of their male offspring must serve the Roman Empire for fifteen years.  Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd) is the most recognized name in King Arthur's court. But in this movie he is just part of the knight round table. Ray Winstone's character Bors steals the show from all the other knights.<br /><br />The knight's last mission before their tour of duty ends is to rescue a Roman family that is about to be invaded by the Saxons. Merlin's Briton fighters do not fight for the Roman Empire, but fight for native Britons. Merlin knows Artorius is half Briton, so he decides his fight is not with him but the Saxons. Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is saved by Artorius but fights for Merlin. The battle ending is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />I like this DVD for its action scenes and overall feel for time depiction. Ireland's location was perfect for filming the countryside shots. David Franzoni wrote the script. (See his comments on historical accuracy in the Spotlight review) It is nice to see some comments from the actual scriptwriter.<br /><br />The unrated Director's cut is for intense battle scenes. There are many graphic head and limb departures utilizing the almighty sword.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>King Arthur is a good summer flick. A different version of the King Arthur tale. Its full of adventure. The special effects and action scenes were well done. I would have prefered to see an actress other that Keira Knightley in the role though. I think the character called for someone stronger. But none the less it is still a fun summer movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGB4HN3QCGAL.html">A3DGB4HN3QCGAL</a><br/><p>I have no idea how historically accurate this movie is but it does have an interesting take on the old legends.<br /><br />The level of detail was interesting, the plot wasn't to bad either- just took upwards of half the movie to really get going.<br /><br />If the movie is historically accurate Arthur's knights were a people called Sarmatians but the look of their recruitment scenes (drafting?)and the use of the term "Rus", made me think of what is today Russia. That's quite a change from the usual idea of being from what is now Britain.<br /><br />I noticed several men wearing what I'd call a buzz haircut, kind of a long stubblecut- I don't think that can be accurate given the haircutting tools they'd have had.<br /><br />The story is interesting , Arthur & his men have fulfilled their enlistment agreement and on the day they were due to go free they get one last mission. They are sent north of Hadrians's Wall (that is an impressive set) to rescue a Roman family from the advancing enemy ( I think it was the Woads- Celtic Britons, not the Saxons who are also invading Britian). Arthur and his men aren't at all impressed with the family but they do their duty and bring them south, along with their worker's families and some captive Woads (Guinevere is one of these)which Arthur has freed.<br /><br />Back at the base Arthur decides to remain behind in Britain due to his disgust with what Rome has become (the depiction of the supposedly Christian Romans may offend some but the actions shown are similar to what some early types really did do). Having already defeated the advancing Saxons in one battle in the run to the south Arthur and the Woad people get ready for another battle, this time at Hadrian's Wall. Arthur's men return in time to help out, this is where the movie really gets going- something over an hour into running time. It's a big battle, look at the DVD extra stuff on it, and Arthur is of course victorious.<br /><br />I liked the look of the sets, and of most costuming, the battles looked very well done, I even liked the way many details of the Arthurian legend were worked into the plot ( just differently enough to be something believably and gradually changed over time).<br /><br />I found it hard to accept that Arthur and his men did not wear anything on their heads until the big battle, no matter how hard they fought or how cold it was. I also didn't like their camping out in some freezing woods without any real weather protection. The Woad women going into battle, no problem except for the tops they wore, I think those people would likely have gone into battle bare chested -men or women.<br /><br />I found it interesting that there was no swearing, surprisingly little blood or flying body parts ( was that to help the rating and film budget?).<br /><br />The movie is all right, just slow going, I may skip most of the first half the next time I watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I don't know what people who've given this movie 5 stars are thinking. Let me start by saying King Arthur isnt a bad movie but it's not exactly a 5 starrer. I didnt dislike the movie because I didnt expect anything from it. It's a movie I'd rent and watch on my couch once in a lifetime and then later someday watch it on HBO and forget about it. I really dont know what 5 starrers are about although I would like to know.Ive seen some better big budget axes and archery films of late than King Arthur.<br /><br />King Arthur has limited action potential thrill.Although it's better than "Van Helsing" it remains lacklusture in comparison to bigger projects.What I liked about the film is the absence of pretence which is quite evident by the absence of details to character chiasis.The direction isnt good and there were a few loopholes. I'm not the kind to take out mistakes. However, there are erratic tempo shifts in dialogue deliveries and accents. The accents sound a bit too forced.I must say I liked the jungle scenes (3 of them).<br /><br />PLEASE READ:<br /><br />This movie takes a big hit because I felt the supporting actor was far better drawn out and hero like than King Arthur himself.<br /><br />I'm talking about Sir Lancealot (the better actor too).<br /><br />Watch this movie on HBO,Rent it at the most. If you're buying this as a DVD then well either your very rich and a bit stupid like me or you liked this film.(5.5/10)</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>It seems that in recent time historians have decided to correct the tale of King Arthur and unfortunately turn it from a romantic, magical and heroic tale, into one of a 5th century soldier of Rome, serving Roman-Imperial England against the savage battle-driven Saxons with the aid of a warrior version of Guinevere. Although this version is supposedly more historically accurate of King Arthur and is backed up by archaeological proof, I personally prefer the glorified romantic version. That's not to say that this isn't a good movie, because it still is. It may have its faults, but it definitely has its good points as well.<br /><br />While many of the actors were believable in their roles, and while Clive Owen is a great actor, I didn't think that he had the screen presence to really make me believe that he could demand the loyalty and dedication of his followers that he supposedly did. I think he might be more suited to a non-leading role than the role of a `King' such as Arthur. Keira Knightly played Guinevere great considering the limitations of the script. My only gripe with her is actually unrelated to her acting, and once again script related. This version of Guinevere is a strong, battle-adept warrior of a woman initially fighting against the Romans, and yet she so easily succumbs to the charm of Arthur, someone wholly dedicated to what she hates with a passion. This weakness just wasn't in character even knowing that her cause took a back seat in light of the invading Saxons.<br /><br />Regardless of criticism of the film script, the detail to historical accuracy of the time and location with respect to the costumes and settings is extremely impressive. The surroundings and somber lighting really pull you into the Era and create a highly believable world. And although the battle scenes never really brought anything new to the table, the battle on the frozen river in the mountains gave of a realism that had me shivering with the chill of the surroundings and the anxiety of the battle. With the 13 minutes of additional battle footage in this `Director's Cut', the battle's include that little bit more action, blood and gore that add to the realism and have you cringing at the sight of torn flesh.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This is a very good swashbuckler, with a bit more reality than the typical Arthur. To tell the truth, I like seeing a bit less magic and a bit more that makes sense. For example, this movie retells the "sword in the stone." That retelling loses the hocus-pocus and prophecy, but gains a lot in personal, human meaning. The movie demotes Merlin from some mystical being to a pagan priest/leader. On the other hand, he is also promoted to powerful political figure, prepared to weigh the relative threats of different enemies and shift alliances as needed.<br /><br />The battle scenes show some real creativity. The fight on the iced lake, even when you know the outcome well in advance, still builds well. The excitement of the final battle was not just due to the sheer mass of its mayhem, it also had a tempo and some scripting to keep the viewer watching.<br /><br />Of course, Knightley's Guinevere kept people watching, too. The babe appeal was there, especially in that combat uniform. If you haven't seen it yet - well, there are some outfits that really require a figure as slim as hers. More than that, though, I enjoyed the role of Guinevere as battle-maid and woman who gets what she wants. Oh, and the "sword upheld" at the end was a nice touch, too.<br /><br />This movie offers a lot, just not the King Arthur of myth. If you want the chivalry, questing, and pining of the standard story, you just won't find what you want. This movie really has to be taken as a mideval action flick of its own, not a retelling of the familiar story. If you can take it in that spirit, there's a lot to enjoy.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Antoine Fuqua<br /><br />While the myth and legend of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table have been around in one form or another for centuries, there is little solid historical evidence that there was an actual King named Arthur or what his exploits may or may not have been, or even what century he may or may not have lived in.  The title cards at the start of the movie makes a new claim of accuracy with historical basis, but from watching documentaries on the History Channel before "King Arthur" was released theatrically, it seems that this movie offers one of many possible interpretations on the Arthur Legend.  No retelling of the legend is going to be completely accurate, assuming there was an Arthur, so take this movie with a grain of salt and as entertainment.<br /><br />Many of the other movies about Arthur deal with a magic sword being pulled out of a stone, and powerful magic being wielded by Merlin (John Boorman's "Exaclibur"), and there is even a musical "Camelot", not to mention the rather bad but strangely enjoyable "First Knight".  Forget every other Arthurian movie that you have seen thus far because "King Arthur" is nothing like those movies.  There is no magic, no knights bursting into song, and no Richard Gere.  This is a darker, more realistic movie from the director of "Training Day".<br /><br />"King Arthur" is set in the fifth century.  Rome is the de facto ruler of Britain, though via proxy.  Roman Knights hold sway in Britain, enforcing the law for Citizens and keeping the "barbarians" away.  In this movie, the Knights that are in Britain were originally from Sarmatia, a tribe far to the East.  These Sarmatians, having lost their battle against Rome have accepted as a term of their surrender that all of their male children will serve in the Roman Army.  These men are serving under Lucius Artorius Castus, or Arthur (Clive Owen).  Along with Arthur are the other "legendary" knights and Sarmatians Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), and Bors (Ray Winstone).  Together, with other unnamed knights, the Sarmatians protect their corner of Britain and their tour of duty will be over with the arrival of the Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti).  The Bishop has other ideas.  He will only release the knights after they fulfill one more task.  They must ride north, into territory occupied by the Woads (native Britons) where there is a Saxon Army on the brink of invasion, and rescue a young man whom the Pope in Rome is grooming as his successor.  Only then with Arthur and his men be free to return to Sarmatia.  They argue, the grumble, the get angry, and they submit.<br /><br />On the way they encounter Merlin (Stephen Dillane), no longer a sorcerer, but a leader of a tribe of Woads.  Upon rescuing the boy, Arthur also rescues a young woman named Guinevere (Keira Knightley).  Guinevere is not the refined princess who's beauty ruined Camelot, but a Woad prisoner who is starving and abused.  She is freed by Arthur, befriended even though she is a barbarian, and through their discussions Arthur begins to question his place as a Roman.  Arthur is part Briton, part Sarmatian, so his world is not the same as that of Bors or Lancelot.  Guinevere also is a warrior, able to shoot her bow with great skill and once, late in the movie, she charges into battle with sword drawn (her scenes with the swords are the least convincing when she tries to match power and strength with men.  Keira Knightley is a small woman).<br /><br />The battle scenes are done more in the style of "Braveheart", though with a surprisingly lack of blood and visible brutality.  Clive Owen's Arthur is a solid leader, though one lacking in charisma.  He seems the leader who has earned the trust of his men over a long period of time by being a strong warrior, brave, intelligent, and always faithful, but not with this force of his personality.  That is good for a leader, bad for a leading man.  Owen was fantastic in "Closer", but his powerful personality is pushed to the side here.  Everybody else in the movie is acceptable and believable in their roles, and Keira Knightley was just fine as a different sort of Guinevere right up until the part where she parried a sword swung by a much larger man.  She was best when using the bow and when using her agility in battle.  She lost me when she used strength to win in battle.<br /><br />This Director's Cut Edition restored scenes that needed to be cut from the theatrical release and reportedly adds a bit more brutality to the battles.  This was evident near the end, but not so much early on in the movie.  Not having seen the theatrical release, I am not able to comment on the differences between the two versions of "King Arthur".<br /><br />This isn't a bad movie.  It is "Braveheart" light with some of the actors from "Braveheart".  After "Training Day" I honestly expected something more from Antoine Fuqua, but it was nice that he did not provide a conventional Arthur movie.  If reports of his struggle with the studio to make "his" movie are to believed, "King Arthur" had the potential to be something better than it turned out to be, even with a Director's Cut.  While not a bad movie, "King Arthur" should not get a grade of much above a C+.  It is decent enough, but nothing special.<br /><br />-Joe Sherry</p></br><a href="../users/A2VE83MZF98ITY.html">A2VE83MZF98ITY</a><br/><p>I really wanted to love this film.  I have always been a fan of the Arthurian legends and stories; I've been a Clive Owen fan for years, and I've enjoyed many Jerry Bruckheimer films.  So what's not to love?<p>The film tries to be historical, but not really, sort of in the manner of 'Gladiator'.  But it isn't 'Gladiator'.  It tries to be 'Braveheart' in tone and message.  But it isn't 'Braveheart'.  It tries to be a triumphant tale of the king.  But it isn't 'The Return of the King'.  True, the viewer will see elements of each of these films in the plot, the characters, the cinematography, the choreography - but it falls short of each of these other films in significant ways.<p>One film this is deliberately not trying to be is 'Excalibur'. This is a demystified Arthur.  There is a Merlin, but his character is a Druid leader, devoid of any real supernatural powers; he is a shamanic figure, called a Dark Magician, but there's no magic here beyond the blue paint and mysteries-hiding-in-the-forest ways.  Arthur is a half-breed, Roman and British; this corresponds with what historians believe about early possible Arthurian figures - that he was a Romano-British leader at the time of the collapse of the Empire.  The knights in this tale are a complete invention - supposed conscripts from the Asian plains transplanted into Britain, they are under the leadership of Arthur along Hadrian's Wall (the northern border of England).  Fault number one occurs here - in a film trying hard to establish its this-really-happened credentials, Arthur should not be in the north.  Nor should the Saxons be invading in the north.  Nor should a principle Roman family be located on the undefended side of the wall.  Willing suspension of disbelief is one thing, but these are too many in a row.<p>I would give this picture three-and-one-half stars, but as whole numbers are required here, I will bump it up to a four-star-out-of-five picture on the whole.  The plot was plodding at times, but picks up near the end; too much reliance on battle scenes and not enough character development is done, particularly as the characters deviate from standard legends so much.  We care for Arthur, Guinevere and his knights, but somehow are left wondering why we do.  There's something missing here, and that's too bad.<p>The round table is effective but only vaguely explained.  The knights' relationship to each other and to Arthur is very clear from the outset, but apart from the most general of relationships with the legendary figures, they bear little resemblance in terms of actual deeds.  Arthur is an idealistic Roman Christian who becomes disillusioned by the failures of people far away - one should look up the historical figure of Pelagius prior to attending the film, as the early Christian heretical controversies play a rather unexpected role here.  The sword-in-the-stone legend is explained in a very innovative fashion.<p>The battle scenes are interesting if not entirely original.  The effects would be quite at home in films such as 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart', right down to the armour and the blue paint.  The sword play is very good in some parts, although 'Troy' had better choreography in this regard.  The one very effective battle scene was the battle on the ice lake, which is quite ingenious, if not entirely believable.  <p>One thing that is believable here are the character developments - not all the good guys live to see the end; not all the bad guys die or get their come-uppence, much like real life.  There is a happy ending of sorts, but of course history dictates that the Saxons would not in the end be held back; indeed, various invasions would continue until the time of the Normans.  Arthur's ideal in the film is one people united, ostensibly for liberty; of course, Arthur is declare king - at a time when constitutional monarchies did not exist, so much for the hope of liberty...<p>The juxtaposition of church and empire on the one side and the locals on the other is a bit of a problem - the Saxons are invading, so that is bad; the Romans and the church institution are foreign implants into the land also, and they are bad (neither live up to their ideals in practice).  The message here is a rather xenophobic one, not too thinly veiled.<p>Clive Owen puts in a very solid performance here, one of his best. Stellan Skarsg?rd as the Saxon king is a bit overdone, but appropriate to the character.  Guinevere, portrayed by Keira Knightley, is a unique character, a native (Woad) who becomes the conscience of Arthur.  The love interest/affair between Guinevere  and Lancelot (portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd) is given a new and interesting twist, taking place entirely before the marriage of Arthur and Guinevere, with Merlin as the officiant of the ceremony.  Merlin (Stephen Dillane) is a shadowy figure who fights the Romans until the Saxons become an even worse enemy - then, the enemy of my enemy...; Dillane carries this role out admirably, largely by his presence more than by performance.<p>The film was set on location in Ireland for the most part - undisturbed rolling hills are seen everywhere; primeval forests that make one think of Druid/Celtic/mystic influences. <p>One thing I did love was the sound - I think I was more aware of the sound in this film than any other for quite some time.  From the arrows flying through the air, the horses pounding the ground, the swords clanking and the ice cracking, the sound really stood out as full and crisp, moreso than in similar films.  The music by Hans Zimmer is appropriate, but also somewhat derivative of other films like 'Gladiator' - the songs by Moya Brennan are (not surprisingly) hauntingly Celtic in tone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Forget the Arthurian legends you have grown up with, just take them and put them aside, along with all your clean and proper kingly court ideas, and get ready for an epic medieval battle film that will leave you breathless from its stunningly flamboyant proportions.<br /><br />Following a myth of different origins, this tale of King Arthur tells of a Briton who serves the Roman Empire's army for 15 years, something that they were required to do while under Roman control for God and Country.  Arthur, or Artorius Castus, (played expertly by Clive Owen) and his six Knights have carved a name for themselves in the Roman armies, a legend of being an unbeaten force.<br /><br />At the end of their 15 years of service, they are summoned by Bishop Germanius (played by talented Ivano Marescotti) to receive their freedom from service.  But the Bishop tells them they are not to be freed until performing one last task for Rome, freeing a loyal Roman family from invasion by the Saxon's to the north, in particular, the son of the family, Alecto.<br /><br />Arthur and his six Knights, Gawain, Lancelot, Tristin, Galahad, Bors, and Dagonet set off for the north, grumbling at Rome's betrayal.  They must travel through the lands that the Woads occupy, strange barbaric foes led by a wise man named Merlin.  Once past the Woads, Arthur finds the Roman family taking the power of their God and Country and using it to create serfs and slaves, torturing those who they deem heretics.  One of the heretics Arthur frees from the prisons is Guinevere, a Woad.<br /><br />With the Roman family unwilling to go submissively with them, and Saxon drums beating on their heels, the seven Knights flee into the mountains in a desperate attempt to fulfill their last obligation to the empire and gain their freedom.<br /><br />Does this movie follow any Arthurian legend?  Not remotely.  Does this movie have any historical value?  None whatsoever.  Is this a good movie?  Yes, indeed!  Put down those history books and King Arthur fantasies and get ready for a stunningly filmed epic, a medieval battle movie far superior to any of the bad "Arthur" movies (except Excalibur).  This is a medieval fantasy, and a very grand one at that.  The photography is spectacular, the acting is superior to many of the "bigger names".  The dialogue is interesting, funny, and intriguing, capturing a closer bond to the feelings of the Knights of their time with the humped up society of today.<br /><br />These are not the shiny Knights of Boorman's `Excalibur', but a rough and dirty bunch, still keeping nobility about them and Honor above all else.  Special mention goes to Ray Winstone, who plays Bors, Joel Edgerton who plays Gawain, Ioan Gruffuddand who plays Lancelot, and Keira Knightly who plays Guinevere, along with Clive Owen, who I can see as the next Mel Gibson.  Owen fits the part to a Tee, and Knightly plays Guinevere the way she should have been played, both soft and tough.  Knightly was good in Pirates Of The Caribbean, but she is great as Guinevere.<br /><br />Still, the real attraction to this movie is the striking photography of the battles.  Take particular notice of the fight on the ice, the way the arrows fly through the air, and tip your hat to the costume designer for some spectacular outfits and gear that truly bring this epic to life.  This movie is pure eye candy for those who love a good medieval fight, tossed with realistic characters and a touch of romance.<br /><br />My only negative thought would be that it needed a little more blood, but since King Arthur was headed towards the PG-13 crowd like LOTR, some decapitation scenes didn't occur that I thought may have enhanced the battles.  All in all, a very lovely piece of tasty filmmaking that should not be ignored simply because it didn't follow someone else's rules.  Enjoy!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1RECBDKHVOJMW.html">A1RECBDKHVOJMW</a><br/><p>I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant "King Arthur" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved "Brave Heart," "Rob Roy" was a good movie too, as was "Gladiator." Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!<br /><br />Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.<br /><br />The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.<br /><br />Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.<br /><br />Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons. The rest is not history, nor even legend. Boo!<br />JANA</p></br><a href="../users/A18M68DE1Y6W51.html">A18M68DE1Y6W51</a><br/><p>Whatever this movie is about (and I'm not quite sure, it is very confusing), it is not about King Arthur. If you have even the remotest notion of what the Arthurian legends are about, please dismiss them before watching this movie, because you will otherwise spend the entire time saying things like "No WAY!" and "Wha?" and other rude things.<p>Let's get to the point: There is no Excalibur, no Morgan Le Fey, no Camelot. Arthur, who is broodingly played by Clive Owen, eminently forgettable in the role, has no visible means of income, but has a Round Table that could be the pride of any hip New York decorator. The Knights reminded me of nothing so much as Robin Hood's Merry Men, from their looks to their ribald jousting--I kept forgetting what movie I was watching.<p>And then there is Guinevere. I adore Keira Knightley, and she did look so pretty, and so very fierce--but excuse me: She fights in battle beside her man (a nod to modern-day political correctness, one assumes), even when no other woman fights. While her comrades in arms dress appropriately for battle in animal skins and armor and heavy protective garb, she fights in two strategically placed straps over her (ahem) chest. And while nobody else is painted blue, she has taken the time in the forest before this pivotal battle to paint blue and interesting symbols all over herself (drawing attention to key assets).<p>The leader of the Saxons looks exactly like Willie Nelson, complete with gray braided hair, and his son, who inexplicably has a brush cut (but did braid his beard), looks like Beckham.<p>OK, go see if it you must. The battle scenes, especially the one on the cracking ice, are great. The acting is strangely uninspired, to match the brooding monochromatic camerawork. Keira does her energetic and enthusiastic best as a warrior, and she is too likeable to diss, even in a movie this bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>The 2004 film "King Arthur" is not your standard retelling of the centuries-old tale about King Arthur and his knights of the round table.  For many years, archeologists and historians have attempted to explain the possible roots for the mythologies surrounding the fabled British king, and based upon the evidence and various theories that have been put forward, many believe that if King Arthur actually existed, it was at a time much earlier than most people tend to place the legend: at approximately the time when Rome still occupied ancient Britain (Gaul).  The producers and writers of the film "King Arthur" then constructed a fictional story about the legendary Arthur without the magic and grandeur of earlier films such as "Camelot" (1967) and "Excalibur" (1981), but with the realism of what may have occurred when Rome was preparing to abandon much of its empire.<br /><br />The film begins far to the east of Britain, in another part of the Roman Empire called Samatia. Here, Samatians, whom Romans had spared due to their fighting skills, were given an agreement by the Empire several generations earlier that a number of young Samatian boys would be taken by Rome, given military training, and serve the empire for the next 15 years as soldiers.  These Samatian knights, as they are referred to, would then be sent to a particular region of the empire to serve with the Roman army.  After their 15 years of service, they were then free to return to their Samatian homes. One of the groups of Samatian knights were sent to Britain to help defend Rome's occupation against the people's living north of Hadrian's Wall. Placed under the command of Artorious Castus, a.k.a. Arthur (Clive Owen), the Samatian knights include Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen); who are all anxious to obtain their freedom after having served the Roman Empire for a long 15 years.  Unfortunately, a bishop from Rome, Bishop Germanius (Ivano Marescotti), orders them to instead rescue a Roman family living north of Hadrian's Wall before giving them their papers indicating that their military service was fulfilled.  Begrudgingly, they set out north of Hadrian's Wall for the first time in their lives.  After a small skirmish with local British, they arrive at the Roman estate where its Roman leader has used torture as a means of converting the local British Pagans into believing in Christianity.  Arthur rescues the tortured captives that include Guinevere (Keira Knightley), then proceeds to insist on evacuating everyone from the estate because of the approaching Saxon army that leaves no person alive in its wake.  The Saxons are lead by the sociopath & despot Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) and his son Cynric (Til Schweiger).  The result is a film filled with several intense battle scenes that were no doubt inspired by such films as the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and "Gladiator" (2000), but without the ultra-shiny suits of armor and mysticism as in "Excalibur" and "Camelot".<br /><br />Because so many people are well familiar with the more popular & mystical stories about the legendary King Arthur, the far more realistic version of the story presented in the 2004 film "King Arthur" was not as well received by audiences as it could have been. However, by placing the possible historical Arthur within the context of the end of Rome's occupation of Britain, the film's writer (David Franzoni) and director (Antoine Fuqua) did a masterful job at attempting to create a plausible story from which the more popular legends could have developed.  Though parts of the story were a little rough at times, it was still entertaining and interesting.  Overall, I rate the 2004 "King Arthur" with 3.5 out of 5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed this retelling of the Arthur  legend in this very "Hollywood"  version.

I don't know if it is the "true" story, but it certainly tries to ground it to reality.<br />It gives Arthur a historical backdrop: when the Roman Empire was collapsing and its Legions were called back, leaving his most distant provinces undefended.<br />In this case Romanic Britain was left without protection from the invading Saxons and from the rebellious Woads.<br />With this structure the movie tell the story of Artorius Castus and his knights trapped in a difficult spot: their service time has ended and they long to return home, but they are forced to accomplish one last mission.<br />Arthur and his friends are depicted as real flesh and bone persons, not perfect heroes. Merlin appears as a Druid not as a wizard full of magic tricks. Guinevere is the daughter of the Woad's Chief. Saxons are starting the endless harassment of the British coast that will continue for more than 500 years.<br /><br />"King Arthur" is a classical action film without very deep or psychological plot. That is not a drawback, the spectator know this and expect only good actions scenes.<br />Well the movie is full of them and some as the battle over ice are great.<br />Actors' performance is correct.

I am positive the latter was not. One would be harder pressed to find a more ahistorical, awkward, forced and unintentionally funny historical romp anywhere. And the fact the film takes itself so seriously simply adds to the already bountiful mirth.<br /><br />As any kid who has answered a test question based on watching Mel Gibson's The Patriot has certainly learned, movies and historical accuracy are not friends. Not friends at all. Yet King Arthur wears its 'we are being historical here that is why everything is so muddy' heart on its sleeve.<br /><br />As if to multiply the historical missteps, the Arthurian legend is often awkwardly forced into the story line at strange places. As a result you have Osama bin Merlin head of what I'm guessing is the Picts. (They are called the Woats but of course there is no such thing. They do wear blue battle paint, which is historically accurate if you are doing a film about Scottish warriors. Scottish warriors attending a football match in the 1970's mind you.) Guinevere is now a leather bikini-wearing archer, and Arthur is a Roman commander fighting the Blue Meanies (after-mentioned Woats) of the north.<br /><br />The Saxons show up out of nowhere and try to kill everybody. So now in that timeworn movie clich&eacute; the two former enemies (Arthur of the Romans and Merlin of the Blue Meanies) have to combine forces to defeat the new evil Saxons.<br /><br />A lot of clich&eacute;s are evident in King Arthur. The worst is the screeching about freedom in what seems to be every fourth sentence of the screenplay. It's irritatingly repetitive, ridiculous (Arthur doesn't become President Arthur after all or as Monty Python put it "How did you become king anyway I didn't vote for you") and it leads to one of the unintentionally funniest scenes ever in a major motion picture release. (As King Arthur gives an almost word for word homage to Mel Gibson's stirring Braveheart battle speech the camera pans back and instead of revealing an army of thousands it has five lone guys. They might as well have been holding coconuts.)<br /><br />Yet despite all this and an ending that reminds one of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, I actually enjoyed myself. The battle scenes were pretty well done despite the PG-13, the acting is okay and Kiera Knightly did prance around in a leather bikini for most of the film.<br /><br />Like the movie Troy, the flaws of this film add a humorous dimension to the proceedings.<br />And don't forget we fight for FREEDOM from the unrepresentative Republic of which I am a commanding officer so we can create an absolute monarchy with a round table.<br /><br />I am telling you if this movie was called Bob the Roman guy it would have been a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>King Arthur is one of the films that surprised me. I love the story of Arthur and I'm just very happy that this didn't disappoint. It may be somewhat inaccurate historically,  but the film is still really fun and the acting is excellent. You wil cheer for the heroes as they fight the Saxons in this film. Nothing else can really be said that hasn't but this worth seeing</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>The King Arthur legend, burgeoning from Geoffrey of Monmouth's HISTORY OF THE KINGS OF BRITAIN (12th century) and Thomas Malory's LE MORT DE ARTHUR (15th century), has taken on a life of it own so embellished as to obscure the meager facts known about the 5th century Briton that made an enduring name for himself ostensibly battling the invasion of Germanic tribes. Historians don't even know what part of Britain Arthur hailed from, being variously assigned to Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland. And there's no contemporary historical evidence that he was a king at all. King Arthur has been, and will remain, a conveniently blank page on which Hollywood scriptwriters can pen just about any story they want so long as it includes lots of swordplay, male bonding between noble knights, and a Hot Babe (Guinevere).<br /><br />In this screen version, Clive Owen plays Arthur, a half-Roman, half-British cavalry commander stationed on Hadrian's Wall at the time the Big House back in Italy decides to abandon the province to the barbarians. The traditional knights of Arthur's Round Table - Lancelot, Bors, Gawain, et al - are Sarmatian warriors at the end of a 15-year conscription into the Roman occupation army. (Sarmatia was an ancient territory way over by the Caspian Sea.) Before gaining possession of their demob papers after years of fighting local Briton insurgents, the knights must accompany Arthur on one last mission, i.e., to rescue a patrician Roman family living north of the Wall whose villa is about to be overrun by an inconvenient horde of Saxon invaders.<br /><br />This KING ARTHUR is refreshing in that it abandons the silliness of the otherwise excellent EXCALIBUR (1981) which played along with the traditional misconceptions regarding elaborate castle architecture and personal fighting armor that actually didn't arrive in the British Isles for centuries. Here, Arthur isn't even a king, at least until the conclusion. And Guinevere (Keira Knightley) is a pagan Druid found chained-up by Arthur in the cellar torture chamber of the Roman aristocrat, a Christian, that Arthur is sent to rescue. The film's creators take this opportunity to take a swipe at the infant Roman (Catholic) Church by making Guinevere's jailers mad monks. Once released, Knightley's character is either muddy or daubed with Druidic war paint, and dressed in shoulder or midriff-baring costumes totally unsuitable for the cold, snowy weather. No frumpy animal skins for her!<br /><br />The generally cheesy dialogue and standard battle sequences make this a three-star film, but which I'm elevating to four in consideration of the costuming, however unrealistic, the gorgeous Irish exterior sets, and the occasionally engaging performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Ray Winstone as Lancelot and Bors respectively. Owen is suitably dark and rugged as the driven, charismatic Arthur. And he cuts a fine figure against the skyline mounted on his steed with breastplate, plumed helmet, and streaming cavalry standard. Keira's Guinevere isn't much more than eye candy, though she wields a mean bow and arrow.<br /><br />If I had to choose between KING ARTHUR and the previously mentioned EXCALIBUR, I'd have to go with the latter, a visually stunning piece of filmmaking up in the five-star category that features superb performances by Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicole Williamson as Merlin, and Helen Mirren as Morgana, plus a soundtrack to knock your socks off.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>How can people love Braveheart and then turn around and call this film tripe because it's not historically accurate?  Oh, please.  Braveheart was a great movie, I love it, but history it ain't!  Whether Arthur the King is or is not faithful to the legend - WHO CARES?  Was any version that has been done on the round table accurate?  I sincerely doubt it.  None come to my mind!  Most Arthurian Legends come from the faerytales of Camelot written in the Middle Ages, by an author who dressed the knights and ladies according to that period.<br /><br />So take a deep breath, sit back and watch the film without hanging onto the romantic images like Linus holds onto his blanket and really watch great storytelling - key words STORY TELLING - in action.  This movie is beautiful filmed, grimly realistic - as Hollywood generally can get.  The wide screen version of the directors cut is magnificent.<br /><br />I really don't see why you have to compare apples or oranges.  I happen to love them both.<br /><br />History it ain't - same as Braveheart, same as Excalibur, same as every Hollywood historical film ever lenses.  When so few historical films are done, its great to see one filmed with such passion, quality and eye for detail.<br /><br />If you want historical Arthur - go seek ye yond history book and MAYBE you will find a trace of him.  Other wise, don't whine this is not accurate.<br /><br />Just enjoy fine storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>King Arthur as Roman warlord?  It's possible, but as that plot device is handled in this movie, it doesn't necessarily make for the best story.  Gone are the courtly, courteous knights of Malory and Tennyson, replaced by a troop of surly, pagan horsemen with little to admire in them save their great fighting prowess and their unifying loyalty to Arthur.  Arthur himself is far and away the most charismatic figure, as it should be, and at least he is a Christian (though at times it seems he places as much faith in humanism as he does in God). Guinevere is introduced as a barbarian warrior-woman (and not a particularly likeable one either) and Merlin is reduced to a primitive shaman, but at least we still get Excalibur and the Round Table.  The chilly scenery and cinematography are breathtaking and the combat scenes are powerful, but this is not the legend's best version. Like MISTS OF AVALON and some other modern retellings, this movie succumbs to revisionist agendas that almost always fail (neo-paganism, feminism, etc) and while the result is by no means a failure, it is nonetheless highly disappointing.  Even the argument that this film's departures from legend are justified because this is *the way it really was* doesn't hold water because it's just not true.  For example, Lancelot is featured prominently in the movie (though there is no illicit romance between he and Guenevere) but Lancelot is one of the Arthurian characters who is not based on a real person--he is the fictional creation of French author Chretien de Troyes.  Be that as it may, the problem is not that changes in the legend are made (every storyteller will change the tale to reflect his own vision) but rather how those changes are handled.  Would it have been so hard to make the knights more likeable?  Or to portray Christians as something other than oppressive tyrants (except Arthur, who usually comes across very well)?  I don't think so.  In any event, the core of the legend remains more or less intact, and as an inspirational action movie about fighting for your freedom and never giving up on your ideals KING ARTHUR succeeds more often than it fails.  For Athurian fans I definitely think this film is worth seeing--just don't expect too much.  EXCALIBUR or CAMELOT this is not...</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>I had wanted to see this movie in the movie theater last summer, but never quite made it. Having watched the extended directors cut last night I am kicking myself for not making it to the local multiplex to catch this grand scale epic on the big screen.<br /><br />I really cannot understand all the negative press this movie has received. Historical evidence (as presented in a quite excellent History channel documentary recently) proves that King Arthur was most likely a Roman general who did band together with the native Britons in fighting off the invading Saxons.<br /><br />The traditional story that Hollywood has brainwashed the movie-going public into believing is total drivel. Arthur was not a figure of the middle ages, he was not an Anglo-Saxon and there was no magical sword in the stone. For years I have felt disdain for the manner in which the English have claimed King Arthur as their own - here at last is a movie that goes some way to setting the record straight. One really should not forget that the warriors from Brittany who sailed with Norman the Conqueror sang and celebrated King Arthur as their hero, someone who had fought to protect the Britons from the invading Saxon hordes.<br /><br />Another criticism leveled at this movie is the presentation of Guinevere as a warrior woman. However this is also historically accurate as explained by actress Keira Knightley in both the "Making of..." documentary  and the roundtable discussion (included as part of this impressive DVD set). Women often were quite capable warriors and it was not until about five centuries later that they faded into historical obscurity. Was it not after all a Briton warrior queen who caused Rome so much concern in the earlier centuries of the first millennium?<br /><br />What we have here is a thoroughly entertaining, informative and dramatic recounting of the inspiration for the Arthur legend. Arthur himself is a half Briton, half Roman who takes command of a group of Samatian (sp?) cavalrymen guarding Hadrians Wall (historical evidence also points to this being an accurate account). With news of an invasion to the north by the Saxons Arthur and his men are sent to retrieve a Roman family and transport them back to safety. What follows is an epic struggle to survive and a growing awareness by Arthur as to his Briton heritage.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie and I also think the DVD is exceptionally well done. The highlight of the special features in my opinion is the roundtable discussion which includes the major actors as well as the writer, director and producer. They discuss the historical accuracy of the movie as well as the challenges in bringing it to the screen. There is also a (rather fluffy) making of documentary, an audio commentary and a (rather lame) trivia track. Overall though this movie is an impressive achievement.<br /><br />NOTE TO MR. GEORGE: Most of the evidence quoted comes from the aforementioned History Channel documentary on King Arthur as well as material covered in the DVD for which this is a review.  I am also at a loss to understand where your assertion that I have a disdain for the English comes from - since I am part English myself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Yes, there have been lots of "King Arthur" films but most of them focused on the same story. They all had Guinevere fall for Lancelot and vice versa with both of them betraying their loyalty to Arthur. Here you get a fresher Arthur story that was never told before. Lancelot obviously loves Guinevere but she loves Arthur and not him. He knows this and he never gets too close to her. He mostly just steals looks at her. In this film you know Lancelot is too loyal to Arthur to go with his feelings for Guinevere.<br /><br />The actors and characters are strong and they help the film be more engaging. Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances. The battles are fantastic too. They're exiting and intense. The battle on ice is cool but in some ways the one in Merlin is better. The battle at the end is the most compelling and totally makes the movie though. The story itself could've used more work but still I admire the film-makers for trying to be original story wise. They could've just given us the same story we've seen many times before but they chose otherwise and it worked for me. It's not a fantasy and Merlin isn't this great magical wizard....he's this dirty wise warrior guy that lives in the forest lol. Plus Arthur never goes looking for the Holy Grail. The movie is about love, characters with real emotions, friendship and freedom. It's not a great movie<br /><br />In short, "King Arthur" is a much better film than it is being given credit for. Prepare to enjoy this film for what it is and you will be entertained. If you enjoy films like "Gladiator" and "Braveheart," then pick up this DVD! It's really good and it deserves to be seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>I have seen many movies about "Arthur." This one, though not near so magical, depicts him, Lancelot, and Guinevere in a much better light. Instead of all the adultry and death, we are left a triumphant ending, and a noble death for Lancelot. I think the unrated version is probably the one to see, for the extended battles and longer scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>What would the summer season be without another action-packed adventure flick from Jerry Bruckheimer? Since Top Gun officially deemed him one of the leading producers in the summer of 1986 (though, to his credit, it was Beverly Hills Cop that really kicked his career into high gear), he has revved up the careers of such current super-stars as Tom Cruise (Top Gun and Days of Thunder), Will Smith (Bad Boys and Enemy of the State), Nicholas Cage (The Rock, Con-Air, and Gone in 60 Seconds), and Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) as well as director Michael Bay, with whom he has worked with on five feature films over the years. And don?t think that time has had effect on his ability to keep turning out hits, not only in the theaters but television as well, or his ability to make stars of his films into leading actors and actresses. He hopes to add Clive Owen onto his already extensive list of accomplishments in Hollywood with the historical take on the Arthurian legend.<br /><br />The story for this telling of the adventures of King Arthur takes away the mythological aspect and place emphasis more on the historical roots that led to the creation of the legend centuries later. Arthur is the leader of a group of loyal knights in the service of the Roman Empire and one who only wishes to finally fulfill his obligation to the Empire and return to the city of Rome to live out the rest of his life in peace. But times have changed; the once great empire that was Rome has become dangerously corrupt and now faces the threat from Barbarian tribes like the Saxons who kill anything and anyone in their way. Those Saxon tribes now have their eyes set on Britannia and Arthur, along with his knights, are sent on one last mission for Rome, which is to bring the favorite godson of the Pope of the Catholic Church to safety. But while accomplishing his final task for the Romans, the realization that the once great center of civilization is gone sets in and Arthur comes to decision that he must take up arms with his former enemies in order to unite the people of Britannia and repel the Saxon force that has invaded their homeland. The story for King Arthur seems rather lifeless and bland when one compares it to the legend on which it is based but taking it for what it is, a historically tweaked version of the story, it is at least a noble effort, if not one that comes off more mediocre then the filmmakers would want. The problem is that Hollywood is devoting too much time and effort into grand historical epics, referring to the lack-luster Troy earlier this year, when they should be putting more thought into bringing the legends to life, not through historical context but through the full-realization of the myths themselves and what they stood for those who heard them.<br /><br />The feature?s lack of star power is not its primary draw-backs, in fact it?s one of the its better assets, but rather the blame can be transfixed on the script?s undeveloped and, at times, meaningless characters. Clive Owen takes his first leap onto the main stage as the historical equivalent to the legendary King Arthur, known as Arturius, and produces one of the film?s best performances. Despite an exhilarating performance given by Owen, the audience is often left confused as to the just end Arthur is seeking. At one point, he fights for the Romans, but with the empire crumbling and the realization that his utopia doesn?t exist, he shifts course ? if only the filmmakers informed us what that is. Obviously at the end, everything comes together and the goal Arthur was seeking becomes, but unfortunately it comes too late for us to put too much emotional investment in the film?s climatic battle sequence to care all that much. Keira Knightley?s role as Guinevere is another in which there is confusion placed on the movie-goers as to certain actions that are placed around her. For example, what is her exact relationship with the tribal leader Merlin? In one scene she leads Arthur into a clearing in which the tribal leaders comes out to speak to him about the invading Saxons ? Is she his daughter or just a loyal tribal follower? And what was the sole purpose of Ioan Gruffudd?s Lancelot? He?s suppose to be Arthur?s most devoted follower but often he comes off as whiny and too much of annoyance. And is the whole Lancelot glancing at Guinvere every now and again the best the filmmakers could do into incorporating the Guinvere and Lancelot adultery aspect of the myth into this story? It?s not romantic but rather creepy and flat.<br /><br />Overall, for those who had grown up reading about the legendary King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, the Jerry Bruckheimer spectacular may come as disappointment, not so much as to the point of echoing Warner Brothers? Troy, but rather for its less attractive approach to the legend. For the less informed individuals of this society not willing to venture to Spider-Man 2 for the twentieth time in a week, King Arthur at least offers itself as a reasonable, if not an inferior, alternative. When Jerry Bruckheimer originally envisioned the film, he had planned on a no-holds barred blood, sweat and tears aspect of the Arthurian legend but unfortunately producers must bend to the whims of their studio masters, in this case Disney (can someone just dump Eisner already?), and so the wonderfully choreographed battle sequences are toned down to the level of PG-13 audiences in order to reap in more box office coin. As one can probably guess, the film, namely its action sequences, suffer severely because of this ? perhaps if they had left out a ?love scene? between Guinvere and Arthur, which, considering their ages (Knightly ? 19, Owen ? 39), comes off as more disturbing then anything else, and the language had been toned down a bit, certain sequences could have been saved. Don?t get the idea that the film?s an utter mess; it?s actually quite decent if one understands the historical context in which the film is placed and isn?t expecting something on the level of Gladiator but more along the lines of the usual Bruckheimer diversion. It?s definitely a disappointment considering the amount of marketing blitz Arthur has been given and Bruckheimer?s 2003 summer hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, but if one goes in looking for a simple diversion for the summer, then you won?t come out demanding your money back at least.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Note to my "fans": this is my edited previously published review. It's just that it's so good I know you deserve to see it here:<br /><br />Lord, how I hate these THIS-IS-THE-GOL-DARNED-ABSOLUTE-TRUE-STORY type deals.<br /><br />This dreadful clunker directed by Antoine Fuqua, a Chicago native like me, prods itself along horribly. Beginning with narration by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot) telling us all about Rome's manifest destiny delusion, and how it wanted all of Britain to go along, we are treated to a dubious map of Europe, showing us Rome and the region of "Sarmatia". This is vital, because most of Arthur's "knights" are supposedly "Sarmatian" conscripts here. Of course there was at the time no such place, and few historians know anything about Sarmatians.<br /><br />After the introductory Roman army scenes, we go to a little community of huts somewhere in England. A boy named "Arturius" (Arthur, misnamed because the correct Latin is "Arcturus") is about to be conscripted. They take him, after he says his goodbyes to his mother and foster father, a priest named Pelagius (based on the real heretic Father Pelagius of Scotland, he of the Arian heresy). Though he's a child, Arthur is already strong, handsome and ready to go. Asking the Roman officer how long he will be gone, he is told, "Fifteen years." DUH!<br /><br />It is sometime around 452 A.D. We don't really know, because the date is flashed on the screen at a weird time. All grown up, with his "Sarmatian knights" hard alongside, Arthur (Clive Owen) and the knights are awaiting freedom from Roman army conscription. The goofy Bishop Germanius (deliciously over-acted by Ivano Marescotti, based on the real Bishop Septimus) arrives, in full Roman battle gear, ready to deliver the conscripts' freedom papers. The knights, like the bishop, are a sketch.<br /><br />The stalwart round table fellows consist of Lancelot ( Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelson), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson). For all the personality these fellows should have, the only interesting one is Tristan, only because he is wearing Mongolian armor and wields a samurai/scimitar like a... well, like a samurai.<br /><br />The king had a Japanese samurai on the Round Table?<br /><br />The knights are cornered by the bishop for one last assignment, handed down directly by the pope: go beyond Hadrian's Wall and fetch a wayward Roman family. We do not know who the Romans are or why they're up there in the North...but this Roman's handsome son is a "personal favorite" of the pope's. They have to get those Romans outta there before the evil, lip-smacking Saxons run over them and eat them alive.<br /><br />Bitching and grumbling, the knights obediently prepare for what they are sure will be their slaughter. They obey only because Arthur asks them. So the "quest" begins. Arthur and his semi-retarded knights are being followed by the creepy "Wodes", a fictional people who serve no purpose. Actually, the Wodes are a vehicle for Merlin: he is their leader. The Wodes have waged war for decades, and they seem to be a mish-mash of Picts and Celts, so no wonder.<br /><br />At the Roman's villa, Arthur rescues a Wode woman who turns out to be Guenevere. Aside from her vampiric gyrations, we are treated to some mysterious language that is supposed to be Old English. Everyone speaks with Eurotrash accents, but the "Wodes" speak a gobbledy-gook Saxon language requiring subtitles! At least the bishop sounds Italian, but then, Marescotti is Italian.<br /><br />Merlin appears, well past the halfway mark in this 140-minute borefest. This guy is a must-see: wild-eyed, scruffy-looking, like a cross between a Neanderthal homeless guy and refugee from "Clan of the Cave Bear". He begs Arthur to come back (later, of course) to lead the Wodes into a new British era. Nothing comes of any of this, and Merlin, who gets a few seconds' screen time altogether, plays no further part in the story.<br /><br />Another character speaks insanely about the coming of Excalibur to Britain. It's a tragic loss: we never are told what the hell "Excalibur" is! Arthur ends up with NADA. The goose egg, my friends, not even a decent Roman villa for his hassles. Much less does he wind up king of anything--except B-movie flops, perhaps.<br /><br />The film is ultimately hilarious, and not just because it has a few clever, snappy bits. The battle scenes are a joke, the story arc is a muddied mess, the acting is dreadful and the lines are silly. Somehow, it's all so bad that it really does seem "the true story".<br /><br />Trouble is, this director obviously flunked every class he ever took in his life. Including film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>This film is certainly a mixture. The acting is excellent but the script is stereotypical and overly dramatic. The art direction, costumes, scenery, and photography are top of the line but the plot is highly predicable and unbelievable. I found that Clive Owen and Ian Gruffudd did an excellent job of acting but the lines they had to say were so predictable and formulaic that I found myself feeling sorry for the actors having to make these overly emotive statements about abstractions that are barely relevant to the plot. I actually did not have as much of a problem with historical accuracy as many of the other reviewers since there was a period in which Christianized Romans gradually retreated from England, leaving the island to warring Angles, Saxons, Celts, and other native Brittan's. The concept that the Knights of the Round Table were Sarmatians integrated into the Roman army was also an interesting hypothesis. Most traditions have Lancelot as a native of Gaul or modern day France. The character of Guinevere seemed the most implausible. A Celtic woman warrior seemed to be the boldest interpretation so far of the character and position of Guinevere. The Knights of the Round Table, unfortunately, all got mixed together so that it was difficult to distinguish one from another. Merlin is a Celtic wise man and warrior in this interpretation rather than an established part of the court. In the end, I felt this film could have been much more if the screen writers had trusted the audience to comprehend a more sophisticated, realistic script. It was the script that pulled this whole film down despite the considerable talents that went into its making.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>I don't know why I'm reviewing this as there are already over 500 reviews here, but I've just finished watching this again (probably the 6 or 8th time) and I really like it. The director, Antoine Fuqua, has essentially remade his previous film Tears of the Sun and couched it within the Arthurian legend. Hear Clive Owen plays the Bruce Willis role.<br /><br />The Good Stuff: If there ever was a King Arthur this is more in line with what historians think they know about him. His half Roman, half British blood line. His being a commander in the Roman Army, etc.  You also have Hadrian's Wall, the Roman rule, The Sarmatian horsemen, the local tribes who paint themselves blue and a host of other things. This is also a very thrilling movie. There's bravery, valor, great battle scenes, all for one and one for all and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear. What else is there?!<br /><br />The Bad Stuff: Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky.<br /><br />But the movie is cool. They take some of what we've been told about the legend and use those same components in a more natural way. Excaliber and the drawing of it from the stone (here it's his father's grave) are less magical and more real. The magic here comes from the earth itself. The forests, mountains, rivers and forests are all shot to give the land a personality of its own. A mysticism of its own. And did I mention Keir Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear? What else is there?!<br /><br />Fuqua does a nice job directing here. He seems to have keyed in on the Ridley Scott school of film making as this movie has a very sweeping quality to it. It's a big movie with a great look, a good musical score and Keira Knightley in blue paint and leather battle gear.<br />If you've seen the waaayyyy silly Excaliber you should like this miles better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A good cast helps elevate this mostly forgettable story of King Arthur into a story worth watching--by no means a terribly good movie, it's at least an enjoyable one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I love this move; not 100% sure why. I liked the Roman spin on the Arthurian Legend. I also like Clive Owen as an actor (and Keira Knightley is, as always, a total fox). Ok, I admit, the movie is a bit contrived at points but I thought it worked pretty well. Arthur's nemesis in the film was a hoot too. (My favorite line: "Finally, a man worth killing.")<br /><br />KA is probably a 3-star movie, in all honesty, but I'm a sucker for these kinds of films.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>More fact than fiction this version follows recent discoveries of a leader of the Roman calvary that fought for the Britains. Even though it isn't fantasy it is not hard to see how Arthurian legend came about. This is not for the feint of heart since the battles are depicted like they were likely to have been fought, vicious and bloody. Good cast, directing, effects, and music make this at least worth a rental for most fans of war movies. The central story revolves around Arturius, half Roman and half Britain, and his knights that guarded the Hadrian Wall. The knights were actually Sumation decendants that were exceptional calvary warriors that were drafted by Rome to serve fifteen years. When the Saxon army invades they have a hard choice as to whether stay and fight or return to their homeland. Merlin is a Britain and the father of Guinevere a warrior in her own right. Merlin's magic is smoke and something equivalent to Greek fire. Not a family movie, but certainly engaging for those that like chivalry and long epic battles. It may seem a bit long to those that aren't into war movies. Fans of "Braveheart" or "Troy" will probably enjoy it. Good quaility DVD with decent replayability.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This film is digging up the myth used by Purcell for his own King Arthur semi-opera a few centuries ago. But he does not really improve the fable. He adds the Romans, the Roman Legion, Hadrian's Wall, and the "Roman" origin of Arthur and his knights. But it cannot reach the sublime music Purcell had wrapped the tale in. So the film can only concentrate on horror. The Roman horror of slavery and forced Christianization, under the menace of dying in some dungeon where you will be buried alive. The horror of the Saxons who do not colonize people but only conquer the land and empty it completely of their inhabitants. And even the horror of the native Britons who are pagan and fierce fighters. This reduces Merlin to some kind of spiritual if not only war leader. Arthur will decide to fight against the Saxons, hence to fight with the Britons and then to Christianize them by marrying the girl he had saved from the Roman dungeons. Of course this film has nothing to do with history and it has no real depth about the real conflict between liberty and the future, between freedom and peace, or should I say rather war? The film is then a long series of bloody battles shown in details, but that's a little bit short to make a good film that has otherwise no content.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The King Arthur Director's Cut is no better or worse than the theatrical, having the same strengths - some good character writing, action scenes where you can actually tell what is going on, an interesting background - and weaknesses - plot holes you could drive a Mack truck through, laughable historical errors, idiotic battle strategies and some hideously bad performances. The latter are definitely the biggest problem, with Antoine Fuqua proving more often than not truly hopeless at directing actors. Indeed, KA boasts some of, if not THE worst performances ever seen in a major studio picture. Clive Owen may look the part, but he delivers the lines like a dyslexic reading off idiot boards while fighting a hangover while Keira Knightley's Guinevere is just as pitiful: she's supposed to be a Celtic warrior queen but despite the fact that her people seem to speak Sioux for some reason she sounds like she's been to a rather expensive English finishing school where they teach you to mispronounce words like `cuhnntwee' (country) and `Roahm' (Rome). That wouldn't be so bad if she had even the remotest shred of talent, but none is to be found. Not since Helen of Troy have their been two leads so desperately in need of dubbing by more talented artists. Throw in Ken Stott doing an outta-ray-juss Ay-Taly-Eano accent, Ray Winstone overdosing on the bish-bash-bosh routine he does instead of acting these days and a couple of frighteningly inept child actors and it's a miracle that the film manages to be as much fun as it is. When the characters aren't trying to talk (something only Ioan Gufford seems to be able to do with success), the action is well handled (particularly the battle on the ice) and the film surprisingly good - but with better casting, it could have been so much more.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>This film tries so hard to bring a sort of historical "accuracy" to the legend of King Arthur that it loses much of the wonder, excitement, and romance of Arthurian Legend.  No, I was not expecting a Mists of Avalon fantasy, but I also was not expecting this violent tour of the Dark Ages.  Now, I've never seen the the PG-13 version so I don't know if the violence was toned down (I expect it would have had to been less to get a PG-13), but the violence in this film is a bit much at times and with the blue-painted Celts it was like a British version of Braveheart.  At one point there is even a big speech reminiscent of Mel Gibson's freedom speech in Braveheart.  If Clive Owen had uttered "For Freedom!" I would not have been surprised.  The major positive of this film are the actors. Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, and Keira Knightley are good considering the material they are forced to recite.  Ioan Gruffudd, in particular, was very good.  I look forward to seeing him in the Fantastic Four.  Overall, this film suffers from trying to remove the fantastical elements that have allowed the legend of King to endure for more than a 1,000 years.  Give me Excalibur, John Boorman's classic retelling, any day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ.html">A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ</a><br/><p>There are some directors who have made gritty, visceral films about modern times like Martin Scorsese who can also travel to the past and produce something noteworthy. But then there are some like "King Arthur" helmer Antoine Fuqua who should stick to their turf. His "realistic" re-telling of the King Arthur myth is a jumbled, dragging mess that features some stunning cinematography and atmospheric music but never feels focused or intense. If we are to believe this movie, then Arthur and his knights emerged from Samaria during the Roman era and served the empire as a sort of ancient wild bunch. The screenplay by David Franzoni (one of the writers on the superior "Gladiator") tries to give us a myth, human story, history lesson and action adventure all rolled into one. Which isn't bad, it's the way the movie is executed that sucks. Fuqua made his name with gritty crime pictures like "The Replacement Killers" and the superb "Training Day" which showed great promise. Here Fuqua suffers from bad scripting and lack of passion. The movie has some wonderful images and rich photography, the use of mountains, green fields and snow creates mood and sometimes you're tempted to forgive the movie because it LOOKS so good. But eventually it feels too long and empty because the characters are not fleshed-out, the story is simplistic as well as the dialogue (which makes "Alexander" sound like a classic work of theater) and the story doesn't have a lot of meat. We like what we are seeing in terms of visuals and colors, but we don't care much for anything that's actually happening with these people. Hans Zimmer should be commended for doing a good job with the movie's score with has a touch of ancient European lore in it's etheral vocals and moody strings. But even the music doesn't help a movie that just feels cold, you almost get the sense Fuqua wasn't having fun making this film. Indeed, the original theatrical version was a PG-13 cut that was reportedly argued by Fuqua who wanted an R version and here gets his wish with the DVD release of the "Director's Cut." Anyone expecting an improvement won't find it. The movie essentially feels the same, all that is added is more blood and a few more slices and kicks during action sequences which is meaningless because more blood and gore doesn't exactly advance what is a weak storyline. "King Arthur" chugs along trying to tell the "real story" behind a legend that feels more entertaining in movies like "Excalibur" and the masterful TV miniseries "Merlin." Fuqua is a gifted director who knows how to make movies, but this is not his best area of expertise and it's a shame his next movie, an epic crime drama titled "American Gangster" has been cancelled. Skip the original cut, skip the Director's Cut, even the most feverent fans of Dead Can Dance won't like this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>I expected more from "King Arthur."  I found the pacing s-l-o-w and the battle sequences non impressive.  The movie was over produced, and under cooked.  The story ventures from the familiar tale, having Merlin as some kind of evil General out to get Arthur.  Guennie kicks [...], but is still somewhat out of context.  I kept thinking there is something missing, perhaps a better movie lurks underneath.  A little long, but still it does have some moments.  It is beautifully filmed.  The locations are spectacular, and you get to know more about the other knights.  Quite frankly they were more interesting than Arthur.  Takes itself way to serious and has no comic relief to ease the tension.  Maybe there will be a director's cut one day and I can see what was missing.  One good scene could elevate this film and make it clearer and easier to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>this film works well as long as Action is tops.I'd give this film a 3.5 to a 4 because of the intensity&force it starts&ends with. all the extra features make this film worth-while. you combine the Vision of Antoine Fuqua along with Jerry Bruckheimer's larger than Life vibe of film then you have a action packed film from start to finish.non-stop action&suspense from start to finish.I'm Hit&Miss with the acting,but the pacing&the action make this film for me.dug the Commentary&extra bonus features.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.  Though I always thought of King Arthur as belonging to a later period, this movie does a decent job of capturing a much earlier period in history where Rome still ruled most of Europe.<br /><br />Arthur and his men had been promised to be allowed to retire from "military" life are called back for one more mission.  They need to rescue a nobel held captive.  Though none of them want to do it, the knights loyal to Arthur will do it just to stand by him one more time.<br /><br />The battle scenes are epic, reminicient of some of the battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The forest people are incredibly interesting and I wish the movie could have expanded on them more.<br /><br />Though this movie may not be suited for a "sequel," a prequel would definately be great.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>This movie was yet another retelling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  It had an unusual angle to the familiar story, and a lot of potential that I believe it just didn't live up to.  But wait, isn't this a kind of foolproof, proven winner?  Well...<p>What I liked:<br />it was a grittier, more historically plausible interpretation of the King Arthur legend than anything filmed before.  The chaos of the battle scenes was nicely done.  There was nothing mystical or magical mixed up in there.  The main characters were very flawed humans with their own stories:  Merlin was a prominent leader, perhaps a Druid, but not a wizard; Arthur was a conflicted half-British, half-Roman noble who learned egalitarian values and cared deeply for his pagan comrades; and all the knights of the Round Table were foreign men eager to leave the service of the Roman Empire once their 15 year tour of duty was up.  I was able to appreciate the care that went into researching the likely historical setup for the tale of these renowned "heroes".<p>What I disliked:<br />First, there were logistical flaws like wimpy people pulling bows that had 120 lb draw weights, weapons from inconsistent historical periods and countries, the overly done "tough Amazon warrior princess" typing done with Guinevere (it was laughably implausible).  That's enough to bother some people, but I can get over that sort of thing if the rest of a movie is pulled off well.  <p>Sadly, King Arthur wasn't pulled off that well overall, and I think it was a problem with the basic story being a bit underwhelming.  The biggest (meaning, what took up most of the screenplay) task that these men faced involved not the fate of the nation nor the defeat of great evil, but protecting a small village from a band of marauding Saxons.  I just had a hard time caring.  You know a film is in trouble when the director has to rely so heavily on the music to convince the audience that there's deep emotion to a scene.  Yes, that score was swelling heavily and often, but somehow, I just didn't connect on the visceral level with the dilemmas of Arthur and his knights, or the plight of the oppressed common folk that they were shepherding to Hadrian's Wall. The Arthur/Guinivere/Lancelot romance was halfhearted.  Even the "sad" parts involving deaths of good guys didn't grab me, and I normally choke up.  I kept wondering, what's missing -- why can't I lose myself in this story?  <p>So this is a valuable lesson to all future filmmakers that may wish to tackle this subject. Perhaps the Arthurian legend does need magic and mystery to carry it successfully on the big screen - after all, if you're going to take on a larger-than-life tradition, your scope had better be larger than life.  Otherwise, why bother?  You could any number of other documented military campaigns instead.  Too much petty realism combined with a too-small plot focus may have been the death of this King Arthur movie.<p>-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></br><a href="../users/A8G9GETA2OLMZ.html">A8G9GETA2OLMZ</a><br/><p>This movie has gorgeous scenery, terrific costumes, wonderful acting, but is bad.<br /><br />All because of a silly premise and ridiculous writing.<br /><br />The idea is that the REAL Arthur was half-Roman, half-English, and led a band of "Sarmatian" cavalry against various enemies of Rome in 452--in the farthest-flung, and failing, outpost of the Empire, Britain.<br /><br />So you get Roman soldiers, blue-painted Picts (or Druids), called "Woads," and yak-like Saxons, whose clothes are apparently made out of their hair, all fighting each other.<br /><br />There is incessant talk of "freedom."  This is never defined, but apparently it means taking orders from Arthur rather than Romans or Saxons.<br /><br />There is also much talk of "equality."  But this is a mere sop.  This is a frigid jungle, with law-of-the-jungle hierarchies.<br /><br />So the movie makes no sense.  It is beautiful to look at, between bash-them-to-bits Dark Age battles (of which there are many, many, many).  Lots of spurting blood, lopped-off arms, smashing, gouging, arrow-piercing, and so on.<br /><br />It has one memorable line (Kiera Knightley's before the battle on the ice).<br /><br />But mostly it is tedious and predictable and goes on for a very long time.</p></br><a href="../users/APZ9MBMUKD2W.html">APZ9MBMUKD2W</a><br/><p>I really doubt that the real Arthur will ever be found.

It also gives one a good hint at what the beginning of the Dark Ages of Britain might of looked like.<br /><br />A solid B+ film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>What's to like about this drab retelling of the Arthurian legend?  The filming is uninspired, owing a large debt to the techniques Ridley Scott used to much better dramatic effect in Gladiator.  The plot is as skimpy as the outfit Keira Knightley wears for the final showdown between Arthur's knights and the Saxons.  Knightley's eye candy Guenivere provides one of the few bright spots in a film that is otherwise difficult to watch.  Arthur and most of his knights seem grossly miscast, and Clive Owen simply cannot carry off the role as this larger than life hero.  Stellan Skarsgard pulls off a moderately good performance as the leader of the Saxons, but inexplicably speaks with a distinctly American accent.<br /><br />I rented the director's cut, which presumably represents the artist's vision of the final movie.  This film is exemplary of why studios often make dramatic changes to a director's work.  The film is grossly overlong, somehow deluding itself into believeing that a long run-time somehow equates to an epic film event--and the film's almost nonexistent plot seems only to serve as a device to get the combatants to their next battle sequence.<br /><br />Thoroughly uninspired, this film does little to expound upon the mystery of the Arthurian legend as its opening titles promise.  Instead, it winds up being a loosely confederated group of battle sequences, which, while occasionally eye-catching, are often gruesome and gratuitous, and usually fail to advance the story, which is what this film is most in need of.  All in all, a huge waste of time for a person who does not have time to waste.  Very disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>King Arthur opens with a statement that declares that this is based on the truth behind the legendary myths surrounding the tales of King Arthur and his knights.  This is a bold statement, in fact, it is bold enough to bring the tale to its ruin before the film has even begun, as most people consider it folklore and fairy tales.  It seems as if the purpose is to draw the audience's attention to the story with a false statement and declare it to be the truth in an attempt to falsely advertise.  Those who are educated in the matters know better, but those who do not might not.  The falsehood of the tale is upsetting, as it could very well one day serve a similar purpose for some who want to change the view of history.<br /><br />Antoine Fuqua's version takes place moments before the Romans withdrew their troops from Great Britain as the Saxon's were invading from the north, and the Britons where raiding convoys.  The Britons are led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), who is not a wizard, but a tattooed leader of the poor Britons that fights a war with Guerilla warfare.  When the Saxon's approach from the north, Merlin decides that joining forces with Arthur against the Saxons is the best solution, as Arthur (Clive Owen) and his knights are sent to rescue a couple of Roman's.<br /><br />Arthur arrives to the Roman camp and he discovers that the people have been unjustly treated and in anger he responds by freeing those who have been unjustly treated in the name of God.  It is, however, extremely strange that he has never seen any unjust treatment of people prior to his visit to the Roman camp.  Consequently, the escape away from the approaching Saxons begins, which is very similar to Fuqua's Tears of the Sun (2003) where a group of Navy Seals disobey order by helping local populations from genocide.  The story continues with brave warrior's fighting for just causes, as they fight for a higher cause -- freedom.<br /><br />The original tale of Sir Arthur and his knights brings the audience wisdom and valuable lessons, which would be seemingly fitting for the time when the story took place.  Nevertheless, King Arthur seems like a parody in the way the knights tackle political issues in a way only contemporary heroes do in films.  Despite the awkwardness in the film, King Arthur offers some valuable lessons in what could only be a self-righteous attempt in recreating a frequently told tale, which is displayed through the vibrant colors of Ireland and grand war scenes that only shadow Gibson's Braveheart (1995).  In the end, King Arthur offers an awkward cinematic experience with some lessons, but overall leaves the audience with a disappointing experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I am open to reinterpreting classic myths and legends in different settings.  For example, it their &quot;Elseworld&quot; stories DC comics has retold the familiar origins of Superman and Batman in different time periods: e.g., Superman arrives in the England of the Dark Ages or Batman in the London of Victorian England.  For that matter, &quot;Camelot 3000&quot; has Arthur and the knights of his roundtable reincarnated in the year 3000 in time to save England from an alien invasion.  So when &quot;King Arthur&quot; wants to locate the &quot;true story&quot; of Arthur in the last days of the Roman occupation of Brittania I find that to be an intriguing idea. <p>The Romans had always found this last outpost of the Empire a problematic area: Hadrian's Wall essentially separates the north (Scotland) from the south (England), trying to keep the Woads (Huh?  We would get the wrong idea if you called these people the Celts?) on the other side of the barrier.  Adding to the incentive to abandon the land is the arrival of the Saxons on the scene who are set on killing everyone and pillaging everything.  In such a land, a man who could become a rallying point against the onslaught of barbarism would be worth remembering.<p>In David Franzoni's script Arthur (Clive Owen) is the son of a Roman officer and a Briton woman.  Sent to Rome to be educated he returned as Arturius, commander of a garrison on Hadrian's well.  His knights, in a subplot that does come across as a bit forced, are from the land of Sarmatia, far to the west.  When their land was defeated the Romans spared their lives, but bound the knights and their male descendants to 15 years of military service.  Now that period is up and awaiting their honorable discharges (and safe passage throughout the empire) are the last six of the Sarmatia knights who ride with Arthur: Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), Gawain (Joel Edgerton), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone) and Dagonet (Ray Stevenson).  They just want to go home, but a bishop (Ivano Marescotti) shows up from Rome with one last mission.  <p>The knights go, but it is not for the bishop, because they are all pagans, or for Rome, because they care little for an empire that is abandoning the land their friends died defending, but for Arthur.  The only one who does not seem to know that he is a living legend is Arthur himself; or, if he knows, he neither cares nor believes in the stories.  But Merlin (Stephen Dillane), the holy man  of the Woads respects Arthur as the warrior who can lead men in battle, Cerdic (Stellan Skarsg?rd) the leader of the Saxons hears Arthur's name everywhere he goes and finds him the rare man worth killing, and young Guinevere (Keira Knightley) has been raised on fairy tales about Arthur and his knights.  This film is not about King Arthur as much as it is about how Arthur became king in this reimagining of the tale.<p>Given the context of this telling of the Arthur story it makes sense that the epic love triangle between Arthur, Guenivere and Lancelot is jettisoned.  In many ways that story, which remains the greatest love triangle since it is the husband's wife and best friend, has taken over the Arthurian legend.  Director Antoine Fuqua is really going back to the basics, although in a way that will make most Arthurian scholars cringe.  In this context I like not only turning Guenivere into a Celtic warrior but also that she advocates Arthur's destiny and is not merely a landed lady worthy of marriage.  Besides, there is the nice contrast between Knightley's stately beauty as she fires her arrows and her ferocity as she gets to race across a battle field and win a bunch of sword fights.  You get the feeling she was having the most fun of anyone in this film (I waited patiently for Ioan Gruffudd to do something really impressive with his two swords but they never really came up with anything).<p>What is interesting given the idea that the Knights of the Round Table were the personification of Christian warriors is how the Church is blamed in the film for the downfall of Rome.  Arthur is a true believer who has taken the teachings of Christianity to the level of the equality of all human beings, while the only other Christians we see in the film are engaging in torture and slavery.  Arthur embodies the best of both Roman and Christian virtues, which makes him a most unique individual, but this film really does some serious retroactive Church bashing.<p>Yes, there are some problematic elements in this film.  No Roman family, let along one with the Pope's favorite godson, is going to be living beyond Hadrian's Wall in Caledonia (Scotland), and I the ending of the sword fight between Arthur and Cerdic is so trite by this point in movie history it is rather insulting to the audience.  But on balance this is ambitious effort to tell the &quot;real&quot; story and there the situation is reasonably well thought out (plus working in bits from classic films like &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;).  Most importantly, the actors make it believable, even when they have to proclaim rather pretentious dialogue.  The climactic battle scene offers a nice blend of Roman technology and Celtic bravery (I thought the charge of the Woads was a nice representation of the speed of the Celtic attack since they do not bother with armor), and the result, while not a great film, is certainly interesting enough to warrant a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>KING ARTHUR Unrated Director's Cut (Touchstone) is better than the theatrical version.  When I saw "King Arthur" on the big screen, I was expecting a movie filled with myth, mystery, magic and mayhem.  In the director's cut, at least the mayhem has been considerably enhanced and it appears other moments and elements have been added that create a more satisfying movie experience.<br /><br />Publicity for "King Arthur" said it's the untold story of the real man who became the Arthur of legend. But in fact this is merely screenwriter David Franzoni's politically correct take on snippets of loosely interpreted fifth century history.<br /><br />Clive Owen is a forceful screen presence as Arturus and Stellen Skarsg?rd is very effective as his Saxon nemesis Cedric.  A game Keira Knightly goes ballistic as warrior Guinevere in her skimpy leather battle gear and face paint.<br /><br />But even with a terrific set piece battle on a frozen lake and the extended, bloody confrontation at Badon Hill, this film does not do justice to the extreme religious and political forces -- primitive Christianity, paganism, Roman occupation and of course Pict, Saxon and Celtic concerns and claims -- that warred for control and in some cases survival in fifth century Briton.<br /><br />The extras include an all too brief round table discussion with cast and crew.  It's interesting to see and hear producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Antoine Fuqua, stars Clive Owen and Keira Knightly share their insights and anecdotes about the film-making process and their characters.  There's an OK making-of featurette and better than average commentary by an articulate Fuqua.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z.html">A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z</a><br/><p>A rather mediocre attempt at bringing to light the mythological origins of King Arthur undermined by a pathetic script and horrible screenplay. In addition, the history portrayed in the film is tentative at best and most historians studying the Arthurian myth wouldn't be so hasty to draw the conclusions presented in the film.<br /><br />First, in terms of the film itself, it was rather mediocre. The plot is a standard Hollywood formula of that is completely predictable in the first 5 minutes of the film. The script was simply indicative reciting the obvious in addition to gratuitous jingoisms where the characters yell 'freedom!', 'liberty!', 'our rights!', etc. I didn't know Arthur was Thomas Jefferson. Although the film quality was very good, the editing wasn't that great and rather generic: overly long scenes showing the Saxons marching like Nazis (just to remind you that they're the bad guys) with their chief whose just a Hitler-like character who wants to exterminate everything (just to remind you he's the arch-villain.) The actors didn't seem very thrilled about their script and just recited what was given to them on paper without much enthusiasm. I give credit to the battle scenes though, they were rather good: especially the one on the frozen lake. One final weak point is that one can clearly see this film's cheap attempts at capitalizing on Riddley Scott's superior 'Gladiator' with similar editing for the battle scenes and almost identical music: hardly a mark of creativity on the part of those who worked on/marketed this film.<br /><br />As for the historical theories proposed in the film, don't be deceived by D.H. Franzoni's commentary about the research involved in this film as the theories he relies on have many flaws that simply don't add up. In terms of historical accuracy, the film is correct in showing that, as most historians now believe, Arthur was a Celt-Roman leader in Britain who lived during the collapse of the Western Roman Empire c.450-475 A.D. and, that he led a military/political movement to fight off the increasing migrations of Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, that were coming to Britain from modern-day Denmark and northern Germany. Contrary to D.H. Franzoni's claim, Lucius Artorius Castus is not a likely candidate as historical evidence places him under Marcus Aurelius/Commodus' reign c. 180 A.D.: 270 years before Arthur is commonly accepted as having existed. In addition to that improbability, the claim that the Holy Grail, The Lady of the Lake, etc. are undoubtedly the product of Sarmatian culture is false and a product of pure conjecture. The Holy Grail is a Christian symbol that had been around for 450 years in the Roman Empire and such symbols were introduced to Britain and Ireland by evangelists such as St. Patrick. Dragons, Merlin, The Lady of the Lake, and Excalibur, is stronger evidence of Celtic/Druidic rites than anything else; also, if members of Arthur's entourage were Sarmatian, why do they all have Celtic/Roman/Germanic names such as Artorius, Ulfius, Galahad, Tristan, Gawayne, Uther, Vortigen, Morgana, Mordred, etc., etc., etc. All of the characters in Arthurian myth have Celtic, Roman, or Germanic names: not Sarmatian ones. Legends of the Green Knight in Arthurian myth have little to do with Sarmatians and more to do with Celtic mythology. In addition, most of the battles, forts, and characters of Arthurian myths are recited as being in Wales and southern England which is where most of the myths come from, not Scotland where Hadrian's wall is located: presumably there's a reason for that. It is also important to note that most of the Celtic revival and geopolitical expansion at that time was focused in southern Britain and Brittany in northern France as evidenced by multiple Celtic settlements and forts: not Northern England as shown in the film.<br /><br />Again, this film is rather mediocre in terms of its screenplay and acting while its script is rather pathetic in terms of its generic dialogues. The film has some good battle scenes. This may be a good movie to rent but, in my opinion, it's not worth owning. The only good Arthurian film in my opinion is John Boorman's 'Excalibur' as it cleverly combines the Romantic tale with Celtic mythology to bring a strange image of surrealism that works quite well for this genre.  The films 'First Knight' and 'Merlin' are the epitome of bad film and you're better off with this film instead.  Finally, for a more cautious historical approach to the Arthurian myth I would recommend Geoffrey Ashe's book 'The Discovery of King Arthur' in addition to the writers recommeded by D.H. Franzoni to get a balanced view on the many theories as to who Arthur may have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>The sadly underrated "King Arthur" provides a rip-roaring and original take on the classic Medieval legend.  The film is set in the brutal world of the 5th Century AD, right at the moment when the crumbling Roman Empire is turning inward and withdrawing its forces from far-flung outposts such as Briton, where barbarians from the north, sensing Rome's weakness, are beginning to make incursions into the regions south of Hadrian`s Wall.  In this version, Arthur's famous Knights of the Round Table are a compendium of conscripted tribesmen who have faithfully and courageously served the cause of Rome for the past 15 years.  Now, just at the moment when they are about to be granted their hard-earned freedom and are eager to return home, they are sent on a final dangerous mission deep into Saxon territory to rescue a boy who may be a possible successor to the Pope in Rome.<br /><br />"King Arthur" focuses more on the geopolitical aspects of the tale than the customary romance and magic - although neither of those has been completely slighted in this telling.  The film opts for a darker, more realistic treatment of the story - there's no talk of Camelot here - one in which, Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere and the rest undergo internal conflicts and moral struggles often overlooked in earlier versions of the story.  Arthur, in particular, the product of a Roman father and a Saxon mother, is torn between his loyalty to Rome and to the island he calls home.  But, above all, he is faithful to the men who have served under his command and, with whom, he has been able to forge a chivalric code of ethics - one whose very cornerstone is individual rights and freedoms - that seems like an anachronism in a world dedicated to enslavement, brutality and destruction.  The violence in the film is grim, graphic and gory but appropriate to the times in which the movie is set.<br /><br />David Franzoni has written an intelligent, dramatic screenplay, and Antoine Fuqua has directed the movie with flair and style.  The action scenes are vivid and intense, and the film features the best ice floe battle sequence since "Alexander Nevsky."  The acting - by Clive Owen as Arthur, Keira Knightley as Guinevere and Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot - is no great shakes, but at least it's unobjectionable.<br /><br />For the most part, the movie's attempts at de-romanticizing the legend work well - although turning Guinevere into a halter top-wearing, bow-wielding combatant on the order of a Boudicca or even Xena-Princess Warrior, does seem a bit much.  However, since the film is less a retelling of the Arthurian legends and more a chronicle of the "real" people on whom the characters were allegedly based, such re-imaginings are more forgivable than they might otherwise have been.  And like most actions films these days that don't seem to know when to leave well enough alone, "King Arthur" is saddled with a saggy third act whose repetitive battle scenes drain some of the life out of the story.<br /><br />All in all, though, "King Arthur" emerges as a handsomely produced, thrilling tale of love, hope and freedom that should satisfy the schoolboy adventurer in all of us.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>A treat for people who love legends and other tales from the Middle Ages. Wonderful acting directing visuals and the story outline is wonderful. Very entertaining movie, a most see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I thoroughly enjoyed "King Arthur."  Sure, we can all haggle over history (or legend, as the case may be) but what this film boils down to is that it is an action yarn that's littered with historical and legendary tidbits about one of the greatest legends of our time, King Arthur.  Clive Owen takes up Excalibur as our hero this time, and he leads a group of Samatian knights against the Woads and then the Saxons to set his people free.  Galahad, Tristan, Gawain and others ride with Arthur and face death with not even the slightest bit of fear.  In this version, Guinevere and Lancelot only flirt for a minute, so don't expect the love triangle that was key to so many of the other versions of this great epic.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, including Ioann Gruffudd (Fantastic Four, Horatio Hornblower), Hugh Dancy (Ella Enchanted, Blood and Chocolate), Ray Stephenson (HBO's "Rome"), Ray Winstone (Cold Mountain, Beowulf), Stellan Skarsgard (Deep Blue Sea, Amistad, Pirates of the Caribbean), and Til Schweiger (SLC Punk!, Joe and Max).  Fans of Jerry Bruckheimer productions will notice plenty of the actors involved in this film.  The music, by Hans Zimmer, is some of his most epic yet.<br /><br />Director Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job of melding plot and action in this tale.  Writer David Franzoni litters the story with just enough legend to remind you that Arthur may or may not have been just that.  Some of the characters, especially knights such as Tristan, Dagonet and Bors, are given lighter treatment than you'd expect, but maybe that's why this tale is called "King Arthur" and not "Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table."<br /><br />The DVD is very nice.  It features two very informative mini-documentaries on the making of the film.  The first is "Blood On The Land" which gives you an inside look at the making of the film.  The other is "Round Table," which features a literal round table with some of the cast and key members of the production.  There's also the optional "Knight Vision," which offers all sorts of trivia about the actual time and place these events might have taken place in.<br /><br />Granted, historians and armchair historians will argue over this film's accuracy until the cows come home.  In the end, though, this film is nothing more than an epic along the lines of "Gladiator."  I highly recommend "King Arthur" as well as two other Arthurian films, those being "Excalibur" and the musical "Camelot."</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>The reason that I really liked this movie is the probability of it being very close to being portrayed correct. The director's cut of this movie is much better than the PG-13 version of it. It is much more explainitory and in depth story and the characters involved. This is probably my all time favorite story of King Arthur. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies about Camelot and King Arthur.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Pretty good movie, although thankful for the directors cut.  Excellent extras on the DVD including a cool Round Table discussion with the cast and director.</p></br><a href="../users/A7Y6AVS576M03.html">A7Y6AVS576M03</a><br/><p>Good effort? Not really. Different, I would say and that's about it. There a lot of bloody good killing going on if that's your taste. I found no real substance to the film. The plot was very thin. It was photographed well and there was one very good and innovative scene of a confrontation which takes place on a large frozen span of ice and snow. There are some good bits  strewn throughout but not enough to make this film anything more than just average.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>A very different portrayal of King Arthur, it aims to be the `true' historical portrayal. With all said and done it simply a different perspective, but fans of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table should be open to a different take on the story.<br /><br />There was some things I liked about this and some things that I did not. The original story of King Arthur was indeed set before the Saxon invaders from Germany and Denmark succeeded in conquering Great Britain, and the Celtic peoples inhabited the island. As such the knights in shining armor often portrayed in Arthuric legend came considerably later in history. So I liked the idea of the costumes and weapons being closer to the age under portrayal.<br />I am not sure that I liked the idea of the Knights being `Samartians', men imported by the Romans as mercenaries from somewhere around the Ukraine.  I don't believe there is any evidence for King Arthur and his men as being anything other than indigenous to Britain. I did however like the idea of Guinevere being a Pictish Princess - played by the dark and gorgeous Kiera Knightley. Though I thought it was silly not to have Merlin at Arthur's side as his trusted friend and advisor, and to rather have him as a sort of enemy of Arthur's.<br /><br />The setting where brilliantly done, it came together well, and the caste was good. I think that Clive Owen added some force to the role of Arthur, and Iiked the casting of his knights especially Ray Winston as the rough and ready Bors.<br />The movie is entertaining and thrilling and comes together well, even if I did not like all of the way the story was written.<br /><br />It was better than First Knight , in my opinion, but not as good as Excalibur or Merlin.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>This was a hard movie to rate. I was prepared to hate this movie after seeing the trailers last year because they looked horrid. But I didn't hate it. I have issues with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.<br /><br />My issues are that they use the character names from the Arthurian mythology but not the legend itself. If you don't like the legend, name your characters something else and don't use the name of King Arthur to sell your movie. Another issue is the movie is rife with inaccuracies from historical facts to weaponry and armor to battle tactics. Is it too much to ask that they get something right? The third issue is the atrocious dialog you come to expect from a Bruckheimer production.<br /><br />Once I was able to let these things go and relax, I enjoyed the movie. There are some good performances despite the silly things they have to say. There is a very good scene of a battle on a frozen lake where the ice is cracking and the Pictish warriors have a good look and feel to them. Don't think too much and don't expect to learn anything. Sit back, eat some popcorn and get lost in the 5th century.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Wow, instead of noble King Arthur wearing a crown sitting in a white castle amongst green fields, we have a roman general fighting braveheart like warriors in Britan.  Interesting eh?<br /><br />I never saw King Arthur in theaters, and I was not really interested in seeing it anyway.  When it came out on DVD I decided to take a look.<br /><br />Early on I was quite suprised with the movie.  It had an interesting start, and the early battles were interesting (if a bit long).  The scenery was gorgeous and the story was moving along quite well.  All seemed good and true, but after the halfway mark had passed, I actually began to loose interest in the movie.  Not even huge battles could really get my interest back.<br /><br />I think that the main problem with King Arthur is that it kind of goes on too long.  This being an unrated directors cut, there are apparently several minutes of battles and gore put back into the movie that were apparently cut out for the theatrical release.  To be honest, the new battle scenes dont really add much.  They also make the battle scenes go on and on to the point where a battle that should last at the most, five minnutes soon stretches out to ten minutes of non-stop chopping, hacking and slicing.  Well, it may not be ten minutes, but it felt that way.  When the final battle came on, it just kept going and going and going.  By the end of it I was actually bored!  I kept thinking, "Come on, get it over with."  Not a good sign.  At that point, I didint care about the heroes or if they would win or not.<br /><br />So in my opinion, the biggest problem with the movie is that the battle scenes need to be trimmed down.  From my experience in film classes, you need to keep a battle as short as possible instead of dragging it out.  It would also have helped to have some overhead shots showing all the soldiers fighting by the thousands.  Those would have really helped make the battles more interesting.<br /><br />Oh wait, theres the rest of the movie to review?  OK.  The scenery, props and costuming department really shine in this movie.  The scenery of Britan is absaloutly gorgeous, to the point where I'd like to take a vacation to visit some of the locales.  The costumes feel really authentic (well, except for the much talked about leather brassiere) and make the movie more believable.  I also must mention the great ice battle sequence, which was a refreshingly origianal take on "How can seven guys hold off seven hundred guys?".  The acting was on the whole, mediocre.  The only charachter I was really interested in was the main bad guy (who is never named in the movie), who spends most of his time killing people and frowning.<br /><br />Personaly, I found the idea for the film being set in roman times with Arthur as a Roman general to be fascinating.  We've all heard and read about how Arthur was the romantic gentlemen.  Here, he's a figher with morals and beliefs, and to enforce those beliefs, he often has to slice and dice.  I won't get into how historically accurate this setting is, but I find it quite refreshing.<br /><br />So in the end, this movie is simply OK.  It's not great, it's not awful, it's just a middle of the road, average movie that with some more improvments, could have been really good.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: A film that could have been a lot more interesting if the approach was better.  Here we have the true story of King Arthur who fought for Rome and Britian, a man who wanted nothing more than freedom for his men.  Sound familiar?  It should, because the whole freedom thing has been done too many times, but that's not what makes this potential epic a dud.  Also this claims to be thr true untold story of King Arthur, when in reality the historical accuracy is rather poor.  The movie doesn't go into detail about what the heck is going on during these such as Braveheart did. I found the acting and the set design to hurt this movie the most.  The battle scenes were incredible in my opinion, and I thought they were well done.  The ice scene is nice, and the ending battle through the smoke was incredible, but it was the acting and the sets that hurt the movie the most.  Clive Owen and Kiera Nightley did fine jobs, but the rest of the cast was horrible.  The acting was so stiff and wooden, it just felt too tense.  I found myself wanting the actors to stop trying to act and just let it flow, but that didn't happen.  Then comes the set design, everything looked so fake and that brought down the effect.  The armour looked like plastic, and some of the costumes looked like something out of a high school play.  Even the wall that was built to keep the woads and saxons out looked cheaply done.  The colors on some of the costumes were way too bright, and that was in contrast to the dreary, foggy, green landscape of the location.  By having these bright shiny knights riding through the foggy green fields it makes the costumes and landscape look fake.  Everything had the look of something brand new and not gritty, rusty, or blood soaked.  Otherwise this movie could have been amazing, but now it's just enjoyable.  If Hans Zimmer didn't compose the score I probably would have not found this movie so exciting, but his thrilling score is what makes it enjoyable.<br /><br />VIDEO: The unrated disc comes in a 2.35:1 widescreen transfer and it is decent.  The colors come out nicely even though that is the downside of the movie.  But the snow scenes are a visual feast for HDTV owners.<br /><br />AUDIO:  The Dolby 5.1 mix is clear and crisp but rather weak in my opinion.  Nothing exceptional except for the ice battle and the smoke battle at the end.<br /><br />PACKAGING / EXTRAS:  The single unrated disc comes in an armary case with snap latches on the side identical to many Universal releases (We get rid of WB snapper cases, now we get these, ugh).  The case also has a cardboard slipcase, which has no purpose whatsoever except to attract attention of the consumer as they wander through the DVD aisles of their local stores. This unrated edition has 13 minutes of added footage, which basically makes the battle scenes more violent. The extras are pretty basic.  You get a 17 minute making of featurette, and I was happy to see that they gave Hans Zimmer a little screen time in discussing the score, unlike in Tears of the Sun, where he got none.  Then there is a 15 minute discussion that includes Bruckheimer, Fuqua, Owen, Knightley, and some other actors.  I thought it was pretty good, but it also seemed like fluff.  There is an alternate ending that was cut due it not being recieved with open arms from test screenings.  For XBOX owners you have a playable demo of the King Arthur game, and to top it off there is a feature that pops up fun facts of the production as you watch the movie.  Pretty basic, but better than most discs.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I've been interested in the legend of King Arthur for a while, and although it doesn't quite come near my obsession with the Titanic, it still rouses my curiosity every so often. Hence the fact I've been dying to see this movie since it came out, but decided to wait for the director's cut DVD, so I could see the gorier version that wasn't shown in the cinemas. I got it for my Christmas, along with the book! Woohoo!<br /><br />I've seen a few of the Arthur movies made - Excalibur (which I barely made it through), Merlin (TV movie with Sam Niall), and Mists Of Avalon. The last two were excellent, and I must admit, I was hoping for something as magical as they were both. I was bitterly disappointed when this didn't come anywhere close to magical, and instead, seemed intent on ripping off both Braveheart & Lord Of The Rings (according to my Dad - I still have no desire to see these movies).<br /><br />The characters are indistinguishable from each other in this - if I didn't like a certain Welshman Ioan Gruffud (can't pronounce his name however), playing Lancelot, then I'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between him & Clive Owen, who played Arthur. The rest of the characters were barely given a proper introduction, and throughout most of the movie, I was lost as to why these people with long hair wanted Arthur's, and his men's, blood on their hands. Merlin barely made an appearance, he was referenced once, and that was it. Guinevere, played by a monotone and bored sounding Keira Knightley, didn't appear until halfway through the movie, and then barely appeared there after. Although they made sure they got shots of her in what can only be described, as a couple of bits of sticky tape for an outfit - at least she doesn't have enough to burst out of it. The `romance' between her & Lancelot was little more than a teaser, and not at all like the other movies, where she marries Arthur & then has an affair, or they have a threesome. And I did not think it was the done thing in those days for any physical contact outside of marriage. Slow down girl!<br /><br />Another thing I did NOT understand was the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer's name is splashed everywhere to do with this movie, which led me to think he actually directed it. But a guy called Antoine Fuqua, actually directed it. Bruckheimer just threw a pile of money at it, in order to get it made. I still don't see why his name is everything. Poor Fuqua isn't getting much recognition for his work. Michael Bay was originally supposed to direct, and with him, it was in development for five years. He left due to budget concerns. (I'll probably get an in-depth lecture about this entire paragraph on the ins & outs of directors, producers, and everyone inbetween that.)<br /><br />One section of the movie I did enjoy immensely was Arthur & his men pitted against the Saxons - at least I think that's who they were. They were about to fight on top of a frozen lake, which proceeded to crack beneath their combined weight, and the camera actually films beneath the ice - although it's probably very clever camera/computer trickery. This scene is quite close to being magical, but not enough.<br /><br />Most of the characters differ slightly to what I've seen them portrayed in other movies. Guinevere is normally a weak little girl, who'll kick off her knickers at any sign of a guy's attention, even if she bound in marriage to another guy, but in this, Keira Knightley played a snarling warrior, who's an expert archer. Clive Owen did not have the charisma to play Arthur, even though in other movies, he's basically a weakling, being pushed by the women around him or having to consult Merlin before he did anything. His eyes, although dark, were not in the least bit sexy, and were almost dead. And Lancelot seemed to be devoted to Arthur until the end - no running off with the girl there!<br /><br />Another quibble about the number of knights - didn't the legend state that there were twelve knights? There were only seven in this, and only four left by the end of the movie.<br /><br />At the start of this movie, it's described as being the `real' story of King Arthur, which was set many years before the fairytale/legend came about. Frankly, despite the fact I'll probably watch it again at some point, I'll be sticking to the fairytale/legend from now on. It's never a good thing when you see the `real' story, after you've been brought up on/told about the fairytale. Would you like to see the film version of Hansel & Gretel? They didn't get eaten up by a old woman/witch/hag in a house made of sweets - they ran off, got married & had babies together. Or Cinderella didn't marry the prince. Instead she became a businesswoman, and never let another man touch her again. (OK, I went a bit mad there - but I think I know what I'm talking about.)</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...Braveheart 5? Sorry, but this was the last epic about Knights for me - I loved Braveheart, but King Arthur in my opinion is a movie so slow, ungripping, and there are no surprises here - it's a miracle they didn't fall asleep making it. The acting was okay, but the camera-work and the filming of the story, well, this has been done too many times before now - it's all been seen before - and frankly after Braveheart I don't think King Arthur was worth making another movie for, sorry...</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>We as a culture tend to become so enamored with The Legend of King Arthur that we lose sight of one crucial word:  Legend.  First penned a thousand years after the real King Arthur supposedly lived, the legend--with its sweeping depictions of Camelot, wizards, the Lady of the Lake, a forbidden love--has transcended reality.  So, when a new interpretation of Arthur is presented that has none of the above, it's a bit jarring, and forces the viewer into somewhat of a discomfort zone.  Which, to me, is the beauty of Jerry Bruckheimer's new epic, KING ARTHUR, a handsome film that usurps the legend to tell the story of a man who was able to unite an island under siege.<p>The producers of this film make the case that the original Arthur was a Sarmatian warrior with an allegiance for Rome, a man by the name of Lucius Artorius Castus.  In the sixth century, as Rome was preparing to abandon the Isle of Briton and leave its native tribes defenseless against the invading Saxons, Artorius--also known as Arthur--is given one more task to perform before Rome will grant him and his knights freedom from military service:  rescue a Roman noble family trapped behind Saxon lines.  The quest is daunting--almost suicidal--yet the prospect of freedom is alluring to a group of seven knights weary of battle, even though they are uncertain what to do once freedom is obtained (go back to their ancestral homeland, or remain in Briton?).  The subsequent story is riveting, as Arthur and his dwindling band of knights forge an uneasy alliance with the native Woads (led by Merlin and Guinevere) to take on the ruthless and bloodthirsty Saxons.  <p>Clive Owen is believable and sincere in the title role; the supporting cast, including Ray Winstone, Stellan Skarsgard, and Ioan Gruffudd, gives stellar performances.  The four-star rating, unfortunately, has to do with the film's one glaring weakness:  the character Guinevere (Keira Knightly).  Depicting this character as a scantily-clad, green-painted, fierce Xena clone is absolutely laughable, and seriously undermined the credibility of the rest of the story.  Yet this irritant is easily forgiven, based on the overall scope and feel of this epic--an epic that explores the origins of a legend.<br />--D. Mikels</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing this highly anticipated summer action picture. To be quite honest, it was a huge letdown. It was still semi entertaining (hence the 3 stars), but it took itself way too seriously. Keira Knightly is as hot as ever and is the standout as the sexy yet tough Guinevere. Clive Owen was okay as King Arthur, but my biggest complaint is that annoying Lancelot and the absense of Merlin (save for a couple of short scenes). If you aren't going to have Merlin be a larger part of the film, don't have him in it at all. And please don't go in this film expecting the true history on Arthur, this film is just more theories strung together to make stupid audience members say "I didn't know that." Some of the action scenes were well done (Ice Battle), but I would wait to see this one on Dvd. Save your money and catch "The Village" and "Alien vs. Predator" which will both be out within the next month.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>This is a great movie.  Clive Owens does an excellend job playing King Arthur in this true-to-life (provide the legends are true) movie.  This is not the "Sword in the Stone" fairy tales we've heard and seen in the past and I greatly enjoy this tale.  Regardless of whether or not you believe any of this movie (I believe it) or not, you will be greatly entertained!</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Antoine Fuqua's King Arthur is an excellent example of what epic filmmaking should be.  The director is an underrated genius in his craft and I can't help but wonder if the troubles he faces from studios when it comes to presenting his vision stems not from actual feasability, but from the color of his skin.<br /><br />That an African-American could present such a bold and exciting account of the Arthurian legend, side stepping the Hollywood perpetuation of impossible myth and instead seeking a more historically believable telling of the tale must have stuck in many a studio executive's craw.<br /><br />The PG-13 theatrical release rating almost assuredly was an attempt to ruin Fuqua's box office credibility, when all it did was lend credence to the idea of disbanding the MPAA.<br /><br />Now by no means is this a perfect film, and the overused(although resounding) motif of freedom gets redundant and eventually, annoying.  However, much can be forgiven when each and every battle scene is more jaw dropping than the last.  If you're a fan of film violence presented in a realistic fashion, that's all the more reason to see this version of the film.<br /><br />This was one of the best films of 2004, too bad it never made it to theaters.  Also check out Tears of the Sun, which is another overlooked Fuqua film.<br /><br />P.S.  Keira Knightly can be my Smurfette anytime.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>SPOILERS BELOW!<br /><br />I've commented on this movie before: the cinematic PG-13 version. This is what I wrote in Auagust 2004:<br /><br />Saw it twice. Liked it even better the second time around. I know a lot of folks had their problems with it, especially those who wanted either a rehash of exisiting 'Arthur' tales, or alternatively expected a 'historically accurate' account.<br /><br />Get a life, people. It's a MOVIE. A STORY. And it's well-told, with the mystical mumbo-jumbo removed and the French soap opera elements rinsed away, so that just the names are recognizable. Despite that-and that's one of the things I really liked about it-the movie managed to retain the flair of (demythologized) 'legend'. It was an uabashed story about a hero, and there's nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Another nice tweak: Arthur making the transition from trying to serve a 'higher purpose' to humanization, when he realizes that the 'higher purpose' is probably well and truly corrupted, and that if any purpose in life is to be found it lies in the service of one's people. A good and noble soldier's creed. The stuff indeed, of heroic legend, well told, and with a kick-ass cast.<br /><br />---- Now, finally, I got the DVD, so here goes... ----<br /><br />There's been a lot of complaining about the de-mythologizing of the legend. Mostly that means the removal of the French soap-opera component and the pretense that anybody really believes in magical swords, witches and spirits living in lakes. Is that a loss? I suppose it depends on who's talking. A review in the Guardian (complete with the inevitable political anti-American end-commentary) moans that 'Britain's national myth has suffered its own catastrophe' and that KA is 'one of the worst historical, or history-esque, films ever made'. Complaints also abound about its historical inaccuracies, and Keira Knightley's battle dress continues to draw major vitriol. Well, if you look at the latest research by people like John Matthews and Linda Malcor you may find that the inaccuracies may not be and that Keira, like her male comrades, should have been fighting in the buff, their bodies painted head-to-toe. That would have been a sight, would it not?<br /><br />Of course, there's an argument for 'preserving' legends, and I think KA did that well. It just twisted it into a different direction. The DVD also contains an alternate, darker ending, without the PG-13 feel-good wedding. This had been Fuqua's choice, but apparently the money-men walked over him and Bruckheimer and what was intended to be an R-rated movie became a PG-13 nice-kiddy flick in the editing room: sanitized and dumbed down.<br /><br />Fuqua's commentary is very revealing and shows up not only his disenchantment with studio politics, but also reveals his personal philosophy, which I've always liked, ever since listening to him comment on Tears of the Sun. Above all, he makes the interesting observation (one I happen to completely agree with) that, in particular, the adultery soap-opera element in the traditional  versions of the legend actually makes no sense. It may be perfectly in line with what we expect from daily TV soap fare and Reality TV, but between comrades-in-arms there is a kind of ethics that folks living within the comfortable and boring confines of refined civilization may well find incomprehensible.<br /><br />To those who wish to advance the virtues of the 'noble' and 'clean' traditional versions: it occurs to me that the very _ignoble_ soap-operatic characters, whose 'courtly' nobility appears to be more one of declaration and general pomposity, can only cower in shame before the much less sophisticated but honest nobility of the Arthur and knights depicted in this movie. Surely, if we look for heros of the Campbellian kind, this is where we find them, not in the classical bedroom dramas centering around the betrayal of Arthur by Guinevere and Lancelo, or people's  obsession with that ultimate of social taboos, incest.<br /><br />Watching KA again after listening to Fuqua's commentary gives the movie additional depth and reveals dimensions one might easily have missed before. All in all a worthy and important addition to the cinema release version. So many things I initially missed suddenly became clear, such the obvious parallels to such classics as 'Seven Samurai' and 'Magnificent Seven', and the even closer kinship between this movie and 'Tears of the Sun', another classic Campbellian hero tale.<br /><br />Another nice touch (I keep discovering things about this movie!) was pointed out to me by a lady who truly loves horses. When the knights, together with the Roman garrison and a bunch of refugees, leave Hadrian's Wall and the Saxon drums of war start rolling, the horses bolt, prompting the knights to reflect on their decisions to leave. I thought it was a good scene, but it becomes even better when we remember that, as we're told early on in the movie, slain warriors return as horses. So it wasn't just that the knights had a sudden and not easily understood change of heart: it was their horses, the souls of the dead warriors, that reminded them who they were, and who refused to continue avoiding their destiny-albeit a destiny which, as Arthur reminded his knights later, they chose as free men, rather than indentured soldiers for the Romans.<br /><br />Till Noever<br />Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP<br />owlglass.com</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>I don't like to write reviews about the movie itself.

In this version, Arthur and his warriors are Eastern European contract horse soldiers serving in ancient Roman Britain.  As the story begins, the Romans are leaving on one tide,while the next brings invading Saxons.  Arthur and his men must also contend with the local Celtic tribe, led by Keira Knightly in an exotic female warrior outfit.<br /><br />Other reviewers have addressed the historical basis for this version of King Arthur.  For the general viewer, it may be enough that this is a good action movie, especially if you dump your preconceived notions about Camelot.<br /><br />As you might expect with any movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Antoine Fuqua, there are plenty of action sequences with strong, driving musical scoring.  Clive Owen is a brooding but noble Arthur; Ioan Giffud is a rather low-key but loyal Launcelot.  Arthur's fellow horse soldiers, his "knights of the round table", are miles and years from their Eastern European home; not many will make it back.  Skellan Skargard is a superly menancing Saxon warlord; his "at last, a man worth killing" is the takeaway line of the movie.<br /><br />Arthur and his horsemen, hard-pressed by the invading Saxons, will make a timely alliance with the Celts, setting up a climactic and suspenseful final battle scene.  Along the way, the movie makes a few bows toward the Arthurian traditions and gives Arthur time to make his own alliance with the lovely Knightley.  It's all in good fun, and highly recommended as an entertaining action movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I've been wanting to say this for a while now since this film got dogged big time when it came out.  It's hard to follow in the footsteps of a film like Gladiator and I think that it will be a problem for an epic like this to really hold it's own if you hold it in that light, but if you take it for what it is you will see that this film was a really great one at that.  The performances were strong and that action was spot on, the sequences were thrilling and brutal (especially in this version) but yet it still was flagged as a waste of time.  I thought it was great and think that it's a film most everyone should see...and while it may not be acurate, who are we to say...I mean it's not like anyone really knows for sure.  most people still feel that King Arthur was a myth, and the sword in the stone crap is deffinatly fake so don't dog this film just because it's not what you believe to be truth.  It's still one awsome movie and one cool ride.  Owen is good as Arthur but Knightly is the best one here, she has really proven herself as one kick @$$ actress...I'm rooting for her this year with 'Pride...' she could take home a Globe...</p></br><a href="../users/A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ.html">A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ</a><br/><p>I missed this film when it came to theaters, because it disappeared so quickly.  This was one of the summer releases in 2004 that I was most looking forward to see, because there hasn't been a major film that I'm aware of that covers the legend of King Arthur and his knights of the Roundtable.  When it was released on DVD, I took a gamble in buying it, since I'd never seen it previously.  I thought no one could mess up a film like this, but I was wrong.  This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced watching a film, and its not like I had huge expectations before I watched it.  I was looking forward to seeing a big screen treatment of King Arthur that was equal to if not better than the film version of "Robin Hood" (the Kevin Costner film that unfortunately doesn't hold up well with the passage of time).  Like another film reviewer said, this one is not "Gladiator" or even "Troy".  I would even say that this isn't even "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" or "A Knight's Tale".<br /><br />The main problem I have with this film is probably all of the battle scenes.  The filmmakers probably didn't count on the audience fatigue of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, in which the battle scenes were exceptionally well done in all three films.  After that trilogy, epic films centered on battle scenes aren't going to captivate audiences, so that's probably the biggest flaw this film made.  Had they focused more on the interpersonal drama and storytelling through dialogue and human interactions, it would have made a much better film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film lacks warmth of any kind.  The scenes are dark and dreary, which is perfect for mood setting, but a whole film like that?  There is little sense of humor or funny dialogue that lightens the film, instead we get a treatment of Arthur that is entirely too serious.  It moves along slowly, and the entire plot rests on three key battle scenes...one in the opening, one in the middle and the big finale.  I would have preferred to see more of the intellect of King Arthur, how he related to people and why he became a legend...something beyond his display of courage and strength on the battlefields.  There's more to King Arthur than violence and killing of enemies, but we just don't see it.<br /><br />The reason I give it two stars is because I like Clive Owen and the flaws of this film are in no way attributed to him.  He is a perfect King Arthur, in an imperfect movie.  The second star goes to one of the best scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  The middle battle scene that takes place on a frozen lake is clever, original, and exceptionally well done.  Its the only thing worth seeing in this film, unfortunately, but it is something to watch with marvel.  Too bad they didn't spend more time making the rest of the film worth watching.  I guess someone should send a memo to Hollywood:  epic films with little more than battle scenes are box office bombs.  If you don't believe me...look at the disappointing returns of "King Arthur" and "Alexander".  "Troy" is marginally better because the story worked.  However, after the brillant success of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, I'd say that people are just battle-worn-out.  Let the genre rest a few years.  When you've seen one battle scene, you pretty much seen them all, and there's no reason why any movie should base its whole plot on three key battle scenes.  That tells you right there there isn't a story worth telling, so they should go back to the drawing board until they get a story that's worth telling that doesn't rely so much on battles as it does on the wits and conversations that carry better films.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Coming off of last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean", Disney's hopes had to be high for Jerry Bruckheimer's supposed factual retelling of the Arthur legend in "King Arthur".  Instead, they get something that is hit and miss, no doubt in part to a studio mandated editing that turned a n R-rated violent and bloody movie into a PG-13 family affair.<p>Arthur (Owen), is presented as Arturius, a commander for the Roman empire.  On the brink of gaining freedom for himself and his knights, he rescues Guenivere (Knightley), turns on Rome, and alighns with the Guenivere's people, the Woads.  Eventually, this turn will lead to him becoming the ruler of all the Britons.<p>This movie is filled with action and fighting, but as I mentioned earlier, it has been toned down and sometimes feels choppy.  Clive Owen does not have enough screen presence or noteriety to carry the role of Arthur.  Kiera Knightley is most likely the only recognizable name in the cast to Americans, and she does not show up until almost halfway through the film.  She also seems to be a little too small to be wielding the swords that she does, especially against some very large men.  I like the idea of Guenivere being a warrior, but perhaps they should have chosen someone that fits the part.<p>Perhaps I nitpick too much, but this movie for the most part did little for me.  That fault does not lie on any one person's head, and perhaps I will have a different opinion when the R-rated version comes out on DVD, probably this fall.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SLA0SXRQV8M0.html">A2SLA0SXRQV8M0</a><br/><p>Let's begin by saying that as entertainment, this movie is passable (albeit, just barely). The scene of the battle in the ice is certainly one of the most exciting scenes shown in movies during that year. As for the actors, most of them lack charisma in their roles, except for Keira Knightley as an improbable celtic warrior. Clive Owen, specially, is totally devoid of charisma in the lead role (though he has proven he is a fine actor in other movies). OK, now let's turn to history. This movie was promoted when it was released as the true historical portrait of King Arthur (someone who, most likely, never existed), so it's fair to question this aspect of the movie. According to this film, Arthur was a Roman general who, by the time of the withdrawal of the Roman troops from the British Isles in the 5th century, decided to join the Celtic locals against the Germanic invaders and eventually become their king. Well, where one can start? With Arthur's warriors shown as improbable proto Russians? With its anachronic portrayal of the Catholic Church, already more powerful than the Roman empire and engaging in the inquisition (an invention from the late middle ages)?. With its laughable references to historical figures like Bishop Germanius and the heretic writer Pelagius? If you want to see an entertaining movie, you might enjoy this film, but if you have some interest in the history of the period, you are bound to came out very disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>You too can direct a big budget disaster based upon the myths. Of course, Antoine Fuqua, director of Training Day, seems eager to show that the idea that a person can direct only what they know is true- he's a black American homeboy, and his grasp of the legends is not even slender- is true. In truth, the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are for more entertaining and grand than the d&eacute;class&eacute; tripe of The Lord Of The Rings saga, but you would not know it in this version. Instead of romance, intrigue, honor, and magic we get `realism'- or so the director spouts over and again in his film commentary, and in the assorted extras on the DVD. But, please note the ` ' that I used around the word realism. That's because there's not a hint of it in this disaster. First off, the blood and guts fighting is laughably unreal. Ever since Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line in 1998, filmmakers have been trying to be `real' in their violence onscreen. This `realistic' movie, however, eschews that. Yet, the Knights curse and spit, especially a Cockney Sir Bors (Ray Winstone). They also are not British, nor even French. Instead, they are from Sarmatia- a region that never produced knights in the early 5th Century, when this film is set, nor were they ever at war with the Roman Empire, as claimed. In the tales, King Arthur and his Knights are devout Christians, and Rome is little seen. In the film, Arthur is a Roman Christian in service to the Pope, Lancelot is a heathen, and Merlin (Stephen Dillane) the head of a band of forest people called Wodes who, in this `realistic' film, never existed. In short, the film centers around Arthur's Knights' rescue of a would-be child church bishop north of Hadrian's Wall before the terrible Saxons sweep in from the North. Unfortunately, the Saxons never occupied northern Britain, they were defenders of the Isle from Scots, Picts, and Celts, and they were not marauding barbarians in the mold of the Vikings a half an eon later- all, again, in this `realistic' movie.<br />  Gwynevere (played by the lovelier than words Keira Knightley -or is it Natalie Portman with an accent?) is a wild warrior woman in the Xena mold- possibly a Wode, although this is never definitively made clear- which she and Fuqua claim is historically accurate, although it's not, but allows the brief notion that the glimpses of her taut, lithe, nacreous bod (and nacreous is a word destined to describe Ms. Knightley's skin) in skimpy leather, in winter- mind you, will soon give way to a great romantic love scene with Arthur (the petrified Clive Owen). But, alas, the one brief romantic scene is lame, Keira stays far too clothed, and Lancelot (Ioan Gruffydd) is a total pussy who seems utterly impotent in the face of Gwyn's charms.... Now, none of these failings would matter in the least were the tale a damned good one, but the only way this script could have been passable on celluloid were someone like a Roger Corman brought in to camp it up. But, humor and camp are totally absent in this hermetically dry waste of time. So, the claims of `realism' and historical accuracy' are the only thing this monstrosity had going for it- along with the anticipated delight of Keira Knightly in and out of leather, yet it fails miserably on both scores. And the editing is atrocious- with at least three major discontinuities in scenes where snow is seen on the ground, them mysteriously replaced by green grass a second later. Avoid this film, burn the DVD, and read Thomas Malory. To sum up- I still look forward to the day when I can ogle Ms. Knightley's taut form in the way it entered this world, but the hopes that this film would be entertaining or even passable, well- to quote Mistah Kurtz- `He dead!'</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>It's got action maestro Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) as a director, big budget action extrordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer as producer, and a different, but creative, take on the legendary King of Camelot.  Clive Owen stars as Arthur; a Roman soldier stuck defending England against the invading horde of Saxons.  Even though there are tons of historical inaccuracies, twitchy logic, and even some sloppy editing; this King Arthur still manages to be entertaining and packs in so much well choreographed action that you'll ignore most, if not all, of the bad points of the film.  Owen is good as the heroic Arthur, and Keira Knightley is just plain gorgeous as warrior babe Guinevere, who loves arrows and leather straps.  Ioan Gruffudd is here as well as Lancelot, along with Stellan Skarsg?rd, Ray Winstone, and Ray Stevenson from HBO's Rome.  All in all, King Arthur is an enjoyable, pretty much mindless, action film that delivers the goods it promises, and is better than what you may think.</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>I did not see "King Arthur" when it was in theaters but I wish that I had seen it on a big screen.  To be truthful, having seen the trailers I was not sure about the casting or that the story would be interesting.  I was wrong on both counts.  What appeals to me about this story of King Arthur is that it goes against the romanticized stories of the Knights of the Round Table and the search for the Holy Grail.  This is the historic Arthur or Lucius Artorius Castus.  What is known about this legendary hero is that he defeated the Saxons and established control over a large part of England.  The story presented in the film has Arthur and his Sarmatian cavalry (recruited from the modern day area of Hungary) in the days before the fall of Rome as the only effective force that maintains law and order in what was once a Roman province.<br /><br />There is a round table in this Arthur, signifying the equality of the knights, which dismays Bishop when he sees he will not be given preferential treatment.  Guinevere, however, is not simply the object of Arthur's (and Lancelot's) affection but is a tribal warrior maiden; and Merlin in a tribal leader who is opposed to Arthur and the dwindling authority of Rome.  Keira Knightly, playing Guinevere, has come in for a good deal of mirth for her portrayal of a warrior rather than the traditional role of Arthur's Queen.  However, now that archaeological evidence has proved that there really were Amazons and we know that women fought as gladiators and, recently, even serving with the legions in Britain, it should not be so shocking a leap to have Guinevere as a warrior.  Although Ms. Knightly has scenes where she is the only woman fighting with men, there are also scenes in the final battle where she is one of several women.  It may seem odd that her body is painted blue (not just face-paint) but it is certainly true that tribal people did paint themselves.<br /><br />Clive Owen does a magnificent job playing Arthur and is well supported by Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet).  I liked Keira Knightly and Stephen Dillane made Merlin an interesting opponent/ally.  My only complaint is that Hadrian's Wall looked a bit skimpy for it being the location of one of the forts.  There are massive doors but the fortifications are lacking.  The location (in Ireland) was well chosen and the costumes were designed with some accuracy in mind, although one of the Roman cavalry helmet reminded me more of Japanese samurai. King Arthur is a film that will hold your interest and, hopefully, make one think about the real Arthur.  The story is well-conceived and brought to life by great actors; it is a film that deserves far more attention.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>THE FILM:<br />"King Arthur" is a superbly-crafted historical epic. Mixing the Athurian legends with historical fact, the film, for the most part, succeeds at presenting a plausible "truth" behind the origins of King Arthur (mixing the acts of Ambrosius the Roman from the fifth century, the name of Artorius Castus and his Sarmatian Knights from the third century, and the battle of Badon Hill from the sixth century). The battle scenes are exciting, the acting top notch. Any fan of historical epics, and for those who want to see the possible origins of the Arthurian legend, then you won't want to miss "King Arthur!"<br />THE DVD'S:<br />"King Arthur" is available as either the theatrical version (fullframe format), and as the "Unrated Director's Cut" (2.35 Widescreen format). The extended version features some great new footage (A conversation between young Arthur and Palagius, a conversation between Lancelot and Guenivere) that should have been left in to begin with. It is also more graphic than the theatrical version, which makes the film feel more realistic.<br />Both DVD's come with some great extras, and are presented with fantastic picture and sound. Whether you are getting the theatrical version or the director's cut, prepare for a great movie experience! Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>I personally liked this movie and mainly due to Clive Owen who gives a strong performance and commands the screen with ease. This is a new modern take on the Camelot tale and I found it to be fresh and invigorating. There are some great action segments in this particulary a scene that takes place on the ice. I would reccomend this movie, give it a chance it may surprise you, it did me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Although I am no expert on King Arthur, all I have learned was from books such as the Cantebury Tales and such, I find it hard to believe the 'supposed facts' that this DVD is based on. First of all, King Arthur is apart of British history and we as American's should not be taking their legends, fables and myths as our own and distorting them so atrociously. The British don't take the Civil War or our great heros such as Washington as their own and make 'true' versions out of what happened.<br /><br />King Arthur, although having pretty cool landscapes is nothing more than a show of brutality and stupidity. The Roman's here are portrayed as being afraid of the Saxons when Rome at that time had one of the largest armies and was so bent on conquering the known world they didn't have time to be afraid. Face it, they wheren't even scared of Attila.<br /><br />While I tried to watch this movie with an open mind, there was just to much untrue representation going on that it was hard to truly enjoy it at its level. And whats up with Merlin? He's completely hard to believe as the infinitely filthy gang/rebel leader of some backwoods army. Would such a person ever recieve the name Merlin. Most likely not, its rather a noble name. Such as Guinevere (*sigh*) so much for daughter of a great king. Who did she belong to anyhow in the movie?<br /><br />On the whole, as one reviewer said, if they hadn't tried to use the names king Arthur, Guinevere, Merlin or Galahad it might have been more believable, and more enjoyable.<br /><br />How also did King Arthur get Excaliber? And if it wasn't such a magical sword given to him, then why was it so famous and named thus? Roman's didn't usually go around naming their swords for the heck of it. And what about the wall covering Britain from Italy? Who destroyed that so completely that it was never discovered until now? The Saxons? Angry at Arthur that they took it out on the wall? Please.<br /><br /> One the whole this movie tried to introduce a new idea, but falls completely flat. There are two many holes in this theory that just don't quite give it the necissary credience.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>And it should be on video pretty quick.  I know how historically inaccurate this attempt was, and if you have read any of the reviews here, so do you.  What makes this so mediocre is the fact that no one in the cast distinguishes themselves until well into the film.  I got Arthur and Lancelot confused the first few times I saw them.  Neither of the main actors for Arthur and Lancelot are household names.  Sometimes this tactic of using unknown actors works and feels fresh, like the young kids who were so great in That Thing You Do!, Tom Hanks' directorial debut.  Here, however, it would have been a good decision to have a bigger name than Keira Knightley as the main star.  The story is okay, but nothing you haven't seen before.  The battle scenes are well done, but pretty much all war movies these days have great effects.  This is the age of great computer effects.  So the war scenes won't blow anyone away.  In short, this is a moderately entertaining two hours plus that had it never been made, would never have been missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Ok so we have the stories of King Arhur and the knights of the round table, Excalibour, the Lady of the Lake, Sir Lancelot, Merlin, etc. all burned into our mind with fairy tales and very romatic stories of love, treason and so on. This movie takes it all on and presents us with a great adventure of King Arthur before he was the King.<br /><br />The movie presnets us with Arthur as being a general of the Roman army in Briton on the Northern borders battling with bands of local Briton tribes that wanted independence from the Romans, and battling agains the invading Normans (Vikings) who had aspirations of capturing the island for temselves by pushing out the Romans.<br /><br />Historicall it all makes sense of course and it seems like that has really bugged out a lot of critics..... yeah ... do not let reality or history spoil our childish vision of King Arthur ...<br /><br />OK the move is exciting .. has some of the greatest battle scenes almost reaching the excellence of the battle scene in Gladiator where the Romans vanquish the barbarian hordes .....<br /><br />Ok one thing bugged me is that there are a lot of dark scenes, foggy scenes but I guess for the sake of reality, I mean it was mostly set on the northern hills and mountain border of Britain, means that the viewers has to make one concession at least ...<br /><br />Wonderfully entertaining and informative movie ....</p></br><a href="../users/A1R9GZ8FC44MF5.html">A1R9GZ8FC44MF5</a><br/><p>Except for troy and passion of the christ, this is the best movie so far this year (yes it is better then spiderman 2, by a little).  The action is great except for the ice battle, which is definetly not the best part of the movie because its too short and all that happens is they shoot some arrows and then one of the knights runs out and breaks the ice and they fall in.  The last battle is very impressive though, much better, with great choreography.  The performances are good and deserve a few nominations, mainly clive owen.  The drama is affective but we could use a little more info on some of the characters, arthur mainly.  I would nominate the movie for best picture, but i think troy might win, unless alexander is good.  I give it a 9 out of a 10.

The dignified Arthur, played with understated grace by Clive Owen, is a part Roman; part Anglo knight, conflicted in his duty to Rome. He's an idealistic high commander in the Roman army, which is in the midst of abandoning Britannia as a protectorate. <p>Everything Arthur does is for the church and for Rome, although throughout the movie he's constantly questioning this motivation. His moral inclinations are to free his people from oppression. Arthur also wants to give his fellow knights - Sarmatian soldiers reluctantly bound to imperial service - freedom so that they can travel anywhere throughout the Roman Empire. In order to achieve this, Arthur and his knights are asked to go on one last mission into Saxon territory to rescue a rich Roman family living beyond Hadrian's Wall.  They must defend the family and their farm workers against invading hoards of barbarian Saxons from the north. <p>Along the way they realize that their religion isn't Rome's religion, and they save Guinevere, spunkily played by the beautiful Kira Knightley, from near starvation and death at the hands of the obnoxious Roman landowner. After Guinevere makes a remarkably quick recovery, she helps the knights make friends with her forest-dwelling and strangely blue-tinted clan of warriors led by a non-magic and rather dull Merlin, played by Stephen Dillane. His part is so reduced that if you blink, you'll miss him. <p>Bruckheimer has obviously maligned a legend. He does go for historical accuracy, by setting the story in the appropriate time period, but any similarity to the legend of King Arthur that we know and love finishes there. The romantic entanglement between Arthur and Guinevere is reduced to just one hasty and rushed sex scene, and there's absolutely no love triangle with Lancelot at all. Instead we have lots of fiery and spectacular explosions, and not very bloody G rated sword fights, complete with an overly embellished and inflated music score. Some of the battle scenes, photographed in that annoyingly trite slow motion, do spark some interest, and it is nice to see that the CGI effects are not overwhelming the action. But most of these scenes are so badly shot and edited that they become a mixed-up visual whirl. I was also surprised how little blood was actually spilled, considering the ferociousness of the battle scenes. <p>There's a lot of overly sentimental and dull preaching about freedom and equality, with people having a right to choose their own identities. And it is obvious from the outset that Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere are fighting for a cause that is beyond anyone's understanding. Of course, like any conflicted hero, Arthur finally realizes, through sacrifice and battle that the freedom they seek is within them, not in some far off distant land such as Rome. <p>The performances are generally passable. As the warrior princess, Kira Knightly looks kind of ridiculous, dressed in some kind of leather, paint-streaked get up in the action scenes, but she does get to kick some serious butt which is fun to watch. The appealing Ioan Gruffudd is absolutely wasted as Lancelot, and he's given almost nothing heroic to do. Clive Owen does his best, but he just can't rise above the pedestrian material. He does look terrific though, with his three-day growth, his swarthy manner and his oily, black locks of hair. There's also some nice warrior beefcake, but overall King Arthur is a rather dull, and tedious exercise in historical mediocrity.

All of these elements are very good, then the movie misfires on many things also.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: THE ACTING, oh my god, this has to be the director's fault here.  he has great actors, but it is the way you direct them to act.  The two main guy characters were just godawful, yet  you could tell they were good actors, they were just being told what to do wrongly.  I can't say that anyone was as glaring as these guys, but it is amazing how they stand out as being the leads and all, yet the supporting actors are really leaving you with the feeling of wanting to know more about them.<br /><br />So once again, not the greatest battle sequences, but then again that is when most of the actors shined through the most.<br /><br />So the retelling was done in an awfully quick manner, but it is still a pretty cool looking movie at least.<br /><br />Also i have the directors cut and haven't seen the regular version, but this one is certainly worth a watch.  And the commentary sucks, but the trivia track is pretty good.  Also the special features include like 40 minutes of making of and thoughts of, that kind of stuff, once again that feature beat the hell out of the commentary.

The pace is pretty even and there's a good story to the film, story of courage, loyalty and honor; three virtues on which this movie ultimately rest its soul on.<p>The movie don't do well if you really have to think deep. The fine story wasn't supported by a fine script, that much must be made clear. Some of the other reviewers have already pointed out some of the major flaws of the movie, biggest one I thought was that dumbo Roman family in distress plot. What was Antoine Fuqua thinking when he okay this??<p>But I thought the negatives were outweight by the positives. The actor who played that Saxon leader proves to be very good. I wish there were more scenes with him in it. Clive Owen held his own, Keira Knightley went from helpless girl in muck to Amazon bow-woman. Actually, she wasn't bad at all.  I think these "Woad" were nothing more then Picts of ancient Britain. Merlin seem to be more of a druid leader type but his role in this movie is very limited.<p>If any of you out there who read this, be warn that there is no Camelot, no knights in shinning armor and no love triangle in this movie. Its your basic sword and armor movie based during the period when the Western Roman Empire was disappearing from history.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WZ1B92F81LJJ.html">A2WZ1B92F81LJJ</a><br/><p>When you think about it, what is the collective conception of the Arthurian legend?<br /><br />Well, it's a myth, for one thing, and an achingly Pre-Raphaelite one at that: a sword magically buried in the stone; the lady of the lake holding aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water; the ambivalent wiles of Merlin, a magician who has slept under a rock for a hundred years; a Merovingian Easter-egg hunt for the Holy Grail; the nasty skulduggery of Merlin's sister Morgana Le Fay; and finally the illictly, tragically requited love between Guinevere and Lancelot. All good, stirring stuff, if you like that kind of thing.<br /><br />Now imagine how it would play if you took all of that away and were told instead that Arthur was a stony-faced Roman Centurion, his knights a band of cockney-sounding eastern European slaves (shades of an anarcho-syndicalist commune, I couldn't help thinking), Merlin a hairy, daubed (literally!) savage, and Guinevere a sort of skimpily attired, malnourished, blue, Xena Warrior Princess?<br /><br />Doesn't sound much chop, does it?<br /><br />And nor is it. (Well, all right, the skimpy warrior princess bit isn't *all* bad). It's not helped by less-than-imaginative borrowing from Braveheart, Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, Black Hawk Down, and the Lord of the Rings instalments, nor the wheeling in of yet another member of Clannad to sing the theme tune, nor the credulity-taxing back story involving Sarmatian knights who, with Ray Winstone in their midst, sound more East London than East Europe.<br /><br />Fundamentally, the Arthur story is only interesting as romantic myth. Thus, David Franzoni's justification of the film's historical accuracy on this site misses the point: La Morte d'Arthur is a great story; King Arthur: The Director's Cut is not. By purporting to take all the hocus pocus away, Franzoni has jettisoned anything of any real interest or point (unless you're prepared to see this as some sort of allegory for the Iraq War and, frankly, I'm not).<br /><br />King Arthur ultimately can't hold a candle to Excalibur, and even that reading must pay fealty to the greatest exploration of the Arthurian legend of them all. Graham Chapman's remains the definitive Arthur, with or without the violence inherent in the system.<br /><br />Next.<br /><br />Olly Buxton</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>This has got to be the most bizarre, the most unhistorical, and -- let's face it -- the silliest interpretation of the Arthur story that has ever groped its way to the screen. Arthur is so besotted with Rome that he dresses as a Roman cavalryman? (But with a legionary's infantry helmet.) The Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatians? Merlin is a Celt who paints himself blue? Guinevere is an Amazon? Rome is the protector of freedom? The Britons are all for "liberty" and "free will"? And the Britons, Sarmatians, Romans, and Saxons all speak the same language? (They don't even bother to pretend otherwise.) Gimme a break. Not to mention that the Saxons, not being stupid, invaded England from the south and never did reach Hadrian's Wall. The plot jumps from a time when the Sarmatians first arrive as recruits in the north of England (though they never actually fight as Romans) and Arthur is just a boy, to a scene fifteen years later, when Arthur (who, for some reason, was promised command when he was young) is running the whole show. From what everyone says, all the exciting battles took place years earlier and killed off most of the knights, so this, apparently, is their swan song. Though by skipping over those years, the director also never gives us a reason why the survivors should be so loyal to Arthur. There are a couple of good battle sequences, though the fight on the ice is dramatically superior to the big climax -- in which the Britons are suddenly in possession of artillery engines. And Keira Knightly is nice to look at -- though she's far too skinny to be convincing as a sword-swinging warrior. The only halfway believable character, in fact, is Cerdic, the Saxon chief, played menacingly by Stellan Skarsgaard. All in all, though, this film is just pathetic.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>I admit, there are some things about this movie that were blown out of proportion a little bit but it's still better then Van Helsing damnit and even better then Troy. I really didnt care for Troy that much and I frickin' hated Van Helsing to the bowels of hell. Clive Owen (The Bourne Identity, Gosford Park, Croupier) plays King Arthur, this makes up for Beyond Borders with him and Angelina Jolie. Kiera Knightley (Pirates OF The Caribbean, Love Actually, Bend IT Like Beckham) plays Lady Guinevere. Knightley plays the same performance in dialouge like she did in CAribbean. Ipan Grussford played Lancelot did it to the max and I was pissed when they killed him off. Til Schwiger (Driven, The Replacement Killers) played a Saxon (bald head guy with the little braided goutee).At first I thought that was Moby but no, my wrong. Everytime he spoke it sounded like he was talking chinese and I was glad Lancelot killed his monkey ass. Stellan Saarsgaard (The Glass House, the upcoming Excorsist: The Beginning and The Savior) plays the leader Saxon. Why did they pick Saarsgard? I mean come on. The other knights of the round table were great and I liked the part where the tall bald guy axed the ass. Kick ass scene. I still like Caribbean better. They shouold rename this Pirates Of The Camelot: The Search For Freedom and Peace. Also Merlin as a forest man in paint was a shock. I was pissed cuz they didnt say anything about Excaliber like they did in the commericial and also the scene where Merlin yells like Gandalf. The director and editor are cheap. Also starring Ray Winstone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Loyalty, Chivalry and Romantic Love are unusual subjects for the powerhouse movie producer, Jerry Bruckheimer whose movies usually have to do with Heroes with bad attitudes and badder guns. And even though the friction between his other films and his reputation for Wham-Bang movies might have made for an interesting re-telling of the King Arthur legend, "Arthur" is not.<br />The King Arthur of Clive Owen is like no other seen on the screen before. His Arthur is no romantic poet as in "Camelot" nor is there a Round Table or Sword in the Stone in sight. Owen's Arthur is deeply troubled and gravely concerned about the Roman conquest of his country, Britain. His Arthur manages to be heroic which is a major accomplishment what with all the silliness that surrounds him, mise-en-scene wise.<br />Keira Knightly has the right attitude for this film in that she plays her role of Guinevere with her tongue firmly planted in her beautiful cheek especially when she turns from a Lady to a harridan with a bow in artfully applied blue make-up.<br />Don't go to "Arthur" looking for a reverential bow to Ladies and Knights of the Round Table but if you are a fan of the Bruckheimer treatment, you could do far worse than what is on screen here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>A twist on the many Arthurian movies, focusing on the Historical context where Arthur was likely a Roman leader of some sort who stayed when most of Rome fled. Quite gritty for the faint of heart but realistic in its battle scenes.  Moves fast. Good characters and a fine climatic battle at the end.<br /><br />Lancelot played by the same actor who played Horatio Hornblower.<br /><br />Director's cut more interesting as it shows the movie ending and the director's preferred ending which is a bit less glory glory we rule attitude.<br /><br />If you want more of the faerie tale telling of this, either read T.H. White's THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING and see EXCALIBUR, which has a very small acting role for Liam Neeson as Sir Gawaine.  Of all the King Arthurian movies, Excalibur had it right and was even based on a famous book.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I can appreciate that this movie may be more historically accurate than what we're used to.  Perhaps Arthur was in fact a Roman.  I wouldn't know, obviously, but I'm happy to take the word of someone who has looked into it, with the additional comment that I don't fully trust anyone on this issue.<br /><br />Judging the movie apart from its possible historical accuracy, I have to give it a definite thumbs down.  There is just too much wrong with it.<br /><br />There are many battle scenes.  They don't give me the feeling of battle.  They are Hollywood battle scenes, lots of closeups, lots of blood and gore, lots of heroism, and none of it looks the least bit real.  It is a bunch of nonsense.<br /><br />The dialogue is pretty bad as well.  There's nothing realistic in the characters.  I don't sense even one real person on the screen.  This isn't exactly Dustin Hoffman here.  This is a bunch of Hollywood nonsense.<br /><br />Guinevere as Wonder Woman.  Yeah, okay.  It's one thing to say that there were female warriors back then, and I have read about Boadicea.  But I bet if Boadicea did in fact participate in hand to hand fighting, she wasn't a slender beauty queen.<br /><br />Guinevere reminded me of the female warrior in Lord of the Rings.  It's nice to have a female role model to make the little girls in the theatre, in their karate classes, proud of themselves.  Why not?  It's all make believe for the guys as well.  It's like Rocky.  The real Rocky was a shlub who couldn't beat Muhammad Ali in his dreams.  The Bayonne Bleeder.  Guinevere is Miss Rocky, so good for her.<br /><br />This movie is a silly bloody fiction, and it isn't worth your time to watch, if your taste is like mine.  If you like silly bloody stories, you will like this one too.  The good guys come off quite well in it.  Don't put your money on the villain, no matter how favored he seems to be.  You want a real long shot, bet on a villain.<br /><br />One part of this movie reminds me of another famous fictional story, the one about Moses leading the Israelites through the sea, a sea which ends up swallowing the army of Egypt.  The same thing happens here, only the sea is composed of ice, temporarily.  Crackkkkkkkk.........<br /><br />I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if the Egyptians, I mean the Saxons, were wearing swimsuits and inflated tubes.  Failing as a drama, it might have been funny as a comedy.<br /><br />To put my comments in perspective, I think that almost all of the adventure movies out today are absolute garbage.  It's not that I'm hard to please.  It's that most of the dramatic movies out now are worthless crap, unless you are into watching phony violence for the sake of enjoying the phony violence.  I'm not saying that this movie is any worse than the rest of the garbage out there.<br /><br />Here are a few of the things you learn from this movie.  First of all, Germans are bloodthirsty evil villains.  Second, Christians are stupid asses who enjoy torturing pagans.  Third, Romans were pretty awful themselves, except of course for Arthur.  Fourth, it is quite possible to shoot an arrow any number of yards, high into the air, and have it come down plunk right into a sensitive organ of a man hiding in a tree.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>When most people think of the Arthurian legend, they think of things like knights in full suits-of-armor, magic, jousting and medieval castles.  To be sure, these motifs are straight out of the writings of Sir Thomas Mallory.  However, they are also anachronisms when juxtaposed with the original myth.<br /><br />This film gets back to the roots of the myth, which date back to right around the end of the Roman occupation.  It also picks up on Arthur and his knights being descendents of Samarian knights, which is a plausible theory.  In short, the epoch portrayed in this movie served as the genesis of the legend of Arthur.  Whether or not the fellow ever actually existed is still a matter of speculation - even amongst historians with doctorates.<br /><br />David Franzoni, the writer of GLADIATOR, once again displays his erudition as he mixes historical fact with fictional details.  There are some cool special features that entice one to admire the lengths they went to in making the sets and battle scenes / battle tactics as authentic as possible.  One leaves this movie feeling as though he or she was just in the middle of 5th century (CE) Britain.<br /><br />Clive Owen is terrific as the noble Arthur. Hans Zimmer delivers yet another top-notch soundtrack.  The direction is excellent. Unfortunately, the Unrated label does not = Keira Knightley taking her shirt off.  However, she still looks very sexy in Celtic warpaint!<br /><br />One of the most refreshing factors of the film is that it does not concentrate on the love-triangle.  That this is an important part of the myth is not in dispute.  However, some versions of the tale focus on the triangle to the detriment to the rest of the myth.  In this movie, things never get past some subtle flirting between Lancelot & Guinivere.<br /><br />For fans of the legend, this movie is a can't miss. For people who desire to learn more about both British and Roman history, this movie is invaluable.  For everyone else, it's certainly worth seeing at least once.  Long Live King Arthur!</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>As it is the film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who gave us Armageddon, Con Air, and Pearl Harbor, you know what you see in King Arther. Historical accuracy? Not a chance. The Round Table? Excalibur? You see them, but not in the way you read or heard. For it is based on a newer, revised idea, which means you get lots of actions, sword fighting, and love. In short, just another over-the-top blockbuster film, and as such King Arther is not bad.<br /><br /> Now, the surprisingly non-Ameircan cast include Olive Owen as Arther; Keira Knightley as Guinevere; Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot; Stephen Dillane as Merlin; Stellan Skarsgaard as baddie Cerdic; Ray Winstone as Bors; Hugh Dancy as Galahad; Joel Edgerton as Gawain; Mads Mikkelson as Tristan; and Ray Stevenson as Dagonet.<br /><br /> The story is nothing you ever have heard in many versions of King Arthur legends. The new story is set against the background of the Roman occupation of Britain in 415 AD. King Arthur is under the command of a Roman priest, who gives Arthur and other knights another and last order to bring back a Roman aristocrartic family safe back from the enemy territory, where the Saxons led by cold-blooded Cerdic are invading.<br /><br /> Of course, it's a suicide mission, but it sounds a bit familiar, isn't it? Well, the director of this film is Antoine Faqua, who did Tears of the Sun last year, and that's no wonder. Oh, and by the way, the screenwriter of King Auther happens to be David Franzoni, one of the co-writers of Gladiator of which huge success, critically or commercially, must have spawned the new craze for the Ben-Hur type big-scale epic actions, including Troy and a forthcoming one about Alexander.<br /><br /> To be fair, the actions are done with enough power and convincing fight scenes, without splashing too much blood. At the same time, after watching Gladiator this one may look very tame. And some of the actions cannot help making us feel like, I have seen it before, and if its doesn't, well, you haven't seen Braveheart or Rob Roy.<br /><br /> I do not complain of the historical things -- anyway, it's legend -- but King Arther challenges our concept about this famous story so gratingly that you may be offended with it. You see no Camelot; Merlin does not use magic; and Guenevere takes us a weapon and shoots arrows, at times with her skins painted blue like one character in X-Men. Some say it's campy, and with good reasons. And as the illicit love with Lancelot is totally gone (hey, it's a family picture), so Gruffudd soon starts to look just like a shadow following her and Arthur.<br /><br /> If you are not surprised to see the newness of the story, you will be entertained with the actions, or the fights between the good and the evil. But as you know. you can see John Boorman-directed Excalibur which would be a better choice for some.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I'll start by saying I enjoyed this movie, a lot - and it's refreshing to see a new approach to the mythical story than simply rechurning old material as others have done. If you are a fan of the excellent "Excalibur" or have even read Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, then your first reaction to this movie will be "What the ?". That said, I have admiration for a director who dares tread unbroken ground in such a way, and tries to express that stories of old, handed down over the years were probably based on some kind of actual events initially, and this is the premise here. Clive Owen, is a little too workmanlike for my taste as the Revered Knight "Arturious" nee Arthur of the title, born to mixed parents, half English, Half Roman who has spent the last fifteen years of his adult life, roaming England, and fighting heathens in the name of the holy church of Rome. On the eve of his release from Religious servitude, he and his band of hardened knights are sent on a pseudo suicide mission North, to rescue a young boy who may become the next Holy Pope. During his journey, he is awakened to the corruption of the Church, a revelation that rocks the very foundation of all he has held dear all his life. He begins to see his own countrymen (formerly his enemies) as kindred spirits almost, and unites them ultimately to ward off a huge army of Saxon invaders. It's a nice idea, and a nice twist with some inventive back story along the way. Launcelot is here, Gawain, Galahad, Guinevere, and even Merlin as a mystic Celtic style witch doctor, all adding meat to the bones of the legend. The trouble is, the movie tries to encapsulate the legend of the mighty Arthur, and really only serves up a slice or two in an almost episodic retelling. The historical timing and influences of the Roman prescence in the England depicted are credible, and the battle scenes are graphic and impressive, but something always seems missing as you watch. My favorite character was the Saxon King Cerdic played with a battle weary but ruthless malevolence by Stellan Skarsg?rd, who adds more than just balance to the whole picture, and will make you hiss every time he appears almost. Overall not bad, it's worth getting this unrated Directors cut however, as the additional footage makes for a better movie, and the alternate ending is the one that should have been used, instead of the schmaltzy Hollywood one shown. Very enjoyable movie that is almost believable in places, but one wonders if it would have been better as a stand alone story, instead of trying to be the Story behind the story of the legend of Arthur.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>What an awful, gore-filled movie. The romance and mystery of the Authurian legend is replaced by the mystery of how Guinevere kept clothed during battle. She only wears a few well placed leather straps. How can they claim historical accuracy and redefine Guinivere in this way? When we first meet G., her fingers are all out of joint and Arthur painfully puts them back. In less than a few hours, she is Robin Hood. Killing evil  Roman Christians and Saxons with a bow and arrow. She is almost starved to death and dehydrated by the Romans, but in less than a few days she's gripping swords, out dueling opponents three times her size and running half naked to battle. She has pretty impressive recuperative powers.<br /><br />The acting of Clive Owen is the only decent thing about the movie. He plays King Arthur in a nice understated way.<br /><br />An undefined "Freedom" becomes the highest good. Freedom replaces truth, justice, chivalry, and duty of the Arthurian legends. The movie investigates the idea of freedom, but never really defines it. True freedom is no boundaries, I think. The movie steals from Braveheart, The Patriot and the Lord of the Rings. The battle scenes go on way too long. There are several scenes of Merlin with the wind blowing through his long hair. It is less than impressive.<br /><br />I could go on, but why bother.<br /><br />I would add 1/2 star. After I wrote this review I saw a special on Bouddicca. She led a charge in England against the Romans. So the warrior princess idea is well-founded in fact. I still think no warrior would dress that way and her recuperative powers were too amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>This movie is either hated or loved, I guess you as the viewer will have to take the pick. I myself thought it was nothing special from all the other King Arthur movies made. They tried I guess to make the movie different this time by hacking out a lot of the old story that has repeatedly been done on so many other movies and they thought this would make it better. Honestly it really didn't. It just made King Arthur fans like I disappointed and somewhat bitter. I can understand they wanted to make it a little different but it didn't seem right all the things they changed.<br />A lot of it seemed unreal and totally barren. Like Merlin, why is it you see him so little, when in the other Arthur films he is the main star? And Arthur hated him in this film, instead of considering him a true friend like in the other films? One of the largest reasons I liked the King Arthur story was because of Merlin. You do not see him though hardly ever in this film though so don't expect him to be. And Guniverye (I can never spell that name right) she was very unrealistic in this film for many reasons. I know they wanted a strong female image but back then women, especially half- starved women with a wounded hand did not fight alongside men. That was very unrealistic. Then the whole essence of passion in the love triangle of Lancelot and Arthur with G. was so vague in this film, when it was supposed to be one of the biggest problems in the whole story. They hacked a lot out of this story definitely, a lot of the stuff that made the story of King Arthur so popular in the first place. So yes, the movie loses major points on this. And the other thing is again, even with all those changes I may have enjoyed the movie nonetheless if the changes were interesting, which they weren't. They were changes that made once a fascinating, mystical legend just to me another historic movie with a few battle scenes, a few words of honor, and then the credits. And since I do enjoy historic movies, I thought this one was all right, it isn't terrible, but it was nothing worth watching again.<br />There has been better historic movies, and definitely better King Arthur films so I advise watching this movie once, and take your decision of it. Then watch an original story of King Arthur in film. Then you decide which is better. The modern tale, or the original tale. It probably will be a different opinion for everyone, but honestly I prefer the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>Kiera Knightley is so hot and I expected this movie to be really good but it was boring and dragged out.

What is left is a dull, dreary, generic action flick in which King Arthur's noble Knights of the Round Table curse, drink, crack crude jokes, and sex-it up.  Being that "King Arthur" has touted itself as "the untold true story that inspired the legend", I was left with the impression that King Arthur's knights were crude, dirty bums that sat around all day; drinking and complaining.  Merlin makes an appearance too as part of a face-painted tribe of barbarians living in the woods.  Can you feel the magic here, folks?<br /><br />This "true story" is bogged down with stilted speeches about how every man is born free and equal and frantic, confusing battle sequences.  And the script?  Here's a sampling of some of the cinematic masterpieces that await you:<br /><br />Lancelot: There is a large number of lonely men out there.<br /><br />Guinevere: Don't worry; I won't let them rape you.<br /><br />Arthur: O merciful God, I have such need of Your mercy now...<br /><br />Lancelot: Why do you always talk to God and not to me?<br /><br />Gawain: The gifts the gods gave me I use in battle or in bed.<br /><br />Galahad: Imagine what a lovely, quiet place the world would be if everyone had their throats slit.<br /><br />Horton: God help us. What are they?<br /><br />Bors: Blue demons that eat Christians alive. You're not a Christian, are you?<br /><br />The acting just don't cut it either.  From previous experience, I realized that Clive Owen's King Arthur and Keira Knightley's Guinevere (who is now a painted pagan prison inhabitant) are supposed to be falling in love, but it is never apparent to the audience until they, predictably, jump in bed together.  And the famous love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lacelot?  Practically nonexistent.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>If gore, and dialogue like "aargh" and "oomph", and impossibly far flying arrows, and tense battle scenes of masses of Saxons against a mere few Knights is your cup of tea, then KING ARTHUR is bound to please.<br /><br />Director Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day", "Tears of the Sun") has restudied the King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable legend and found the origins in 5th Century Rome vs Briton occupation. The result is less a visit to the Camelot of Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere of the 15th Century than it is a heyday for the violence that conquering Rome imposed on the 'colonies' of its empire.<br /><br />Given the odd transplant, Fuqua has created a film that is over two hours long and is basically a series of seemingly endless fighting on the bloody battlefields of Briton.  The settings are dark yet magnificent (Ireland at its greenest) and the film is carried by the strong performances of Clive Owen as Arthur, Ioan Gruffudd (please change that name!) as Lancelot, Keira Knightly as Guinevere, Stellan Skarsgard as Cerdic the evil Saxon, and the famous Knights as played by Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, and Mads Mikkelson (though trying to identify  any of these actors under all the hair and grime is a task!).<br /><br />So it is a battle film and for that genre it is very fine - a good  popcorn movie for the cold nights ahead.  The featurettes on the DVD are not too additive, but the 'alternative ending' shows that Fuqua could have had a tighter film had that been chosen over the sappy one in the released version.  Grady Harp, December 2004</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>After watching Troy, I figured King Arthur would be much of the same - a semi-historical retelling of a legend, minus the fantastical elements. I was half right.<br /><br /> This is the King Arthur as historians imagine him to be. Not a thoroughly medieval knight, but a Roman military leader, struggling to retain control of Britain after the fall of Rome. Abandoned by his allies and surrounded on all sides by barbarians, Arthur must rally his infamous horsemen and apply Roman law to a lawless land.<br /><br /> Well, at least that's what the History Channel told me. There's more to the plot. However, the plot was difficult to understand because of the extremely poor sound quality of the film. The audio crew obviously had some challenges, since the majority of the action takes place outdoors. Everyone mumbles every line, such that important points are lost.<br /><br /> To wit, Artorius Castus (King Arthur, played by Clive Owen) is looking forward to releasing his Sarmatian foederati (his knights) from service after a long campaign of battling the natives. It's impossible to name who the natives are, because nobody ever pronounced their names clearly - research finally uncovered &quot;woads,&quot; but for a long time I thought it was &quot;vulgs&quot; or &quot;wolves&quot; or &quot;wrothes.&quot;<br /><br /> In addition, the Saxons lurk north of a great wall that divides the civilized Roman world in Britain from the barbarian-types. The Saxons are ill defined, looking a bit like Norse Vikings but not actually called Vikings. Which is odd, given that every other character tied to the Arthurian legend IS given his &quot;proper&quot; name, even when it makes no sense for said character to have said name.<br /><br /> Cerdric (Stellan Skarsgard) leads the Saxons, a Really Bad Guy ?. Or at least, he's supposed to be a bad guy. Instead, he settles for whispering every line in a gravelly voice that's supposed to convince us Cerdric, and indeed all the Saxons, are awful, wicked people who deserve to die.<br /><br /> With the Saxons on the move and the Woads getting bolder every day, Artorius just wants to go home. If this plot sounds familiar, it's because every semi-historical movie has been trying to capture the success of Gladiator, including mimicking the plot. It doesn't work here.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, a badly accented Italian bishop comes to deliver news that the knights have one more mission before they will be released back to Rome. It's a rescue mission to a governor's son, who is right in the path of the rampaging Saxons.<br /><br /> The Saxons are such bad guys that even the Woads, led by Merlin (Stephen Dillane), figure they have a better chance at uniting with the foreign occupation, so they decide to make peace with Arthur against a common enemy. It doesn't hurt that Guinevere (played by a wild-eyed Keira Knightley) improves Roman/Woad relations by sleeping with Arthur. Knightley plays Guinevere with wild-eyed abandon, a supposedly ferocious hellcat who can take out Saxons half-naked and with a thin sword. She simply doesn't have the physical presence to pull it off.<br /><br /> After rescuing the boy, Arthur and his knights are faced with a difficult choice: leave the land they now call home for a homeland they can barely remember, or fight and probably die to defend their new home.<br /><br /> There are so many knights who are all scruffy and dark-haired that they blur together. To help distinguish each character, they are given a fighting style and a weapon - none of which strive for even a smidgen of historical accuracy. One knight fights with spiked knuckles, another with two long swords, a third in a rapier style, another with a saber, one with a club, etc. None of this would be a problem if it weren't for the long text intro (and advertising) that proclaims this movie is based on historical fact.<br /><br /> For reasons that only the writers can explain, Sir Bors (Ray Winstone) is by far the most charismatic character and has the most lines - even more than Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd). Bors was a relatively minor character in Arthurian legend, but apparently his comic relief was sorely needed in a film that takes itself far too seriously.<br /><br /> Lancelot exchanges glances with Guinevere and there's plenty of jokes implying he's a womanizer, but no romance. Bors talks a lot about his own prowess in bed, his family, and his home. Galahad (Hugh Dancy) and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) argue with each other a lot (and since they're brothers, it often seems like one actor arguing with himself).<br /><br /> Throughout the story, we discover Arthur is a Christian and his knights are not. But even Arthur thinks a little differently - he follows the teachings of Pelagius, a Celtic monk who believed in free will. When Pelagius is banished excommunicated, Arthur seriously rethinks returning to Rome.<br /><br /> There's a lot of talk about religion and ethics in the treatment of the Woads, of prisoners, and the knights, but none of it is portrayed with any real emotion. The combat scenes are disjointed, probably to keep the movie to a PG-13 rating. At least Troy had the guts to go for an R rating and show combat in all its gory detail.<br /><br /> King Arthur has all the horrible attributes of First Knight, barely resembling the myth from which its characters are named. And yet it hides behind the accuracy of supposed historical research, which quickly falls apart upon examination (and watching the History Channel).<br /><br /> In the end, the most exciting scene is a battle against the Saxons on an ice-covered lake. Good stuff, certainly enough to be entertaining. But it could have been so much more.<br /><br /> King Arthur is like Troy without Brad Pitt. It has all the will and none of the acting ability, directorial talent, or plot to back it up.</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I am by far no fan of any film that has Jerry Bruckheimer's name stamped all over it. To me, Jerry Bruckheimer represents everything wrong with most big budgeted films in Hollywood, all action and no substance. I didn't have much interest in seeing "King Arthur" over the summer but when I had the opportunity to review the unedited version on dvd, I thought to give "King Arthur" a chance. I'm glad I did. I found myself loving the film from the moment I saw a young Lancelot to the last scene.<br /><br />I didn't go into this film expecting the the film to be the truth but to be entertained instead so I wasn't expecting a history lesson. I definitely was entertained. The film begins with a young Lancelot being recruited by the Roman empire to serve in its military for fifteen years which was a common practice for British men during the era (at least in the film). Speed ahead fifteen years, Arthur and his fellow knights are just about to complete their indentured servitude to the Roman empire when they are given one last mission to rescue a young man destined to be a pop from the invading Saxon army. This final mission (which was not by choice) causes minor conflict for Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. During the course of the mission, Arthur encounters Guinevere and her brother and rescuses them along with the Romans before the Saxons could reach the castle.<br /><br />I enjoyed the performances by all the actors involved but I really thought Clive Owen as Arthur and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere really stood out for me. I liked the fact that Guinevere was by no means your atypical damsel in distress. She was just as much as a warrior as she was as a young woman. The battle scenes with the Saxons were visually spectacular. The costumes were great, especially King Arthur's armor which reminded me of Russell Crowe in "Gladiator". What really made this film enjoyable for me is Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score and the gorgeous vocals of Moira Brennan. I loved the music.<br /><br />My only fault I could find "King Arthur" is that this film reminded me too much of either "Braveheart" or "Gladiator". I felt that this film was trying to be the big, epic dramas those films were. I thought the speech Clive Owen gives before he and his fellow knights go into their final battle with the Saxons was cheesy and sounded too much like the cheesy speech that Mel Gibson gives in "Braveheart". As wonderfully choreographed as the battle scenes were, I thought the choreography was a bit too polished and I thought I was watching a ballet, not a movie, like in "Gladiator". Overall, I enjoyed "King Arthur" immensely for all its flaws and gaffes. The bonus dvd features were very entertaining to watch as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it is a very pleasant and entertaining movie.<br /><br />King Arthur, brings to the screen not the traditional version, but an alternative tale of the legendary king of Camelot, Lady Guinevere, Sir Lancelot and the likes.<br /><br />In this version, Arthur and his knights are Sarmatian mercenaries from southern Russia brought to Britannia and bound by a contract to serve out time in defence of the Roman Empire's Northwestern borders.<br /><br />Times are changing; the Empire is under pressure from advancing barbarians and is forced to abandon its farthermost provinces and outposts and focus on the defence of Italia and Rome itself.  As the Romans prepare to leave, the Saxons invade and the native Britons are faced with a new threat/enemy.  Moreover, the Empire finds itself in the midst of the transformation from the old traditional Greco-Roman religion to the new Christian one.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is above average, the special effects are excellent, and the plot is definitely original.<br /><br />The clash between Christendom and druidic paganism is as fascinating as the internal conflicts within the early Christian Church, and both presented very well in the film.<br /><br />The scene in the chapel/dungeon and battle on the lake are breathtaking to say the least.<br /><br />On the negative side the lead actor, Clive Owen, carries himself too much like Nicholas Cage (his voice-his appearance) as if that is who he is thinking of when reciting his lines.<br /><br />Moreover, it becomes rather tiring and annoying with the repetitive "freedom" theme, especially with the otherwise "barbarian" Guinevere (!!!) delivering modern-style lectures to Arthur.<br /><br />The setting, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!<br /><br />Forts, Battles, and Swordfights are all about.<br /><br />In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Although the historical accuracy of this movie can be debated, as with everything, it should be noted that this is a much more realistic look at the historical possibilities that could have built the legend we all know and love.  Gone are the magic, the folklore and the love triangle infidelity that came with the fantasy tale of Excalibur.<br /><br />Now don't get too upset and think this is a disrespectful `re-imagining' like the Sean Connery/Richard Gere debacle of the mid 90s, First Knight.  Although that was a decent movie, it tore apart the fabric of what made the story great.  In this movie, Merlin is a soothsayer, a madman of sorts with a large following of nature worshipers.  You can see how this could kind of person could be seen as some sort of Wizard or magician.  If he says he caused the fog to roll in and all his people back him up, most people will believe it, and the legend will grow into a tale of fantasy.<br /><br />As with the love triangle with Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot; in this film it's done as a side note.  No wedding, no infidelity, no romance.  Just an obvious attraction between her and the two knights, obviously finding each of them appealing for different reasons.  The battles are intense and realistic, the cinematography and visuals of the landscapes are spectacular.  And the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is pounding and alive, probably one of the best he's done in years.<br /><br />The performances by the three lead actors is solid.  Great interactions with Arthur and Guinevere, proving once again that Clive Owen is highly underrated and Keira Knightly is one of the most talented young actresses of the day.  Ian Groffold does a fine job as well displaying a personality in Lancelot we have never really seen.  It's a shame this movie didn't do better at the box office, but if it find life in DVD and rental, I will be happy that it got it recognition.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>I'm not one to enjoy war movies, but this one was great.  Good story, great actors, beautiful scenery, gorgeous landscapes.  Exciting and intriguing. And most of all very romantic.  For me this is Knightley's best role -- love the concept of a strong, female warrior, although she starts off as a damsel in distress who needs to be rescued.  Even loved the cold-blooded Saxon king, absolutely lacking in mercy and a great villain.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the battle on the frozen lake. Wonderful shots of cracking ice, brave knights, Saxons falling beneath the ice.<br /><br />Not sure what all the belly aching is about.  The movie, like all others about King Arthur, is based on a LEGEND.  It's not a documentary, folks. Calm the hell down. And enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Now that Cowboys and Injuns is (appropriately) no longer the genre which allows pre-modern warfare in all its hand-to-hand Gore, Film Studios are hard put to find a substitute. What better than a Popular Legend, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable,along with a bit of Feminism, Amazons who can wield a bow and arrow with the best of them and sufficiently agile to avoid spears, knives, axes, in  hand to combat without any need for the armor that the men wore. I couldn't quite make out the various ways in which the Chief Female made her kills, but did see her straddling one guy from the rear with wide-open mouth; I believe a sword also played a role in her repertoire of weaponry, I did expect Errol Flynn, either as Custer or Robin Hood, to rise to the occasion, but was disappointed on that score. There was talk of Rome, Christianity, Freedom, and Saxons, but somehow the native Celts, upon whom the others were feeding in that era, did not get a play. Of course, after the Celts, Saxons, Danes and Vikings had a shot at control of the area we would call England, the Normans ultimately successfully invaded and took permanent control.<br />Without much need to fall back on reality, which is nearly absent from our common knowledge of this period in " England"", the film-makers had pretty much a free hand to invent what they wanted to...and they did.<br />Over-all, it is not a bad picture if you only allow your mind to dwell on the fighting and not to the politics or cultural attributes which were at the heart of the struggle.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KWQ64TRHB3YH.html">A2KWQ64TRHB3YH</a><br/><p>This Director's Cut DVD is one of those films that says, "It didn't happen as you were told. Now I'm going to show you the truth." The film's view is that the legends of King Arthur are based on a real man who did not live during the middle ages, as the legends state, but in the middle of the fifth century; also he wasn't an Englishman, but a Roman. The film tells us that around 450, when Rome was in decline, and England, which the Romans had conquered was being overrun by Saxons, the Romans kidnapped youngsters and forced them to serve in their army for fifteen years. One of these youngsters was Arthurius, known to us as Arthur. Arthur became quite adept at fighting and led a small group of about a half dozen men, including Lancelot and Tristan, who were devoted to him and whom he called his knights. As a final fight before releasing the band at the conclusion of their fifteen years, the Romans insisted that he fight against the Saxons. Arthur has no choice but to agree, and his band joins him. They encounter a group of English led by a man called Merlin, and his soldier Genevieve, and need to decide if they will work with Merlin's army. The film is filled with battle scenes. Viewers who enjoy such scenes will, like this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`King Arthur' released in '04 is a masterpiece! Not since `The Magnificent Seven' in '60 has there been such an exciting film about a courageous and valiant band of warriors facing insurmountable odds on the field of battle.<br /><br />Synopsis: Seven knights are all that remains of the feared Salmacian fighting forces in servitude to the Roman Empire. The time of Rome's departure from Britain has come and the surviving warriors now await their long promised release from duty. However their appointed time of freedom is withheld until they undertake one last mission, a mission that will bring them face to face with a massive army of invaders from the North. Freedom is in the balance, both for themselves and the British Isles. The choice they make will make them legends.<br /><br />The legendary seven are; Clive Owen (Arthur), Ioan Gruffudd (Lancelot), Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan), Hugh Dancy (Galahad), Joel Edgerton (Gawain), Ray Winstone (Bors) and Ray Stevenson (Dagonet). This is an epic tale with an unforgettable cast. I never get tired of watching this film.<br /><br />Also outstanding performances by Stellan Skarsqard and Kiera Knightley as Guinevere.</p></br></body></html>

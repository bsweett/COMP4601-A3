Being under the shadow of terminator it never got the respect it derserved. The criterion dvd is also amazing, robocop fans like myslef finally get to see the directors cut. The extra violent shots taken are out are pretty interesting and the commentary is also very good. This verison is currently out of print, but if you can get your hands on it, its worth every penny. It is rumored that MGM studios is re-releasing a robocop special edition, but I can assure robocop fans that it will not have the unrated director's cut, or commentary. In other words stick with the criterion version, Thier line of dvd's are amazing, and well worth the extra money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Before "Robocop" displays its extreme violence in a parade of bullets and blood, it opens with a newsbreak that details a world on the verge of disaster and a city out of control, Detroit.  While the world deals with Star Wars, impending Nucleur doom and war, Detroit deals with drugs, rampant violent crime and corporate scum who control the police, hospital system and prisons.  The one bit of actual integrity is the police, who still go out on the streets to try to find some order in the choas.<p>Now, "Robocop" is never as serious as I put on.  That newsbreak and corporate scum is scathing satire that prevails throughout the film on 1980s' America, hitting close to home.  Everything is privitized, the world on the edge of disaster and America riddled in crime and decadence.  Man in the future isn't pretty.<p>The police however, are trying to do some good in this world.  One of their men, Murphy (Peter Weller) ends up being shot to pieces by crime boss Clarence Bodiger (Kurtwood Smith) and his cohorts in one of films' most graphic sequences.  But Murphy returns, sort of, as Robcop, one of the company OCPs' projects to try to clean up crime (but only for a company project called Delta City).  Murphy, however, is still holding some of his shattered humanity, and when he learns of who exactly killed him, he goes on a revenge mission to find them.  He encouters Bodiger and his cohorts in a cocaine plant and an old abadoned steel mill, each attempts to kill each other.  <p>Besides that satire, director Paul Verhoeven is the films' insatiable and bloody energy, showing his fetish proudly for lots and lots of bloodshed.  But editor Frank Urioste and cinematographer Jost Vocano are the bulk of the reason why "Robocop" is a fluid, fast-paced action flick.  And writers Ed Neumier (who also signed on as executive producer) and Michael Miner make "Roocop" an intelligent and pessimistic view of the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>"Robocop" is Paul Verhoeven's bleak view of the future. Here corporations make their own rules and use and destroy anything that stand in their way. Like Verhoeven's later "Total Recall" one can see this film as a devastating satire of Reagan-era America.<br /><br />Verhoeven indulges in his usual over-the-top violence and grim humour, which constantly skirt bad taste. However, there are lots of nice details, social commentary, imagination, action, and yes heart to keep most action fans happy.<br /><br />Followed by two terrible sequels.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Robocop is one movie that I'll never get tired of seeing. The movie is exceptionally made for 1987! Sure, some scenes are cheesy but for that time, wow! This movie is up there with the likes of the terminator. While I find the terminator to be a better movie, Robocop is close to it. Robobcop is a predictable, mindless movie that is fascinating to watch. To watch Murphy strapped into that big robotic outfit will make everyone grin. When he pulls out that huge gun, blows away some punk, and spins it around, you'll be like, wow, this is so cool. This movie is a classic with memorable one liners and fantastic humor. The action is nonstop of course. This movie is like a roller coaster ride, meaning that, it's in full gear, looking like it's about to end and then it keeps on going and there's more awesome to come.<br /><br />There's no need to talk about the plot because everyone who didn't see this should know it anyway. And for anyone grown up, 20+ who hasn't seen this! They're nuts! This is a classic! No, instead people prefer watching Titanic! Well, anyway, I really recommend buying this wicked cool movie in which a big cyborg kick everyone's a**!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before Paul Verhoeven directed the lambasted Showgirls and the dreadful Hollow Man, he helmed this sci-fi masterpiece that would become a box office hit and inspire inferior sequels, a dreadful TV show, two cartoons, video games, and a horde of comics.  Peter Weller plays Detroit cop Alex Murphy who is brutally (and graphically) gunned down in the line of duty.  Through technological enhancements, his brain is resurrected (with snippits of memories) in the form of a cyborg built by corporate company OCP (which owns the police force) to be "the future of law enforcemnt".  While RoboCop is an action sci-fi blast from beginning to end, but what lies beneath that is a satire of the news media and it's influence on the public in a city raging out of control (Verhoeven would later use a similar type of satirical style with 1997's Starship Troopers).  The casting is superb: Nancy Allen is perfect as Murphy's sympathetic partner, Ronny Cox is his usual slimy self as crooked OCP vice president Dick Jones, and Kurtwood Smith (Red on That '70's Show) is utterly fantastic as Clarence Boddicker, the S.O.B. you'll love to hate.  All in all, this is one of Verhoeven's finest directorial efforts, and is essential to any lover of action or sci-fi.  Get the Criterion Collection edition if you can, it's worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"RoboCop" has the distinction of being a leftist shoot'em-up, which might be why the film attained instant cult status when it hit theaters in 1987. It has lots of bloody action, cool-looking technology, and skewers the ideals of Reagan Republicans. Kind of like "Rambo" for liberals. Detroit, Michigan of the near future is overrun with crime, and the city has hired Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a private enterprise, to manage its police force. OCP's vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has high hopes for a problematic ED-209 enforcement droid to augment the police force. But up-and-comer Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has a better idea: A cyborg that incorporates the corpse of a deceased cop, retaining his instincts, increasing his firepower, and programming his directives. When Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is murdered on the job, he is transformed into RoboCop.<br /><br />"RoboCop" is one of those liberal movies that even conservatives admit they love. It's a violent, bring'em-to-justice action movie but also an anti-privatization tract. Elements within OCP are corrupt, working unscrupulously to create a need for their product in order to sell it. The company is at odds with the Detroit police force, which is threatening to strike. And RoboCop is just an enhanced version of a corporate drone, stripped of his own identity and programmed so that he may become "product". OCP is planning a huge industrial complex called Delta City that will provide 2 million much-needed jobs, but the script even manages to spin that unfavorably. One may or may not agree with its sentiments, but the sheer quantity of socio-political commentary that screenwriters Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner, and director Paul Verhoeven were able to pack into the film amazes me.<br /><br />Black comedy, gory action, and RoboCop's sympathetic nature make it all watchable. RoboCop's monotone statements remind me of a mechanized Dirty Harry. They evoke both sly laughter and vengeful approval. But RoboCop is victimized by forces he cannot control and that he struggles to understand. His simple mind is compelled to cope with dirty politics and unscrupulous profiteering. The audience sympathizes with that. Leeza Gibbons makes a semi-cameo as a newscaster whose reports allude to many hot political topics of the 1980s, as do fake commercials that interrupt the news. In fact, there are so many references to then-current events -nuclear arms race, toxic waste, SDI, the Jarvik heart, urban violence- that it feels like a trip back in time to my high school government class. "RoboCop" is simultaneously over-the-top and sly, and it's still fun.<br /><br />The DVD (MGM/Orion 2001): I'm reviewing a bare bones edition of the film, whose only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (1 1/2 min). Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish and French. If you would like an audio commentary and the longer, more graphically violent "director's cut" of the film, you will need the out-of-print Criterion Collection disc (1998).</p></br><a href="../users/A38921VU3NJDFK.html">A38921VU3NJDFK</a><br/><p>This ultra-violent, totally awesome satirical cop-actioner (which was originally given an "X" rating by the MPAA, prior to the conception of the "NC-17" sticker) is arguably one of Paul Verhoeven's best films, besting pictures such as his other sci-fi greats Total Recall and Starship Troopers, and his erotic thriller Basic Instinct. Its smart script is a sardonic and bloody one that surveys topical subject matter like the human character and America's cultural obsession with media and its lasting effects. All the while, however, screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner appease the blood- and action-lusting appetite of that same obsessive American culture, while Verhoeven does what he's best at: delivering his renowned action-focused pace to movies of the action and science-fiction genres, making them as entertaining as they are usually gory.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>I bought the Criterion Collection version of Robocop because I loved the movie and thought the expanded scenes might add something to the movie. I was wrong. I would give the movie itself five stars but the four stars goes to this Criterion Collection DVD. The sound and picture quality are very good but the supposedly added footage is all violence, and only a few frames of it at that. Not that I was looking for extended scenes of blood and gore but Paul Verhoven did such a great job of bringing out the human aspect of Robocop, that I thought there would be more scenes relating to his family or his relationship with his partner. Alas, I was disappointed. And the extra features are almost non-existent as well. I have the Criterion collection of Armageddon and it has two disks and over three hours of extra stuff. If you like this movie, you're better off just getting the standard version, the CC is not worth the extra money.<br /><br />Update: Feb 2008<br />This review refers to the 20th Anniversary collection;<br /><br />I'd Buy that for a dollar...<br /><br />That phrase is still used in some circles today.  Fans of Sci-Fi and comics would probably recognize it as the phrase in the fictional TV show within the movie.  What many people don't understand about Robocop is not only is it an emotional story about a man stripped of his humanity, but a story about the direction of American social culture as well.<br /><br />Released in 1987, Robocop is an ultra violent sci-fi story of Police Officer Murphy, who is converted into a Supercop after being killed in the line of duty.  Although he performs as he should at first, his nightmarish memories of his death at the hands of his killers come to the surface and he ventures out on his own to find out the answers to who he is and why he's having these memories.  After tracking his leads he falls into a trap by the corporate CEO of the company who owns him and is nearly killed.<br /><br />While this plot line unfolds we are treated to pieces of a world, which is supposed to be the near future, that is highly glutinous, greedy and full of crime.  Of course it takes place in Detroit, which at the time was the most violent city in America.  But now, you can look at it and see that the vision of the future was skewed, but not by much.  Silly sit-coms with mindless one liners are not our favorite form of Television entertainment...but are reality shows much better?  Big cars that get 8.3 miles to the gallon are making a comeback in this movie.  Even though we have them, they're not as big, as inefficient or as common.  It's also interesting to see the biggest TV is probably a 27 inch tube.  Everything is going flat screen now.  There are Television News flashes that show possible nuclear war breakout in Central/South America and Africa...not even a thought of that these days but back in the height of the cold war it could conceivably be only a few years away.<br /><br />My point is that this movie is smart and socially conscious...in a hit-you-over-the-head manner.  You watch the world of Robocop and wonder `my god, is that where we're heading?'.  Even though it seems we can assume we'll never be that disconnected it can definitely make you think, and be more aware of what the world is coming to.<br /><br />But putting the social statement of this movie aside to finish this review, it must be said that Robocop is an enjoyable movie, even today.  There was no attempt to display the technology to great excess, so in turn many of the scenes still hold up as a possible future.  Today a movie like this would be overrun with CG enhancements, many of which you wouldn't see.  Most of the special effects hold up very well, the ED-209 robot being the only exception.  The stop motion animation is probably some of the best ever put on film...but it still looks like a kids home made movie compared to the CGI affects of today.  They could invest some money and overlap a superior CG version over the old one but that would be an insult to the people who worked so hard on the Robot.  I'm sure those people look at it now and cringe.  However the matte paintings used are excellent.  Watching the special features on this 20th anniversary edition, you can really see how much effort is put in NOT in front of a computer.  The picture update is very good and both versions of the film (the theater release and the unrated version with about 2 minutes of extra violence).<br /><br />Peter Weller deserves a lot of praise for learning how to move like a robot.  He studied mime and made the movements very impressive.  The film makers believed you needed a good actor behind the mask for the initial involvement so you can care about this guy first.  As we find out he left a wife and son behind, we get even more involved.  All the other actors are top notch as well, especially Ronny Cox as the control freak CEO, Nancy Allen as his sympathetic but tough partner, and Kurtwood Smith, best known for his role as `Red' on That 70s Show (imagine Red with an ultra violent streak).  Although Director Paul Verhoven has done other movies, this one is most likely his best overall.  After this he moved on to Total Recall, Basic Instinct and then Starship Troopers, which also tried to make social statements similar to this.  But the balance of all elements belongs to the Robocop, giving us a good human story with action, brains and humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>ROBOCOP is a funny, ultra-violent, action, science-fiction film that takes place in the near future and the setting is the city of Detroit. A police officer named Murphy is killed by a vicious gang of drug dealers, but a technology corporation manages to bring him back to life by turning what's left of his body into an unstoppable cyborg that will become the future of law enforcement = ROBOCOP. The Unrated Director's Cut is the only way to see this film: it shows scenes that were cut from the theatrical release in order to avoid an 'X' rating, it has an interesting commentary track from the film's director - writers - and producers, it has two theatrical trailers, storyboards from the film, and a written essay on the making of the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>Some extra features on the making of the film with Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, etc.  Still a wild ride of a film all these years later.  Alot of Phil Tippets stop-motion effects would be CGI today.  This edition contains both the original theatrical edition and the extended unrated version.  The later is considerably more violent -- particularly in the scene where Boddicker's men shoot up Murphy.  Nice performances by Weller (who is now a professor of Roman history at the University of Syracuse, NY), Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith (Red on THAT 70'S SHOW) as the utterly vile Clarence Boddicker, Ray Wise, Ronny Cox -- in the first several coporate villain roles he would play like TOTAL RECALL -- and Miguel Ferrer.</p></br><a href="../users/ABP69F7LFTI1R.html">ABP69F7LFTI1R</a><br/><p>I usually don't care for this type of movie, and as the sequels went on and on it got worse.  But, I really liked this one a lot, the original is always the best.  Anyway, excellent storyline, very different for the time and holds up well, even with todays CGI audiences.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FZA9C5MVIWHE.html">A1FZA9C5MVIWHE</a><br/><p>robocop is explosive from beginning to end. from the very beginning where he is human to where he gets gunned down(the shooting doesn't last very long on DVD as it did on the big screen- that's my only complaint)to where he becomes transformed into robocop and he then exacts revenge on those that killed him and then on dick jones after he gets fired from OCP. this is non-stop action, but also lots of violence and foul language. i would not recommend it to anyone under 13.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>This is the original action packed Robocop.  Through the various TV commercials and news reports that are displayed throughout the film a social comment is made on society showing our in-humane and greedy ways.  Of course this film is extremely violent and shouldn't be viewed by a younger audience, but anyone who can take the carnage will enjoy what this film has to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>After a Detroit police officer (Peter Weller) is sadistically murdered by a group of thugs sometime in the near future, he is resurrected--well, sort of--when his head and brain are used as the CPU of the latest law-enforcement experiment: RoboCop, a high-tech cyborg police officer designed to be impervious to corruption and nearly indestructible.  RoboCop is a very effective law-enforcement tool, but when the thugs that killed him try to thwart the cybernetically revived policeman, their efforts backfire as they inadvertently unlock his repressed humanity and thereby make him an even better cop.  Thus goes the basic plot of 1987's ROBOCOP.<p>Though many filmgoers don't seem to &quot;get it,&quot; ROBOCOP is more than an action or sci-fi flick; it is actually a dark comedy.  Or rather, a darkly humorous satire.  Director Paul Verhoeven and writers Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier take pokes at several American institutions and subcultures, not the least of which are law enforcement, corporate politics, goverment, and mass media. In addition, they satirize a popular science-fiction and comic-book vision of the future, one in which society at large decays to near anarchy while science and private business still manage to crank out high-tech toys.  It could even be argued that, on a broader level, ROBOCOP is a parody of the popular 1970s TV show THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, with RoboCop as a dime-store reflection of the cyborg Steve Austin and corporate lackeys and degenerate street thugs filling in for the various threats to the American way of life.<p>The special FX in ROBOCOP are pretty cool, especially for their time, and the acting is just fantastic.  Die-hard genre fans will no doubt recognize star Peter Weller from 1984's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8th DIMENSION, as well as numerous other sci-fi and horror flicks.  In his performance as the titular character in ROBOCOP, he does a perfect job running the gamut of human emotions as he goes from man to robot to a cyborg who regains his humanity.  The adorable Nancy Allen is very effective as RoboCop's human partner, as she emotes genuine concern when she recognizes the human portion of RoboCop and subsequently helps him to get in touch with his humanity.  Genre fans may recognize her from her supporting role in Brian De Palma's CARRIE (1976) and co-starring roles in 1981's BLOW OUT and 1983's STRANGE INVADERS.  Other good supporting performances are delivered by veteran actors Ronny Cox (1972's DELIVERANCE and 1990's TOTAL RECALL), Kurtwood Smith (Red Forman on TV's THAT '70s SHOW), Miguel Ferrer (the 1994 TV mini-series THE STAND), and Ray Wise (1982's SWAMP THING and TV's TWIN PEAKS).<p>As one would expect from a movie depicting a grim future, ROBOCOP is very violent and there are some pretty gruesome scenes.  Fans of sci-fi action flicks or slasher films will probably not get put off the gruesome killing of Officer Murphy (who becomes RoboCop), and they may actually enjoy the scene where a thug starts melting after getting dowsed with toxic waste.  But the average viewing audience may want to consider the high level of graphic violence when deciding whether or not to view or purchase this film.<p>The no-frills DVD from MGM offers a nice widescreen transfer of the film but no extras.  Still, it's cheap enough that frugal sci-fi fans should grab it up for their collections.  The Criterion Collection DVD offers lots of extras--including a feature commentary from the director and other crew members, trailers and TV spots, and more--but its steep price may deter all but die-hard ROBOCOP fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QNQQKJTL76H0.html">A3QNQQKJTL76H0</a><br/><p>This review is for the Blu-Ray edition. You know about the movie, so I won't rehash the plot.<br /><br />As a Blu-Ray disc, this is mediocre at best. This is no posterboy for the next-gen format. The quality of the transfer is not very good. Lots of grain and not as sharp and clean as you might expect for Blu-Ray. Part of it has to do with the movie begin 20 years old, but this edition was clearly not done with TLC. It's a barebones transfer of the movie.<br /><br />There are **NO** special features. The Special Features menu has two options: the Robocop trailer and Resume Movie. I don't count trailers as special features. Why even put this on the menu? Sort of silly.<br /><br />No audio commentary, nada. WB didn't even include any of the features it already put on the 2 disc 20th Anniversary DVD. They could've just thrown it on here, like most other studios do by putting standard def extras onto Blu-Ray or HD DVD. If you already own the DVD version, I'd say skip this.<br /><br />Buy this edition only if it's part of the BUY 1 GET 1 sale (I did) or if you must own this piece of 80's cultural memorabilia.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XMBWQL0LGNJD.html">A2XMBWQL0LGNJD</a><br/><p>On the cusp of HD, RoboCop gets re-released as a 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD that portends quick obsolescence but you shouldn't let that dissuade you from purchasing this standard def DVD to tide you over until the HD format war has ended. However, it appears that there is a "glitch" more severe than a malfunctioning ED-209 present on Canadian versions of disc 2 with a duplication of disc 1 onto disc 2 and the first copy I purchased here in the US had an authoring glitch that would not allow me to select the DTS or alternate audio tracks on Disc 2.  I can already hear the Old Man yelling "You call this a glitch!?"  If you own the legendary Criterion release featuring the "Extended Cut" you will be pleased to know that the upgrade is well worth getting, though you will probably want to hold on to your original Criterion disc for some of the extras that didn't make the migration over to the new 20th Anniversary disc.<br /><br />Disc 1 features the original theatrical cut in anamorphic 1:85:1 widescreen (The Criterion release was presented in 1:66:1 which is Paul Verhoeven's "preferred" aspect ratio) and Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound but the real treat on this disc is the excellent documentary "Flesh & Steel: The Making of RoboCop" featuring interviews with Paul Verhoeven, Jon Davison, Ed Neumeier, Basil Poledouris, and Peter Weller. There's also a couple of 8-minute 1987 featurettes: "Shooting RoboCop" featuring Miguel Ferrer in character as Bob Morton introducing RoboCop like an OCP publicity gimmick and "Making RoboCop" with a behind-the-scenes look at the production and interviews from back in the day. "The Boardroom" is a storyboard-to-film comparison of ED-209 accompanied with Phil Tippet commentary, 4 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer with music from, appropriately enough, "The Terminator," another cyborg sci-fi smash from Orion Pictures.<br /><br />Disc 2 features the "Extended Cut" in anamorphic widescreen 1:85:1 and Dolby 5.1 and DTS sound which is a phenomenal enhancement over the old Dolby surround mix on the Criterion release and restores :23 seconds of graphically violent shots of ED-209 gunning Mr. Kinny into hamburger in the OCP executive board room, Murphy's hand getting blown-off and his stump spurting blood, and Clarence Boddicker's jugular squirting blood after Robo stabs him in the throat which were edited from the theatrical version to garner an R-rating and have been seamlessly restored back into the film.  Why they couldn't just make this a seamless-branching feature on the same disc as the theatrical version like the Commando Director's Cut DVD and put all of the bonus features on the second disc is puzzling though. Disc 2 also features another outstanding featurette: "Villains of Old Detroit" with new interviews with Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and Ray Wise and is a terrific follow up after watching the film. "Special Effects: Then and Now" talks about the advances in digital compositing versus the in-camera matte shots and stop-motion animation employed on creating ED-209. "RoboCop: Creating a Legend" features interviews with Peter Weller, Paul Verhoeven, Rob Botin, et al. about designing and engineering the suit and took between 10-11 hours each day to fit Peter Weller into before shooting.<br /><br />As Murphy's Law would have it, ironically, I ended up having to return my first copy to the store I purchased it from because I was not able to select the DTS track on disc 2.  The department manager and I tested this on different players and on another copy and confirmed the problem.  Since originally writing this review I have recently obtained another copy from a different retailer and it did not have any of the problems selecting the audio tracks so I must have got one from a bad batch and hopefully it is fairly isolated.  This is also going to be released on Blu-Ray but too bad it won't be a combo disc.  I'd buy that for a dollar.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>**Note:  This review deals with the "Criterion Collection" edition**<p>Still hailed as a sci-fi classic even today (and happens to be one of my personal favorites), "Robocop" is a marvelous and outstanding film.  This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and never get sick of it.  I may not be a big sci-fi buff, but that's one of the great things about this movie; you don't have to be one.<p>"Robocop" takes place in the future where Detroit is plagued with crime and murder.  Cops are threatening to go on strike while crime lords and gangs run amuck.  And when a police officer is brutally murdered by a relentless crime lord and his band of thugs, that's when corporation giant OCP resurrects him and transforms him into the ultimate crime-fighting machine.  In all of it's violent and dark glory, "Robocop" is a film that proves to be both a successful action thriller and a clever satire.<p>I love everything about this movie.  The story, the plot, the characters, everything!  This is one of the few movies that when I pop it in the DVD player and hear the music for the opening titles, I get chills.  It's like seeing it for the first time every time I watch it.  It's very well written and directed.  It also has some terrific acting.  (Who would've thought that the father from "That 70's Show" could prove to be a very effective villain?)  And for an older movie, it has some incredible special effects.<p>Be warned, this is not a movie for people who do not like excessively violent movies.  This one's as violent as they come.  Gun shot wounds, arms and heads getting blown off, people getting shot multiple times... you get the idea.  After all, this is Paul Verhoeven we're talking about (the very man behind "Total Recall," and "Starship Troopers").  So be warned.<p>The version I have is the "Criterion Collection" edition.  It's a shame that this one is so hard to find, because I do think this is the best version out there.  Not only is it loaded with some very cool features, it's also the unrated director's cut that offers a few extra seconds of extra gore in two specific scenes.  (I think it's only two.)  Now, that's not a very big deal and doesn't really add much to the movie, but it is something at least.  And the picture and sound is great.  I am aware that the newer version is supposed to look a lot better than this one, but that DVD doesn't appear to have ANY special features on it.  So I will stick with this one until a better one comes out.  (I have a feeling that a better one will come out in the future.)<p>Some special features included on the Criterion version are storyboards, theatrical and teaser trailers, commentary, film-to-storyboard comparison, and more.  It would've been nice to have a few more extras, but it's not a bad package if you ask me.<p>"Robocop" will forever remain a classic in my eyes.  It's one of the few sci-fi flicks I can watch over and over again.  THIS is the one to see (while #2 wasn't too bad of a movie, the third one is a complete embarrassment).  If you want to see a great sci-fi movie with brains and action, this is the one to experience.<p>In the very wise words of Robocop himself, "Stay out of trouble."</p></br><a href="../users/A2T2MYZEB81NOQ.html">A2T2MYZEB81NOQ</a><br/><p>This is a damn near perfect movie. It has intense fight scenes, wonderful graphics, terrific quotes, and a lot of feeling, danger, evil and determination. Here is how the story goes-There is a new cop on a team in Detroit. His name is Alex J Murphy. Dick Jones, the leader of this cop department, who is actually a bad guy wanting to create cop machines that are really killers. Meanwhile, Anne Lewis and Alex are starting to be friends, when a ruthless and notorious cop killer named Clarence Boddicker is hired by Dick Jones to take Murphy out. With the help of his gang, he succeeds, but Murphy is brought back to life by doctors who make him part man, part machine. He is amazingly strong and almost indestructible, and has all sorts of weapons from guns to hand spikes. He is dubbed Robocop, and in no time proves worthy as he trashes all sorts of criminals, saves all sorts of lives and protects Detroit. However, the memories of Clarence Boddicker and how he took his ordinary life away from him makes Robocop want not only justice for others, but also revenge for himself. He soon finds Clarence after plowing through some of his gang, fights him and arrests him. Clarence gets free, though, and talks to Dick, who he makes a plan with to crush Robocop once and for f**king all. Clarence and his remaining gang attack Robocop and Lewis, who is with him and is the only human he'll listen to, at a large construction site. Soon, most of Clarence's gang is dead, and only he and one more member remain. While Robocop moves in, intent on killing Clarence and ending his menace forever, he is dropped on by a lot of metal bars released by Clarence's last henchman, who gets blown to bits along with the building he's in while he and his boss cheer, by Anne Lewis' rocket launcher, no less. Now, Clarence is on his own, but it seems like that doesn't matter, as he sticks a metal spike into Robocop's chest and injures him badly. However, even if Clarence can fend for himself with weapons, what he did to Robocop is still nothing compared to what Robocop does to him. He extends the spike on his hand I mentioned earlier and to say it nicely Robocop gives Clarence the Hector treatment. After Clarence is destroyed, he takes Anne with him to get medical treatment, and then goes for Dick Jones at the police headquarters. After revealing Dick's betrayal, Robocop can't attack as Dick threatens an old but important bossman with a gun and will kill him unless given an escape helicopter. But the old man and Robocop have the last laugh. Despite his age, the man's in good shape and he breaks Dick's hold and says: "You're fired!" And so, Dick Jones meets his demise as Robocop fills him full of bullets and he crashes out a window, falling thousands of feet to the rock hard pavement. Robocop tells the others he is Murphy and the movie ends. This is among the best movies I have ever seen. It gets a solid and gold 10 out of 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes fighting films.</p></br><a href="../users/A12A8LU93A132U.html">A12A8LU93A132U</a><br/><p>A fairly weak Criterion Collection DVD. The storyboard to film comparison, compares a storyboard to the actual scenes shot in the first scene with ED-209. Who cares how it compared? They looked the same to me. Two  storyboards of scenes never shot are included. The first is a long action  sequence that was to come before the final shoot-out at the factory that I  found interesting. The second a sequence of Robocop going to Murphy's grave  that was cut in favor of the scene where Robocop goes to the database  center. This unshot storyboard is very short, boring and could have been  excluded. The illustrated essay is a lot of reading. This is something that  should have been a documentary or even an interview. If I wanted to read  about the movie, I'd buy a book about it. Finally the commentary is a sound  mix of the director, writer, producer and others. It gives interesting  views on making, writing and producing the film. The commentary is the only  redeeming value of this DVD. The director, for example, gives his view on  the symbolism to Christ he was trying to impart. Who knew this wasn't a  simple action flick? Overall, for the money, I'd stick with the standard  DVD unless this was a movie that is on your all-time favorite list.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>Robocop(1987) is a classic, action packed sci-fi film. It's also packed with social satire and dark humor. This is the strongest of the three Robocop movies. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven(Spetters, Soldier of Orange) does a superb job directing the film. Alex Murphy(Peter Weller) is killed by criminals in a run down, dystopian, futuristic Detroit. State of the art cybernetics resurrect him as a crime fighting robot police officer. Nancy Allen is very good as Anne Lewis, Robocop's partner. She's sexy, robust, and convincing as a tough, sympathetic woman. I am glad I didn't watch Carrie(1976) first!<br />Kurtwood Smith(That 70's Show, Star Trek) is effective as low life crime boss Clarence Boddicker. Ronny Cox is good as a corrupt OCP executive and Miguel Ferrer plays a corrupt, ego-driven, Frankenstein-like creator of the Robocop Program.<br />Robocop takes place in the not-too-distant future, but it spoofs the 1980's era it was made in. When I saw Robocop on TV, the violence and foul language was heavily censored. The late Basil Poledouris wrote a superb music score for Robocop. It's driven by synthesizers, but sounds more symphonic as Robocop slowly becomes human again. I remember TV spots for Robocop action figures for children. Wasn't Robocop an R-rated movie? Nevermind. Robocop spawned two sequels, a live action TV show, an animated TV show, a mini-series on the Sci-Fi Channel, and some weird TV spot in Korea where Robocop tried to eat fried chicken! Crow from Mystery Science Theater 3000 once poked fun of Robocop's nemesis, ED-209("They can't make a robot that can walk down stairs?"). Robocop is a keeper.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>This movie still holds up. It is great fun and extremely violent. The villians are just about as slimey, hateful and evil as they come. Ronnie Cox is great in a turn from his usual nice guy roles of the past.

Sid intended to do two things tonight, laugh and watch a great unintentional comedy. Well, Sid always has a good time, but there was not a passable unintentional comedy in sight.<br /><br />Robocop is based on an effemine Chris Hansen looking cop, who gets blasted, then transformed into a cyborg cop. So, eventually, he goes after the guys who killed him and turned into a metal man. In the business they call that a revenge story. Well, here's the revenge Robocop exacted until the last 15 minutes of the movie: he arrested the bad men. Wow, enthraling! Really, Sid was riveted. Then, they had to make this movie even girlier by making Robocop fall in love with his butch partner, who looked like Sid's sophomore year biology teacher. For those of you who did not graduate from North Pole High, that's not good.<br /><br />So, if your woman is looking for a chick flick with a little action, rent Robocop and put it on in one room.

We know that they are separate entities, but we can not look at one without thinking of the other.  This is one of the main premises of the movie, what makes us who we are.  Robocop is told that he is simply Robocop and is given his order, but he finds that his identity is not dependent on the mechanical body or the feelings.  <p>You can't think of this movie without the background.

And now, the classic sci-fi/action film gets the proper Special Edition treatment it so richly deserves (the out of print Criterion Collection DVD is actually superior, but good luck finding it).  As far as the movie goes, we all know by now what happens: Peter Weller plays the slain cop turned police cyborg that seeks to avenge his death against the criminals (both street and corporate level) responsible.  The DVD itself features both the R-rated theatrical cut of the film, as well as the "extended" uncut edition of the film (also available on the Criterion DVD) which originally received an X-rating in 1987.  There isn't much difference between both cuts; only a few more seconds of bloody splatter, but it's the features which make this DVD set worth owning.  Featurettes on the making of and history of the film with interviews with director Paul Verhoeven, producer Jon Davison, and stars Weller, Kurtwood Smith, Miguel Ferrer, and more; as well as looks at the special effects, and the Criterion commentary from Verhoeven, Davison, and writer Ed Neumeier.  All in all, this is one DVD that is worth buying over again if you already own the bare bones edition disc, and it's good to see that the film finally gets the mass DVD treatment it so rightfully deserves.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ.html">A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ</a><br/><p>One of the finest science fiction films of the 1980's, in fact one of the finest Hollywood films of the 1980's, 'Robocop' is a dark, extremely violent satire on all kinds of things, most notably television and big  business. Featuring a mixture of hot military hardware, and a self-mocking  tone that makes you slightly ashamed to be enjoying the hot military  hardware, it's probably Paul Verhoven's finest 80 minutes, and spawned two  of the most dismal sequels since 'Grease 2' and the one that came after  'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid', you know - the 'prequel'.<p>On DVD,  it's tops - one-time Laser Disc specialists Criterion know what they're  doing. The picture and sound quality is excellent, and the extra bits are  extremely good - a set of amusing storyboards (which are presented in a  dynamic fashion - you get to watch somebody jiggling the paper around as  ED209 blows away a hapless executive), and some extra violence are the  stand-outs.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Robocop is a leading contender in the &quot;Most violent movie ever made&quot; sweepstakes.  With that warning in mind, those who are still willing to indulge (and those who can stomach the gore) will find a bleakly  funny, savage, snorting sci-fi behemoth which represents, along with Total  Recall, Paul Verhoeven's filmmaking peak.  (And now on to Basic Instinct  and Showgirls...)<p>I've done a comparison of the screenplay to this one  and the final product.  My verdict is that Verhoeven really pushed the  right buttons in the changes he made.  The Clarence/Robocop showdown is  excellently filmed and staged, the characterization on the money (Nancy  Allen's tough lady cop and Peter Weller's arrow-straight family man turned  metal giant are well matched).  Don't forget the humour as well:  &quot;I'd  buy that for a dollar&quot;; ED-209's humiliating blunders; Kurtwood  Smith's gleeful sleaze.<p>But it's longtime Verhoeven favourite Ronny Cox  who impressed me the most in this and Total Recall.  He finds the  complexities in his villain roles, never quite lapsing into megalomania  even when he's shouting and making villainous threats, finding the human  motivations behind the worst of villains.<p>Excellent set design, special  effects and dialogue round off this apocalyptic late-'80s masterpiece.  Make yourself a cast-iron stomach, take a deep breath and dive in.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>First time I've ever watched this movie, and I only watched it cos I got it as a Christmas present. I was surprised how good it was! OK, it's a bit slow to start with, and I was getting slightly annoyed with the constant TV news clips.<p>I got the box set of the trilogy, and found there were two versions of the film to watch - the theatrical version and the director's cut. Which isn't something you often see on DVDs. Of course, I chose the director's cut, and regretted it. My dad had seen the original, so he was noticing the bits that weren't in the original. And I couldn't look at the screen, especially when Murphy was getting shot to smithereens. It was so graphic! You can see why it was probably sliced when it went to the cinemas. I didn't really notice what else was maybe sliced out. <p>Nancy Allen also stars in this. It took me a while to place her, as she a very severe, bad 80s haircut in this, but when I did place her, I couldn't believe it! It's Chris Hargensen from Carrie! The bad girl who pulled the rope on the bucket of blood. <p>Towards the end, you also see Robocop take off his headgear, which I hated, due to the fact that his face is so stretched! Ugh. Not a pretty sight. <p>I've always heard this film compared to Terminator. It is slightly. I found myself sympathising and feeling sorry for Robocop, the same way I did with the Terminator (mainly in the second &amp; third movies though). Robocop evokes the same feelings in you that happened during Terminator - if you don't have a heart of stone that is.<p>The action only really starts towards the end of the movie, and you feel so sorry as you watch Robocop have flashbacks of his previous life etc. But after watching the first one, I'm glad I have the second one to watch when I feel like it - I've been told bad things about the final in the trilogy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>A couple of words on this DVD edition.<p>Though this is the &quot;director's cut&quot; of the film, I find the theatrical version superior.  The excised material is extremely violent, but that's not why  they don't work as well -- after all, ultraviolence is a motif in this  film.  The extra two, three shots of &quot;Mr. Kinney' being shot even  after he's sprawled on the table are actually funny (if excessively gory),  but the Murphy death scene is actually hurt by the extra material.  The  original scene was already highly arresting; the extra shots of Murphy  screaming, his arm being blown off, and the loving close-up on the hand  actually took some of the momentum from the sequence (while upping the  sadistic factor).  The worst part, though, is that the extra shots of  Murphy's shooting pointed out the poor sound editing in the sequence:  During the reaction shots on Emil, Clarence and Joe, you don't hear  Murphy's moans, making the shots on Murphy and the shots on the crooks seem  like they're in two different worlds.  And the virtuoso 180-degree dolly on  Murphy before Clarence shoots him in the head?  That slowed down the pace  and didn't offer much that was new.<p>Other than that (thankfully the  &quot;restored footage&quot; only applied to two scenes), this DVD edition  is great -- with Criterion's usual care for production history, commentary  tracks (Verhoeven and Neumeier sound awfully interesting, pointing out the  potential &quot;silliness&quot; of the script in its development stages),  and extra options, you can't lose.  I *did* experience two glitches when I  got this DVD, but hopefully those weren't across-the-board defects that  occur on every copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Generally I'm not a fan of the work of director Paul Verhoeven.  He seems to wallow in the decadent and take a bleak world-view, particularly as it pertains to the United States.  "Robocop" contains a number of Verhoeven's favorite themes but there are a number of redeeming features that elevates it above his normal fare.  First off, it is deliciously darkly comic.  The special effects and sound editing are superb.  Ronny Cox as a corporate shark and Kurtwood Smith as a hired thug give outstanding villainous turns.  What ultimately redeems this film, though, are the humane performances of Peter Weller as Alex Murphy a.k.a Robocop and Nancy Allen as his partner.  Weller in particular shines because he is not only called upon to act with heavy body armor on but also make his character sympathetic.  It is debatable whether "Robocop" is classic sci-fi but it is terrifically entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I remember seeing this back in 2005 when I rented the Criterion edition and watched it one night. I loved it so much that I went to buy it and it was out of print! The only DVD at the time was the bare-bones MGM DVD, which had good picture and sound, but no special features, which is COMPLETELY unnaceptable. I did not buy it, and I stand by my decision, because I saw this steelbook 20th Anniversary Edition at HMV the other day, which I bought. I stand by my decision to buy this DVD!<br /><br />This should be the PERMANENT DVD of this classic movie. I am glad I own it, it's the best DVD in my house right now. Disc one has the theatrical cut, and disc two has the uncut version, which is what the Criterion had... except this is better. This one makes it hard to figure what is restored, leaving you to watch the theatrical to find out what was cut. The special features are great, worthy of the price. Great featurettes, and the commentary is damn cool.<br /><br />Finally, this is the DVD that gives Robocop the treatment it deserves. Those who ae hoping to own this classic gem on DVD in it's true and uncut form, buy it now!</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>Before director Paul Verhoeven gave us the ultra gory and special effects laden &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; in the 1990s, he lensed the gritty 1987 movie &quot;Robocop.&quot; Verhoeven, of course, never limited himself to producing science fiction gorefests; he also made the controversial &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and, more importantly, carries most of the blame for &quot;Showgirls.&quot; The latter film would have permanently ended a lesser director's career, but not Verhoeven. He's still gamely making interesting pictures. &quot;Robocop&quot; may have been his first real success story; fans love the first film, many critics adored it when it came out, and no less of a company than Criterion decided to give it a spectacular release on DVD. Sadly, I did not get a chance to view the Criterion disc; I had to settle instead for the lesser MGM treatment. If you want to see &quot;Robocop&quot; with all the trimmings, seek out the Criterion Collection DVD. It has tons of extras including most of the footage originally cut from the theatrical release in order to avoid the notorious 'X' rating for violence. Still, if you cannot find a Criterion disc, go ahead and check out the MGM one anyway. &quot;Robocop&quot; is such a fun movie, such a hilarious social satire about the greed of the 1980s, that even watching it on television is preferable to not seeing it at all.<p>Verhoeven sets his film in a disturbing near future Detroit where corporations have assumed most of the functions of civil society. Big business runs, for example, city police departments. The suits on the top floors fund crime prevention measures at the same time they market new products. One corporation in Detroit called OCP, sick of rampant crime and looking for a way to level a large part of the city in order to build a huge complex of buildings, starts researching new and innovative weapons to battle the anarchy rapidly taking over the city. One way to accomplish this feat is to remove human beings from patrol duty. Who wants to explain why dozens of cops die every week in violent shootouts with criminal gangs? Who needs the bad PR from such unseemly events? Not OCP. If the company can develop a robot to do the dirty work, costs will drop, profits will go up, and everyone will bask in the glow of a job well done. There is one big problem with the new programs--they don't work. Try as they might, the company keeps coming up with one expensive failure after another. After the latest model turns one of the corporation's executives into swiss cheese in the boardroom, an up and coming suit gets his big break from the boss. Fortunately for this greedy little runt, Officer Alex Murphy happens to die in the line of duty while trying to bring down one of the biggest crime bosses in the city.<p>&quot;Robocop&quot; takes off from this point, as the corporation turns Murphy into a mean looking cyborg, an armor plated automaton capable of blowing off the bad guys' heads as easily as he can create good PR for the company by making televised appearances at local schools. Heck, this huge mechanized cop can even drive a car, speak to people, and survive withering gunfire. Problems emerge when Robocop starts to regain memories of his former life, recollections of his wife and child, his female partner, and the bad guys who blew him away. When the cyborg launches a campaign to bring his killers to justice, the corporation that created him turns ugly. It seems a few suits have a several nasty secrets better left hidden, and Robocop's quest for justice threatens to bring to light things that could ruin careers. Soon the cops and the criminals are gunning for the confused cyborg in a series of chases and shootouts loaded with over the top violence and extreme gore. Will Robocop get his man in the end? Will he reconcile his human memories with his robotic exterior? Who knows, but finding out is a lot of fun.<p>One thing you might notice about &quot;Robocop&quot; is Verhoeven's vision about corporation politics. His take on big business in the 1980s is uniformly cynical as he constructs a world where the boardroom is no better than the conflicts taking place outside on the mean streets. The top floors of OCP seethe with violent conflicts as department heads jockey for position with the boss in order to promote their own agendas. Murder, conspiracy, drug use, and a host of other anti-social behaviors inform the daily activities of the company's managing elite. Is &quot;Robocop&quot; Verhoeven's way of taking a slap at the lack of business ethics in the 1980s? Of course! If a commentary on how to run an evil corporation leaves you cold, however, you can always enjoy the great performances. Miguel Ferrar conveys sleazy here like no one else in the movie world. Ronny Cox, when summoned to play a baddie, rarely fails to deliver a memorable turn. Peter Weller does Murphy/Robocop in a way that draws real emotion. Nancy Allen takes her role as Murphy's caring partner seriously even though the film doesn't really do much with her. One of my favorites, Kurtwood Smith, plays the slimy crime boss Clarence Boddicker with enthusiastic gusto. <p>I hate to harp, but you really should try to find the Criterion DVD version of this film. That disc has a commentary from Verhoeven and a bunch of other interesting stuff. The MGM release pales in comparison, as anyone who has ever viewed a MGM disc knows anyway. Still, you do get most of the super gory scenes--Murphy's death sequence, the toxic sludge bath, and the arterial puncture scene--in their partial glory. If you liked &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and you haven't watched &quot;Robocop&quot; yet, now is the time to get moving.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>Kudos to Paul Verhoeven for doing this flick.  He really didn't go the safe route with this one, which would have been an easy play due to it's comic book subject matter.  You could have done a PG-13 with this one.  Nosiree, Bob!  Verhoeven likes to spit in the face of Hollywood and makes flicks down and dirty, the way he likes.  It's interesting to go back and watch this film after not seeing it for a long time.  Talk about violent!  Hard to believe they made a cartoon, tv series and action figure line based on this.  This isn't really for kids if you ask me.  The Criterion version restores violence trimmed by our pals at the MPAA in case the R version wasn't violent enough for you already.  The cut scenes consist of bits in the first hal hour of the movie.  It all probably adds up to 40 seconds total, but those 40 or so seconds add a new dimension to the scene though it doesn't really  add depth to the story at all.  I'll tell you what you're missing so you can ponder it before you invest in this edition.  1)  The scene where ED-209 is introduced to the board, malfunctions and kills a guy.  Remember that?  It's basically the same except there's a few more seconds of ED blasting that poor schmuck after he has fallen down(and obviously dead).  Gruesome!  Fun!  The other cut material is Murphy's death scene.  When Clarence blasts his hand off with the shotgun(&quot;Give the man a hand!&quot;), you actually see Murphy holding the bloody stump.  Icky!  Fun!  Remember after that, all three gang members shoot him a million times while he shakes and yells?  Well, the very first shot completely takes his arm off.  That would explain how his arm magically disappeared in the R version.  Then, they stop shooting him for a moment and let Murphy sit there and scream in pain as one of the gang says in amusement:  &quot;Hey, Clarence!  He's still alive!&quot;  A few more bloody snippets follow of Murphy's murder, but that's pretty much it for the censored stuff.  Either way this is a great movie.  Even with the corny name and concept, this manages to be an emotional, thought provoking, satirical, well written, well directed movie.  Watch it again, you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Peter Weller is excellent as the nearly indestructible title character in Robocop, and the direction by Verhoeven in this sci-fi shoot-'em-up is equally effective, but it's the brilliantly twisted humor in the script by Edward Neumeier, and Michael Miner that make this film more than just another TERMINATOR clone movie, and even though the action is almost non-stop, the satirical asides ( such as the television ads for the 'family game' called NUKE 'EM, and the latest in car theft protection ) are deliciously warped. This is definitely a 'guy' pic, but what a great one it is!</p></br><a href="../users/A2BQBLCKJHP65G.html">A2BQBLCKJHP65G</a><br/><p>Back in 1987, I was a fresh High School graduate who already had a vast knowledge of modern day cinema within the Horror and Science Fiction fields. But in that same year I had heard through the grapevine that the company that had released the classic The Terminator was about to unleash another robotic film but with a character on the good side of the Law. And it's title was Robocop. Robocop? Man that sounds corny, my younger self thought. That is until I saw the teaser poster of this half man/half machine getting out of his squadcar, and after that I couldn't wait to see if this film could rival what Orion Pictures accomplished three years earlier with the shaded Arnold.<br /><br />I was not disapointed.<br /><br />To put it simply, Robocop was a masterpiece of late 80's Sci-Fi filmmaking. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, at the time an obscure foreign director with a few cult classics under his belt, and starring Peter Weller, who already had an underground classic Sci-Fi film "Buckaroo Banzai Across The 8th Dimension" on his resume, Robocop features Weller as Officer Alex Murphy, a family-man Detroit cop who thanks to the corruption of a weak police force now owned by an evil corporation by the name of OCP, gets gunned down and killed during the line of duty. However, OCP has been toying with the idea of using robotic ways to rule over crime, but with disastrous results in the machine ED-209 created by OCP executive Dick Jones (a surprisingly casted Ronny Cox). But up-and-comer Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) feels his design of half-man/half machine might work better for the project, and since when Murphy joined the force signed all his rights over to OCP, and was already dead, to make him the project's first creation. And thus RoboCop was born. Along the way Robo stops crime dead in it's path, becomes self-aware of the life that is now no longer his, runs into the gang that killed him in the first place, and tries to end the hidden conspiracy within OCP once and for all.<br /><br />Where The Terminator successfully gave us an 80's robot film, it had no heart and soul like the one provided in RoboCop. Murphy/Robo is a hero, full of tangled emotions and an obsession of upholding the Law. Sprinkled throughout is a wonderful sense of humor that it seemed only Verhoeven could provide at the time. There truly isn't one part of Robocop that drags or lets you down. From it's funny modern-day News inserts to it's parodying of it's own Reagan-era greed, Robocop is one film that never gets old and after twenty-years still holds up to today, all without any use of CGI through the special effects of Matte Paintings, Costumes, and Stop-Motion Animation. It's been on DVD several times, through companies like Criterion and MGM, but for it's Twentieth Anniversary MGM pulled out all the stops with an edition that blows away any one before it (including Criterion).<br /><br />Originally housed in a Steelbook casing (current versions come in a standard keep-case with booklet and middle leaf), Robocop 20th Anniversary is a two-disc set featuring two complete versions of the movie, the theatrical and the directors cut extended. To be honest, the difference in time between the two is less than 30 seconds. But within those lost pieces are even more violent graphicness that Verhoeven couldn't get away with the MPAA at the time. It's surprising he got away with what he did because either way, Robocop is one bloody thrill ride. Strangely though, MGM decided to put the theatrical on one disc and the extended on the other, which for a disc released in 2007 seems excessive thanks to modern-day DVD branching that could of had both versions on the same disc. Because of this, it's special features are spread between the two, but these features are definitely worth the purchase alone, and I'm happy to switch discs to see them all. Along with a new entertaining commentary with the crew (a different recording than used on Criterion's), RoboCop 20th also has over twelve new and old featurettes totalling over two hours long. Along with two original 1987 port-over behind-the-scenes & featurettes, four deleted scenes (shot on video for dumping to film as more News inserts), there's also five 2007 new featurettes ranging from a wonderful reflection of making the movie, a great combined interview of the bad guys of the film, and a quaint look-back of how all the now-outdated matte painting and stop-motion effects were created by the original artists today. These alone make this version truly the only version to own. Interviews with Paul Verhoeven, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer, Ray Wise, and Robocop himself Peter Weller give great and insightful details what it was like being on this set. Not to mention that this version's print is even more remastered than what Criterion or MGM has provided in the past. Skin-tones and black levels have never looked better, all while retaining it's grainy mid-80's filmstock look. Audio is provided in a variety of ways including the original 4.0 mix and a new 5.1 both standard and DTS. In fact, for those that have jumped on the Blu-Ray bandwagon consider that the BD version only has the extended version, the commentary, and a trailer leaving all these great featurettes behind, so if that shouldn't be against the Law, nothing is.<br /><br />In conclusion, Robocop 20th Anniversary is a must own for Sci-Fi/Action fans of any age. An amazing and original story with some of the best practical special effects ever captured on film, it will entertain future generations to come. While the original never got toppled by it's two medicore sequels and 90's television series, those will never take away from what Murphy gave us in the first place. Highly, highly recommeded.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:9.0/10)</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>In the near-future Detroit becomes so plagued by crime that the police resort to Robocop (Peter Weller), a cyborg police officer, in order to clean up the streets. However, Robocop, who has the mind of a human police officer who was killed in the line of duty, is plagued by nightmares of his death and is compelled to seek out the men who "killed" him and avenge his own death.<br /><br />After watching "Robocop", I mentioned it to a friend of mine, who told me that he had never really wanted to see this film because he always thought it looked kind of ridiculous. To be honest, up until a week ago, that's exactly how I felt about it too. However, after recently watching "Starship Troopers" and falling madly in love with it, I found myself seeking out other films directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Ed Neumeier, no matter how bad they might seem, which inevitably led me to their earlier collaboration "Robocop".<br /><br />Yes, "Robocop" is a ridiculous film, but that's the whole point of it. "Robocop" is a far-fetched and ultra-violent satire of law-enforcement and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Between "Robocop" and "Starship Troopers", Paul Verhoeven is rapidly ascending the list of my favourite directors. He is an A-list director who takes B-grade material and turns it into grade-A final product. What is not to admire about this man? (OK, I have haven't seen "Showgirls", but I suspect that would answer my question).<br /><br />"Robocop" is an incredibly violent film (even more so if you watch the director's cut), which may upset some viewers, but to me the violence just added to the fun. It's not disturbing or disgusting, it's just over-the-top and adds to the satire. If you're the sort of person who considers over-the-top violence to be an acceptable form of entertainment, then you'll love "Robocop".</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>This version of Robocop on DVD for region 4 (Australia) is titled Robocop: Definitive Edition. So, if you do not have this version, there is not much point to reading this review.<br /><br />I wont review the movie, I have already done that for another DVD release version.<br /><br />What I do wan't to point out is that if you do have the previous Special Edition (region 4 release) then don't bother with this release of Robocop, as it only has about 3 or 4 things on it in the bonus features that where not included in the original release here.<br /><br />This edition is great for those in region 1 (USA/Canada) because the bonus features where not included in the original Robocop DVD release, where as here in Australia we had the special edition that was filled with extras and the directors cut on the SAME SINGLE DISC!!!!<br /><br />This version they have sliced the DVD in half and put it onto 2 discs, with one disc having the original theatrical movie, and the second showing the extended cut. So, if you have the original special edition that had both versions of the movie on the one disc, and are not obsessed enough with the film to want 5 minutes of bonus features you might not have seen before, then don't think you are missing out on anything, the special edition is the better of the two.<br /><br />It is cheaper for MGM to make two discs then use a slightly more expensive disc and pack it all onto the one disc. So don't think a two disc edition sounds better and has more features, cause it does not have very much else on it at all. They are just a few interviews with the actors who played villains in the film and they talk about a few things that might interest you if you really want to know... other wise, like i said, keep the Special Edition.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>In a dark, not-so-far-off-nor-far-fetched time, Detroit is a violent wonderland of criminal activity. Murphy (Peter Weller) and Lewis (Nancy Allen) are partners in a police force under siege. While sneaking into the hideout of some particularly bloodthirsty and disgusting badguys, led by the reprehensible Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), Murphy is captured, tortured, shot full of holes, and left for dead. This scene is rather disturbing to watch (much like Verhoeven's brain-sucking scene in "Starship Troopers"). Murphy survives, only to become the latest experiment in crime prevention under the control of a mega-corporation called OCP (Omni Consumer Products). He becomes ROBOCOP. His body destroyed, he now has a mechanical one, and is a walking weapon of mass destruction! He sets out to clean up the streets and uphold justice. Unfortunately, the scientists forgot that he was human, and robocop is haunted by memories of his wife and son. He also remembers those who mutilated him. This sets up one of the best revenge films I've ever seen. ROBOCOP uncovers the sinister secrets of OCP's #2 man (Ronny Cox) and must do battle with the ED-209, an earlier robotic crimefighter design with heavy-duty guns and missiles. This battle is ferocious! ROBOCOP is a gruesome tale. However, it also has lots of humor to offset the grim storyline. Verhoeven's portrayal of the media as a blood-circus and vacuous wasteland is pretty accurate, even though he was doing a parody of it. I highly recommend ROBOCOP to all sci-fi / action / black humor fans out there...</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Robocop is over 20 years old and even today many people will profess to loving this film, no matter what their age. This is one of the only films that I can sincerely say I can watch over and over again from start to finish and never get bored.<br /><br />The OCP (Omni Consumer Products) have been handed control of the local law enforcement of Detroit and their aim is to eradicate gang crime before construction begins on Delta City. A mega city that is set to bring Detroit into the present and make it a bustling metropolis. A presentation takes place at an OCP board meeting of a new crime fighting prototype, ED-209. The presentation goes horribly wrong as it executes a member of the board. Seeing this crisis, the young brash executive Bob Morton seizes his opportunity and pitches to the CEO the idea of Robocop for which the CEO accepts his proposal.<br />A newly assigned officer to the West Metro Precinct, Alex Murphy is sent out on his first assignment with his partner Anne. The pair are called to follow a van that is believed to have been involved in an armed robbery. The pair end up following the van to an old, abandoned steel mill and they discover it's the holdout for the most ruthless gang Detroit has seen. Murphy ends up alone in this steel mill with guns pointed at him and the leader of the gang, Clarence Boddicker wants him blown to pieces. They unload shots in to his chest and blow off one of his arms and ultimately leave him for dead.<br />In the hospital Murphy is pronounced dead and that gives Bob Morton his volunteer for the Robocop prototype. When Robocop is first introduced to the criminals, he makes an impact as he becomes simply unstoppable. Through flashbacks from his previous life as Murphy, Robocop goes looking for the people that killed him and tore apart his family. This leads him to untangle a web of corruption and deceit that is something that becomes quite emotional.<br /><br />This film is definitely something special and the cast for each role are perfect in every way. Peter Weller at the time was a relatively unknown actor but this is the type of career where one movie can be a man's biggest triumph. To some this would seem like a failed career, but to others Robocop being your biggest movie and becoming remembered through time as the actor who played Robocop that's something to be proud of. The real gem of a character in this film is Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. He plays the typical hard arsed individual who shows no remorse and no compassion, even for those who are part of his own gang. This is something that Kurtwood should be proud of and he gives us a character that I found to be truly menacing.<br /><br />All in all this is a spectacular film that I will always love and will always play a part in my Blu-Ray collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A157XTSMJH9XA4.html">A157XTSMJH9XA4</a><br/><p>Plot: Officer Murphy runs into a nasty confrontation with a criminal gang lead by ruthless killer and druglord Clarence Boddicker while on duty in the rough city of Detroit. The gang ends up blowing him to pieces limb by limb and leaves him for dead. He might seem to be just another unfortunate casulaty in the war on crime, but the local police force has a secret plan for his remains. They build the ultimate crimefighter: Robocop, a half human half machine cyborg programmed for justice. Yet while crime rate does take a plunge, there is an even bigger conspiracy going on behind closed doors that is linked with the very string of criminals they are pretending to protect the city against. Now it is up to Robocop to put an end to the corruption and restore order to the citizens. Of course, that's going to be a difficult job with Boddicker back on his tail with more determination than ever.<br /><br />Robocop is undeniably a classic action flick. And it's easy to see why. Most notably, it's got what everybody wants in a film like this: lots of action. I had forgotten just how to-the-point and nonstop the action is here. Not to mention some amazing special effects and makeup work. The graphicness of the violence is about as extreme as one can get if he's wanting to stay with a realistic approach. And it works beautifully. Which moves my point on to one of my favorite aspects of the movie: Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. The character it so delighfully heartless that it actually adds a dark charisma to him. And I doubt the effect of it would have been as gripping as it was if it hadn't have been for Smith's wonderful acting. Peter Mullen, who plays Murphy/Robocop, is also an obviously superb choice in casting. He's believable and easy to sympathize with, which is an important thing for this storyline. And I think that's one of the best parts about Robocop: it's message. Arguably one of the greatest revenge stories ever to hit the screen, I don't think anyone can overlook the power behind it. After all that Murphy had been through, even despite having his memory tampered with, his previous life and very identity discarded like a piece of trash, the last line says it all. When Robocop is asked what his name is, he simply replies, "Murphy".<br /><br />Full of satire regarding how desensitized society has and will become towards crime and despicable human behavior, Robocop will strike some as a heroic return to basic morals and much-needed justice. But even if you're not looking to be preached to, these things are subtle and only support in an underlying way what this film has come to be known as. The perfect example of a kickass action flick! And as for the MGM edition DVD (which is the one I own) you won't even care it's not the Criterion director's cut. Most people make it sound like the uncut version is much gorier, but one viewing of this DVD will convince you that those differences are so small that there's no need to go out of your way to pick up the expensive and out of print Criterion version. It may only have a few trailers as it's extras, but by all means this edition is a perfect buy for anyone who wants to own the movie. It has a crystal clear print and great audio. So pick it up and enjoy the timeless experience of every action fan's dream: Robocop!</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>A fallen police officer gets a chance for some serious payback in the 1987 Sci-Fi favorite "Robocop". In the near future, the city of Detroit is under financial ruin and violent crimes have overwhelmed the city's struggling police department. On the first day of his new assignment, police officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is gunned down by dangerous criminals but is rebuilt as a lethal law-enforcement cyborg by the multinational corporation Omni Consumer Products to eradicate the criminal elements of the city. "Robocop" is a rousing futuristic thrill ride that stands the test of time. Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instincts & Total Recall) delivers a slick and well crafted story, non-stop action, fine performances and sharp social satire. The 1987 futuristic actioner also stars Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer and Daniel O'Herlihy. "Robocop" spawned two sequels, comic books, video games, action figures, two animated series, a short-lived live action series and a four-part television miniseries.<br /><br />"Robocop" 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition comes fully loaded for fans of the 1987 Sc-Fi favorite. The 2-disc DVD contains both the R-Rated theatrical release and the extended uncensored version. Both versions are presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is quite good with little noticeable grain. Both 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks offer an enjoyable home theater experience. Among supplemental material, the DVD contains the "Flesh and Steel: The Making of Robocop" documentary, several behind-the-scenes featurettes, theatrical trailer, TV spot, picture gallery, deleted scenes and an in-depth audio commentary with director Paul Verhoeven and production crew. Overall, "Robocop" 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition gets an "A-".</p></br><a href="../users/A2LR4NR0G8KO7C.html">A2LR4NR0G8KO7C</a><br/><p>This is one of my all time favourites! Paul Verhoeven is at his best here! This movie could have easily have turned out into a smooth Hollywood production, but Verhoeven managed to squeeze in a lot of his dark sense of humor somehow. This is adding a real extra dimension to the movie. The movie is situated in a possible future Detroit where the police is privately owned (!) by a company called OCP. OCP now has a plan to call a halt to crime: the Robocop project. All they now need is a "volunteer".<br />Peter Weller was brilliantly cast as Robocop as he basically talks like a robot by nature already. However Kurtwood Smith delivers the best performance here. His role of psychotic gangleader Clarence Boddicker really rocks! Go and watch this<br />as this movie proves, that action movies do not necessarily<br />have to be stupid.(SARR)</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Along with the Terminator this was the best scifi action film to come out during the 1980's.  Though Peter Weller didn't become a household name, he does an excellent job as a murdered police officer, who is resurrected as a type of cyborg programmed to fight crime.  As "Robocop" he dispenses justice with computer controlled pinpoint shooting accuracy.<br /><br />There is a lot of camp (some of it is extremely funny) which does nothing to diminish the serious drama of the film.  Nancy Allen does a good job as Robocop's partner and look for the guy from That 70's Show as the evil villian.</p></br></body></html>

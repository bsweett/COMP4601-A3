Sadly, though, there are too many missed opportunities for character growth and plot for this movie to truly rise above an "average" categorization.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "MI3" sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) called back to the IMF one more time to save a fellow agent (played by Keri Russell).  When that operation uncovers international villain Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt is drawn into the chase in more ways than one when his wife-to-be Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is drawn into the plot as well.<br /><br />In terms of action/gadgets/technology/freneticism, this movie likely has what you are looking for.  The nonstop action rivals anything that, say, a "Bourne" or Jason Statham flick could ever produce, and the visuals are stunning and slick.  For those only looking for action/adventure going in, there's no reason to be disappointed.<br /><br />At the same time, however, two fatal flaws exist in this film:<br /><br />First, the characters are mighty weak.  Monaghan (though perfectly built for her role) is only "the girl to be saved", Hoffman is a terrible villain, and the script doesn't really give Cruise all that much of an opportunity to grow.<br /><br />Second, the plot (while twisty/turny) is nothing that spy fans haven't seen countless times before.  The names/places/dates may have been changed, but pretty much everything else is stock fare for espionage flicks.<br /><br />Overall, then, while JJ did polish up this franchise a bit, I felt that he didn't buff out enough of the imperfections to make it a truly great film.  Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it to rocket atop any "best of" lists.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Profound analysis of the relationship between diplomacy and (military) strategy, between overt and covert activity, between the American Way and Some Foreign Ways of Protecting Themselves have to be  left at the door to enjoy this film. Since this is the third in the series, most viewers apprehend that fact and sit down to enjoy what they DID come to see: Spectacular Action, lots of stunts and stirring feats of daring, on  the one hand, and, spectacular nastiness from the Bad Guys. This film provides a full measure of WHAM and BANG, possibly better than its two predecessors. It also provides a neat way of getting rid of enemies, the fatal headache. There is more than a bit of suspense as we know from the beginning that the heroes wife has been snatched to serve as Ransom for what some of the Evil Doers want from the Hero. I must admit I did not keep straight the double triple crosses, the deviousness of Government, and all that stuff, Possibly it will have some significance to you. My attitude, pretty well acted upon in this film, is to take about a minute or two, no more, in a part of the film where a rest is called for, to have someone spout a few, hopefully, unintelligible words summarizing the "ideas" in the film, before moving on to the next bang bang. That they do here. Tom Cruise (and his stuntmen) do a fine job, as they usually do in these films; in addition, while I can't be certain, I should think he is still one solid Hunk for the Women. Naturally, there is always something for the men to look at as well. The rest of the cast does well in the relatively brief parts of the scene when the stunts are not being performed.<br />If you liked the others in this series, this one should appear to you a worthy successor to the first two.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>In this third film of the series, Ethan Hunt has retired from the field, and is training new agents.... His sweetheart Julia (Michelle Monaghan) thinks he works for the Department of Transportation...<br /><br />When one of his pupils is kidnapped by a sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt decides to assemble his old team to retrieve her, putting in mortal danger his new love...<br /><br />J.J. Abrams--in his first feature film--shot "Mission: Impossible III" with a sense of timing and suspense... We're dealing with full-flash blanks, glass breaking, explosions... And we see Hunt, in a quite interesting shot, running up a wall to enter the Vatican... Also, in the bridge sequence, he runs away from a rocket hit on one of the vehicles... It's cool because the way he's running, the look on his face, before, during and after that impact could only have been done only by an actor as good as him... In China, in an old fishing village, we see him jumping off tile rooftops, with incredible grace, precision, coordination and footwork... Then, with Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) they jump out of a building on a cable landing on a truck...<br /><br />The special effects, and visual effects are great... They all work together... The Shanghai street chase with Tom leaning out of the car at some insanely dangerous angle to shoot a gun under a truck; Also Tom, in a high-speed boat, on the Tiber River in Rome, Italy; the blowing of a nice spectacular sports car; and, of course, the helicopter chase sequence where, in pursuit, the bad-guy helicopter emerges out of a fireball...<br /><br />Also, in a fantastic shot, in Shanghai, China, when the camera comes in and then goes around Tom as he's standing on top of a Shanghai roof... The camera comes over his shoulder and look down at the ground, so we'll see Tom on the top of the Shanghai building, hundreds feet in the air, and just to show and set up the jeopardy of what he's about to accomplish...<br /><br />Well, I loved the director's work... He's so detail-oriented...The fun, the adventure, the creativity, never eased up...<br /><br />And, please, don't miss Colleen Atwood, entering the Vatican, with a head-turner red dress...</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Lacking the contrived machinations of De Palma's original and the pretentiousness of Woo's artsy sequel, Mission Impossible 3 flourishes under the relative straightforwardness of Abrams' direction; allowed to finally breathe, the series comes up with its best movie, buoyed by a great villain in Hoffman and a couple of stellar action scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Brilliant performances by Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman plus excellent, non-cliched action sequences lift this above the average action movie. Throws credibility out the window but moves so fast you wont mind too much. Easily the best entry in the Mission Impossible franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>Better than some recent James Bond films, MI 3 is a shoot-for-the-moon international caper which moves well into the new millennium.  This episode takes us from Berlin to the Vatican to Shanghai - ambitious indeed.  Slick, youthful and fun, Tom's partners in crime - Ving Rhames, Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are cool and great eye candy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a good actor, but still looks too much like a blonde teddy bear to be menacing for me.  In spite of this, the movie works.  Instead of suffering from sucky sequel-itis, the MI 3 creative team keeps making these films better.  And that's what I appreciate about the movie.  I suspect that JJ Abrams has to take a lot of credit for improving the drama and clarity of the story, which has more character and drama than the usual slam bang action flick.<br /><br />And at the end of it all, there's no denying that Tom Cruise knows what he is doing.  Laugh or sneer at him, but Cruise knows how to deliver with the right team.  It remains to be seen what will happen to the eternally youthful Cruise (will he end up like Arnold or Stallone?) and MI 3 could be the last of an era, I suspect.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>When this film was first announced it was met with skepticism and with the constant bad press Tom Cruise had received over the months this movie was destined to fail. That was before we had the chance to see this stellar combination in action; Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt and Philip Seymour Hoffman taking the role as the main bad guy, arms dealer Owen Davian. These two great actors combined together with the unique and talented Directional mind of J.J. Abrams this movie shut all the skeptics up and gave us an action movie that would truly wrap up the Ethan Hunt saga.<br /><br />Tom Cruise in this movie I think really excels and this is somewhat of a film that really pushed his acting ability to which he delivered perfectly. Philip Hoffman was the true shining light of this film as he played the sick and sadistic arms dealer who was willing to go to any lengths to have Hunt destroyed, even if it meant murdering his girlfriend in the process.<br /><br />This is a great movie and I thought this was truly the right time to re-ignite an old franchise, if you haven't seen this yet and have been one of the skeptics I challenge you to hate this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>It's a mark of how wildly over budget Mission: Impossible 2 went and how generous its star's deal was that despite an impressive-on-paper gross of $550m Paramount constantly cancelled a third entry as unprofitable, even paying off cast and writing off South African second-unit work already in the can until the budget was halved and Tom Cruise agreed to substantially reduce his percentage of the take - by which time original director Joe Carnahan had already walked out over that old favourite, `creative differences,' and an entirely new story come up with. Hardly the most promising of omens for a franchise that always seemed little more than an excuse for its star to play James Bond. Yet despite the bad track record for Hollywood threequels, Mission: Impossible III is a massive improvement over the incredibly awful second entry in the series, and its likely that its much lower box-office may have been as much down to moviegoers disappointment with John Woo's dreary dud and the six year gap between films as Cruise's well-publicised mental meltdown on the promotional tour.<br /><br />Cruise has certainly always treated the films as an ego trip, throwing out the teamwork aspect of the TV show and even turning Jim Phelps into a villain to allow for more solo grandstanding, but this time round director J.J. Abrams at least ensures that there are fewer slo-mo hairspray ad close-ups of Cruise and that the team have more to do than just get killed even if the plotting is predictable every step of the way: you know exactly which characters will die at which point in the film and who'll turn out to be on who's side within the first five minutes. In fact, it's almost a remix of the first film - failed mission, dead agent, Ethan Hunt suspected by shifty boss, has to steal Macguffin for the baddies to prove innocence, yadda yadda. With no surprises on offer, the onus is on the action and the execution, with variable results. The tired handheld camerawork in the pretitle sequence just seems pass&eacute; rather than edgy while the first big rescue boasts a lot of noise, hardware and motion but less excitement than it should, as does a very expensive bridge sequence involving rocket drones, helicopters and exploding vehicles, but there's a nifty kidnapping at the Vatican that is a welcome throwback to the kind of ingenious caper the old show's reputation was built on rather than the Bond-wannabe shoot `em ups that Cruise seems to prefer. Yet at times the film seems keener on imitating True Lies than the old Mission: Impossible, with Cruise pretending to be a boring traffic consultant to new wife and friends until he has to rescue her from a fiendish arms trafficker. Even some of the locations (especially that bridge) look like they still have Arnie's fingerprints on them.<br /><br />Still, although costing a lot less than the second film, it looks a lot more lavish even if it never quite kicks into high gear and ends with an even dafter defibrillator scene than Casino Royale (though the biggest unintentional laugh comes from a villain's claim that cleaning up and rebuilding the infrastructure after the kind of Middle Eastern war he intends to provoke is what America does best: right...). Aside from Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan, none of the cast get much of a chance to make an impression. Maggie Q has even less to do than Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies, with her one real fight scene relegated to the deleted scenes bin, while a dire Billy Crudup is memorable only for being so spectacularly obvious as Cruise's immediate boss. Philip Seymour Hoffman is less irritatingly mannered than usual, and if still not an especially menacing villain, his casting does at least offer an amusing opportunity to see the considerably shorter Cruise somehow grow several inches to imitate him in one scene. The eternally unimaginative Michael Giacchino does his usual more-or-less competent bit of plagiarism routine with the score, getting away with reorchestrating other composers' familiar themes from his record collection (and not just his less-than-dazzling big band orchestration of Lalo Schifrin's theme) rather than creating anything vaguely original, but he's hardly alone in that in this film. For all the early hype about giving the series an edge, this is about delivering something that stays within the audience and studio's comfort zone and sticks with what they know works - in other words, a professionally delivered Summer movie that makes no demands as it repackages familiar ingredients as new-and-improved but also doesn't leave you feeling you've been completely ripped off by the end.<br /><br />If the film itself is less of a Cruise ego-stroke than usual for his Paramount films, the DVD special features on the two-disc set more than make up for it, filled with gushing tributes to Cruise's genius, excellence, humanity, consideration, modesty and, presumably, his ability to heal the sick, feed the multitudes, walk on water and raise the dead (some of them are just too gushing in their worship of his greatness to watch in their entirety). On the plus side it also includes deleted scenes, TV spots and various trailers, though they're mostly slight variations of the same basic format.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>MI:3 was a thrilling movie. I mean literally, from start to finish, it was non-stop action. It was certainly and adrenaline rush. Tom Cruise is perfect once more, as Ethan Hunt. I loved him in this. For all you Cruise Bashers, get over it. This movie did extremely well. And the USA is not the end point for film gross.<br />The acting by everyone is really good and its a fun guessing game as to who is the real bad guy. The first Mission Impossible is actually the better of the 3, in terms of plot. However, this film is certainly more entertaining and it just feels fresher. And for a M I film, I found it more believable than the first one and less confusing. And the great thing is, you really don't need to watch any of the other M I movies to understand this one. Its a great stand-alone film.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Definitely the best of the three, this one is at least a bit credible.  I thought Phillip Seymore Hoffman made a good sociopath, frankly I wish he had been in it more.  This movie is definitely action packed, it's exhaustively so, actually.  I really not a big fan of these Mission movies, they are not nearly as good as the Bourne films, but this one kept me interested and I didnt find myself rolling my eyes as much as I had in the other two Mission movies.  I appreciated that they gave Ethan a genuine love interest, and I liked how much of the movie was in flashback, that made it more riviting.  After the second Mission movie I was not looking forward to another, but after seeing this, I'd definitely see another.  Like I stated earlier, this is hardly up to any of the great Bourne movies, but without a question worth a viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />The first "Mission Impossible" movie was great, Part 2 wasn't but was at least fun and entertaining. But I'm sorry, this third installment is a waste of film, made for no other reason than to milk the franchise dry. Sloppy directing, terrible pacing, lazy acting, etc. Don't blink, because you might miss Keri Russell. She's in this movie for what, 10 minutes and then gets killed off? Why did she agree to do this? Quick and easy paycheck? Seems like the only logical answer. Philip Seymour Hoffman's talent is completely wasted, his character nothing more than a one-dimensional cardboard cutout villain. I've seen [...] movies with more character development.<br /><br />One of the positive reviews here talks about the "excellent" final showdown between Cruise and Hoffman. Well I really must have missed something, because from what I saw, both punch and kick each other a few times, smash out of a window, and then Hoffman dies in the most hackeyed way possible by getting run over by a truck. I guess it doesn't take much to impress some folks.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that I'm glad I saw it for free with a voucher I got by buying the new Special Edition DVD of the first "MI" film. But if I had actually paid to see this mess I would give it a big fat ONE star.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Once again, summer knocks imperiously on the door and so I put away my Independent films and start craving instead the summer blockbuster movies. Mission: Impossible 3 fits the bill quite nicely, thank you.<br /><br />This third offering finds us reunited with a more relaxed Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), now steeped in humdrumness and enjoying domestic bliss with his nurse girlfriend Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who is unaware of Ethan's spy vocation. He's still with his agency, the IMF (Impossible Missions Force, not at all cheesy, huh?), but is no longer a field agent, content now with merely training new recruits.  Billy Cruddup plays Musgrave, Ethan's handler, who busts Ethan's bubble of normalcy and convinces him to return to the field and head up a rescue operation, the particular hostage-in-distress (Keri Russell, in an extended cameo role) being an agent Ethan himself had personally trained. The main baddie is Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), untouchable supplier to various terrorist factions, and the one who's holding our IMF agent captive. Alas, the rescue op doesn't go well and the agency's director Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) is royally pissed at Ethan and Musgrave. Ethan then decides to capture Davian, is successful, but Davian escapes, in a massive firefight on a bridge. Quickly after, Julia is kidnapped and Davian gives Ethan a deadline to obtain something called the Rabbit's Foot, or else...but enough of the plot, now go see the rest of it.<br /><br />Going into a Mission: Impossible movie, I expect non-stop action, great technical special effects, awesome stunts, various double dealings, a few latex mask disguises, cool secret agent toys, hot ladies, a loyal Ving Rhames, and a determined Tom Cruise. And all of the above, I got in spades. I don't really look for a coherent plot in this series but I was surprised how well this one actually held up. Every scene here made sense and meshed nicely, whereas, in the first two M:I flicks I found myself scratching my noggin on few occasions.<br /><br />The set pieces and stunts were up to snuff, convincing and slick. The film takes you to locations such as Germany, Vatican City, Shanghai and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. As usual, Tom Cruise does a fair number of stunts. Meanwhile, director J.J. Abrams keeps things fast-moving and on point. In the grand Hitchcock tradition, he winks at the audience and plays fast and loose with the movie's MacGuffin, the Rabbit's Foot. It draws a chuckle out of me that the Rabbit's Foot never was properly detailed.<br /><br />The cast is solid. This isn't a Shakespeare play, this is a no-holds-barred summer action movie, so for what it is, the actors do a very good job. Tom Cruise, of course, is the glue of the franchise and, as always, he really doesn't have to do much as a thespian except muster up sheer intensity. Ving Rhames is his same cool, dependable self (you could never have too much Ving). Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are competent but bland as Ethan's crew, though Maggie looks very hot in her red party dress (you'll see). Michelle Monaghan as Julia, Ethan's girlfriend, is beautiful and exudes wholesomeness; she gets to have her own pretty implausible but nevertheless kick-ass scene late in the film. Laurence Fishburne as the IMF director is properly dictatorial, while Billy Cruddup as Musgrave is properly subservient in Fishburne's presence, yet manages to find ways to covertly thumb his nose at his boss. Philip Seymour Hoffman, not too surprisingly, does the best job here, putting a decidedly vicious bite in his Owen Davian persona. One particular scene Hoffman has with Cruise in the plane, when Cruise attempts to interrogate him and fails miserably, pretty much sums up the arrogance and venom of his despicable character. All in all, some credible actors here. But I miss Thandie Newton.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a fun summer movie, why not check this one out? And by the way, should you ever find out what the hell the Rabbit's Foot is, please tell me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I've liked all the Mission Impossible movies, but to me this one was the best.  This is primarily due to the great villain played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  He was perfecly cast and delivers great dialogue.  His final fight with Cruise was thrilling and even brought a standing ovation from some in the audience.  The editing and pacing of the film was also perfect-I never felt bored or overloaded with action.  Cruise was good as usual and if you can overlook his kookiness you will enjoy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Although Mr. Cruise may look fantastic, the absolute picture of health and physical fitness, in his latest outing, Mission: Impossible 111, his special agent formula seems to be wearing a bit thin. With lots of explosions and action sequences that look as though they have been almost edited out of existence, this third film in the franchise takes us to some exotic locales - Rome, Shanghai and Berlin, but it doesn't really offer up anything new or fresh.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is about to get married when he's sent on a secret mission which secretly re-assembles old team, now comprised of Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and luscious but wooden supermodel Maggie Q. They all head out to capture evil international bad guy, arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is after something called the Rabbit's Foot (much to our frustration we never actually find out what the Rabbit's Foot is).<br /><br />Fine actors Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne take small roles as bureau leaders. And Michelle Monaghan ends up kicking some b*tt as Ethan's lovely wife Julia. Obviously director J.J. Abrams is doing what he does best, bombarding us with extremely loud explosions, bulging rock music, prolonged gunfights, a series of chases of different varieties, jump-cut editing that's more like a teenage MTV video, and a convoluted plot that eventually leads nowhere.<br /><br />This installment is certainly fused with a dark and furtive quality: there's torture scenes, unstable devices shot up nasal cavities into people's brains, ruined buildings, and women in danger. When there aren't explosions, there's lots of Tom running, and tumbling etc. The narrative makes no sense and Ethan's romantic entanglements do nothing to lend the movie any emotional gravitas, still the action sequences, when they're not shot in the dark, are at least well done and have an edgy, exciting quality about them.

Then John Woo gave it a fling with `Mission: Impossible: II'; a poor post-Matrix action movie which lacked a coherent plot and was riddled with pointless action scenes.<br /><br />Now, with a third movie a third man takes the director's chair.  J.J. Abrams (TV's Lost, and 2009's Star Trek) takes the helm of this thus-far iffy series to try and return steer it back from the comic-book goofiness that was Woo's Mission: Impossible: II.<br /><br />I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that he's succeeded where both of the two previous directors have failed.  `Mission: Impossible: III' (M:i:III) takes the best from the previous two films and leaves behind the bad creating an absorbingly entertaining film going experience.  Tight action scenes tied in with great performances from Cruise and the supporting cast (which includes Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) balances what could have been a dumb action flick.<br /><br />This time around Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retired from IMF to try and lead a quieter life, opting to continue his contribution to the community by training future agents.  Engaged to the love of his life, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) he wishes to avoid danger, but when he learns that his favorite student, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russel) has gone missing on an investigation of a vicious arms dealer he decides to lead his old team back into action.<br /><br />But when a rescue mission goes horribly wrong Ethan finds breaking off his retirement- taking the task of pursuing the arms dealer, Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who is more powerful than they had predicted.  This arms dealer is as well-informed as he is heartless and Hunt will learn that his skills will be put to the test both mentally and physically if he is to have any hope of bringing the criminal mastermind down.<br /><br />This film has the most grounded plot in the trilogy as well as having the best performance from Cruise.  In the first film Ethan Hunt was very typical secret agent.  In the second he was James Bond-meets-The Matrix.  M:i:III Ethan Hunt is portrayed as an actual human being who has emotions yet knows that he has a job to do and that he's the only one who can do it.  It's not a landmark performance, but it is a vast improvement over the last two interpretations by Cruise which seemed wooden; vehicles for action who the audience couldn't legitimately relate to on any level.<br /><br />A strong supporting cast improves since their last appearances in M:i:II, but the show comes close to being stolen by Hoffman's portrayal of Owen Davian.  This is a GREAT villain!  No doubt about it.  He's more vicious than a Bond villain, yet just as well-cultured if not more so and he always keeps a menacing calm in his tone.  Hoffman always seems to talk-down to everyone around him even when he's  being held captive- it's like he feels himself to be a higher level of human being.  Hoffman gives this character a great deal of depth, even though he could have easily pulled something cheesy or uninspired (given that the writing for the character is rather weak).<br /><br />For these reasons M:i:III is my favorite thus far in the series.  I give the movie a 9/10 star rating<br /><br />M:i:III also boasts the best collector's edition of all the DVD releases of the trilogy.  Tom Cruise and director J.J. Abrams give a funny, informative commentary that never gets boring.  All the featurettes are mighty entertaining (with some exceptions) and help you understand what the crew and actors went through.  I really appreciate how much fun these people seemed to have in making this film.  People like to get on Tom Cruise, but when I see a guy who seems to be having this much fun working with a crew I could care less what his religious views are.  From what I see these guys had a load of fun with this film and that reflects on the film where everyone seems to be more engaged with their on-screen performances.<br /><br />10/10 for the Collector's Edition DVD/Blu-Ray set for Mission: Impossible: III</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>In making his big film debut, director J.J. Abrams (LOST) certainly knows how to deliver bone-crunching action sequences, particularly the stunning attack on the bridge.  Tom Cruise's franchise, however, may be tired and Cruise himself has said there'll be no more impossible missions.<br /><br />You gotta hand it to Cruise---while this is certainly not the kind of role to win Oscars, his Ethan Hunt is a dashing, credible hero.  This time around he's married the lovely Michelle Monaghan, who is kidnapped by a crazed arms dealer, played with cool abandon by Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Again, not Oscar caliber, but Hoffman's understated villainy is quite chilling.  The supporting cast of Ving Rhames, Maggie O, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Laurence Fishburne and Kerri Russell are also top notch...the camera work is great and the Lalo Schifrin theme still packs its punch.<br /><br />All in all, a good action movie and if it's the last, it's a good way to wrap it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt who has quit working in the field for the Impossible Missions Force in order to train new operatives.

There is plenty of action, high-tech hijinks, narrow escapes, and romance to keep everyone happy in this slick new addition to the Mission Impossible series.  In this one, Cruise's IMF buddies try to convince him that he cannot have a career and a serious relationship too.  He is determined to prove them wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Mission Impossible III" opens boldly with the film's emotional climax: Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is tortured, restrained, desperately trying to convince someone that something called "the rabbit's foot" is authentic. His foe is Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a blackmarket dealer in everything illicit, who is holding a woman at gunpoint, ready to kill her if Ethan doesn't deliver the mysterious "rabbit's foot". This third installment in Tom Cruise's "Mission Impossible" franchise is directed by J.J. Abrams in a grittier style than its sleek predecessors: The fistfights are knock-down and drag-out. The camera moves a lot -though it thankfully does not shake. The cinematography is generally darker, often using indirect light.<br /><br />The action doesn't suffer, though. We get 5 action/fight sequences, a couple of them pretty exciting. It's fun to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in a villain role. Tom Cruise is joined again by Ving Rhames as technology wizard Luther. Hawaiian-born Asian star Maggie Q is a new addition to the IMF team as Zhen Lei, along with Irish hunk Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the improbably named Declan Gormley. When Agent Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell) is abducted by the nefarious Owen Davian, Ethan Hunt takes a hiatus from his training job and his fiancee (Michelle Monaghan) to return to the field to rescue Ferris. But there may be more to the mission than meets the eye, as Agent Ferris has left Ethan a clue to something -but what?- in the form of a microdot on a postcard sent from Berlin.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2006 single disc edition): Bonus features include "The Making of the Mission"  documentary, 5 Deleted Scenes, a Tom Cruise tribute presentation (9 min) that was shown at the 2005 BAFTA ceremony when Cruise received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film, and an audio commentary by actor/producer Tom Cruise and director/co-writer J.J.

He and Cruise discuss performances, filming scene-by-scene, and more. A nicely paced commentary with lots of information.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Mission Impossible begins near the end of the movie.

The bad guy makes a reference to some event on an airplane and tells Hunt that if he doesn't tell him where the Rabbit's Foot is, he is going to shoot his wife (Michelle Monaghan) in front of him.  He counts to ten, but Hunt doesn't give in.  There's a gun shot. Then black.  The movie then rewinds back in time to show how Hunt ended up where he did.  It turns out that Hunt had retired from active duty and was training agents at the academy.  Everyone in his "normal" life, including his fianc&eacute;e, Julia, believes he's a high-level agent in the Department of Transportation.  At his engagement party, Hunt gets a telephone call that causes him to leave to go "get some ice" at a nearby gas station.  A guy at the store talks to Hunt behind his back (literally) and tells him that the IMF needs Hunt for a mission, and ace student of his (Keri Russell) has disappeared.  Hunt declines, but after a night of nightmares tells his fianc&eacute; he has to leave on a special assignment.<br /><br />Thus begins the part of MI:III where things get a little more interesting.  Hunt selects a team which includes Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames) and sets out for Germany.  They find the kidnapped agent and a helicopter chase through a field of modern windmills ensues.  That chase is about the most exciting thing that happens in the movie.  From there the action moves to Washington, D.C. to Vatican City back to Washington, D.C. and finally in Shanghai.  Along the way the agents learn about evil weapons dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a device he has in his possession called the "Rabbit's Foot" which based on speculation by a computer guy at IMF headquarters might have the potential to destroy the entire world.<br /><br />MI: III is not that great of a movie.  J.J. Abrams is one of the hottest properties in Hollywood right now.  He got a huge surge of power capital to spend after creating ALIAS and after the huge success of LOST.  He's also the screenwriter for a few moderately successful films, e.g. ARMAGEDDON.  MI:III is his first known foray into major motion picture directing and from the looks of it, Abrams should stick to television.  In fact, the entire film can be summed up this way:  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: III is like an extended version of ALIAS, but with the two main characters from the Mission Impossible movies.  That's it.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best thing about the movie and he's on screen for a total of about 8 ? minutes.  Ving Rhames is the 2nd best thing about the movie, but his character has to play second fiddle to Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.  As for the Rabbit's Foot, we never actually learn exactly what it is or why it's so valuable.  Billy Crudup gives a nice performance as one of Hunt's commanders, John Musgrave.  It adds a little more sparkle to the movie, but after seeing Crudup in BATMAN BEGINS it seems like Hollywood has already decided to typecast the guy.<br /><br />The only thing valuable in the film besides those three performances are the cameos.  Look, it's Keri Russell, Laurence Fishburne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, etc.  The action scenes aren't much to look at and there really aren't very many twists to this film (there are a grand total of two masks in this film).  The pendulum in Shanghai is kind of lame and the shoot out on the bridge has been seen almost in entirety in promos.<br /><br />Overall, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: III is the weakest of the three movies in the series.  It is full of unanswered questions and doesn't give the real stars of the movie (Rhames and Hoffman) much screen time.  The action is toned down and is somewhat lackluster (except for the helicopter chase).  As a movie, it's only average.  However, if you've seen everything on tv, you might enjoy watching this big-screen, extended episode that's a cousin to ALIAS.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>this mi food chain is just like 007, getting bita tired and over stretched now. shanghai-china, moscow-russia, paris-france...where else is new? car chases, gun fights, stunts, runnings, explosions....and what else is new? seen one, seen it all. same cliched chablis in new bottle. but as long as there's still market, even it keeps shrinking, it would go on and on. until cruise decides to quit, never say never again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Remember when just finding a cool action movie wasn't an impossible mission?  (right before the time of "MI:2".)  Cruise and company are back, and this time with a more worthy follow-up to the first movie.  MI:3 pulls out just the right stops - wowing without going into overkill.  In 3, Cruise plays a grittier yet more aware Ethan Hunt - the thrill-kill Hunt of 2 is history, replaced by a guy who trains new agents and is himself about to tie the knot.  Called into the field for an emergency rescue mission of an IMF agent, Hunt finds himself tangling with her captor - thoroughly evil arms merchant and arch-villain named Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  There are hints that Davian may have some "inside help" at IMF, but he's apparently fearsome in his own right.  The flick gets that point across in the opening shot - set near the end of the story, in which Hunt is in Davian's power, and we realize before we've seen any of the story just how much power he has amassed (will amass) against our heroes.  Flashing back, we follow the story of Hunt's nearly successful-but-doomed rescue of his fellow agent, which is followed by Hunt taking on Davian himself, racing the clock as Davian is about to close an $850 million deal on something called "Rabbit's Foot".<br /><br />"MI:3" offers a heady amount of choreographed fight scenes, car chases and explosions (SUV don't just burn but now get flipped around) but actually excels in its choice of villain - Hoffman barely acts as the evil Davian, but manages to convey his malice and his will to dominate whoever he speaks with.  We see little of what Hoffman actually does, or the breadth of his evil organization, but the script effectively communicates his (and its) fearsome formidability.  Cruise seems a bit tired of the sort of secret-agent contortionism that's been his shtick since the first MI (carried over into "Minority Report") but he's game.  The story also tosses in a larger (but not friendlier) Laurence Fishburne as Hunt's angry boss but also Simon ("Shaun of the Dead") Pegg who steals his scenes as a data-analyst who theorizes on the creation of the "Anti-God" by greedy men.  There are some plot twists that won't surprise anybody, but the flick maintains enough velocity that even the non-surprises are delivered with an effective jolt.  Directed with imaginative flair by JJ Abrams, a man who can't shoot an artless scene.  They say that these movies are getting too expensive to make - if so, the MI franchise goes out on a high note.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Mission Impossible 3 is the perfect summer movie.  Things get blown up, its got a great villain(Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as one of the biggest jerks in a movie since Denethor in the Return of the King) and its got a great twist at the end I did not see coming!  Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise and the other actors are pretty good.  I am going to buy this when it comes out.  It gets summer off well, very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Pulling off stunts that could only be accomplished by Batman or a committed Scientologist, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), backed up by his IMF team (Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, & Jonathan Rhys Meyers), leaps into action once again to rescue his wife and prevent sinister arms dealer Owen Davies from getting his mitts on a mysterious weapon known only as the Rabbit's Foot.<br /><br />This is a hugely entertaining film.  TV autuer J.J. Abrams shows that he has what it takes to make it on the big screen, efficiently stringng together an exhausting sequence of major action set pieces with just enough plot to provide context without getting in the way of the thrills.  Some reviewers have complained that we never learn what the Rabbit's Foot is, but I think that is just Abrams's affectionate joke on the action movie genre that recognizes that it doesn't *matter* what it is, just so long as everyone is desperate to get their hands on it.  A major step up from the terrible MI:II and definitely more coherent than the first one.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I heard nothing but good things about this movie, so I rented it the first day it was available recently.....and I wasn't disappointed. Oh, it does have a bit too much action and a few politically-correct annoyances but neither are much and overall the movie is a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />The action scenes are not only interesting; they're spectacular at times. Overall, the photography is slick. It's a good visual movie. Not only the cinematography, but the director did a nice job with many of these shots. The version doesn't have all the gimmicks the first Misssion Impossible film, but it certainly has the best action scenes. The action is improbable as Cruise's "Ethan Hunt" would have to be Superman to perform the stunts and acrobatics he does here. (I would never claim this movie is credible, or even "intelligent" - just escapist fun.)<br /><br />Just put your brains on hold, and go along for the wild ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>The reason for the success of MI I and MI II, for this viewer, was the sophisticated, scientific devices and plans used to manipulate evil by good.  It was always a pleasure to watch the superior minds win.  But somehow MI III seems far more interested in pyrotechniques and mass explosions and derring-do than for smart ideas and for that reason it seems less successful - but then that may be the result of watching it on the home television instead of the vast spaces of a theatrical screen.<br /><br />The story is negligibly the same as usual: impossible villain is superceded finally by Ethan Hunt.  The role still fits Tom Cruise well, if a bit repetitious, but the strong point of this third installment is the supporting cast.  We have the pleasure of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting gifts as the arch villain, and the added pleasure of fine actors like Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Laurence Fishburne and the beauty of Michelle Monaghan, Keri Russell, and Maggie Q. And when they are not all  covered by fire and broken glass and whirling helicopters and collapsing bridges etc they do make us notice them.<br /><br />Not a movie for those who prefer intelligent scripts, but for an evening's diversion it is entertaining,  Grady Harp, October 06</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: While Summer isn't officially here, it is here in terms of movies.  Mission Impossible 3 kicks off the summer movie season with a bang with an interesting and entertaining installment in the money-making franchise. Tom Cruise reprises his Ethan Hunt role and J.J. Abrams takes the director's chair. What makes the Mission Impossible franchise so interesting is the constant change of directors. If you look at other franchises like Lethal Weapon, Pink Panther, Indiana Jones, etc, the directors usually stay on board for the sequels. Even with the James Bond franchise you have directors usually doing several Bond films in a row. Mission Impossible was helmed by Brian De Palma and was all espionage with light action. Action maestro John Woo took the second one and made an explosive and entertaining action sequel even if it was a little over cooked. J.J. Abrams makes his feature film directorial debut with Mission Impossible 3, which is a little bit of espionage and a little bit of action. For those who don't know Abrams, he started out writing films like Armageddon and Regarding Henry. He then broke into the television scene with Alias, a pretty popular show. He became very well known recently for his latest show. Abrams is the creator of LOST, one of my favorite shows. So, I was excited to see his first movie. M:I-3 has Ethan Hunt trying to settle down and start a normal life, but he is thrown back into his old job when an arms dealer played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman wants him to track down the Rabbit's Foot. The Rabbit's Foot is some kind of weapon of mass destruction, and if Hunt doesn't retrieve it in 48 hours his fiance will be killed. What follows are explosive action sequences that sing the right tune to satisfy all of our action appetites. The movie is good, but I couldn't help feeling like something was lacking. I tried to pinpoint it, and the only thing that I could come up with was that it lacked style. Sure it had LOST written all over it. The tight close ups, starting the film by showing the ending and then rewinding back to the beginning, getting Michael Giacchino to compose an almost identical score to LOST, even re-creating a scene from LOST at the end, but still the movie didn't feel like it had an overall style. The reason why I liked M:I-2 was that it had John Woo style. The slow motion build up, the doves, and of course Hans Zimmer's amazing music. I'm just saying that Mission Impossible 3 is good, but it's not a definative action movie that stands out from the rest, let's see how Abrams develops his techniques with future projects now that he's broken into the movie scene.<br /><br />ACTING: Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the show as the incredibly self centered and hot tempered Owen Davian. You can tell he had lots of fun with the role. Tom Cruise does what he does perfectly and basically owns the character.  The supporting effort by Ving Rhames and the rest of the gang are not anything spectacular. It's really all about Hoffman and Cruise.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: M:I-3 delivers the goods, but it doesn't step above anything we've seen before. The bridge fight and helicopter chase were the only scenes in the movie that really felt original, everything else felt like it has been done many times before. It's entertaining, it's fun, and you'll enjoy it. It was great to see Hoffman and Cruise really work off each other. Abrams does a great job directing, but he really didn't make it his own in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Mission Impossible III" is a definitive summer popcorn movie.  It's got amazing special effects, outlandish stunts, handsome heroes and gorgeous heroines, and a plot that is as thin as tissue paper.  All in all, a perfect afternoon's escape from the summer heat.<br /><br />If you are looking for a complex plot out of a Le Carre novel, you'll be disappointed in this movie, but then you knew that, didn't you?  Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) tries to save the planet and his wife (Michelle Monaghan, from "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang," a much wittier film) from the evil Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, cashing in on his best actor Oscar from "Truman").  Davian is some kind of evil gun runner who sells weapons of mass destruction to Bad Guys, and he and Hunt are fighting over the Rabbit's Foot, an undescribed weapon with unimaginable destructive power that also conveniently fits into a small briefcase.  Alfred Hitchcock would call this the "MacGuffin."<br /><br />This "plot" is an excuse to string together some incredibly clever and outlandish "ops" for the Mission Impossible Team.  From an early scene where Hunt and his team rescue a captured MI member to a kidnapping in the Vatican to some highwire escapades in Shanghai, Hunt and his gang offer visual thrills galore.<br /><br />Leave your disbelief at the door, don't try to figure out the physics or the logic, and just have a good time watching attractive people do unimaginably spectacular things.  (And try to forget that Tom Cruise is, you know, insane.)</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>***Warning the first paragraph might contain some spoilers***<br /><br />Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise) stands at the crossroads in "Mission : Impossible 3". He's left field work but gets pulled back in when Lindsay (Kerri Russell) one of his former students is captured by arms dealer Owen Davian (a deliciously nasty Phillip Seymour Hoffman). It seems that Lindsay discovered that there may be a mole helping Davian within IMF. Now Hawke once again finds himself in the field trying to bring down Davian, discover who the mole might be and protect his fianc&eacute;e Michelle Monaghan) from torture and death.<br /><br />Regardless of the fall out from all of Tom Cruise's issues and antics J. J. Abrams'("Lost", "Alias" and writer of the film "Regarding Henry", writer/director of the forthcoming "Star Trek XI" prequel) crafts a spy thriller almost worthy of Hitchcock with its use of the McGuffin (the "Rabbit's Foot" a dangerous weapon of war that Davian plans on selling to North Korea) and a number of marvelous set pieces that would make Brian De Palma and John Woo proud. Interestingly the third film in the series combines elements of the first two films with Hawke's search for the mole within IMF and the scenic stylish almost surreal action pieces created for the film.<br /><br />We get almost as much variety for this release as you get donuts in a donut shop. The single disc edition features a limited number of features including director Abrams and star Cruise in a commentary track. Abrams discusses everything from his McGuffin (which he considers something of a joke) to Cruise's stunts during the action sequences. It's a solid commentary track.<br /><br />The single disc edition also includes "The Making of the Mission" featurette, deleted scenes, and the indulgent BAFTA "Excellent in Film" montage allowing us to see why Cruise deserved to be patted on the back as well as a selection of trailers.<br /><br />The two disc edition includes everything the single disc edition has plus "Inside the IMF" and "Mission Action: Inside the Action Unit" that run nearly 40 minutes. "Visualizing the Mission", "Mission Metamorphosis" and "Scoring the Mission" give insight of the production of the film from pre-production through post-production.<br /><br />The 5 part "Launching the Mission" provides an excellent overview on the production of the film. "Moviefone Unscripted: Cruise/Abrams" features the two discussing the movie from an internet "event" while "Generation: Cruise" really is nothing more than an indulgent ego stroking montage from the MTV Movie Awards. Things are rounded up with trailers and TV spots for the film. We also get four Easter Eggs that are pretty easy to find on disc two.<br /><br />Paramount does a nice sent off for the swan song mission of Cruise and the studio together. Although the business and quality of the film was overshadowed by Cruise's idiotic behavior "Mission: Impossible III" overcomes these obstacles with an enjoyable thriller. Hoffman is top notch and the return of Ving Rhames as Luther is always welcome. Perhaps Paramount can built a fourth franchise film around Rhames and bring in another actor to replace Cruise. Either way Abrams crafts an enjoyable adventure for fans and reinvigorates the slumping series by returning to a style that is reminiscent of De Palma's first film on steroids.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>If you're like me, you love to see good guys win, bad guys get what they deserve, and have lots of things blow up. This is Mission Impossible III. Lots of explosions. Lots of plot twists. A doomed romance. Friends that die, betray and are betrayed.... and lots of techno gadgets tht never fail... hence the impossible part.<br /><br />It's fun to see the comraderie of the principle characters that have absolutely no fear. They speak every language, they are fit, they have extensive knowledge of various weapons, hand-to-hand fighting techniques, and none of them fears heights, water, knives, guns, fire, poison - you name it - they are invincible.<br /><br />A highly enjoyable movie-going experience to be sure, but this is one I could live without seeing again. There are some movies that intrigue so much, you don't realize until days later the holes in the plot - but this is one of the movies where you see them as they happen. Albeit James Bond-esque, this movie hinges upon everyone fulfilling their role flawlessly and not one of their high-tech gadgets ever failing. I do believe a lot more plot and script development was present in the first two installments than in this feature.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is (big shock) utterly flawless, and one of the best parts of the film. The whole take-over plot involving the Vatican was very enjoyable, but I believe many integral parts had to end up on the cutting room floor to make the movie an appropriate length. When I see movies like "The Bourne Identity" where they explain everything within the allotted time, it still has amazing explosions, tech and fighting, yet you get emotionally involved w/ the plot and characters and find everything fairly plausible, it's hard to excuse this film from its shortcomings with a straight face.<br /><br />There is enough good acting, gun play and stunt moves to save it from total duldrums, but this is not big on intellectualism. Sound buffs will appreciate the attention to detail regarding the sound. While the plot is questionable, I wouldn't be surprised to see this film get nominated in the Best Sound category at next year's Oscars - every helicopter blade, handcuff link and shell casing can be heard plunking away ala Doppler effect across the theater - I haven't heard Foley sounds that good in a long time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Thanks to director J.J. Abrams, "Mission: Impossible III" surpasses the missed opportunities of filmmakers Brian De Palma and John Woo by returning to the core elements of the classic TV series. In the memorable villain department, Philip Seymour Hoffman kicks it up a notch and gives IMF agent Tom Cruise a run for his money. The pace rarely lags as Abrams stages several stunt-filled setpieces while surrounding Cruise with a solid acting ensemble. Unfortunately, the film's perfunctory climax squanders a potentially exciting showdown between Cruise and Hoffman - an obvious sign of budgetary shortcuts. Despite this lapse, the third time is definitely the charm for the "Mission: Impossible" franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AK1OBVI54SY73.html">AK1OBVI54SY73</a><br/><p>I have been a fan of Tom Cruise's older films for the longest time, so regardless of his disappointing performance in War of the Worlds, I decided I wasn't going to give up on him yet. And I must say in this film that his acting is indeed less embarrassing but also pretty average. He doesn't impress I mean, I think many actors could have did his role easily and just as well unforunately. The rest of the cast was pretty average too...I don't know they failed to keep the story interesting all of them.<br /><br />That wasn't the only problem either. The biggest to me was the action. I don't know but throughout the entire movie I grew very tired of all the ways the movie was trying to impress me with the very heavy action scenes. I think it all was a bit much after awhile, and unnecessary even in some parts of the film. I think Tom Cruise needs to learn a little does a lot. That's my view on it. Some others may just love all of that but I didn't. Those sort of scenes ended up leaving me very bored and even fast forwarding in some parts.<br /><br />The entire movie lost me quickly. I stayed till the end, but I was glad when the credits finally rolled. Compared to War of the Worlds this movie is a step up for Cruise, but that isn't saying too much honestly.<br /><br />2/5</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>tom cruise has done it agian in mission impossible 3. he returns as ethan hunt and faces one of the most diabolical villians in the sereis. this movie is great. but two is still better. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Mission Impossible is now on the long list of films based off a show or a book much like the Bourne Identity, James bond and so on. There're are two types of fans that go see films like this, those who started watching the films and don't care and don't know anything about the original books or show and those that do and are completely loyal. In no way do I show disrespect to the people that loved the show or books because there have been plenty of films that had a great show and it completely disappoints me.<br /><br />My review is mainly for anyone that has seen the first two films or is just looking for a good movie to watch on movie night. I started watching Mission Impossible from the first film and the third installment is much different than the first two films. One big change is that Ethan is married right from the get go and already the film has a much more mature main character who is now living on the safe side. The other big change is that Ethan is no longer an agent is now an agent trainer. The story builds up when Ethan is asked to do a mission to rescue one of the agents he trained, she has been captured by the films villain Owen Davian played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br /><br />Ethan accepts but of course he has to make something up because his wife knows nothing about what Ethan really does. Then after the cool scenes of gunplay and new gadgets the heat is on and so is the search for Davian. Ethan really has no choice but to go after Davian himself. When all the elements in Mission Impossible come together it becomes one of the best films I've seen over the summer. A major action change was made because unlike M.I.2 Ethan does only one hand-to-hand fight scene and it isn't much because it's against Davian. One big problem I had was the addition of his wife, which does add more to the story, but for the most part she was annoying. Of course Davian found out about Hunt's wife and used her to get Ethan to steal something called a Rabbit's Foot.<br /><br />I also would have loved to see some more fight scenes, in the last film the movie depended on those great fight scenes and this one steers clear of it period which wasn't needed. The action was amazing from the shootout on the bridge which was mind blowing to the crazy and unbelievable jump from one skyscraper to another in Shanghai to recover the Rabbit's Foot. I wouldn't say that the action was severely limited, if anything just a little and to be honest it had an almost perfect amount of action to keep the viewer interested in the movie. Though Tom Cruise was going crazy around this time I don't think it affected his performance, maybe his fans are ticked but I like this movie a lot. The acting was ok; nothing amazing but good enough to hold the movie up and overall Mission Impossible 3 is definitely a movie worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>MI3 is fantastic. great action, great adventure, and great acting make this the best of the series. a great movie, please buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is a summer big budget action film.  It is certainly more than your average Arnold picture in the way of plot, but at the core it is a popcorn movie.  Though there are twists and turns, this one is less confusing than the first film.  Much of the technology is improbable, but you have to suspend a little belief.  I mean, yes people can make lifelike masks, and if given time can make a person resemble another.  But there is no machine that can make an exact copy in less than a minute.  Cruise is good in his usual charming way.  Hoffman is great, and I would have loved to see more of him.  The movie is a worthy addition to the franchise, and it is a shame it did not do better.  I would certainly like to see a 4th.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>If you've seen the other Mission Impossible films, you should know what to expect with this one.  International man of mystery Ethan Hunt takes on yet another case involving top secret arms, beautiful ladies who kick butt, evil villains, and world travel.  The only difference in this movie is that now Ethan has decided to settle down and has recently gotten engaged.  This, of course, provides all sorts of opportunities for the torture of his new lady friend at the hands of the evil villain he's trying to take down. The plot isn't that stellar and we never really know what Ethan's fighting for. However, this film was directed by J.J. Abrams (creator of Alias and Lost) and, as expected, has an air of mystery that is typical of his work.  For Alias fans, this movie has Milo Rambaldi written all over it, and for Losties Abrams threw in a shout out to the Hanso Foundation in the credits. Otherwise, like the previous two Mission Impossible films, this movie is action-packed and entertaining the whole way through.  If you like movies like action movies with pretty ladies, you'll enjoy this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>One might picture Ethan Hunt as the American version of James Bond, and they would probably be on the mark. We Americans always have to one-up anybody who tries to top us, of course. If the USSR has bigger missiles with higher yields of plutonium, then by God we'd better get some bigger ones ourselves! And if Ian Fleming's James Bond can out-maneuver the world's bad-guys every time, then by God we'd better find a hero of our own who can too!<br /><br />So The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) was created to the excitement of action film fans around the West. With it we got Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, VANILLA SKY), a kick-butt-and-take-no-names kinda guy who's out to save the world.<br /><br />With the previous two Mission Impossible flicks, the focus was always on the action just for the sake of action. It was entertaining, but lacked the depth that we'd like to see from characters on occasion. So it is notable to mention that we get much more from Ethan Hunt in MI: III thanks to a love interest named Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY). That we have Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the bad guy, Owen Davian) also pumps up the character interactions to new and higher levels.<br /><br />Full of eye-popping stunts, shot on multiple continents, and loaded with great cars, boats, and beautiful people, MI: III has everything that the previous two Impossible films had. Except, as stated, this time we see more of Ethan's humanity. He's a man in love who refuses to lose the girl just so, in the next film, he can meet the next Mission Impossible bombshell (i.e., Bond girl). So we have a departure from the norm, which was pretty refreshing. Not only does the audience get to see the action they're so accustomed to, they also get this bonus.<br /><br />But one has to wonder if Ethan's new woman might meet a deadly end if another Impossible movie is made. We can only hope that they won't fall into cliche-land. Let us pray!</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Ridiculous. If you were a fan or liked Tom Cruise before, forget that he's an idiot & enjoy. This is Tom Cruise doing what he does best, being a charismatic super action figure.  Also it is another chapter in the MI story. In fact, after you get past the over long tease before the credits & the annoying long set-up, (he's a good guy, ex-agent engaged to a woman without a clue to who he is or was), what you have is a complete episode like the tv series, a bit flashier perhaps, sucessfully completed. Then the second half & the movie really begins. MI:III had the incredible luck of having Phillip Seymour Hoffman as their suitably evil villian. That's the only sniff of Oscar this will ever get. Lack of a very good plot means a lots of technical mayhem. Cars blow up, choppers get shot down, Tom gets launched from building to building all a bit tedious. To his credit, Tom does a lot of his own stunts. I wasn't disappointed. The movie delivered what I expected but I didn't have high expectations to begin with. Forget the critcs & enjoy this one, the first of the summer action movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>J.J. Abrams' "Mission: Impossible III" is vastly superior to the first two films in this franchise. It is the only one of the three that gives us what we wanted in the first place: a taut, thrill-a-minute adventure that resembles a super-big-budget episode of the original series, and that makes us care just enough about the characters that we feel just enough emotion about their fates. It doesn't turn original series characters into traitor-villains to validate Tom Cruise's claim to the franchise, as M:I One did; it doesn't sacrifice plot coherence to adrenaline rush and the worship of Tom Cruise, as M:I Two did. Cruise, of course, is still front-and-center, but here he's the first among equals, not the whole show. Whatever you think of his offscreen behavior, he's still a believable, charismatic action hero, and never more so than here. Abrams showcases Cruise without deifying him; himself the creator of tense, breathtaking TV series such as "Alias" and "Lost," Abrams knows how to pace a movie like this, and how to shoot action scenes for maximum impact. He also chooses his casts superbly; the supporting players may not have a lot to do here, but they do it very well. Philip Seymour Hoffman, possibly the best American actor currently in film, oozes fishbelly slime as the ruthless Owen Davian, arms dealer and nemesis to Cruise's Ethan Hunt. There is also notably good work from the returning Ving Rhames as Cruise's best buddy, and from Laurence Fishburne and Billy Crudup as IMF higher-ups who may or may not have their own agendas. And, of course, there are death-defying stunts, shootouts and explosions galore. If you're looking for action, M:I Three has it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This is a strange film in many ways. The music is always the same. The packed action is always the same. The spectacular events are always the same. The same is in the series I remember from 1969-1970. And yet everything is different. We have the right to doubt we are on any right or wrong side. Everyone is against everyone else and everyone is a double agent somewhere. When all agents are double agents, then we have turned the circle of the plot into a square dance and that does not really help us know what is who and who is what. Some beautiful scenes in Shanghai, less in the Vatican, but apart from that we don't have much time to sightsee around. This film is nothing but action and the depth of its meaning is so shallow that we are happy to be able to compensate for it with the height of the buildings. The TV tower in Shanghai is really impressive. But I defy you to find out what that rabbit's foot is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This movie easily outshines the short lived TV sequel and the first two cinematic projects.  The action is nothing short of spectacular and the effects are as good as any of the top action films that have come out in the last few years.<br /><br />Some of the plot reminded me of True Lies (Cruz can't tell his wife what he really does for a living and she only know that he has to go out of town frequently) and really starts to hone in on Cruz's psyche.<br /><br />The kidnapping of the bad guy in the seemingly super secure Vatican was amazing and I am surprised that the Vatican let it be shot since it could give would be real bad guys ideas.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>I haven't been impressed with the franchise, but I keep renting the movies. Maybe, because even today I like the old TV series, so I keep giving Tom Cruise another shot to get it right. They tone down some of the ludricous stunts. This movie, all the stunts seem somewhat possible to me.  Although, Tom Cruise (Ethan) does escape twice from being completely bound and watched by captors by simultaneously fighting the captors and escaping his bonds. It pushes the limits of imagination a little. The battle scene on the bridge was good and exciting.  The whole marriage subplot adds a sympathetic note to the whole story. Hoffman as the villian plays it well. He is a cool calculating murderer and he has fun with it. The cover stories Ethan (Cruise) gives to his wife are hilarious. He is going to a conference in Texas so won't be able to call her for a few days. He is supposed to be some kind of engineer. Is Texas a 3rd world country? The exploding bomb in the head concept was silly too. I don't know if it is possible, but how they disarm the bomb seems silly.<br /><br />I still don't know if I recommend the movie, but there was some nice touches in this one. It is superior to the previous two in the series. By the way, the mole in the organization is very predictable.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Action-packed, entertaining `Mission Impossible III' is probably the best in this `MI' series. Actually it should have been the first installment of `Mission Impossible' franchise, one of the big hits coming from the star Tom Cruise.<br /><br />`Mission Impossible III' is virtually a train of well-crafted set-pieces of actions. The initial mission in Germany to retrieve a kidnapped agent leads to another action in Italy, then in America, and finally in China where Tom's Ethan Hunt must run, run, and run. These thrilling actions, enhanced by good stunts and CCI, would be a real treat for the action film fans. Well, some of you might not particularly like Mr. Cruise, who seems to have monopolized every single `impossible' mission of the agency, but Tom Cruise's performance is focused and credible, even though he sometimes acts like a real superman.<br /><br />The film's action sequences themselves are always fun, but they are most interesting when Tom Cruise is not a one-man band who can do ANYTHING. The best part of the film is the slick kidnapping sequence at Vatican where Hunt acts like a leader, not a hero, managing the whole operation like jugglery, using various high-tech gadgets. In the action sequence in Shanghai, in contrast, Ethan Hunt moves almost like Jackie Chan, never hesitating to jump from the top of a building to another.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman appears as a sadistic arms dealer, who knows something about one top-secret `Rabbit's Foot.' Though good supporting actors like Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Lawrence Fishburne, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Maggie Q, and Keri Russell join in the cast, it is Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show, even from the star Tom Cruise. Unfortunately, the casting of Michele Monaghan as Hunt's sweetheart is a mistake for her character is a rather boring presence, a typical `lady in distress' role.<br /><br />Many viewers would notice that the third mission of Ethan Hunt and his men look similar to the countless films and TV programs they have seen, even including the two previous 'Mission Impossible' films. Yes, the not-so-original script of `Mission Impossible III' re-uses the familiar premises found in this genre, but director JJ Abrams keeps the ball rolling by providing the actions, if not the logic behind them. Though the film is far from original, `Mission Impossible III' is a great popcorn movie that is highly entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>I am neither a big Mission Impossible movie fan, nor a Tom Cruise fan, particuarly with things that have happened during the last year.  However, I am a fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and, while I have never actually watched a J.J. Abrams TV show, from what I've read and heard he knows his stuff.  I went in to see this movie not knowing what to expect.  Gone were the Mexican Standoffs and white doves of John Woo fame.  Gone was the silliness of the first one, so mocked now.  Replacing this is a gritty, "reelistic" (for an action film), and incredibly paced and exciting film.<br /><br />The idea of a secret agent having a home life and trying to hide it has been the subject of many movies, often-times comedy-action movies (True Lies, Mr. And Mrs. Smith).  So, when talk of M:I 3 and its focus on Ethan's life were circulated, I shrugged my shoulders.  But, J.J. used this situation to bring life to the film and to create some of its more thrilling moments.  From the beginning that is actually an end to the tension-filled climax, M:I 3 succeeds in keeping you glued to the screen and on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Phillip Hoffman proves once again that he deserves to be in the forefront.  And what a terrific followup to Capote.  Here, as you can see from the excellent teaser trailer, he is insidious, evil and absolutely terrific.  Playing a character with no moral compass and no compassion for anyone, Hoffman breathes life into what basically is your one dimensional bad guy and makes him his own.  Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, but you have to give it to the guy, he loves his stunt work.<br /><br />The supporting characters are all good, from Ving Rhames to Keri Russel to Billy Crudup and Lawrence Fishburne.  What I really enjoyed about this film was how J.J. focused on the team-aspect.  It wasn't The Tom Cruise show; each of his teammates worked together and they all got face time to do necessary actions.  It was cool to watch.<br /><br />I can't think of an action movie in recent memory where the pacing felt so on pitch and always moving.  And the plot is terrific in that action movie, hero-must-save-the-world-and-his-lover sort of way.  Granted, this isn't Shakespeare and the plot isn't exactly believable, but for an action movie, it is definitely top rate.  And, really, what else are you going to see these films for?  Action, explosions, pop-corn.  Mission: Impossible 3 delivers on this promise and more.<br /><br />A five star action movie and a terrific start to the blockbuster season.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>This is easily the best one. The 2nd film was just a Tom Cruise show where we watch him show off by doing spin kicks and do cartoonish stunts. Although J.J Abrams directs this film like he's doing an episode of Alias, he still knows how to do a Mission Impossible film better than John Woo. He at least lets Tom give one of his better recent performances on top of having some really great stunts in the film. While MI 2 was mostly just one big stunt show. This film at least has a story and some edge of seat suspense. Although I liked part 2, I can't say that watching Tom ride a motcycle while blowing up cars with a hand gun in part 2 was that exciting. That was more of a look at me I'm Tom Cruise film.<br /><br />  This film is so much more than just a look at me I'm Tom Cruise film. He at least has a team that gets some action and get to actually shine a little. For once Ving Rhames even gets more to do and developed more than he was in the other films. Here he helps out Ethan and gets more lines. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are also good as two members of Ethan's team. I also liked seeing Simon Pegg from Shaun of the Dead in a role. Although his character is way too much like Marshal in Alias. The whole building where Ethan works even looks  like somewhere Sydney Bristow would work. I almost even expected either Sydney or Jack Bristow to walk in the building.<br /><br />  The whole way the film is put together is like an Alias episode too. In the beginning we see Ethan and his wife tied up and being threatened by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He threatens to kill her if Ethan doesn't tell him where something called "the Rabbits foot" is. Anyway then the film shows everything that lead up to that point. It's like the first episode of Alias where she's tied up and a torturer is threatening to pull out all her teeth. Then it it flashes back to everything that lead up to it. I don't really mind him directing the film as if he is doing an episode of Alias though since I always found Alias to be a fun Mission Impossible rip-off anyway. Plus he's more fitting to do the movies than John Woo. Don't get me wrong, I like Woo but Mission Impossible isn't meant to be all brainless action.<br /><br />  I also love the fact that we also actually see them make a mask of someone elses face. In the other films we just see Ethan pretend to be someone else and just pull the face off to reveil it to be him. So at least now we know they just don't carry spare faces around lol. I just loved this movie and couldn't keep my eyes off it and it totally brings the series back after the 2nd one let so many people down.<br /><br />  The only thing I don't like about it is the overly happy ending after the rest of the film was so gripping and violent it doesn't really work. Plus the film centers so much around Ethan getting married and doing the job too when I doubt he'll even be married in the 4th film. While Tom and Ving talk a lot about marriage in this one, I already picture them talking about divorces in the 4th film lol. I mean he was supposed to love Thandie Newton's character so much in the 2nd one and here he doesn't even mention her once.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>The best thing about this movie was Keri Russell - and her role, which she played spectacularly, was over in the first 20 minutes.  Cruise & his romantic co-star had zero chemistry together. The actor chosen as the villain, was not well-suited to the role, not frightening at all nor believable as a bad guy. Number II was still the best one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>With the first `Mission Impossible' film, Cruise and DePalma created a smart thriller that made us think more than anything else...With the second `Mission Impossible' film, Woo did what he does best and created a high octane thrill ride with stunt after stunt and fight after fight, but with the third installment J.J. Abrams does a one up on both previous directors and delivers a solid mix of BOTH, giving us an intelligent and thought provoking plot coupled with some great action sequences.<br /><br />Here Cruise reprises his signature role as Ethan Hunt, except Ethan is no longer working as a spy but is now retired and recently engaged to the beautiful Julia (Monaghan) who has no idea of Hunt's past.  Hunt however is suddenly thrown back into the life he left behind when he's dispatched on a rescue mission for his former student Lindsay (Russell) who has been taken hostage by International Weapons provider Owen Davian (Hoffman).  This mission itself ends up forcing Hunt to come out of retirement and places not only himself and his team, but also his fianc&eacute; in serious danger.<br /><br />The acting in this bunch is probably the best of the three films...for while every film had adequate acting neither of the predecessors had any villain that could compare to Hoffman's Davian.  Hoffman becomes the perfect villain, unmercifully evil and full of hate and rage and that arrogance that is evident in most of Hoffman's performances.  Ving Rhames is back as Ethan's friend and teammate, and new additions to the team include Maggie Q as Zhen and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (building quite a nice resume for himself) as Declan.<br /><br />`Mission Impossible: 3' delivers all the excitement and intelligence we would expect from a film of its nature and proves to be the most enjoyable and deserving installment in the franchise.  Props to the entire cast, even Cruise, as well as Abrams for creating a worthy addition to our DVD library.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>Mission - Impossible III (Widescreen Edition)~ Tom Cruise is a tremendous action movie and the best in the series. Tom Cruise is amazing and the part that he plays is so much more complex and demanding then in the first two movies in the Mission Impossible series. The special effects are some of the best in the business and the music is right on the mark. The script is action packed and yeah some scenes are like totally unrealistic but hey if I want to watch realism that I can turn on CNN anytime and watch that. Laurence Fishburne does a bang up job and so does Luther Stickel. I loved this movie and I would recommend them doing a MI 4. 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>I have to confess to two things at the outset.  First, I am part of the legions of moviegoers who have had their fill of Tom Cruise.  While many have recently joined on the bandwagon, I have had trouble with Mr. Cruise for a very long time.  Part of my difficulty has been with his espousal of a set of beliefs that I honestly believe were made up as a hoax by their originator, but part of it has been that he essentially always plays the same character.  He plays that one character very well, but they all seem to have close to the same personality.  Second, I'm pretty much at the burn out point on action spectaculars.  I'm tired of films that try to top all previous films with the size of the action sequences, in originality of stunts, and the amount of sheer noise.<br /><br />Despite these two misgivings, I have to confess that I very much enjoyed this film.  While I'm burned out on action films, this one at least tries to balance the action with genuine character development.  And unlike the vast majority of action films, it attempts to tell a real story, instead of just throwing the hint of a story at us that serves to frame the succession of stunts and special effects.  And while most action and espionage films try to throw surprises at us, this one's surprises did genuinely surprise.  Because a lot of the joy of the film lies in the various surprises, I won't delve at all into the plot or story.  Let me just say that for the most part it is an intelligent and entertaining film.<br /><br />The film is well directed and J. J. Abrams has to be given kudos for that.  For some time now I have wondered if Abrams's talents weren't better suited for film.  Though celebrated for his work on TV, not many have noted that his first two series -- FELICITY (whose star Keri Russell appears in this film) and ALIAS -- started off great but ended up weakly.  It is like Abrams has a talent for developing a premise, but has difficulty in long-term execution.  Contrast this with Joss Whedon, whose shows stay strong until the end.  And after the first six episodes of Season Three of LOST, one wonders of this show is suffering the same fate as Abrams's other shows.  Kierkegaard said that the challenge was how to continue a good beginning, and while that is certainly true of living life, it also applies to TV.  But while Abrams seems to struggle with long format television, film has no long format.<br /><br />The cast is for the most part solid without being spectacular.  Ving Rhames, Keri Russell, Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, and the others all do a solid turn in their respective parts.  The one performer who stands out, as he almost always does, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who despite what would seem to be a limiting physique apparently has no limits as an actor.  If someone were unfamiliar with his work were shown this film alongside CAPOTE, BOOGIE NIGHTS, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, and FLAWLESS, they might have trouble grasping that it was the same actor in each film.<br /><br />I did like and do recommend this film, but again I must confess my weariness with the whole action genre.  It is nearly fifty years since Guy Debord coined the expression and published his manifesto THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE.  Nowhere does this seem more apt than in the action film.  While M.I. 3 actually had some story to go with the spectacle, this is becoming more and more rare.  Too many films have almost no story and character development at all, instead relying exclusively on spectacle, as if that were all a film need be.  Though perhaps not enough people would agree with me, I would prefer that all of today's espionage films try to emulate THE THIRD MAN.  It had little action, no real special effects, but utterly riveting dialogue, visuals, and character development.  But as much as I might wish that, I suspect that the future is going have more rather than less spectacle.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>Considering all the bad press Tom Cruise and this film got earlier this year I wasn't expecting this film to be all that great.  I mean, by the time you get to the third sequel of film there is rarely anything original left.  Granted, this film is not the most original of plots, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, what a great job J. J. Abrams did, and what a great cast the film had.  It was much better than I expected it would be.  As you watch the film, you can definitely see J. J.'s "Alias" touches all over the place.  There were even a few times when I wondered if Sydney Bristow was going to jump, which would have been SO cool.  Tom Cruise too a lot of crap for this film, whether that was deserved or not due to some of his antics I don't know, but he was very good in the film and it keeps you attention from start to finish.  If you're looking for a great action film that is also beautifully filmed and well acted, M:I3 is your film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>i dont know why this movie flopped. yes, yes, a few holes in the script (what is rabbit's foot? how did he get it from outta there in less than 2 hours?) but it was good fun, intense, action-packed, storyline with a twist (not predictable, not boring), very good acting from T.

Check.  Lots of stunts and special effects?  Check.  Big name lead in the title roll?  Check.  Must be the first weekend of May, also known as the first weekend of summer blockbuster season.<br /><br />As Mission: Impossible III opens, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is strapped to a chair.  Across from him is a female prisoner with a gun held to her head.  Holding the gun is Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  He's demanding that Ethan give him the "rabbit's foot" or he'll kill the woman.  Try as he might, Ethan can't convince Davian that he already gave him this item, and the gun goes off.<br /><br />The story then flashes back a ways (we're never told exactly how long it was).  A lot has changed in Ethan's life since the last time we saw him.  Instead of being in the field for IMF (Impossible Missions Force), he now acts as a trainer.  He's also fallen in love and gotten engaged to Julia (Michelle Monaghan).<br /><br />However, duty calls again.  His best pupil has been captured.  He is called on to lead his former team to rescue Lindsey (Keri Russell).  The mission doesn't quite go as planned, but it sets Ethan on the trail of Owen Davian.  Determined to capture this dangerous arms dealer, he and his team set out to kidnap him from the Vatican.  If only the mission were really that easy, however.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of this film franchise.  I hated the first one and thought the second one was just ok.  There was one reason alone I was anxious to see this movie.  I am a huge fan of writer/director J. J. Abrams because of his TV shows Alias and Lost.  I was going to have to see the movie for that reason alone.  Any Alias fan will recognized several of his narrative techniques, most noticeably the character in jeopardy/flashback story telling technique.  Sometimes he can be over do it, but here it works well to ratchet up the suspense.  And don't worry.  His friend Greg Grunberg does get his cameo near the beginning of the film.<br /><br />The story is fine.  Let's face it; it serves as an excuse for a bunch of car chases and stunts.  Still, it serves its purpose well.  While a couple things come at you a little fast, they do make sense when you have a chance to stop and think about them.  In the end, it holds together without too many gapping holes or loose ends.<br /><br />The action scenes are where this movie shines.  They start out small, but build over the course of the movie and include several great sequences.  Couple that with the suspense of the plot, and you have an adrenaline rush.  My heart was pounding during the second half of the film.  Sometimes the camera work makes it a tad hard to follow the action, but it's only a problem worth noting in passing.<br /><br />Of course, none of this would matter if we didn't like the characters.  The script wisely gives us some time to get reacquainted with Ethan before he starts doing his stunts, something the previous two films lacked.  Tom Cruise does an excellent job bring the character to life.  We understand him and therefore have a stake in the outcome.<br /><br />The other actor who really gets a chance to shine is Philip Seymour Hoffman.  He makes an excellent villain.  There are a couple scenes where he's down right creepy.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was great as well.  While Ethan does get a team to work with this time around, they are definitely supporting players.  Still, they provided some great character moments and really liven up the movie.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of the blockbuster movie Hollywood loves to release every summer.  It's loud, fast paced, and requires little thought.  It also works perfectly and is a great way to spend two hours.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Not for a moment did I suspend disbelief at this meaningless spectacle of mayhem and contrived superficial emotion interspersed with loud, over-the-top action set pieces.<br /><br />By paying to see this movie, I felt guilty supporting an increasingly bizarre and crazy man's delusional, controlling behaviour. Yes, I'm talking about Tom Cruise. I heard other movie goers expressing the same thoughts.  So I'm not alone.<br /><br />My gut feeling is that some of the Amazon reviewers who praised this movie are Paramount plants.  Even my 12 year old son thought the movie was "boring" and he laughed when he heard the familiar notes of the Mission Impossible theme.  He said he couldn't "take it seriously and the plot was ridiculous."  So if this wasn't made for 12 year old boys, who was it made for?  Not young adults, that's for sure.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Draw two cards from the standard deck: "bioweapon" and "wife held hotsage." Now, let's play.<br /><br />Tom Cruise does a great job with the Rube Goldberg plots and gadgetry. There's a lot of running around on rooftops, swinging through the air, and other good fun. There was one huge cop-out though. We see Cruise enter the top-secret bioweapon lab (downtown Hong Kong? is that really the best place for it?), and leave a moment later with the goodies. C'mon guys - what happened inside? Armed guards? Secured labs? Guessing the way around an unfamiliar rabbit-warren of lab corridors? All in a day's work, I guess, nothing worth writing about.<br /><br />It's good excitement, but don't expect anything more. If you have an evening to kill at the movies.

But a mission to rescue a former trainee of his gets him and the audience into not only a thickening plot but also into high gear for what becomes one smartly directed, choreographed, and edited action scene after another. The pace is unrelenting.<br /><br />This is action movie stuff to the IIIrd degree if I may say so, and it is done with real movie smarts and a healthy budget. Cast and crew did their jobs well.  It crackles and I was able to ignore the obvious leaps of logic and sit back and enjoy a rip-roarer done with style.  I had fun, but then I like good action flicks.

The story & screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, & Abrams, which is based on the television series by Bruce Geller, is great. The music by Michael Giacchino (who did the music to Abrams' "Lost" (Emmy Winner) & "Alias"), which also includes the theme by Lalo Schifrin is great. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is great! The film editing by Maryann Brandon (who film edited & directed on "Alias") & Mary Jo Markey (Emmy Winner) (who film edited "Alias", "Lost", & "Felicity") is great. The casting by April Webster (who did the casting to "Lost", "Alias", Roland Emmerich's films "Stargate" (1994), "Godzilla" (1998), "The Patriot" (2000), & "The Day After Tomorrow" (2004) is great. The production design by Scott Chambliss (who did the production design to "Felicity" & "Alias") is great. The art direction by Dennis Bradford, Daniel T. Dorrance (who worked on "Collateral" (2004), "Mission: Impossible II" (2000), & "Days Of Thunder" (1990), Gary Freeman, Sean Haworth, Kevin Kavanaugh (who was one of the art directors on "Mission: Impossible II" (2000), Gary Kosko (Emmy Winner), Doug J.

The costume design by Colleen Atwood (who won the Oscars for her work on Rob Marshall's "Chicago" (2002) & "Memoirs Of A Geisha" (2005) is great. This is the best in the Mission: Impossible series.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>After enjoying the first Mission Impossible film and thinking the second was just decent at best, I was surprised to like this film better than both combined. It has the action of the second film and the smarts of the first. J.J. Abrams has done a great job on shows like Alias and Lost, so it comes as no surprise that he has the stuff to direct his first feature film. Tom Cruise is the same old Tom Cruise. Not great, not bad, somewhere in between. He does pull off the fight scenes well, and his gadgets are always cool, but somebody get this man a tissue. He cries or looks as though he is about to throughout the entire film and it kinda bugged me. Philip Seymour Hoffman stole the show as the main villian and I liked Ving Rhames as well. I just wish Hoffman's role was bigger, because a character this nasty needed more screen time. For this type of movie I would rate it a 4.5 out of 5. Bring on The Da Vinci Code, X-Men 3, Superman Returns, and Pirates of the Caribbean 2! The summer movie season has officially begun with MI:III, and what a way to start.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Mission impossible is about a TEAM of professionals who go after the enemies of america. This movie and the rest are abominations that even Tom cruise can't save. The plot is thin which I could forgive if this wasn't a HIGH budget movie.  And of course there is no team in this movie. Instead it's a lone action hero, if this was called "man impossible" then I might give it a break. It's excrement though as a movie; that is based on a good premise that is not here barely. Even worse the whole idea of fighting bad guys has to always include the american government. ???<br />It's not related to mission impossible. AND HORRIBLY there are going to create another one of these monstrosities. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!! let me guess, evil americans are out to get tom cruise. who can't be killed of course. which is fine if this didn't have the misssion impossible NAME ON IT. I do like cruise. he's good but these movies are a disgrace.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>...and failing, yet again.<br /><br />This Mission: Impossible sequel comes closer than the previous two, at least, to pulling off a decent movie. Setting aside all the Tom Cruise weariness we all have, I can at least admit that it was a passable action movie, and a decent spy thriller. This time out, we even have a team working with the Cruise character, so it's not just Tom-going-it-all-alone.<br /><br />Well, why am I disappointed? In a nutshell, it was too much like the TV series Alias, and not enough like the TV series Mission: Impossible.<br /><br />You see, I may be young, but I'm not that young, and I do remember the original TV series, which was much more...cerebral.<br /><br />I've been struck by such thoughts several times in the last few days. HBO was showing Star Trek: The Motion Picture recently, and I was struck by the slower pace, the intelligent conversation, the deliberate pondering of deeper questions... I remembered thinking, back in the 1980s, that that film had been too "technohappy", by taking the time to show off the Enterprise in spacedock before it departs to engage with V'ger. Now, I've come around to a better appreciation for the film, and that style of film-making, in which the film-makers acknowledge that some things do really take some time, and that things should occasionally be more cerebral.<br /><br />Other examples of this:<br /><br />  * We don't see the shark in Jaws until more than half of the movie has passed us by.<br /><br />  * Think about how long it takes for us to see the cape come out in Superman.<br /><br />  * Now, just compare the original Planet of the Apes to the Tim Burton remake.<br /><br />  * Most of Rocky is not the fight.<br /><br />To me, there's a difference in pacing that all of these examples have, over most movies made today.<br /><br />So, I guess I'm faulting M:I III for not being enough like the TV series it was based on...not slow and cerebral and deliberately paced. Yes, it's an action movie, with a villian excellently played by Philip Seymour Hoffman....but we barely get to see him, and we barely get to know any of the team characters, and there's only the one old-style M:I get-the-bad-guy setup, and we rush right through it.<br /><br />I guess that, sometimes, I'm tired of wanting a little more than I actually get.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>This adrenaline pumping movie keeps you on the edge of seat. Lots of action, quick paced scenes, and of course, high-tech gadgets galore!!<br /><br />Good acting and storyline! Romance is on the menu for Ethan Hunt this time around as he marries the woman of his dreams!!<br /><br />With J.J. Abrams at the helm as director, you definitely see/feel the "Alias" vibe.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Wow! Mission Impossible III makes you wish you would own stock in the company that makes pyrotechnics for Hollywood!<br /><br />Although loyalty to friends and family is a reoccurring theme throughout, the focus is on action... action to capture the bad guys and rescue the good guys.  The movie begins with the penultimate chapter... a scene just before the end.  What a technique... you see this ending coming at you and you can't envision a way out!<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />*  Tom Cruise running his 1000 meters through a crowded sidewalk.  Just how fast WAS he running?<br /><br />*  The escape of the bad guy from the convoy.  Remember True Lies?<br /><br />*  Fiance getting mad.  "Point and shoot... It's that simple."<br /><br />*  Helicopter chase through the wind farm.<br /><br />*  Synergy of MI force team members.<br /><br />Rated LOE for Lots Of Explosions.  Not your typical "weak women are exploited while strong males come to the rescue."  The women are tough.<br /><br />All in all, great action entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>pointless and boaring just like pt. 1 and 2</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I avoided the third installment of Mission Impossible for the same reason a lot of people did: Tom Cruise.  It's a tradeoff: a bankable star becomes a liability if you happen to dislike him.  Of course, the people who don't like these big budget stars are usually not substantial enough to affect sales.  Given Sumner Redstone's, CEO of Paramount, decision to cut ties with Cruise, it seems that his outrageous antics finally caught up with him.<br /><br />And that's a shame, because Mission Impossible III is really good.<br /><br />The problems I've had with the other installments revolved around what happened to the original conceit of the series: it was a carefully planned operation performed by a team.  Being privy to the operation in the beginning, we worried for each agent as they performed their particularly dangerous and important task.  This is the whole symbolism of the burning fuse: the agents light the fuse, but the conclusion is an inevitable explosion.  In short, we knew what to expect and got it at every episode, even if there were a few twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />Thus making Mission Impossible a star vehicle is against the spirit of the series.  There's no one star agent; there can't be, because every agent is important.  Right? The first two movies forgot that point.<br /><br />In MI3, J.J. Abrams brings the series back to its roots.  In essence, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) performs a standard mission extraction.  They pull it off perfectly.  There's just one problem: the bad guy (Owen Davian, played with chilling aplomb by Philip Seymour Hoffman) refuses to be interrogated.  Utterly unafraid, he begins interrogating his interrogator.  And suddenly, MI3 has been turned on its ear.<br /><br />What if everything went right, asks Abrams, and it still all went horribly wrong?<br /><br />What's so refreshing about MI3 is that even when Hunt defects, even when he's not sure who's on his side, his team sticks by him.  When he goes rogue, his team goes with him.  And when he goes on a mission to stop Davian, his teammates are right there in the mix, risking their lives for their leader.<br /><br />There are some amazing scenes, including a sliding fight on the rooftop of an office skyscraper and a helicopter battle in a wind turbine farm.  Add into the mix a ticking time bomb and the tension and action keeps the audience on its toes.<br /><br />By never forgetting what made Mission Impossible great, Abrams brings the magic back.  And Cruise delivers without hopping on a single couch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`Mission Impossible: 3' is a chase marathon.  An explosive adventure filled with wild goose chases--and just plain wild chases--this globe trotting adventure will please anyone not interested in seeing characters catch their breath.  The plot is opaque, but uncomplicated:  To avenge the death of colleague, Lindsey (Julie Harris), Ethan (Cruise) finds little time to consummate his honeymoon after taking vows with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and, instead infiltrates the Vatican and Shanghai to catch his nemesis, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Thomas) an arms dealer who will use a coded item (nicknamed a "rabbit's foot") to sell sensitive weapons to the Middle East.  Finding treachery in his intelligence organization and a villain who kidnaps his newly wedded wife make for some nail-biting adventure.<br /><br />Although familiar in its pyrotechnics and chase scenes, 'MI:3' remains a formidable adventure.  And though we've seen the hero blackmailed by his kidnapped wife many times, the danger often remains palpable.  Tom Cruise gives the third installment some urgency, and Laurence Fishburne as his tough, tart-tongued supervisor, Theodore Brassel, bolster the formula for this action outing.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>MI3 is a big-budget summer actioner, with all the pros and cons of that genre, plus its own strong and weak points.  The big set pieces are here; the huge action sequences and the explosions; the Unkillable Hero and the Omnipotent Bad Guy; the exotic locations.<br /><br />Tom Cruise proves he can still act, and still retains tremendous likability on screen, regardless of his bizarre couch-jumping, postpartum mother berating, cult-supporting antics off-screen.  His co-stars turn in  credible to good performances as well.  J.J. Abrams does an amazing job of directing; it's hard to believe he had never directed a feature film before.  To pull off a huge big-budget summer blockbuster like this the first time out of the gate is impressive.<br /><br />So why just 3 stars?  The problem with MI3 is ultimately the script.  Implausible actions and dialogue by the characters take you out of the movie and make you scratch your head.  And a movie like this, with such impossible action sequences, has to have something of a sense of humor about itself to allow you to suspend disbelief.  "Charlie's Angels" is a prime example of this, where you believe that anything can happen in Angelworld and you just roll with it.  MI3, on the other hand, is so deadly serious about itself that you can't suspend your disbelief about some of the stunts and action sequences.  It needed to have either less over-the-top action or less leaden seriousness; the two did not work together at all.<br /><br />Nevertheless, MI3 is at least worth a rent if you generally like this sort of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I originally had the first Mission Impossible on video. I never actually understood what the heck was meant to be going on half the time, but I've watched it more over recent years, and understand it more now. Then, really, I'll happily admit I was watching it for the eye candy that was Mr Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Then everyone went haywire for him & his publicists. Splitting with Nicole Kidman, becoming more vocal about his love of Scientology, getting together with Katie Holmes, getting her to convert to Scientology, having a baby together, and then possibly, a marriage.<br /><br />But the latest Mission Impossible movie brings Tom back to what he does best - despite the fact that baby Suri was born just a few days before the premiere. There's stunning special effects, and Tom Cruise is back to the eye candy he was in the first movie. Don't even get me started on the long hair he had in the second movie. Not a good look.<br /><br />As an avid watcher of Alias, I finally realised why some aspects of Alias seemed familiar - there's a lot of similarities between Alias & the Mission Impossible movies. So it now seems appropriate that J.J. Abrams, the director of Alias (and Lost) directed this, taking the place of David Fincher and Joe Carnahan, who both dropped out of directing it. J.J. even manages to include a regular cast member of Alias in the party scene near the beginning of the film - keep your eyes open for Greg Grunberg (who played Eric Weiss for the first four seasons of Alias, and appeared briefly in one episode of Lost), who barely has one line to say.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this film was Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Simon Pegg. Ricky Gervais was originally supposed to be the computer geek, but got replaced by Simon Pegg, who should stick to what he does best. The role would have worked sooo much better with Ricky Gervais. And I just didn't like Phillip's character I guess. Wasn't he a nasty piece of work? And Michelle Monaghan (whose role in Constantine ended up on the cutting room floor), just seemed awfully dull throughout. Hardly the life of the party you'd expect Ethan's character to end up with. Plus, her and Keri Russell spend the best part of the movie tied to a chair, and Keri's character quickly gets disposed of. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is disappointingly not in the film that much, and doesn't get the chance to show off his gorgeous Irish accent, which is just a complete & utter tragedy.<br /><br />The 120 minutes of the film flew by quite fast for me, although I was very annoyed at the person across the aisle from me, who didn't stop eating for the entire duration!!! My friend & I were gobsmacked. She even left halfway through, and came back laden with more food. And I could see the light of her mobile phone getting looked at constantly. What could be so important that you couldn't switch off your mobile?! Are those Orange ads (which I don't really find funny) that uneffective?<br /><br />Occasionally, I felt like I was transported back to watching True Lies. There's even a bridge which looks remarkably like the one used in True Lies. And the idea of trying to keep a HUGE secret from your other half just doesn't work. It's been done before, in True Lies for example.<br /><br />I'm not sure if there will be a Mission Impossible 4, I did like the way they changed this one, so it wasn't like the previous 2, and I definitely think J.J. should direct another one, but with so much press surrounding Tommy Boy constantly, I don't know what could possibly happen. People go to his films just to slate him. But in my eyes, he did redeem himself a wee bit.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>This is another slick, high-tech action film in the Mission Impossible series. It might just as easily be called Mission Improbable III due to the improbably poor shooting and judo ability of the villians and the improbably super human athletic ability of the good guy, played by Tom Cruise. We have Tom rescuing his fiancee from the psychotic chief bad guy, played by Oscar-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman, but then IMPROBABLY going completely out of character for a highly trained agent by sappily kissing his lover after untying her and, by doing so, drops his guard for the bad guys to jump him again. (Geez, Louise!) Mix in an improbable plot and stir. But, no worries, mate. Forget all that. Sit back and enjoy the well-choreographed action sequences with a 44-year Tom Cruise doing many of his own stunts. Also enjoy the beautiful cinematography and high production values. A comparison of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III to the less high-tech opening scenes of TRUE LIES is illuminating. In the latter, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the help of buddy and partner Tom Arnold, crashes a party at a mansion, peels down to a tux and does a cool tango, then escapes on a high-speed ski mobile in a forest at night, all the while gunning down chasing bad guys. For all its high-tech gadgetry and jaw-dropping scenes, MI III lacks the wit, charm and romance of those wonderful opening moments of TRUE LIES. What that comparison shows, I posit, is that you don't need so much high-tech wizardry to make a great action flick and that humor, style and a good script can give a high-tech film a soul. (Where are you, Arnie baby?) Nice shots of Shanghai, China.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) juggles a new fianc?e (Michelle Mongahan) and a happy domestic life with his new job as a trainer for the IMF. He also has to keep the existence of the IMF a secret from his future bride. During the engagement party, Musgrave (Billy Crudup) calls and Ethan soon learns an agent he trained, Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell) has been kidnapped by a ruthless arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). She is being held hostage in an abandoned factory in Berlin and they need to get her back because she has incriminating evidence about Davian. Ethan and his team, including Luther (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q) and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) are soon in operation. After the rescue, Ethan is now Davian's enemy and they lock horns.<br /><br />Directed by J.J. Abrams (the creator of TV's "Alias" and "Lost"), "Mission: Impossible III" accomplishes the impossible. It is the rare sequel better than the first (and second installments) of the franchise.<br /><br />Okay, so we all know Cruise is off his rocker. I don't really see how this impacts your enjoyment of the film, but to each his own. Clearly, many people feel this way and have stayed away from the film for this reason. Throughout the history of Hollywood, there have been many stars who have been into one thing or another and they still managed to make some darn good films. Cruise is guilty of what, being overly enthusiastic? Damn him. If you don't like him, try to look beyond that, because the majority of the films he makes are very well-made. He takes a hand in producing most of the titles, working with his producing partner to make sure every element is top notch. Yes, the films are often imperfect, but they are heads and shoulders above most of the other offerings we are subjected to on a normal basis.<br /><br />Cruise seems very comfortable in the role of Ethan Hunt. He has had time to acclimate to it, and now seems to fit the shoes he has had to fill. He owns this character and is able to convincingly portray the tender side of Ethan to his new fianc?e and instantly switch to the old Ethan, the one who will use every skill at his disposal to save a fellow agent.<br /><br />Cruise convinces us that he is in love with Julie (Michelle Monaghan, who bears a striking resemblance to Katie Holmes), which is important during the last act of the film. And we believe that he can effectively lead his team into Berlin, Rome and Shanghai, tracking the purely evil Davian (Hoffman, in a bravura performance).<br /><br />This is Tom Cruise's film. Ethan Hunt is the main character and is in virtually every frame of celluloid. Because so much of the film rests on his shoulders, we have to believe in Ethan and Cruise makes this happen. He fully inhabits the character.<br /><br />Of course, there is an equally important flip side to this character, the villain. In "III", Hunt finally seems to have a villain who challenges him. Hoffman's Davian is a very memorable creation. Part of this is because the character is so unlike anything we have ever seen from Hoffman, evil seeps out of his pores. When he is initially captured by Ethan and his team, he doesn't even seem concerned and tells Ethan that he will hunt down his girlfriend and make them both pay. This scene does two things; it demonstrates Davian knows he will get out and soon. And he will also attempt to get even. Because he seems so sure of himself.<br /><br />"III" is not a perfect film. There are a couple of points that I would like to make, but if I discussed them, it would ruin a couple of the moments in the film. I can't do that. Let's just say the film violates one of the most basic conventions of the thriller. The reason it is so basic? Because it is necessary for any successful thriller; if you violate it, the film loses some of its impact.<br /><br />Also, it is a shame the supporting cast is little more than window dressing. Ving Rhames' Luther has a history with Ethan, so he is a welcome sight, but he is still simply a cog in Ethan's machine. He doesn't have his own story or impact the story all that much. The same can be said of the characters played by Maggie Q and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, simply tools in the machine and the roles could have been played by anyone. "III" follows the tradition of the earlier films and casts these actors because they are `current' and `interesting'.<br /><br />Bill Crudup's Musgrave is easily the least interesting character he has ever played. That says a lot because Crudup is one of the best actors working in film. Musgrave is weak, boring and easily manipulated. The character is an old friend of Ethan's, but that is about all he contributes to the character.<br /><br />On the plus side, the action sequences are fantastic and it appears as though Cruise did most of his own stunts. There are three prolonged, involving sequences spaced throughout the film and they are well-staged, interesting and the top of the craft. For me, the standout is a sequence on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Hunt does everything he can to prevent a covert force from removing a suspect from his custody. They throw missiles, gunfire, planes, helicopters, and more at him. He jumps over holes in the bridge, gets flung against cars, but he won't stop.<br /><br />These, combined with an amusing, more "Mission: Impossible"-like sequence set at the Vatican, provide an amusing backdrop for the story. The story is well-plotted and easy to follow, but that doesn't detract from the seriousness. When they are in the Vatican, they use that old "Impossible" trick of creating a lifelike mask of Davian, to allow another character to pose as the villain. This was done all the time in the television series; a phony pan behind a beam or wall would hide the moment they switched the actors. In "III", they use the same technique, but the effect is simply stunning. Completely believable.<br /><br />"III" does a good job of giving the original series some credit, something the first film, in particular, had a lot of trouble with. From the memorable theme music and the signature fuse burning to a scene involving masks, Abrams seems to realize that this is the heritage of this film. These elements are partially why the series is so fondly remembered, tribute is needed.<br /><br />Abrams was a great choice to head this latest installment in Cruise's franchise. He brings intensity to the action and a humor to the dialogue which works perfectly with the story.<br /><br />"Mission: Impossible III" heralds the beginning of the summer popcorn season. Hopefully, "III" isn't the high water mark and merely a sign of things to come. This could be a very good summer indeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Mission Impossible III had a lot to overcome for it to be a box office success, and a good movie.  First, Tom Cruise was in the middle of his public scrutiny/Scientology/Nicole Kidman/Katie Holmes public relations fiasco.  Second, this movie was directed by JJ Abrams and came out five years or so after the second, and third, this is a Mission Impossible movie, so it had to live up to certain expectations and fulfill certain elements that fans have come to expect.<br /><br />While entertaining, this movie is not nearly as good as Mission Impossible II.  It seemed like a series of highly complex, detailed missions, each lasting about twenty minutes, followed by five or ten minutes of story or drama, then onto the next big set piece.  You had the rescue of the captured agent, the capture of the bad guy in rome, the bad guy's escape, the theft in China, then the finale.  Each segment went down the same way, the IMF team (Cruise, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, and another guy) played their parts and looked nice, but in the end, I felt know connection to what they were doing.<br /><br />Phillip Seymore Hoffman plays the bad guy, Owen Davian.  I read reviews where his performance is praised, yet I found it fleeting.  He was only in a few scenes, and not given time to develop as a bad guy.  The rest of the cast was fine.<br /><br />In this movie, Ethan Hunt is in love and about to get married when he gets drawn back into the field by a self-destructing message.  The opening played the catchy, hypnotic theme music, but then the theme all but disappeared by the end of the movie, making me feel like this wasn't a Mission Impossible movie.  To me, JJ Abrams under utilized the Mission Impossible theme and this brought the movie down a bit in my eyes.<br /><br />The story was simple, but lacked the "cool" factor that John Woo's edition seemed to have.  This is an okay movie, and I'll watch the next if there is another one, but I understand now why it didn't rule last summer's boc office.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>The mission, should you decide to accept it, is to read a completely negative review of this movie.<br /><br />Before, I need to make clear that I enjoy action movies a lot, that I enjoy the explosions, the frantic action scenes, the villains, heroes and any other accessory that contains a film of this kind. Likewise, it's important to emphasize that I enjoyed enormously the "prequels" of Mission Impossible, and for that very same reason, I have to explain why Mission Impossible III did not fulfill my expectations.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. YES, it has lots of action, special effects and above all, it has Philip Seymour Hoffman as the villain.  The problem in this movie falls in the absurd turn that the plot took.<br /><br />Mission Impossible used to be a series where a group of extraordinarily gifted secret agents were assigned to carry out "impossible" missions, with state-of-the-art technological tricks, disguises, and the possibility that always they were about of be discovered.<br /><br />Though MI-I and MI-II suppressed at  the most the "group of agents" concept and centered all the action in only one, Mr. Ethan Hunt, we could accepted that once again it was Hunt the leader of this new mission.<br /><br />But when the "supposed" mission revolves around the hero romantic relationship, I would expect that at least such relation had some sense. On the contrary, is a relationship based on lies, and it doesn't have enough dramatic weight for us to value the faith of these two people.<br /><br />It would appear the Tom Cruise can't allow the prospect of sharing scenes with other co-starts that could offer anything else more than his worn out smiles, facial expressions and tiresome acrobatics.<br /><br />JJ Abrams (Lost), in his debut on the big screen, directs the movie as if it was a 2-hour Alias episode, cluttered and clumsy, presenting an elaborate plot without substance, always with a fast pace, descending the rhythm only when Hoffman is on the screen.<br /><br />And it's thanks to the unquestionable qualities of Hoffman as a performer that MI-III is not a total fiasco.  Many people will stay astonished with the explosions, the frenetic helicopters pursuits, the disguises, the jumps from skyscrapers and the explosive action scenes. Others will get out of the theater mentally bored and exhausted after expending 2 hours watching what should had been more of than the same old action thing, but worse.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Q6R4481YFFG.html">A14Q6R4481YFFG</a><br/><p>Yes, great talent went into this movie.  You've got great actors and some interesting and innovative technology.  P.S. Hoffman makes a top-shelf bad guy, right up there with my all-time favorite, Dirty Harry's Andy Robinson.  The plot moves right along and a somewhat schmaltzy but satisfying ending is provided.  In that sense, MI:3 lives up to its predecessors and is good entertainment.<br /><br />But, I can't ignore the problems with this movie, some minor, some major:<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  Are writers too lazy to do any good foreshadowing anymore?  What is going on with this faux-noir business of showing us the climatic scene at the beginning of the movie?  I noticed this in Turistas as well.  I'm no fan of European cinema, but take a look at the foreshadowing done in Sexy Beast: a boulder hurtling at you and almost killing you but landing instead in your swimming pool.  Now *that's* some witty, well-done foreshadowing!  Giving away part of the plot SPOILER ALERT (Davian's escape and Julia's kidnapping) for a cheap head fake just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  We need more originality in action scenes.<br /><br />>  The "let's launch a missile strike on a long bridge" scene was done in True Lies.  Granted, one was filmed on US1 and the other was filmed on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, but is there really that much difference between the two?  I'm also a little perplexed as to why Ethan's posse would transport prisoners across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in the first place, since there are plenty of perfectly good airports right in D.C., military and civilian.  For anyone who knows the area, they're bound to be put off by this obvious plot hole.  There were continuity problems in this scene as well, with the helicopter hovering above the bridge superstructure in some shots but not in others.  A nine-figure budget should eliminate those kinds of mistakes.<br /><br />>  The Shanghai building jump scene was done in Tomb Raider 3.  It's even a rip-off to a certain extent of both Die Hard and even Green Ice, for crying out loud.<br /><br />>  The "attack the guy while immobilized by biting him" scene was done in The Bone Collector.  Stabbing to death with a pen?  Silence of the Lambs and Gross Pointe Blank.<br /><br />>  The "kill him then revive him" scene was done in The Abyss.<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  Typical left-wing politics and Hollywood trash-talking.  Agent Musgrave's against affirmative action.  Ooooh.  He *must* be evil.  C.f. Derek's father in American History X.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  The actual theft of the Rabbit's Foot - what's up with that?  We're just supposed to assume Ethan broke through to the right floor, evaded guards, found the device's location, busted it out of whatever super-protected contraption it was in, and made his way out?  That's inattentive, lame and just plain lousy writing.  This sort of "we won't tell you how he did it but trust us, he does" attitude ruined The Hitcher, Identity and even to a certain extent Die Hard 2.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  Once again we get the "rogue CIA chief is out to kill you"** theme.  We just had that, again, with the Bourne series.  Isn't there something else we could use for bad guys other than institutions dedicated to protecting us?  Something like, oh, I don't know, terrorists who are part of a global fascist ideology fueled by the teaching of a seventh-century prophet?  Or are we just playing it safe by once again beating up on U.S. intelligence institutions?  Or is it just to increase the overseas gross?  You tell me.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  "Halliburton made me do it."  A whole movie was actually made - remade - on this theme, The Manchurian Candidate.  In the somewhat-coherent "I'll tell you why I did it" scene, Musgrave justifies his betrayal by appearing to say that the Rabbit's Foot will be used to frame some poor little Mohammedan country, which will be bombed, then rebuilt, presumably by Halliburton under a "no bid" contract.<br /><br />Adding it up you've got great acting, the best F/X money can buy, and great gadgets on the one hand, and tired plot, reworked action scenes and careless, clich&eacute;d writing on the other.  The producers of the MI series should take a lesson from the 1988 version of D.O.A., where a character tells the protagonist that of the protagonist's four books, there's the "third that's a little careless and a fourth that sort of stinks!"  Let's leave the MI series at "a little careless," so we won't have to get to the one that sort of stinks.<br /><br />**  IMF, CIA, whatever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>After MI2 I wasn't even sure I wanted to watch this one.<br />I'm glad I did.

Don't get me wrong mission impossible pt 1 was good but at times it was overly complex. Not to mention MI: 2 which was an exaggerated over blown sequel. Instead here we have a balanced chemistry of a simpler plot and more realistic action.And what I liked was that everything is accomplished as a group; exactly as it was done in the TV series. Best of all  JJ Abrahams creates tension from time to time with interesting close ups that are in a way similar to the TV show 24.<br /><br />The plot in this movie is much simpler than part 1 but not so simplistic as part 2. It all begins with Ethan Hunt coming back to the IMF agency; he is sent to rescue a fellow agent. Along the way we discover there is an arms dealer that is negotiating with terrorist about a potential nuclear device, possibly known as The Rabbits Foot. I don't want to ruin anymore but at least I can say that it's a worthy sequel. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because even though the movie is somewhat better than the predecessors i felt that it was still a Tom Cruise vehicle, concentrating on an exaggerated ego of his. But other than that is was all good. Mission accomplished<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This 3rd instalment of the Mission Impossible films sums up exactly what is wrong with most Hollywood films today.<br /><br />Lets be fair and start with the good points: The stunts and action sequences (particulary on the bridge) are breathtakingly good. The acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laurence Fishburns (in a small role) is very good. Cruise and the remainder of the cast are reasonable as well. There is also a lovely cameo role from Simon Pegg which is worth catching as well.<br /><br />However on the downside there is virtually no characterisation. The script is at best average, and did I care in the least about anybody in the film (no). Stunts and explosions are great, but if thats all that the film consists of then you no longer have a film. This isn't quite that bad but if you took that out of this film you would have about 15-20 minutes left at the most.<br /><br />So its worth seeing, there are some great moments, but I'd recommend renting it rather than buying as it really is a typical bloated Hollywood blockbuster.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>The first five minutes contain what is possibly the best performance of Tom Cruise's career. And I should know, I own and have seen all but one of his movies (War of the Worlds). The plot of the first Mission Impossible was too convoluted (I even read the novelization of it to throughly understand it), whereas the plot of the second mission Impossible movie was too dumbed down (after so many complains about the first movie). This third installment manages to combine the wits of the first film with the stunts and visual beauty of the second. Make no mistake, at the end of the day, this movie is nothing more than a very good thriller, but with Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performances and strong support from Ving Rhames, this movie delights and entertains without missing a beat. And, at the end of the day, isn't this why we love movies so much?</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>It was a shame to my delicate sensibilities that Seymour H. Wasn't used more with Cruise, in what could have been excitingly impossible to eyewitness dully. The two are powerhouse actors. And I couldn't help but have a bad taste of knowing too much personal information about both Ethan Hawk and for that matter, the person playing him in real life: Cruise. Don't get me wrong, I was in no way influenced by the obvious antics by Tom, but at the same time, miss the time in cinema when agents protected their actors from too much public investigation.<br />There were signs to me, when the small screen director seemed unable to produce bigscreen action. Besides the long scoops on tight sequences, which could have been spider man for all the ambiguity of the impersonal angles, There was a point when yet another impossible break and enter was required and everything seemed poised for another catwalk from the room to a supervault fiercely protected by guards, but then we wait along with the van and twiddle our fingers expecting the inevitable: Cruise with a most urgent story of his escape and of course, the goods. Or, the rabbits foot. Jeffrey Abrams does have youthfull passion for his work and it shows in his deliberatly implied ehtics, such as a reduced amount of gore, and a pychological beginning, thrusting you into an immediate thrill house, and seizing your attention onto a sizzling bomb fuse and immediately switching to a friendly espousal between new wife and husband. Cruise and Wagner productions last feature film has an open, chapter-to-be-continued feel that all Bond films end with but is rather a closer to a very established production company. Will he be teamed with his wife in impossible situations for the next? Will there be a next? Perhaps, but more that that, promise me director of the future, that whatever the story between wife and husband, assuming that you have yet another awesome combination of super actors, use them for God's sake!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Mission Impossible III brings to the screen the ongoing adventures of Ethan Hunt as he battles dangerous villains.<br /><br />The former spy is called upon to retrieve a captured agent, though it might be that this time he's bitten more than he can chew...<br /><br />Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the special effects, the dialogues, and the music are all good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>Another action packed movie. What impressed me this time is the beautiful agent Maggie Q, whose moves are fluid and crisp, and Michelle Monaghan as Agent Ethan's new-wedded wife, Julia. The final sequences when Julia looked at the battered Ethan, pulled the trigger and later saved Ethan were beautifully captured. There was more to it than pure action - love was in the air. A twist as to who is the mole is also a pleasant surprise.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>It wasn't Tom Cruise that kept me away from seeing this movie in the theater, it was the second film in this series.  I hated it.  The first was good, but the second was completely and utterly a waste.  This one is much better than the second, but not as interesting as the first.  Cruise is ok as Ethan Hunt, but I think this series could do better with someone more interesting.  What this movie has going for it is the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The problem is that the movie could use more of him than it gives us.<br /><br />The whole thing is an excuse for daring rescues, impossible fights, big booms, bright and ridiculous explosions, and fair damsels in distress (in their modern fighting form).  The conceit of the movie is that Hoffman is an international supplier of bad things to bad people in bad governments.  In this movie there is something called a Rabbit's Foot and is never explained.  It is a McGuffin.  That is, what it is doesn't matter, that it motivates action does.<br /><br />You can pretty much guess what happens and how it ends before it starts.  But it is still some light and exciting fun along the way.  However, it requires you to not think or your fun will be spoiled.

But, I can see what they are doing.  I just rented this DVD of "Mission Impossible III" and I know that they actually made a depreciating effort to reduce the video quality of this DVD. The picture quality of this DVD is a great deal less in quality than it easily could be.  And I've got a fantastic Samsung 32" LCD TV.  I know they made sure the picture quality of this DVD would be sub-par so that they can try to push the Blue-Ray DVD version to try and get people to start buying Blue-Ray DVD's.  I have many high quality High-Definition DVD's, so I know that it is possible to give us standard DVD player owners, a High Definition DVD of this film, but they won't.<br /><br />I started to pay attention to this when I saw "War of the Worlds" on DVD.  I thought that the picture quality of that DVD was sub-par, too.  But, the DVD of "Terminator III: Rise of the Machines", "Monsters, Inc", many of my films from the eighties, and even 1963's "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", all appear to be a High Definition (simulated) mastered release on a standard DVD.  Blue-Ray is the next new expense of getting you to keep spending your money on the same movies that you already have.<br /><br />Well, if you let yourself fall into that trap of replacing all your favorite DVD's with Blue-Ray DVD's, you're looking at an expensive future of buying all your favorite movies all over again.<br /><br />And you know what?  I'll bet, within 5 years or so from now, they'll say they've come out with something better than Blue-Ray DVD's, and you'll be suckered into replacing all your favorite DVD's once again.<br /><br />This is a never ending cycle of making sure that you keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.<br /><br />And then over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you buy all your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and again you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and then something new will come out and then you'll buy your favorite movies over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and over and over again, and so on and so on.....<br /><br />If you start to invest in Blue Ray now, the movie industry obviously has you wrapped around their finger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>What I enjoyed most about this movie was that the root of the film was true spy genre. To many movies spend so much on action that they overshadow the true nature of the business. That is not to say there isn't plenty of action in this third installment of the successful series, it just doesn't smother it. Tom Cruise is amazingly fit at 44 and does a great job in reprising his role as, Ethan Hunt, an agent for the IMF. Ving Rhames once again turns in a fine preformance as part of his support crew. Directing by J. J. Abrams was superb and showed his talent at making an action film with more than just special effects. He brought out some good charactizations, and made me want more screen time from even smaller support roles like Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn.<br /><br />This movie centers on Ethan becoming romantically involved with a nurse. Although it may not please action fans, it has a ring of truth to real life, and not just love em and leave as so typical in the Bond movies. We are surprised in fact that Ethan marries and has given up his field work. He is called back in to save one of his trainees and she is killed by a heartless arms dealer during her rescue. Ethan then sets out to capture the arms dealer Owen Davian played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but things go very wrong. Not only does he lose Davian, but finds that his wife has been kidnapped. When he tries to rescue his wife from the clutches of Davian, we don't know what to expect. One thing that impressed me was her part in the rescue. To often the ladies scream and cry and are helpless, that is not the case here and I am glad to see strong females portrayed.<br /><br />I bought this DVD without seeing it in the theater on the hope it would fill out the trilogy without regrets. It did more than that. I am far happier with it than my third installment of X-Men. It makes me want a MI:4. The DVD is excellent quality and contains many extras in addition to the standard commentary and making of documentary. If you enjoyed the previous MI movies or you enjoy spy movies like "The Bourne Identity" or the James Bond series, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>For a moment, I'd like you to visualize the following scenes as depicted in an action movie. First scene: the hero uses a plethora of weapons to fire at a continuously moving target. Second scene: he has to scale a tall structure in order to break into a restricted area and gather information. Third scene: he faces death when the area of the building he's trying to escape from explodes in a blaze of eardrum-shattering glory. And finally, forth scene: the hero has to try to rescue a very important person, namely, the woman he loves.<br /><br />As far as anyone is concerned, I could have been describing sequences from any number of action films. But in this case, they came directly from "Mission: Impossible III," the further adventures of Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) on his quest to save humanity from the ever elusive bad guys and their plot to destroy the world. The formula this film follows is so conventional and uninteresting that I found myself bored out of my skull halfway through. It doesn't help that the eventual outcomes are predictable and ultimately unsatisfying. Isn't the point of a sequel to present something new, something that isn't a virtual copy of the previous story?<br /><br />If you live for this type of entertainment--the type that relies solely on wall-to-wall action sequences--then I'm sure you'll get your money's worth out of it. There's certainly no shortage of action in this film, from exploding cars to shootouts to daredevil stunts on skyscrapers. In this sense the film "works" because it delivers exactly what it promises; anyone who has seen the trailer will know what to expect. And that's the problem, especially since the trailer offers a mere taste of its stunt work. I should think that even the most dedicated action film buff has a limit. Exactly how many stunts can a person watch in one sitting without feeling jaded? I don't think the filmmakers ever once took that into account when making "M:i:III"; the adrenaline pumping moments are so abundant that the film practically drowns in superficial eye candy.<br /><br />As far as the story is concerned, it centers on needlessly sadistic arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He is in possession of a top-secret item called the Rabbit's Foot (so top-secret is this item that the audience doesn't even get to know what it is). The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) wants Agent Hunt on the job, despite the fact that he's engaged. This particular mission--led by the quarrelling Theodore Brassel (Laurence Fishburne) and Musgrave (Billy Crudup)--is enough to convince Hunt that he needs to rejoin the team. Apparently, Davian has kidnapped Hunt's former student (Keri Russell as Lindsey Farris).<br /><br />The problem with Hunt's job is that it requires him to be a liar, something he'd prefer not to be if he wants to live happily with his fiancee, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). For this mission, he gives her the classic I'm-going-away-on-a-business-trip routine, something she's rightfully suspicious about. In the sole moment of humanity the film has to offer, Hunt asks her to trust him. She ultimately does, but it was given under intense trepidation. It's enough of an answer for Hunt, who then teams up with a dedicated group of professionals to find Davian and his Rabbit's Foot. They include Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q), and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), all of which seem to share the same skills and know how to get by using the same techniques.<br /><br />Their search first leads them to Vatican City, which prompts them to make use of a multitude of super spy methods (all of which only pass muster in over the top comic book stories). At one point, Zhen takes a picture of Davian's face using an ultra sophisticated camera (it's hidden within a makeup mirror). The image is then electronically transferred to Strickell's makeshift mask factory. Within a matter of minutes, Hunt is transformed into a doppelganger Davian, complete with a voice-altering chip placed on his throat. It was a technique utilized in the previous two films, and frankly, I never once bought it. Even for a work of highly stylized fiction, it was a little too unrealistic for my taste.<br /><br />The scenes continue to go from one to the next as smoothly and expectedly as anyone could hope for. But when Davian kidnaps Julia, things suddenly get complicated. Not surprisingly, this sends Hunt into the depths of panic and fear, almost to the point of losing his edge. What makes matters worse is that a certain member of IMF isn't who he or she seem to be; hidden amongst the ranks is a saboteur who has been in league with Davian all along. Despite the desperate situation, Hunt and his team are sent to Shanghai to continue their mission. It's there that Davian gives Hunt an ultimatum: deliver the Rabbit's Foot in forty-eight hours time, or Julia will be killed.<br /><br />And there you have it: the basic plot description of a cookie cutter action/adventure flick. If it wasn't enough to pique your interest, then it's best to just save your money on "Mission: Impossible III." All you'll experience is two hours of nonstop frenetic activity, enough to last you more than a couple of trips to the theater. However, if I've managed to make you salivate in sheer anticipation, then by all means, go and see it (but be aware that I'm not making a serious recommendation). Is it a bad film? I wouldn't quite go that far. But I will say that it's an unnecessary film, presenting nothing but a collection of cinematic devices that we've already seen many, many times before. It's an uninspired, unoriginal work, and it represents an idea whose time has already come and gone.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>The opening scene of "Mission: Impossible 3" is the best of the whole series, jamming us smack in the middle of a duel between commando Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and arms dealer Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Davian has a gun to the head of Hunt's girlfriend Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He wants the "Rabbit's Foot." He'll count to ten.<br /><br />"M:I3" has our attention.<br /><br />That bold stroke is the work of first-time director J.J. Abrams, creator of "Lost" and "Alias." It's more Abrams' film than Cruise's, just as all of the "M:I" movies have been - Brian DePalma ("M:I"), John Woo ("M:I2")  and Abrams have also projected their artistic personalities onto the Ethan Hunt character. First, there was CIA Ethan. Then Cool Kung-Fu Ethan. And now Soulful Ethan, a lover as much as a fighter, who only re-enters the spy game because his first trainee, Lindsey (Keri Russell) is about to be murdered by Davian. Hunt's team (Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q) botches the rescue and then draws a plan to ensnare Davian at the Vatican.<br /><br />"M:I3" builds off its compelling opener and climaxes around its midpoint, during a gunfight on the Cheaspeake Bay Bridge that involves helicopters and a missle-shooting drone. And then it tails into a lousy ending. It's too ambitious, stuffing romance between action, saddling Cruise, at a time when he's unbearable off the screen, with drippy, teary-eyed material suited for "Jerry Maguire." And Abrams' inexperience with a movie budget and technology is evident. He sticks the bridge sequence. But he blows a couple others, including a confusing free dive off a Shanghai tower that steals from "M:I2," a scene Woo handled better.<br /><br />Hoffman is the Cracker Jack prize of the film. He has maybe five actual scenes and he sells Davian's villainy with arrogance and certitude. "What I'm selling and who I'm selling it to should be the last thing you're concerned about" he says to Ethan. What does Davian know? It doesn't turn out to be much, but "M:I3" designs Hoffman's performance in a way that makes it seem otherwise.<br /><br />The rest of the cast flames out, but a punchy screenplay-by-committee doesn't help. Rhames barely resembles computer genius Luther Stickell at this point, and spends most of the movie channeling his crook from "Out of Sight." The two new IMF suits (Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne) subject us to a boring shell game of discerning which is straight/crooked. A humorless, sappy Cruise transmits creepy vibes while Monaghan, pretty in a Liv Tyler kind of way, isn't given much to do.<br /><br />Abrams prefers close-ups and hectic photography to a more lucid action presentation. At times he whips, pans, zooms and hacks about like Michael Bay. Unlike his two TV shows, his female characters don't get much breathing room or development. And unlike a TV series, "M:I3" shouldn't dither about for 15 minutes with the domestic filler and useless dialogue Ethan and Luther trade throughout the picture.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I was one of those people who resisted this film last year because Mr. Cruise was severely riding my last nerve.  But apparently I didn't stay away for long.  I agree that the action and special effects are good.  However, the script stinks to high heaven.  And camera hogging Cruise needs to learn how to share the camera.  Even our villian, Hoffman's character, had the smallest amount of screen time I've ever seen.  Hunt and his "wife" have absolutely no chemistry and I didn't buy into the love affair and I don't appreciate not being told what the heck the rabbit's foot was and what it was capable of doing.  Overall, if you're just looking for good action scenes this is the movie for you.  If you're looking something else--look somewhere else.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RFG9LI7JDILS.html">A2RFG9LI7JDILS</a><br/><p>i will admit that i couldn't take my eyes off the screen.. but that was only because i was so overwhelmed that i couldn't do otherwise - such is the plight of modern cinema..

To tell you the truth though, this is kind of what I was already feeling halfway though this movie. Seeing the number of stars that took part in this production I thought that maybe it was going to be better than the previous attempt. I was sadly mistaken, since the performances of most of these big stars are uninspired, and the only exception is Philip Seymour Hoffman. This actor has the ability to astound me no matter what the role is, even in a movie that counts with the number of flaws this one has.<br /><br />It all starts with Ethan Hunt being questioned and threatened by the evil Owen Davian (Hoffman) and the twist has to do with the fact that Davian is actually threatening to hurt not Ethan, but his wife Jules.  The scene ends with a shot but without showing what happened. We then are taken back in time to see Ethan and Jules getting engaged. Ethan is dedicated to train Special Forces and he has stopped with the field work, but when a former student is taken prisoner he jumps back into the action. And that is one thing you get in this movie, action, a lot of fast-paced chases, fights, explosions and stunts. If this is what you are looking for, you will likely have a good time.<br /><br />For those that are looking for a nice backbone to the story, I am sorry to tell you that this film certainly lacks that. The plot is so shallow that I was surprised and somewhat disappointed.  I can't even believe that after showing a scene in the future with both Hunt and Davian alive the creators are trying to create suspense by them placing these characters in dangerous situations in the past. To make matters even worse, the movie is long! I hope that by now you have a pretty good idea of how much I disliked this movie and what I think the flaws are. If you are just looking for an action flick, I wish you the best of luck and hope you enjoy yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>This is my third, and final, Mission Impossible! Why? Because the magic from the original 60's series has not once reappeared for more than a split second. I'm now a firm believer that Corporate Hollywood does not have a clue as to what made the original series a hit!<br /><br />Okay, what do you expect from what is essentially a comic book story? A lot! First, I want to be entertained! Is that asking too much from Hollywood? I don't want to groan, or laugh, because of sheer camp stupidity! If I'm in the mood for dumb, I'll go see a comedy! Exhibit A: Tom Cruise stops his heart with electrical wires running on household current and a bowl of water. When he's finally revived, he jumps up, gun in hand, looking for a target, as if he got nothing more than SCRATCH! The audience thought it was a hoot, but this dopey scene belongs in a slapstick comedy, not in an action picture which tries so hard to be taken somewhat seriously!<br /><br />Next, I want some character development, so I can care about some of the characters, just a tad bit. For example, I'd like to know something about this relationship between Ethan Hunt and his newly wed wife. In MI3 romantic love comes across as maudlin and forced. Like a bad 50's movie. Nothing lifts the heart. There simply is no satisfaction on any level!<br /><br />Now comes the acting. When I start yearning for Arnold Schwartzenagger, I know Tom Cruise has hit rock bottom. His acting is not the least bit convincing. He almost comes across as uncomfortable madly kissing his "wife". All I can hear in the background is, "where's my contract", "I want more money", or "I got places to be, people to see." Memo to Tom: What happened to the depth you have shown in Risky Business, Born On The Fourth Of July or Jerry Maguire? If your hearts not in it, don't do it, Tom! Stop treating yourself like some commodity on an exchange! Otherwise, you will wreck your career all that much sooner! It was Friday night, and only about 25 people were in the audience in a theater that easily sits 500, and MI3 has only been out for a couple of weeks!<br /><br />Lastly, I would love it if the story made some sense. Here's one good example: What's the connection to the Vatican City? Nice filmmaking, too bad it wasn't a travel documentary! Oh, it's so "cool" when the MI3 crew gleefully blow-up their $100,000 sports car, like any garden variety terrorist, while still inside the Vatican's walls. But I hope the Pope, or anyone else, for that matter, was not passing nearby! How stupid, on so many different levels, can Corporate Hollywood get? If you need to take a swipe at the Catholic Church, can it at least have something to do with the story?<br /><br />If I have deterred a single person from spending their hard earned money on this trash, then it was worth the effort to write this review. Vote with your pocketbook so Hollywood is not tempted into making MI4! If you got to see it, wait till it comes out on DVD and borrow it from your local public library for free!</p></br><a href="../users/A2F7CCPK4QL359.html">A2F7CCPK4QL359</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of  Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy&lt; It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwheming<br /><br />there are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings.<br /><br />I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest.<br /><br />it is a good action flick for those who crave action<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>It has been a long time since Tom Cruise starred in a film where he wasn't just playing a jacked-up version of himself. With "MI3" the streak continues.  Tom never allows you to forget you are watching TOM CRUISE.  He mugs, he over-emotes, he flexes --- all the things that made him a matinee idol.  Does he act?  Not much, but films like this don't allow much room for that anyway.  One need not be a great actor to pull off a film like this.  One must only be a competent actor.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman, however, is a dandy villain.  But he has a small role anyway, and movies like this tend to be showcases for the villains anyway.  They tend to be the only really interesting characters in these genre films.<br /><br />Cruise's Ethan Hunt character and his domestic ordeals are straight from the Unoriginal Screenplay Handbook.  Let's see here:  he has a fiancee (and eventually wife) who doesn't know what he does for a living.  She thinks he has a rather mundane job.  But horror of horrors, she finds out the truth when she is kidnapped by the baddies and hubby has to rescue her and she finds out the truth...<br /><br />Sound interesting?  Sure.  Sound familiar?  It should.  It was the central conceit in James Cameron's "True Lies" starring Ah-nold and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Twelve years ago.  And "True Lies" was a remake of a French film.  So "MI3" has key elements that were unoriginal 12 years ago.  Nice job.<br /><br />In "MI3" there is a chase of sorts on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  Jets fire missles to destroy the bridge, cars explode, bridge sections collapse, etc.  Now where have I seen this before?  Oh yeah, in "True Lies".  Different bridge, same look, nearly the same general action give or take a plot element or two.<br /><br />Hope Jim Cameron at least got partial screenplay credit for this fim.<br /><br />Five years since "MI2" and this is the best they could do?<br /><br />I'm not saying that "MI3" and "True Lies" are the same film.  But "True Lies" was more exciting, more interesting, more layered, and more plot-driven.  "MI3" never really engages you for more than a few moments at a time.  Lots of cliched Hollywood emotional manipulation, too.<br /><br />A very by-the-numbers film.<br /><br />And at the end of the film, as a call-back to something tried earlier in the film with another character, Tom's character must allow himself to die temporarily with the hopes of being resuscitated later by his frantic wife.  Sound familiar?  Yep.  Reverse the gender roles and you have a scene from James Cameron's "The Abyss" from 1989.  In it Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio drowns herself so that her husband (Ed Harris) may live and hopefully resuscitate her soon after.  Frantically, of course.<br /><br />I first saw "MI3" in May of 2006.  But I saw major elements of it as far back as 1989.<br /><br />I guess the REAL Impossible Mission is to find a totally original screenplay.<br /><br />Minor quibble:  Billy Crudup's character shows up to meet with Ehtan Hunt at a convenience store and he has several days' goatee growth.  Then he gets Hunt to watch a video he made less than 8 hours earlier in which he is clean-shaven.<br /><br />Oh, and Crudup plays Cruise's boss and later betrays him.  Sound familiar?  From the first "Mission Impossible", maybe?  And also from "Minority Report" now that I think about it.<br /><br />I couldn't care less that Tom Cruise jumps up and down on Oprah's furniture, supposedly impregnates Katie Holmes, blasts the psychiatric profession, joined a cult, gets Comedy Central to yank "South Park" episodes from the air, or much else.  But with the kind of pull he has in Hollywood he should be able to insist upon making a better quality of film.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>The MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series can be summed up with one sentence: style over substance.  The rather jumbled plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE could be ignored with little difficulty thanks to thrillmaster Brian De Palma's gripping directing, while John Woo's stylistic action scenes overran the nearly incomprehensible storyline of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II.  The difference between those films and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III is that there is style AND substance.<br /><br />The film opens in a fashion similar to that of Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL, as we find that we are already quite a ways through the storyline - in fact, we're very near to the end.  We can tell by the fact that the film's primary villain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, has Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in restraints and is making demands about something which we assume is very valuable.  As soon as this heart-pounding sequence concludes, we are hurled into the roughly twenty-second opening credits and then yanked back out.  We find ourselves at a pre-wedding celebration between a chipper Ethan Hunt and his fiancee, Julia (Michelle Monaghan).  Ethan has given up his life with the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) and is trying to enjoy a peaceful, action-scene-free existence.  Unfortunately for him - but luckily for us - this is not possible.  It is, ironically, impossible.  It seems that one of IMF's agents has disappeared while spying on weapons dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman).  IMF wants her back.  What man is more fit for the job than Ethan Hunt?<br /><br />The story doesn't end there, of course.  Just when things are looking good for Mr. Hunt, he finds himself in over his head, both with Davian and with the IMF itself.  Ethan's trouble with his agency is not the only recycled plot element in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III.  This film hasn't an original bone in its body.  M:i-III's storyline is made up of countless recycled plot points from the films which preceded it.  The fact that the movie boasts nothing original storywise, yet loses little of its enjoyability, is a testament to writer/director J.J. Abrams.  As a fan of Abram's television work, I found myself occasionally expecting Ethan Hunt to don a wig and engage in some real espionage, or perhaps, in one of the film's two airborne scenes, to crash-land on an island and duel it out with a giant polar bear.  Thankfully, none of this happens.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III stands on its own amongst J.J. Abrams' other work; still, it can't compare to the talented Mr. Abrams' television work (then again, not a whole lot can).  Along for the ride are a few of Abram's past co-workers.  These include screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, both of whom have written numerous episodes of ALIAS; Keri Russell, who played the title character in Abrams' series FELICITY; and composer Michael Giacchino, who is responsible for scoring both ALIAS and LOST.  Giacchino's score for M:i:III is hardly as impressive as his work on the aforementioned TV shows; Lalo Schifrin's classic theme is conspicuously absent throughout most of Giacchino's score, appearing in the opening and closing credits and briefly in the bulk of the movie.<br /><br />Despite Tom Cruise's increasingly bizarre behavior off-screen, he hasn't lost any of his charisma on-screen.  Ethan Hunt, a primarily one-dimensional character whose motivations are always made abundantly clear, suddenly becomes interesting thanks to Cruise's performance.  We cheer for Ethan we he pulls something grand off, and our hearts pound when he's in trouble.  Ving Rhames reprises his role from the previous MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films as Hunt's teammate, Luther Strickell, working alongside Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q.  Billy Crudup is Hunt's boss, and Laurence Fishburne is Crudup's boss.  SHAUN OF THE DEAD's Simon Pegg is a stand-out in his comic scenes as IMF's technical expert, although Pegg's total screentime is almost painfully short.  The real standout of the cast is the always-exemplary Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose performance as arms dealer Owen Davian is truly chilling.  Hoffman portrays the character as being nearly inhuman, maintaining a horrific calm whilst performing the most sadistic of acts.  Hoffman's Davian seems to be bored by just about everything; to him, torture isn't something terrible or even something that requires great skill - it's just a tool to get what he wants.  Without a doubt, Hoffman makes Davian the most wicked antagonist of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series.<br /><br />In many of the calm scenes, the cinematography is bland and unexciting.  The action and suspense sequences, however, are an entirely different matter.  In the action scenes, the camera leaps around and captures the event(s) from a variety of angles, each angle shown for mere moments before the next is presented.  This rapid-fire style of editing really puts us there with Ethan Hunt.  We feel the adrenaline rush that he feels.  We feel acting on impulse.  We feel ourselves reacting to the chaos surrounding us.  In the scenes of suspense, the camera focuses on a character and is rather shaky, filling us with a sense of uncertainty, putting us on the edge of our seats.  Great editing and camera work can puts the audience in the moment, and the action/suspense sequences in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III do just that.<br /><br />Combining the high-powered style of THE BOURNE IDENTITY and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with the over-the-top gadgetry of the recent James Bond films, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III grabs the viewer by the neck and throws him or her into a wild and shockingly fun ride.  There's nothing truly amazing here, and when you get out of the theater you may find yourself wondering just why you thought the movie was so good.  While watching the movie, however, you just can't take your eyes off it.  J.J. Abrams has seemingly pulled off the impossible.  This MISSION, should you choose to accept it, is a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Tom Cruise (Minority Report, Last Samurai) returns as Ethan Hunt and this time he has left his thrill days behind and focus on his wife Julia played by the lovely Michelle Monaghan (North Country, Bourne Supremacy). When Hunt's friend John, played by Billy Crudup (Almost Famous, Stage Beauty) tells him that one of the people that he used to work with named Lindsey Ferris, played by Keri Russell (Felicity, Upside of Anger) is missing, Hunt goes off to rescue her with his team including Luthor, played by Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Kojak), Declan played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Match Point, Velvet Goldmine) and Zhen played by Maggie Q (Taped, Rush Hour 2). Hunt and his team even track down to find bad guy Owen Davian, played superbly by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote, Happiness). Things happen when Hunt kidnaps Owen and things go completely haywire when Owen kidnaps Hunt's wife Julia and he demands Hunt find the Rabbit's Foot otherwise his wife dies. The opening scene is surely a grabber..well that's JJ Abrams for you who directs this action packed movie which is better then the first two. The first one is still good but John Woo screwed the second one up. This felt like Alias and it has refrences to Lost (scene where Michelle Monagahn pounds on Ethan Hunts chest echoes the scene in which character Jack tries hard to revive Charlie while pounding on his chest). The action scenes are pretty inventive as well...especially the highway road scene with the jet flying all around and the scene in where Hoffman and Cruise duke it out at the end. Hoffman was only in the beginning, the middle and the end but his character has to be one of the best villains in this kind of genre in a long time. The supporting actors such as Rhames, Crudup and Meyers are very good. Also starring Laurence Fishburne (Matrix Trilogy, Mystic River), Greg Grunberg (Alias, Ladykillers) and the hilarious Simon Pegg (Spaced, Shaun of the Dead).</p></br><a href="../users/A2JYIDH7JIG48H.html">A2JYIDH7JIG48H</a><br/><p>Mission: Impossible III is definitely for Tom Cruise fans, with plenty of captions such as "Berlin, Germany," and "Rome, Italy." The rest of us, who already know a bit of geography, can skip it.  The story has nothing new or unpredictable - in fact they show a scene from the end of the movie at the beginning, so you know exactly where it's going.  The bad guys gathering in the Vatican, and the "good" guys breaking in to it, is an insulting implication to catholics.  That's all my criticism; on the plus side the movie is a diversion with action, special effects, stunts, and explosions enough to keep it going and earn 3 stars.  But personally I'd be just as satisfied to go see a new theatrical release of some of the old TV episodes with Peter Graves, which would save a fortune and probably present a more intellligent story.</p></br></body></html>

The first thing you find amazing and very scary is that these undead aren't the slow walking/stumbling kind but well actually give chase to whoever they are after which is a real kick in the nuts for the survivors in this movie.  The second was the great acting most of the cast did as when you see them go to the mall and are suddenly trapped inside by the undead with really no other place to go at that time.  You see how they interact and how they try to coexist with each other and the situation they find themselves in.  The movie had a limited budget so don't expect great special effects an the like not that the effects and makeup they used was bad.  The movie is very gory and bloody of course so we pretty much know this is not a family movie to show to the kids but if you're looking for a good horror or zombie movie this one is just for you...</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>This remake of the 1978 classic Dawn of the Dead is awesome. The gore factor has been kicked up a notch, there are more characters, more action, more terrifying zombies, and the vibe is even creepier. The storyline is still vague however, because it's still about how there is no more room in hell and now the dead walk the earth. Plus, it doesn't feel like it has all the finesse of the creepy vibe of the original. Still it's one of the most solid remakes of any movie you can find. If you can't get enough of zombies you must buy this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, "Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives." Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks "punch."<br /><br />But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add "soul" to this film about the "souless" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the "Apocalypse," he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great "fifth-act conversion"!!<br /><br />What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!!<br /><br />The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the "real" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this "problem" with Boyle's "28 Days Later" . . . in America we received the "happy" ending and weeks later, the "unhappy" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!)<br /><br />Hey, even if you don't dig close-examination of film (not everyone does!!) and just want a great action movie . . . this is it!! It will not disappoint!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>WHAT MAKES THIS MOVIE SO GOOD IS THAT THE ZOMBIES CAN CHASE YOU, INSTEAD OF WALK AROUND SLOW LIKE SOME SENIOR CITIZENS! PLUS I LOVED ALL OF THE CHAOS GOING ON IN THE STREETS! THIS MOVIE BROUGHT A REAL LIVE FEELING TO IT! IT MADE YOU WONDER IF THIS STUFF REALLY HAPPENED, WOULD THE MILATARY JUST LEAVE YOU TO FEND FOR YOUESELVES!THIS MOVIE IS A GOOD HORROR MOVIE TO WATCH OR OWN!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) has just come off another long, thankless shift at the hospital. She is unaware that the world around her is changing in ways that will soon shatter everything she knows, believes, hopes, or dreams. Ana goes to bed with her husband, oblivious to the growing horror and creeping dread right outside. In the morning, Ana faces the new reality first hand. She has no time to adjust or think, only to flee, to react, and to survive. Yes, the dead run the streets, seeking prey, seeking those like Ana to attack and slaughter. Ana's once quiet neighborhood is a battlezone. Her entire life has suddenly plummeted off the cliff of normality into the darkness of unknown terror. Ana runs, screams, and drives on instinct now. She is automatically moving, trying to escape. Trying to keep away from the hordes of former humans that pursue her. The fires burn and the helicopters roar overhead. Ana has entered the end of all things. Somehow, she meets up with other survivors. Kenneth (Ving Rhames) is a cop who comes across Ana's wrecked car. They walk together now, strangers in a nightmare land of roaming cannibals and panic. The two find another small group of warm-blooded people. Can this tiny group stay alive? Can they face what is unthinkable? Do what is inconcievable? DAWN OF THE DEAD is a masterpiece of dread and lurking fear. The situations are fast, violent, and shocking. The characters are living people with pasts that no longer matter. The story is apocalyptic to the extreme, slamming home the idea of a world devoid of all but death, and those who seek to outlast it. Buy this movie immediately! It's like Fulci's ZOMBIE, Romero's NIGHT-DAWN-DAY OF THE DEAD, THE STAND, and MESSIAH OF EVIL all rolled into one gnashing, biting, drooling package! What are you waiting for?? ...</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>The unrated director's version is the one that i have.<br />Great movie, but not as great as the Romero version.  Some of the<br />zombie scenes felt like that crappo 28 days zombie movie... which<br />is edited a la mvt video style, and  some of the ending scenes are filmed in high speed shutter in which gives out a feeling not as satisfying as the original movie.<br />Saying that, i can say that i recommend this movie to anybody that<br />like zombies movies...and the bonus is that this movie has a good<br />budget its characters are interesting....it wont let you down..it'l just try to take a bite out of you..........</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>This movie proves that some remakes can actually be very good. It's smart, scary, has some dark humor and the zombies are lively and scary. The zombies don't just walk around like dull dead-heads like in Resident Evil for example. Hell this move is everything that Resident Evil could've been.<br /><br />  Sarah Polly (Go!) plays a women who wakes up one morning with her husband and they both get attacked by the little girl nextdoor who became a zombie. Her husband gets bit and becomes one, so she flees her her house not knowing what is going on. After seeing the madness going on in the streets, she panicks and gets into a car accident. Then she meets a badass cop played by the...badass Vin Rhames (Pulp Fiction). They meet Mekhi Phifer (8-Mile, E.R.) and his pregnant g/f along with Jake Weber (The Cell). At the mall they meet some security guards head by C.J. (Mchael Kelly) who have claimed the mall there's and are relucant to let them stay there.<br /><br />  The cast is really good but surprisingly Michael  Kelly I think has the best part. . He handles the action scenes just as good as Rhames. Plus since his character has some screws loose and actually enjoys splattering zombie brains all over, it makes his character the most interesting and fun. This movie has some the best action since Aliens dare I say. I thought I've seen enough zombie movies of late but this makes me want to see a sequel get made. The movie is also smart and strange. Is clever how Vin Rhames communicates and becomes friends with a guy on top of a store roof by flashing signs back at each other and then use binoculars to see what each other say. Plus Mikhi Phifer's g/f giving birth has to be one of the strangest and unusual scenes you'll ever see. If anything is disapointing about the movie, it's how it just suddenly ends after so much action, thrills and blood splatter. However is some action during the credits but that  makes you want to see what happens next even more.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead (2004) turns out to be the remake from hell. The super fast zombies add a degree of suspense, these zombies could be Olympic runners. When I rented this movie I didn't pay attention to the rating or unrating.. However I thought while I was viewing it, it seemed beyond your average rated R movie. Come to find out it was this unrated director's cut. I'm only bringing this up because I've seen other movies that claim to be unrated or the director's cut and they don't seem like anything more than the R version. That's not the case here. I am a huge fan of zombie movies and horror movies period. This is one of the best horror movies in a while. The zombie FX are superb. The infant zombie was a little over the top, that whole scene was disturbing. I'm not sure how much of it made it in the R rated version but this version isn't for the faint @ heart. The original Dawn of the Dead (1979) is still very very good. If you haven't seen it I fully recommend it as well as this super cool remake.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>DAWN OF THE DEAD rocks.  A great hybrid of action/horror/comedy, this film hits the mark where many have failed.  Where 28 DAYS LATER starts out decent, but takes itself too seriously and RESEDENT EVIL ends up a slipshod version of a video game that's actually more cinematic and eerily realized than the film, is exactly where DOTD triumphs.  Given a decent budget, a fine cast, a fun script, and inventive, assured direction by ZACK SNYDER, this is THE modern zombie movie that gets it right.  A thoroughly enjoyable splatterfest of thrills and chills that does the original film proud whilst staking it's claim as it's own great flick.  Good horror is hard to come by, but this will please fans of both ends of the genere spectrum-the actually creepy to those who like 'em bloody.  DAWN OF THE DEAD delivers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X27FQSHP418Y.html">A2X27FQSHP418Y</a><br/><p>This movie takes from the first minute and never let you go until its (unfortunate and unpredictable) sad ending.<br /><br />If you never watched the original movie, then you'll be able to feel comfortable to enjoy this as one of the most amazing action / horror flicks of recent years. The action is unstoppable, the characters are good, acting is good, special effects are good, there aren't so much plot holes (altough they're inevitable in such a kind of movies...). Comparison with the previous movie will make no good,they're completely different things.<br /><br />There is gore,no doubt about that. There are clichec characters, but the director does an amzing job of giving them some deepness with the time has has at his disposal. Also, director Snyder, a music video director, did not use blinding fast edition to disguise the bad movie he was shooting. No. He believed in the script, so he directed it properly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie. It had glued me in my seat, and I really cared for the characters, even if they were a dozen more than in the original movie.<br /><br />Breathtaking. The sense of coming doom that slowly goes through your senses is somehting I've seldom felt in movies, the sense that, no matter what these guys do, they will die. The director passed this message slowly, with each passing sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NVW4NUXPOSJB.html">A1NVW4NUXPOSJB</a><br/><p>I was curious to see it. Texas Chainsaw Massacre the remake was a great surprise so why not? with the progress made in SFX nowadays, I was thinking, it'll be bloody! I confirm. Dawn Of the Dead the remake is a cool movie. The original version was my fave Zombie movie so I came with the eye of a critic. There's no big difference with the original, the story is quite the same except the end going further.<br />If I remember, the original end, was the two last survivors leaving the mall with an helicoptere. Here they leave on a different way but well, it's cool and well done.<br />The only negative points...<br />1/ The teenager girl who leaves the mall to drive a truck (Yes, she knows how to drive a truck...cool), and crushes hundred of zombies ( yes, she's not scared...cool) to save a dog (yes, she really loves animals to death...cool)<br />2/ When they get to the Marina, they know everything about the boat. They know how it looks and find it right away. Otherwise, they know how to navigate it. You'll understand what I mean.<br />3/ A pity there are not those bad Hell's angels coming over the mall and bring some more massacres..For those who saw the original, they will know what I'm talking about.<p>About the SFX and visual effects, of course they're bloody great. Of course the dialogue is sometimes a bit cheezy and some of the characters a bit ridiculous but well...<br />100 times or more better than the "28 days later" treating the same subject, Dawn of the dead is sick, bloody and I really enjoyed...I believe a sequel will come to light in the following years...when dead have no room left in Hell certainly.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YAABMT80RLYA.html">A2YAABMT80RLYA</a><br/><p>Remakes of modern classics are inevitable, so this new version of George A. Romero's apocalyptic masterpiece "Dawn of the Dead" was about due, more than 25 years after the original was released. What surprised me is how much I enjoyed this remake, in the same way I enjoyed Tom Savini's underrated 1990 remake of "Night of the Living Dead", as an updated version that serves more as a tribute rather than a derivative knockoff. <p>This remake only resembles the original in setting and premise. The zombie pandemic sweeps over civilization overnight, causing widespread chaos from which few have survived. Seven survivors find each other and set up camp in a deserted shopping mall, which is convenient and protected. The survivors are a solid mix: A young sympathetic nurse (Sarah Polley), a grizzled cop (Ving Rhames), a level-headed Joe Everyman (Jake Weber), a young black professional (Mekhi Phifer), his pregnant Russian bride (Inna Korobkina, who has about two lines in the entire movie), and three loud mouthed security guards who cause the required tension. Unlike in the original, the mall itself is merely a setting, a place for survival. There are no satirical stabs at mindless consumerism that the original had, this is strictly a horror movie with a couple choice moments of humor thrown in. Don't expect to see zombies trying on hats or playing in the fountains. <p>Which brings us to the main attraction - the zombies. "Dawn of the Dead" will inevitably draw comparisons to "28 Days Later" for the fact that these zombies are a far cry from the slow, lurching zombies of George Romero's movies. These zombies will run up to you and rip you to pieces before you can look twice. They have no interest in the mall itself, just the people within. They only have one purpose - human flesh, and they are ravenous for it! The big kudos goes to the makeup effects people, who did a wonderful job making these zombies as nasty as possible. Aside from that, this new version has it's share of dramatic moments. Like the original, people bitten by the zombies invariably become zombies themselves, so the survivors have to make tough decisions when one of their own is bitten. The one element that is downplayed slightly is the apocalyptic subtext, where they could conceivably be the only people left in the world. The emotion associated with that kind of reality is not really expressed here. Instead, the filmmakers have focused on the character tension, the death scenes, and those wonderful fright gags that make up jump 10 inches off your chair. Be ready for them. <p>It would be too obvious to say that this remake is not as good as the original, because you simply cannot top a masterpiece, but the remake exceeded all my expectations. The style of filming, the acting (which is for the most part pretty good), and the Romero homages (which any fan will easily spot) make this a fun ride for horror fans, as well as a good introduction for people new to the genre. This will be a welcome addition to my horror collection when it comes out on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>STORY: Ah, zombies. George A. Romero started this genre back in 1968 with 'Night Of The Living Dead'. His little trilogy spawned hundreds of similar like movies and even created a video game phenomenon. Let's look at zombies, the central idea behind them. The living dead is a frightening subject. Think about it, other human's walking and eating others, while dead! The idea of "zombies" without a doubt came from an actual human practice, cannibalism. This is why it is so frightening, at least the idea of it. The movie on the other hand while it does provide its jumps and jolts does not provide "out of your seat" moments.  I did enjoy some of those tense moments though that build up, but was disappointed when they led nowhere! I was expecting a big jolt with a dash of loud music to accompany it but, nope! The movie is entertaining though, and is worth a look at. The original is a classic because it utilized a satirical undertone to the story, and while this movie tries to capture these contemporary satires of human behavior it fails and all we get are a few cheap laughs that feel forced. Yes, the movie does try to use humor but it's literal, not like the original where the humor was more non-direct. I'll tell you though, for first time director Zack Snyder, this movie was not a bad effort.  It has style all over it.  It's just in the end it turns out cliched, and unfortunately does not close the story, so expect a sequel or pre-quel if this one gets a good turnout at the box office.<p>ACTING: The cast is very well put together and they balance each other out. The cast is likeable because it's not composed of dumbfounded teens with chiseled facial features and bouncy breasts in tight tees. Ving Rhames is probably the only person average moviegoers will recognize, and he is the strong point in the ensemble, but in the end the cast's connection is weak.  Mekhi Phifer's relationship with his pregnant wife is horrible because the audience sees no emotion between them, and in the end you feel that he was just using her for incubation. Fun cast, no emotional connection, but looking at them individually will show more strengths rather than looking at them as an ensemble, which is really what the script should of focused on.<p>BOTTOM LINE: I was only pleased because this movie captivated more suspense than action. I'm a big Resident Evil fan, and I know where the game got its creepy claustrophobic environments, creepy music, great characters, and zombie madness from . . . this movie (the original). The film adaptation of Resident Evil was just action madness, this movie is a big improvement that I wish Resident Evil had. I would also like to see `28 Days Later' and compare, because I heard that was more of a sophisticated horror film rather than one aimed at teens, which this one surely is. The original movie was a classic in the same way that `Kill Bill' will become one. A movie that was shockingly gory and fruitless to a point where it's satire. The remake tried to take itself too seriously and try to be too funny at the same time, big mistake. Also, the zombies in this movie were able to run, jump, climb, and do many other physical actions. Zombies are "brainless" beings, they moan, not hiss and growl, they limp around, not sprint, and they cannot think. The zombies in this movie are some kind of hybrid, an ugly one. I like the zombies you find in Resident Evil games, you think of them as harmless stupid things, but yet they are frightening. See this one for a good time, not for a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>How do you remake a film that has become a cult classic?<p>Well, apparently you just do.  And you do it up sort of like the original and sort of exactly opposite the original.  What do I mean?<p>The action largely takes place in a shopping mall, just like the original film.  The characters must learn to live there and make it their home.  So that makes it "sort of like the original".  However, it is there that the similarities end.  In the original film, we had the sense of time passing, that the characters had been there a long time.  In this remake, that isn't the case.  You don't know if they've been there one day or one year.  No mention is ever made.  In the original, there was an emotional reaction to the horrors going on outside.  In the remake, there is but a brief moment where Sarah Polley has a slight cry and that's pretty much it - no one talks about it ever again.  It's as if zombies are something of a pain in the neck and the loss of the character's families is never discussed.<p>Now, how is it exactly the opposite of the original?  In the original the zombies were slow, lumbering creatures obviously suffering from rigamortis.  In the remake, they are lightning quick - even one morbidly obese who, in life, could never have been that quick.<p>In the original, we had the false new society (the characters set up in the mall) breached by the bikers thus allowing the zombies into their midst.  In the sequel its one of their own going outside who does the trick.  This works.  However, there is a single problem with it.  The remaining plot hinges on a stray dog.  A dog that in the course of apparent hours they have trained to perform an action that would quite obviously take days or months even under the best of conditions.<p>Now, granted, I'm not the target audience for this film.  I was the target audience of the first film when it was released in 1979 (actually I was underaged back then).  But, curiosity got the best of me so I wanted to see this one.  Oh, it's gory and it's scary - in a "jump out at you" sort of way.  This may be a GenYer's Dawn of the Dead, but it isn't mine.  It's definitely got a lot more action and moves a lot faster than the original, but I'll take story to action any day of the week.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>Well I saw the movie, a midnight showing.<br />There is about 10 minutes of film before the actual credits start. During this 10 minutes, people were screaming and cheering, it was that action packed. Then when the credits started, people started applauding, the first 10 minutes got our adrenilane up that much!!!<br />It pretty much gets straight to the point, as a group of people run straight to the mall and lock themselves in. Before the televisions go off the air, there is a chilling moment. A preacher looks directly in the camera and says "When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth." Then the characters realize just like the book of Revelations, that it is Armeggedon, the end of the world.<br />My friend I was with was jumping through the whole film. He said he has never seen a movie that made him jump out of his skin like that. You pretty much stay on edge...<br />many young girls got up and ran out of the theater while their boyfriends chased after them..<br />I loved the film, although I think they rippped off '28 days Later' too much. It wasn't really a remake of the original as it was simply based on that movie. I loved the movie, although I could point out weak spots, but over all it was quite a ride!!<br />One hint, when the ending credits start to roll, don't leave, there is more to the story..</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Well... as a longtime zombie fan, I must say that I felt worried when I heard they were going to ramake one of the best horror films ever made. But after reading about it, I understood the film was NOT a basic, simple remake... it was a "reenvisionment".<p>They took the original premisse and worked a new movie into it. ...Simple as that. In this way, I think no "Dawn of the Dead" fan should feel angry about "new guys touching the classic film".<p>This NEW "DOTD" is a completely new film with all the budget, effects and ideas the 21st century can afford (today, this film can do many things it was not allowed 25 years ago!). Like me, the real fans will still feel confortable enough with some references the screenwriter threw in just for our amusement (can you spot them all??).<p>Having said this, I have to admit I cannot choose between the two films (as many people will try to do) because they are so different in so many ways........ anyway... I do believe the simple existence of this "remake" is a great homage to the original film which stays at the cathedral it belongs. Thus, this new version will surelly attract a whole new legion of fans who did not see the original. In fact, it will bring a new (comercial) life to the original - as the Anchor Bay new dvd proves it.<p>Now, about the film....<br />I like it very much. To me, it is better than RESIDENT EVIL (which I liked very much) and better than 28 DAYS LATER (whose 30 last minutes I hated). Mr. Snyder seems to have a strong eye and a great sense of composition. His directing seems firm and sure. Many people may not know, but hes comes from advertising films and I sure noticed his strong sense of pacing.<p>I was also afraid this film would have an "all-too-beautiful" advertising look. Well, it doesn't. It looks real and well situated.<p>The casting seemed also like a good choice. While there are so much more characters than the original film, the chemistry between them, the plots and their backstories are nicely interlaced. I really liked these characters.<p>The major plot news is the fact that this film gives a lot of attention to the sense of confusion the characters go into as they witness the "dawn of the dead"... and its massive impact on society - in this sense, the first 20 minutes of this film are some of the best horror-film setups I have ever seen. Yes, it has lots of scarry moments and you should enjoy every one of them!!<p>Need I say the makeup is over-the-top studio quality?<p>Anyway, I think this film is a terrific horror film. It is fun, scarry, fast, loud... all in the right portions. It should be seen without prejudice. Obviously, the film has a few details I did not like (which I don't think I should discuss here), but I still think this to be a winning project. I hope it film is a huge success and I hope finally Mr.Romero is given the green light to his project.<p>Al last, zombies are fully into mainstream Cinema!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>You can see that this is a different take of Romero's undead universe. The zombies are similar to the ones in Return of the Living Dead, except that the intelligence and spoken words are taken out of context. The scares, despite having more obvious shock effects, do have the same effect as Land of the Dead and the original Dawn of the Dead. It may not have the same cult following as the original, but it is indeed way creepier. It's yet another classic in the zombies genre.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Remakes of classic horror flicks are largely failures.  Zack Synder, however, has reinvented "Dawn of the Dead" for the modern audience--and it comes out a sure-fire winner!<br /><br />Something awful is happening the world over: the dead aren't staying dead.  Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse, wakes up to find a small girl on a murderous rampage; escaping out of the city, Ana meets Kenneth (Ving Rhames, delightfully stoic throughout most of his role), a cop who's searching for his brother.  They meet up with a rag-tag bunch of survivors (led by the enigmatic Michael, played with charm and finess by Jake Weber).  Taking refuge in a nearby mall, they watch their numbers grow...but as more survivors appear, so do more zombies.  And it's only a matter of time before they break in, and the living become the living dead...<br /><br />This movie is suspenseful and horrific.  Not as gory as it's been toted to be, but that's ok; the atmosphere is what really counts in a horror movie anways, and the atmosphere here reeks of pure terror.  Surprisingly, the characters are three-dimensional; the acting is superb, by both the living and the "dead."  The special effects are memorable, and the pacing is fast and frantic.  Yet, there's enough dark humor thrown in to give you some genuine chuckles here and there.<br /><br />Let's not call this film a "remake," after all.  Sure, it borrows the storyline...but it is good enough to stand on its own as a seperate horror film.  I don't know if it, too, will become a classic...but it should.  It's that good.  It's that scary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Man, this is one scary, action-packed movie.  Zombie-o-rama, with a relentless pace from the film's first scene on... Fans of the original George Romero films will not be disappointed... The script, the acting, the action are all first-rate.  Finally -- a scary monster-slasher film where the protagonist's motivations and and actions all make sense, and the kitsch is kept to a minimum.  This is one of the best, bleakest horror movies you'll ever see... and make sure you sit through the credits once the film is "over."</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I might be in the minority here when I say that I have not seen the original, George Romero film. So, I cannot compare the two. I can say that this re-make is one heck of a fun ride from start to finish. It's a real balls to the wall horror film filled to the brim with blood, guts, gore, guns, and explosions. I haven't seen a bloody good time film like this in a long time. The plot is pretty simple and to the point. Some kind of outbreak has the citixens of Everett, Wisconsin turning into cannibalistic zombies wreaking havoc on the town and feeding on human flesh. If you get bit, you are infected. It will only be a matter of time before you are one of them. A small band of survivors from this outbreak get together and take refuge in a shopping mall. The survivors is led by the beautiful Sarah Polley, who plays Anna, a nurse. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a tough cop. Jake Weber plays Michael, a TV salesman, and "ER" actor Mekhi Pfifer is also included. The band of survivors must fend off the intruding zombies and figure out a way to stay alive.  The action pretty much gets going within the first few minutes. It just starts and never stops. The survivors are in the mall within 10 minutes of the movie's start. I like how the movie is shown very normally in the beginning. Anna going home to a perfect, idyllic suburban neighborhood, and then all this breaks loose. The film has a major advantage by having a tremendous, above average cast. Indie darling Polley, and Rhames. Polley is definitley a welcome addition to the horror heroine fold and she definitley holds her own. She's smart, brave, and tough. One of the best heroines to come along in a while. Rhames is a man and actor of incredible presence and intensity. He's perfect in the role of Kenneth. The others are just as good. Character actor Matt Frewer briefly pops up, looking sickly even before he gets sick!. Also expect cameos by make-up genius Tom Savini and original star Ken Foree as well. On an interesting note, Lindy Booth who plays Nicole, and Kevin Zegers who plays security guard Terry, played an ill fated couple in the horror flick, "Wrong Turn". The make-up and gore is zombie-tastic, courtesy of David Anderson(Heather Langenkamp's husband). There is enough death, blood squirting, and heads exploding by bulletts to please all gorehounds. The script is sharp and tight and the characters, thanks to the performers, are all pretty well rounded and formed. There are the typical types of people you would expect to find in such a film in such a situation. The sarcastic jerk, the creep everyone wants to get it, and so on. But what would it be without it and the ensuing conflict that it delivers?. The dialogue is solid and realistic, and it, and the direction, keeps everything moving right along at a frentic, hair-raising pace. I hear about the social commentary used in the first film, but this one seems to not pick up on it much.  There are nice bits of humor here and there, but not enough to make it a laugh type film. The humor is real and comes out of the situations. Like the instrumental muzak version of "Don't Worry Be Happy" playing over the monitor when they first get into the mall. There's more like that. I should have seen the original first, to compare better, but I really don't like doing so. No one is going to think much of a re-make of their favorite movie no matter what. All I can say is that this is a rip roaring film. A real bloody good time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead (Zack Snyder , 2004)<br /><br />The first thing to know about the remake Dawn of the Dead, and you should know this before you go in, is that the only was a fan of the original is going to enjoy the remake is if you consider it as a completely separate film. The basic premise is here (small core of survivors, shopping mall), but the execution is completely different.<br /><br />The new Dawn fits into the new "fast zombie" craze (Resident Evil, House of the Dead, 28 Days Later..., etc). You start off with a nurse (Sarah Polley, from Go) getting off at the end of a very busy day. She goes home, goes to sleep after some gratuitous shower sex with the husband, they wake up the next morning, and their neighbor has turned into a zombie. Uh oh. But not the shambling mound from a Romero movie, a zipping horror that can be across the room and latched onto your throat before you can say "go rollerblade somewhere else willya?"<br /><br />The nurse hooks up with a cop (Pulp Fiction/Holiday Heart's lovely Ving Rhames), the two of them hook up with three other survivors, the pragmatic type who still wants to save the world (Jake Weber [Wendigo/The Cell]) and the young lovestruck pregnant couple who just want to live long enough to have the baby (Mekhi Phifer, recently of 8 Mile, and  ER).<br /><br />You can already see the difference; more survivors (and thus more potential zombie food). But what the movie gives us in expansiveness it sacrifices in content; where the longer, slower original film focused on creating wonderfully complex characters, the new version is concerned with giving you blood and bodies. And lots of both.<br /><br />Which may be, perhaps, the only interesting comparison between the two. Romero's original has less blood, less gore, and by far a lower body count than does the remake. It got slapped with an X, this gets an R. Perhaps it's time to re-release the originals to get the funding for Twilight of the Dead? (One can only hope.)<br /><br />If you look at the new Dawn of the Dead as just another fast-zombie flick, you're probably going to enjoy it. As long as, that is, you liked Resident Evil and 28 Days Later... and didn't think House of the Dead was too terribly awful. Get ready for an awful lot of jumps, some groanworthy humor (especially of the sick variety), and a soundtrack that veers from unlistenable to downright insane (Richard Cheese's lounge version of Disturbed's "The Sickness"). Turn your brain off, you'll have a blast. It's only when you reflect on how much the original pressured you to turn on your brain that you start wondering why they felt the need to make this in the first place. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>The first ten minutes of this remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the dead should have been flaunted on television as it was on the Monday before it's opening on the USA network. What an amazing start, few times am I moved by actions or horrors, (as this is both) but the sheer power and fear generated by this opening sequence is what sets the stage for this film. It is all down hill from there but the film does manage to do what few remakes do, and that is stand on it's own as a decent movie overall.<br /><br />The original Dawn of the Dead kept the zombies in slow motion but never turned away when they got a victim pinned down and the remake doesn't even come close to the violence or pure horror of the original (nothing does, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made).  It does however remain a suspenseful action/horror film that has you rooting for the good guys...and sometimes the zombies.  It is entertaining despite it's flaws.  Director Zack Snyder has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  All of the film's outstanding strengths are directorial in nature.  The cast was also strong.  Ving Rhames revisits his type castings here but is enjoyable despite being written inconsistently.  Sarah Polley breaks her independant film mold and chooses a strange film to do so.  She is a good screamer (albeit very cliche) character.  She pulls it off well enough to conveniently veil the film's writing flaws.  The film has a decent cast in the forefront but drops off big time from there.  You will see the screenplay's very worst lines delivered the way they would be delivered in a Sleepaway Camp film.<br /><br />Speaking of the screenplay, it is the only real stand-out problem.  Dawn of the Dead is unique in that the screenplay is really sort of bunched up in bad dialogue and cheap copied ideas from bad movies, but it is forgiven for the most part by it's surprising aforementioned strengths.  We go by the action/horror film book page by page in this film but it manages to come off as different because of the new zombies we have, compliments to the mainstream success of the remarkably refreshing 28 Days Later.  I will admit laughing out loud at least a half dozen times at some one liners and busting a gut at the celebrity shooting scene on the roof of the mall.  You will too but if you plan on taking this remake seriously you may feel guilty about it.<br /><br />So how does it compare to the original?  Well, Snyder and company played it safe and made a very different film with fast zombies, no consistent or obvious social commentary, a wider and more diluted cast and some very fancy and super cool action shots.  It's colorful, it's packed with explosions, blood and  shooting; it's creepy and the zombies are almost as much fun as they were in Return of the Living Dead.  Unfortunately it sacrifices the depth and sheer terror of the original so it simply cannot be compared.<br /><br />All in all the film's flaws can be ignored because this film worked for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Just when I thought no film on the planet could ever scare the &^%$ out of me, the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" comes along and proves me horribly wrong (no pun intended).  I have seen just about every horror flick that was deemed so-called "Scary" in recent years, but this one tops them all.  I may honestly have nightmares, something I've only had over my failed marriages in those same recent years - LOL.  This blood bath is so frightening I held my own hand throughout the film.  It didn't help.  I jumped out of my skin so often I felt like a 50-year-old iguana.<br /><br />Loosely based on the original film by George Romero back in 1978 (26 years ago), this is a must for every horror fan.  I don't think a film has taken me on this type of ride since "Silence of the Lambs" and "The Exorcist".  Even then, "Lambs" could be considered a "slow" movie when compared to the "Dead".  I had never heard this quote before today's feature.  It explains so well the true nature of zombies:  "When there's no more room in Hell. The dead will walk the earth."  And they do...<br /><br />Many of my colleagues have seen this film.  Two of them told me they walked out of the theatre...1) for the non-stop gore  2) for the scene with the pregnant girl.  Trust me my buds, if you like flesh-crawling terror, this one is for you.  I will be first in line to buy this DVD when it hits the market.  It is so well done (considering the source), I was actually looking over my shoulder during the screening.  This was a lunchtime treat at my local theatre and there were only three people in the audience (it's been out for four weeks).<br /><br />Furthermore, if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs), then you must know what he said in a recent issue of "Entertainment Weekly".  When asked, "So what recent movies have you enjoyed?", Tarantino responded, "I can't believe it, but I really liked the remake of "Dawn of the Dead".  It was terrific.  I don't really expect to see much better film-making in any set piece this year than that.  I was almost offended when (they announced) a remake - I mean, the idea of remaking a George Romero film without George Romero!.  And there are things about the new "Dead" that don't compare favorably at all. In the original, Romero used mostly amateur actors from Pittsburgh and they're giving their all, and you just completely buy into these characters in this world gone wrong.  They become your friends.  It wasn't like a character in a movie just got killed, it was like, Oh, this is horrible.  It had the most intense character study of almost any pure genre movie.  Even the zombies had personalities."<br /><br />Right on, Quentin.  I couldn't agree with you more.  A horror fan???  Ya' gotta see it!  10 is written all over it.  And, like I said, trust me.  I've seen them all and this one honestly scared (...)me.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Why are all the Dead coming back to life? And why are they all rabid Atkins Diet freaks?<br /><br />Zach Snyder's brilliant 2004 remake of George Romero's groundbreaking "Dawn of the Dead" takes up the material of the original, dusts it off, injects it with a syringe chock-full of creepiness, splatter, gore, and raw adrenaline, and goes off-roading into the dark desert of the Apocalypse.<br /><br />This is better than Romero's original. It is terrifying. It makes your jaw drop. It is, possibly, the only cinematic rendering of the Apocalypse I have ever found even remotely believable, and let me tell ya, fellow troopers---every second I was riding shotgun with Sarah Polley's heroine. And given what I saw---flesh-eating monsters tearing up law-abiding home-owners in living color on their front lawns---I had a really itchy trigger finger.<br /><br />"Dawn of the Dead 2004" made me afraid. Very afraid.<br /><br />Let me make this clear: this is the scariest film I have ever seen. Your heart will race. Your blood pressure will rise. Look at the opening credits alone, that grim parade of brutal bloody images of atrocity accompaniesd by Johnny Cash's dismal and revelatory "The Man Comes Around". Yeh, this is the real thing, Old Hoss. Lock and load, yeah; but don't hide. They'll find you and eat you if you hide.<br /><br />In an amazing debut for a novice director, Zack Snyder shoves us mercilessly from the sublime (even boring) into the ridiculous. No, not ridiculous: he shoves us from the everyday commonplace world of adorable skating little girls and 24-hour supermarkets and fast-food and pizza delivery into a latter-day hellscape where your next door neighbor busts down your door in the wee hours of the morning and uses your brainpan as a sausage sampler.<br /><br />I expected nothing when I walked into "Dawn of the Dead", other than 90+ minutes of gut-chewing escapism. Within the first 5 minutes of Snyder's masterwork, I was hooked: my eyes bugged out, my heart pounding.<br /><br />Feel the fear when Ana's (played by the gorgeous, gracious, calm as a bomb Sarah Polley) car smashes into a tree after her narrow escape from being breakfast in her own home. Seriously. Put yourself there. Snyder captures the sort of raw danger only a select few of us feel once in a lifetime, and then only in street riots or war zones.<br /><br />How does Snyder compare to Romero's classic? He takes all that material, pillages Romero's brain cells, and surpasses anything the Old Master accomplished in any of his "Dead Trilogy".<br /><br />Snyder's 2004 "Dawn of the Dead" is a nihilistic classic of gut-chewing horror, and blew me away in its total rebel yell against decency. We get ample flesh chewing. We get a hideously fat old woman in a ridiculously skimpy negligee (who has, mind you, been hauled into the mall where our heroes take refuge---hauled into the mall in a WHEELBARROW) hankering for flesh and demonstrating all the right moves.<br /><br />We get a stone-cold gang-banger Andre (played to the 9MM by the talented Mekhi Phifer) who thinks he got to live in this world to bring his baby into it---and cruelly, nastily, gets his wish.<br /><br />There isn't a single character who lets the flick down: Polley goes from normalcy to hellscape with soldierly resolve. Ving Rhames (Officer Kenneth) dominates the shattered landscape and totally owns the movie. Ty Burrell (yachtsman and resident cynic Steve) and Michael Kelly (security guard turned Mall Hitler CJ) provide a generous helping of humanity at its worst.<br /><br />But let's focus, for a moment, on the true bloody glory of this remake that actually manages to surpass the original: doesn't it feel like Death to you? The Death of Humanity? The Death of Normalcy? The death of going down to the Mall to pick up a CD or videogame and then heading back home to the burbs for a little sleep?<br /><br />The DVD is locked and loaded, too: my personal faves are gunshop owner Andy's video diary and "We Interrupt this Program", part compilation of the slice-and-diced news broadcasts sampled in the movie, part ambitious little indie-film. It's a bit rough around the edges, but taken on its own terms adds depth to the Last Days.<br /><br />Snyder has turned out a classic little flick that goes well beyond the frontiers of the typical flesh-eater outing, and ventures far into the dark territory of the Apocalypse. Golf clubs, the mall rooftop, Richard Cheese's swing rendition of Disturbed's "Down with the Sickness", and some of the sickest, droolingest, flesh-rottingest zombie nutjobs I have ever seen in my life, and you have an open doorway to Hell that is, for now, entitled "Dawn of the Dead 2004".<br /><br />Lock and load and watch the first step---it's a doozy.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.<br /><br />While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.<br /><br />Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.<br /><br />I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.<br /><br />First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.<br /><br />DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.<br /><br />The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardizes the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.<br /><br />There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.<br /><br />Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.<br /><br />I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.<br /><br />This UNRATED HD DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.<br /><br />Filmed in Super-35 the HD DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 1080P widescreen with Dolby THD sound. The picture is flawless and Zack Snyder's high contrast, blown-out cinematography looks utterly perfect. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.<br /><br />NOTE: This 'unrated' HD-DVD is NOT the Director's Cut. The DC lasts 110 minutes while this one barely makes it to 109. A few lines of dialogue are snipped here and there and the naked woman on the freeway has been 'covered up' with bloodstains. Why, I don't know.</p></br><a href="../users/A4UKBG3M5U5TI.html">A4UKBG3M5U5TI</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is, of course, a remake of a sequel - not exactly promising origins for a movie.  However, it's a surprisingly good modern horror flick.  Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter, Go) stars as a young Wisconsin nurse who awakes one morning to an unexplained zombie invasion.  As she flees, she meets other survivors, including Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer.  They hole up in a mall, hoping to escape the fast-moving zombies.<br /><br />First time director Zack Snyder has crafted a first-rate thriller, and the movie really shines in the Director's Cut.  Despite the overabundance of zombie flicks in recent years, "Dawn of the Dead" is surprisingly fresh.  The excellent cast helps make the situations credible; it's a little jarring at first seeing indie queen Sarah Polley in a horror movie, but she more than holds her own.  The action starts right away and never lets up, and the movie includes healthy doses of humor - listen to the muzak playing in the mall as a good example of the twisted humor.  Finally, the makeup and the overall conception of the zombies are outstanding.  The movie clicks on all fronts, managing to be scary and engrossing.  Make sure you watch through the credits - the action doesn't stop!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />DVD Extras: The DVD is loaded with behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a director's commentary.  Particularly enjoyable are the docs that show how they designed the zombies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I had never heard of this movie prior to watching it so I had no expectations at all.  After the first 15 minutes I realized what a predictable plot it was.  There's no surprises in this film, at all.  This is another "horror" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever. It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable. It's a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it's audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>Zombies...the living dead...is there a more misaligned population segment in Hollywood monsterdom?  Perhaps, but on the scale of sheer numbers, they seem to represent the largest group.  In general, they're not evil, malicious beings, but only doing what their limited instincts command them to do...eating the flesh (and sometimes brains) of the living, and when I say living, I mean humans, as they seem not too interested in lesser forms of life like polecats, porcupines, or plankton.  And there's that whole thing of transferring their `undeadness' (I sometimes get a cold from a co-worker, and I find that highly annoying, so I wonder how much worse it would be to catch the death in the same way) to those of us who find themselves in the awkward position of being viewed as a hot lunch for these ravenous creatures, there by propagating the species, if you will.  And let's face it, even if we could work around that whole thing of them wanted to eat our flesh, there's still the issue of rank, flatulent, rotten, putrid, decaying flesh to deal with...also, these creepy, cadaverous automatons suffer from a severe lack of personality, focused solely on the intent of fulfilling their need for our warm, juicy, tasty fleshy parts, inhibiting any attempts to open up a meaningful, personal dialog...oh well, they sure can make for some entertaining viewing...<br /><br />In essence, The Dawn of the Dead (2004), directed by Zack Snyder (S.W.A.T.) is a remake of George Romero's 1978 film of the same name, and a pretty good one, at least in my opinion.  The film stars Sarah Polley (eXistenZ), Ving Rhames (Out of Sight), and Jake Weber (Wendigo).  Also appearing is Mekhi Phifer (8 Mile), Ty Burrell (Black Hawk Down, Michael Kelly (Unbreakable), Matt `what the hell happened to my career' Frewer (Max Headroom) and special effects artist/director/stuntman/actor Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn).<br /><br />The film, set in Wisconsin (that's all we need...zombie cheese heads) opens pleasantly enough, with Ana (Polley), a nurse working in a local hospital emergency room, returning to her suburban home to meet her husband/boyfriend (I'm unsure which).  They share some intimacies and then retire for the evening.  Seems like a pretty good ending to a normal day...enjoy it while you can, as the morning brings forth a whole boatload of bad mojo (and zombies).  As the film progresses, a small group of survivors, including Polley, Rhames, Weber, and Phifer, make their way to a local shopping mall, seeking refuge from the insanity that has ensued, as the epidemic of the dead spreads quickly.  The local, still-living population is ripe for the picking, as they are still unaware of what's actually happening, and the nature of the disease, virus, or whatever...tensions run high as personalities clash and more information becomes available, and those not infected begin to understand the reality of what's happening, and also their new place on the food chain.  Haphazard plans are formulated and tossed about, but how do you escape from something that's everywhere?  No...this becomes an exercise in survival, and a seemingly futile one at that.  Is this the end of the human race?  Are we destined to become zombie chow for the ever-growing legion of the undead?  It's a zombie nation, and we're the minority...<br /><br />I did have fun watching this film, and thought it was done well, despite certain changes from the original.  The direction from Snyder was slick, fast paced, and engaging, showing he's certainly a capable director, able to take an established storyline and infusing a certain amount of creativity, keeping most of the relevant parts, losing the outdated material from the original, while maintaining a level of respect from whence the story came.  I did feel the production lost a little bit of heart from the original film (the group here never really seemed to gel as well as those in the original), focusing more on high-tech special effects rather than the character driven elements of the story, resulting in sometimes 2 dimensional characterizations (CJ the gun totin' hick, Ana the bleeding heart liberal, Michael the somewhat logical pragmatic) that you really couldn't care for if they lived or died.  I thought the actors did reasonably well, but I felt they probably had little to work with, and ultimately wasted at times, which is a big difference for me from the original.  There really weren't any standout performances, but I did like the guy who played Steve (Burrell), the ever-sarcastic pessimist always handy with a smarmy comment.  His part was small, but memorable.  I suppose the biggest difference between this film and the source was the speed of the zombies (who look really excellent, by the way).  I think most of us are used to the shambling, doddering, slow as all out undead, ones we could easily evade, unless their numbers were too great.  Not so here as the creatures moved extremely fast, showing excellent mobility and agility.  This goes against what I would think of how a dead person would move, especially once rigor mortis begins to set.  I suppose this was done to heighten the tension, which it tends to do, but it seems entirely uncharacteristic.  I prefer my zombies to amble about, rather than running around like hyper children hopped up on Pixie Stix and soda pop.  I did like the special effects a lot, especially those of a grand nature (do kerosene tanks really explode like small A bombs when fired upon?)  Gore hounds will find sweet spots throughout, but I was a little surprised at the overall lack of visceral material (what there is is pretty intense).<br /><br />The widescreen picture looks excellent, and the Dolby digital audio is clear and sharp, pretty much what I would have expected from such a recent release.  Included are scads of extra features, listed here adequately enough so I won't do it again, but I did find them entertaining and worthwhile.  All in all, I thought the effort was really good here, albeit superficial.<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is a remake of George A. Romero's 1978 horror movie classic. Whether the remake is as good as the original depends on how your criteria.<br /><br />Technology has made incredible advances in the 26 years since the original's release. The new version, fueled by tens of millions of dollars in financial backing, is a special effects bonanza. In the old days, it was difficult to set up a scene in which a truck ran over one victim. Today, it's easy enough to show five or six victims run down in as many seconds - all digitally, of course. . Less is more has become more is more.<br /><br />The original had a budget of only a few hundred thousand dollars. It was a classic example of the idea that "one's success is based upon one's ability to improvise." Viewed as an example of a low budget movie, Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" succeeded brilliantly.<br /><br />Despite it's technological superiority, this version suffers from the fact that, by definition, it can not be original. The best that can be said of it is that it might be the definitive version of Romero's story, if only he had had the money to make it this way.<br /><br />Having said all that, today's version is entertaining. The story of a killer virus turning people into cannibalistic zombies remains virtually the same. As in the original, the central characters are a band of survivors who hole up in a mall. Their guns and their machismo may be bigger, but their plight is just as hopeless.<br /><br />The new "Dawn of the Dead" should prove exciting and innovative to those who never saw the first one. Those who did see the 1978 version might be a bit disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>To my surprise I really liked "Dawn of the Dead," even in this no holds barred unrated director's cut.  Like many others I considered George A. Romero's original version of "The Night of the Living Dead" to be the classic low budget horror film of all time and I also have a strong sense of affection for the original version of "Dawn of the Dead," with its wry commentary on American consumerism.  So I was wary of a remake, especially given that director Zack Snyder was a feature film novice and writer James Gunn wrote both of the Scooby Doo movies.  But by the end of this film I was grooving to "Down with the Sickness" during what is one of the most unsettling end credits ever.  This had to be one film where everybody stayed in the theater until the light came on and then thought twice before they went outside to their cars, especially if they went to the late show (like a true horror fan ever goes out before dark to see a movie).<br /><br />The basic story is the same as the original.  A group of people fleeing from the zombies get into a shopping mall, where they find another group of people, security guards, who are not really happy to see them.  So they have to hole up in the mall while the number of zombies outside trying to get in grows and grows.  Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop.  They then find Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and his pregnant wife, Luda (Inna Korobkina).  They barely get into the mall ahead of a small group of zombies and then butt heads with CJ (Michael Kely), and his and his sidekicks Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry).  Later on a truck shows up driven by tough lady Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Frank (Matt Frewer) and his daughter Nicole (Lindy Booth), sexy Monica (Kim Poirier), smartass Steve (Ty Burrell), and good ol' Tucker (Boyd Banks).<br /><br />Basically the movie is divided into two parts.  Most of the movie the group is just trying to keep things together inside the mall.  Then in the final act they make a break for it.  The best bits are in that first section and what helps during the great escape attempt is that these people are not too stupid, which is quite an accomplishment for a horror film where stupidity often runs rampant.  In the mall there are two intense scenes, the first involving the decision to kill one of their members who has been bit, and the second involving Luda going into labor (yes, what happens then is even worse than you can imagine).  In between there are some moments of black comedy as they find way to kill time and kill zombies.  Across the street at Andy's Gun Shop poor Andy (Bruce Bohne) is on the roof, all alone, able to communicate with the mall rats by writing messages on boards.  There is some nice pathos with Andy to go with the black comedy of the games he plays with his new friend Kenneth.  Of course, there are also a couple of memorable muzak moments involving grotesque irony.<br /><br />Because this is a 2004 film the zombies have to be seriously upgraded.  Forget the lumbering ghouls of the original films, because these zombies are not only faster but not as stupid.  There are also a lot more of them and the film has a couple of chilling shots and sequences where we get to see wall to wall zombies (or the entire parking lot of the mall filled with zombies at night).  I approve of the changes because it allows Snyder to up the pacing and the horror.  There is also a corresponding upgrade of what the living at able to throw at the dead that would make ol' Hank Hill pretty happy.  Add to this the effective use of the "Aliens" rule, which is that as long as what you are shooting with your big gums are not human, you can blow them to bits and the blood and gore does not really count.  You know what special effects are like today and there are enough zombies getting blown away for everyone to find one or two demises that appeal to their inner warped little child.  Fortunately the three principles, Polley, Rhames and Weber, are all decent people, even in the face of the end of the world as we know it, so you do not feel like you are wallowing in the depths of human degredation (besides the flesh eating zombies).<br /><br />However, given what works in the film several of the DVD bonus features are pretty lame in comparison.  There is "The Lost Tape" that reveals Andy's terrifying last days and basically turns that interesting character into a joke.  Equally painful is the "Special Bulletin" segment, where nobody comes closer in terms of performance or effectiveness to what we get in the opening credits as bits and pieces of information about the collapses of society flash by.  In contrast, the beginning of "Raising the Dead," where we see a hundred extras lined up in zombie makeup, is better than those other two bits.  Then we get the director and prosthetic makeup designer David LeRoy Anderson delineating the differences between Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 zombies in terms of makeup that makes it seem like a totally reasonable way of approaching the universe.  There are other features on the special effects (e.g., "Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads") and a commentary track with director Zack Snyder and producer Eric Newman where they both seem rather pleased with the result, and while this remake of "Dawn of the Dead" is a lot slicker than its competition in the 21st century zombie movie category (to wit, "28 Days Later"), it does have its moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>Well maybe not everything, but it was one of the best horror movies of late, as well as one of the best horror remakes.  Psycho fell a bit flat, not bad, but nothing special.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre was argued over many about how terrifying it was.  This one was a truly scary movie, dealing with several common fears; death, especially when they rise to consume the living, and the fear of disease.  It also deals with some more psychological ideals, as in how would survivors deal with what appears to be the end of the world.<br /><br />The movie starts out simply enough, teasing you with ideas of what was going to happen.  Ana (Sarah Polley) is working late on her shift as a nurse.  There is mentioned that someone was brought in for a bite on the hand and the ambulances tear off before she leaves.  She and her husband are obviously very in love, and while taking a shower miss an emergency broadcast on the TV.  A little girl who seems injured wakes them from their slumber, but then savagely attacks and kills her husband like a feral animal.  While she is calling an EMT her husband dies, gets up, and starts attacking her in the same manner.  She manages to get to her car and escape out of her neighborhood.  But disaster is all around her, packs of people screaming wildly are running through the burbs, cars are racing through the streets crashing more often than not, etc......  She crashes after someone tries to take her car, and after waking up meets Kenneth(Ving Rhames) and another group of people looking for safety.  They go to the mall and board it up with a group of rednecks they found and other survivors and try to figure what to do next.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes of this movie are just about perfect.  It was teasing with the horror, bringing up the tension until we finally see what we paid to see.  Then it goes full tilt until the car crash and the opening credits.  They show tidbits of what is going on through news pieces, and without telling you make it seem like society is collapsing, and now people are more concerned with survival than anything.  The zombies aren't slow moving ponderous(a fact that was argued over by horror fans), they are fast moving almost feral animals.  Society seems to rapidly collapse with extreme chaos, then the only thing that you see is the dead and the small group of survivors.  The survivors are what you would logically expect, a mixed up group of people; crazy rednecks, a yuppie, some kids, truckers, salesman, gangbanger, etc.....  They don't interact well, some of them are outright dangerous, and some are a little deranged.  They go from a point of fear to a point of decadence, society is gone so they can do pretty much whatever they want, no work, no bills, etc.....<br /><br />The bad<br />The acting was a bit lopsided, and though there were more people than in the original, they didn't go into a lot of them with any sort of depth making them feel a bit too dimensional.  They also didn't explore the world around them as much, making it feel more claustrophobic.<br /><br />The good<br />The movie has a fresh feeling to the pacing, starting out as an adrenaline shot then going to a psychological piece, to a survival at all costs ending.  The zombies are used well, never over done, or overused.  The makeup and FX are excellent, especially when you see the progression in one of the featurettes.  The plot was believable, and the character interactions interesting.  The extras were actually worthwhile, they took some effort in this.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent horror movie, and one of the better zombie movies of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ0EO10KTRJ4V.html">AQ0EO10KTRJ4V</a><br/><p>A word to all Hollywood directors, editors and producers....... STOP USING THAT IRRITATING CHOP MOTION DIGITAL EDITING FOR ACTION SCENES !!!!<p>The new Dawn of the Dead remake started PERFECTLY with an opening that casts the proper sense of doom and rapidly escalating chaos.<br />At this point I was thinking... WOW finally a remake that is great and in some ways may even surpass the original.<p>Then as the film progresses, the inclusion of too many characters weakens the development and the movie begins to have a dragging feel that lessens your real interest or empathy for their plight.<p>However, the REAL thing that killed my enjoyment for this film was the last 1/3 of the movie where the final action and resolution starts kicking into motion.<p>The makers of the film chose to film this entire last 30% of the movie in that same irritating grainy, pixelated, choppy, skip frame, digital editing that I first remember seeing used in GLADIATOR'S opening battle scene.<p>Since GLADIATOR this style of action film editing seems to have become the trend for editors and directors to use.<br />It is supposed to introduce tension and energy but instead many people like myself find that instead it DETRACTS from the film as you really can't follow the action and it imparts a fake look to scenes.<br />When you use it non-stop for 30 minutes or so like in DAWN OF THE DEAD's final scenes it becomes downright annoying and removes any feelings of terror or suspense that had been developed in the earlier portion of the film.<p>Standard speed filming would have greatly improved the overall movie.<p>Attention Hollywood..... drop the choppy digital action editing trend..... it's not an effective visual tool..... just visually annoying to try and watch !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>Ok, if you have never seen the ORiginal classic 'dawn of the dead' then this one which basically follows a similiar storyline may be ok. However it's got running zombies and they are still running long after they died. That works in the 'the return of the living dead' series which is part comedy. (still a classic though). but not so well here. The acting is fine  but the detail and social commentary is lost in this movie. It's  a higher budget movie but the filmakers just don't have the soul in the story the first version had.  Taken on it's own?  It's still average for a high budget horror movie. It's lost all the humor of the original though which is a shame. So it's a average horror movie. But running zombies , as in sprinting should be left for the return of the living dead series. The blu ray looks great though and has extras. It should though being a newer movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`Dawn of the Dead' is a pretty decent reworking of a classic Zombie film and whilst it has it's detractors I feel it manages to come up trumps.<br /><br />This follows a group of people who hole up in a shopping mall after a Zombie outbreak and shows how they fight off the Zombies and their own tensions.<br /><br />This has some decent zombie effects and boy can these guys move, much faster than I remember and more scary for a modern audience, I guess, than the shuffling creepy Zombies of old.  Ving Rhames is believable as a gruff cop and Mekhi Pfifer is good as a father who has to deliver his own baby under unusual circumstances.<br /><br />This film manages to be both creepy and action packed in equal measures and is a worthy addition to the Zombie genre.  Don't compare it to the original and enjoy it in it's own right and this should provide ample entertainment for an evening.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A small group of survivors holes up in a shopping mall in order to survive a plague of zombies, who can only be stopped by destroying their brain.<br /><br />Other than the absence of social commentary, the most obvious difference between this film and George Romero's original is the fact that these zombies are fast runners.  This ratchets up the scare factor in the early part of the film by making this version of the undead that much more dangerous and inescapable.  However, it soon becomes clear that the characters in this film, many of whom are inexperienced with guns, will be able to make as many head shots as necessary to ensure that the scenes play out as the script demands.  There are a number of particularly implausible escapes that feel very Hollywood and break the verisimilitude of the story in a way that the original never did.<br /><br />Still, there is plenty of gore and several good scares, even if it does become a bit tiresome by the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I just purchased this remake of Romero's thriller in HD DVD at a bargain price and it's a winner in many ways, an improvement over the original.  Although the original had some political points to make, Zack Snyder's version is more focused on the myraid characters who find escape, temporarily, in the mall.  Also the acting is much better here than the original plus the wide screen and Dolby sound pull you in on the horror that is to come.  Definitely recommended for all horror purists and zombie enthusiasts!  Much better than the "28 Weeks Later" debacle.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead is the 2004 'reimagining'(if you will) of George Romero's low-budget zombie classic from the 70's of the same name. Like the original, the film depicts a handful of human survivors who find shelter in a shopping mall only to be surrounded by swarms of zombies. It's quite different than the original. The film is directed by Zack Snyder(best known for the movie, 300). It stars Ving Rhames, Jack Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Sarah Polley and Kim Poirier. Unlike the Night of the Living Dead remake, Dawn of the Dead was made on a $28,000,000 budget and it shows. The movie itself grossed over $102,356,381 to date and is still doing well in DVD sales. It's a favorite among zombie fans. This edition includes footage that was intended to be in the movie originally but was cut for theatrical release. The DVD offers several other scenes which were not included in any version of the film as well as more. Very entertaining reimagining, if you ask me. I enjoyed it very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>So many people decried the makers of this film when they learned that the classic of all modern day zombie films was going to be remade. Rather than wait and see what the final product was, they chose the low road of attacking it based on their cherished memories of the past, the midnight showings where a world was exposed to the inner workings of creator George Romero's zombie nightmare. They should have waited and judged the final product instead. Not to mention the fact that in allowing his name to be used, Romero is now going to see some financial gain. Buy a ticket and send him some money.<br /><br />The plot is simple and follows that established in 1968 in the original. For some unknown reason, the dead are coming back to life with one thing on their mind, eating the living. There you have it in a nutshell. Now, let's take that story and add in the human elements and you have a tale.<br /><br />This time around the story begins with Ana (Sarah Polley), a young nurse who wakes to find her world turned upside down. An attack by the little girl next door leads to her husband's death and subsequent attack. Ana escapes into a world she doesn't recognize where neighbors attack one another and no help is in sight. After wrecking her car, she meets with a policeman named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and they head out, coming into contact with three other survivors. Together, this rag tag group heads for the mall in the hopes of finding other survivors there as well.<br /><br />Instead, they are attacked by another zombie. Looking for high ground, they head to the elevators only to be greeted by the mall's security guards who ask them to leave. Convincing them to allow them to stay for a while, the group eventually comes to realize that they have a better chance if they work together, even if it takes force for the Ana's group to convince the guards.<br /><br />Going to the roof to search for help, the assembly discovers that none is in sight. Instead, the mall is surrounded by zombies all eager to kill and feed. When a helicopter flies overhead and continues on, they know that they are on their own.<br /><br />The movie offers us a glimpse at how each of the survivors deals with their situation, including another group that drives in and is offered shelter. By this time they have come to realize that a bite from one of the dead results in a quick death and subsequent rise to feast on flesh. One of these later survivors has been bitten and is already showing signs. His daughter is distraught over the possibility of losing her father, but the inevitable happens.<br /><br />Looking for solutions, the possibility of leaving the mall and heading out to the marina where they will take a boat to one of the neighboring islands is discussed. With the chance that the island won't have near as many zombies on it as the mainland, they set out to do just that. Creating a pair of battlewagons from the store's shuttle buses, they head out into a sea of zombies with hunger in mind.<br /><br />Many people who view this will indeed make comparisons between it and the original film. The makers of this one have stated that they are not remaking the film, only offering their version of how it could have played out.<br /><br />One review I read found two major faults this time around. The first was that the movie changed the zombie mythos created years ago where zombies were moving slowly, unable to more fast due to rigor setting in. The other was that there were no personalized zombies as in the first, such as the nurse zombie, the cheerleader zombie, etc. Both criticisms were lost to me as I was engulfed in the story more than the zombies. And the fact that these zombies, as in 29 DAYS LATER, moved with speed and quickness, made the movie more terrifying. As with the old mummy movies, I often wondered why people couldn't avoid a creature that moved with a handicapped gait. The fact that they could move in this movie made them more horrific.<br /><br />This time around, the zombies seem scarier than ever before. The action is plentiful and makes the pacing of the movie revolve around not just the question of how survivors react, but how they will compete when facing off of these hungry creations that live only to eat.<br /><br />The movie is scary, thought provoking and kept me glued to the seat waiting to see what would happen next. While Romero's earlier work was a fantastic film, this one ranks up there as well, offering that second take that the film makers said they wanted to provide. My only gripe? The ending. And no matter how much it disappointed me, I would never reveal it. Go and sit it that darkened theater, alone with a multitude of strangers, and find out for yourself. And wonder all along if any of them might be eyeing you as their next meal ticket.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>It's kind of strange to be reviewing Dawn of the Dead, the 2004 remake of the film of the same name originally done by George Romero. I've never actually seen the original (or any of them for that matter...well except that god-awful Land of the Dead though) so while most people are watching this with a sense of "how does it stack up to the original" while I'm just simply wondering if it's a good film or not. While I prefer my horror films foreboding and creepy, there's at least enough to recommend here, even if it's not exceptionally well-done from beginning to end.<br /><br />Nurse Ana is having a normal day at the hospital with some people mentioning cases of bites but nothing out of the ordinary. After coming home to her husband (or boyfriend?) and falling asleep, Ana wakes up to find her neighbor's kid with blood on her lips and takes a chunk out of Ana's neck. Ana escapes and eventually meets up with some survivors and they hide out in the mall. But these people willing to chomp on them are outside and eventually they'll either get in or they'll be a reason to try and get out.<br /><br />A lot of the older horror films and the films coming out of Asia are mainly concerned with developing a sense of dread and unease; a creepy atmosphere that's meant to make you feel uncomfortable. However, films like Hostel, the Saw series and others are mainly concerned with using as much disgusting stuff happening to their characters, thinking that's what'll scare people. Well it doesn't scare me (in fact, it's mainly a disgust factor, not a scare factor) but it's a bit more tense and action-packed than I'd expect from a horror film and it all starts with the "zombies". Instead of the slow, constipated walk of the old days, these zombies bolt to get to their prey and the film benefits from it.<br /><br />One of the more surprising things about the film is in its casting. Normally these films are littered with WB...sorry, CW veterans that end up getting munched/chopped up so it's weird to see indie favorite Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Pfifer, and Kim Poirier but they also manage to create likable characters. My one gripe is their defenses against the horde of undead after them. I mean, they're in a mall! Surely something must be available in these stores to wail on some zombies but they just make an armored van. Poo.<br /><br />It's a likable zombie film sure although I'm not a big fan of them. Some hate it, some love it while some find it merely entertaining so I'm kind of the last one: it didn't zap under 2 hours of my life but I didn't feel like I gained anything having watched it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F9VH8916IA40.html">A3F9VH8916IA40</a><br/><p>I'm really failing to see the reasoning behind making a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQNAG">Dawn of the Dead (Ultimate Edition)</a> remake, especially when this movie has very little to so with Romero's original zombie classic. I am not one of those horror fans that are against updating old horror films; sometimes a horror movie needs a face lift in order for new generations of horror fans to rediscover the original classics. Unfortunately this new version of Dawn of the Dead doesn't follow even remotely the plot of the original, it just takes advantage of the name (still of the coolest names for any horror movie ever) in order to make more money then it otherwise would have made. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a> the remake was a wonderful homage to the original black and white classic and really could brag being a remake. This movie could have been called any other name, they didn't have to call it a remake because in fact it really isn't, but they did. Don't be fooled, this movie has almost nothing in common with the original so to refer to it as a remake is unfair and misleading.<br /><br />Now, to the movie itself. Set in modern day Milwaukee Dawn of the Dead follows the life of Anna, a nurse at a local hospital, as a strange and unexplained virus brakes out and quickly throws the world into chaos. One night her life is relatively happy, she's talking about taking a three day weekend with her husband and complains about her rude bosses; then the next morning she watches in horror as her beloved husbands neck is bitten off by the neighbor's sweet little girl and sees him turn into a bloodthirsty killer. Escaping from her home, she looks on as the quiet little suburban neighborhood she lives in is transformed into a battlefield as hundreds of dazed and confused people wander though the streets watching their homes burn and their lives fall apart. Mixed amongst these unsuspecting bystanders are dozens of zombies carrying with them a plague of biblical proportions. Within a week social order collapses, in a month there is nothing but silence. Anna manages to survive by escaping with a former cop, a gangster and his wife, and a guy that works at Best Buy to the local fortress, the Crossroads shopping mall.<br /><br />It is at that point this scary and intriguing film starts to fall apart. The director made a terrible mistake by deciding to take Anna out of the chaos so quickly. The five minutes between Anna waking and her escape to the mall are by far the most interesting parts of this movie. The chaos in the streets, the mad scramble by the military and police to make sense of the unbelievable situation, and the random zombies running though the streets almost unnoticed are very chilling and by far are the scariest parts of this film. No other zombie film with the exception of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TJBN80">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a> showed the madness that would result from a crises of this nature. However, it only lasts five minutes. Once they enter the mall they are safe, the zombies can't get in and they can't go out, so any advantage gained by making the zombies sprinters instead of walkers is lost. What good is having a running zombie if the characters are unreachable? of course this is a recipe for disaster as the director realizes his mistake and resorts to petty scares like the classic lights going out gag, and everyone going into the dark and creepy basement, and then zombies popping out of nowhere and yelling "boo." These zombie scenes come off as forced and unnatural, making the viewer suspend their belief far too many times for it to be taken seriously; and this movie desperately wants to be taken seriously. This could have been so much better if they had just made it a spoof, but instead they tried to be serous and ended up with this mess.<br /><br />Although this movie has plenty of memorable moments, it doesn't really add anything new to the zombie genre, unless of course you count the zombie baby which I don't because Peter Jackson already did it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157362408X">Dead Alive</a>. It contains none of the social commentary of the original and relies of cheap scares and mediocre actors far too much.<br /><br />Replay value; mediem.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I have been asked before "why do you like zombie movies so much" and the answer is this; the undead are the one of the few bad guys I know of in horror land that you cannot reason with. You cannot yell at them to "stop" or "wait" or "Jason it's your mother" Imagine being pursued by something so familiar as a human being , knowing that its no longer functioning on your level. It is now a stumbling, or running eating machine that you have to get away from quickly lest it scratches or bites you. The thought of turning into one of them, is incomprehensible. Other monsters such as vampires or werewolves that still have human form retain their intelligence to a point, they can still enjoy a cup of wine or watch Friends on TBS. Zombies, on the other hand, exist only to feed on your flesh , slowly rotting away till there is nothing left but a jiggling mass of putrid goo. We love our lifestyles and we all know that zombies equal the downfall of society, and that's horrific to us!<br /><br /> Filmmakers either get the undead or they don't. George Romero gets it, that's indisputable. He gets them because he gets human nature. Zach Snyder also gets them he just has a different take. Romero's visions have always been based in the sociological mythos, Snyder touches on that but really takes the movie to a more basic level, which is to shock and scare you. Romero's zombies frighten me in a different way than Snyder's, they are shuffling mindless prolific husks who keep coming, ever so slowly to eat you. Snyder's zombies are gory bloody hungry and running at you full speed, they are more like animals, but you don't dare pet them.<br /><br /> I went into Dawn of The Dead expecting to leave disappointed, I thought that it would be a fumbling mess of clich&eacute;s and quick camera work and bad acting. I was so blown away by it that I couldn't believe what I had just seen. It was like going into the "tunnel of blood" at the county fair and the Paper Mache monsters had come to life.  The music was right (and that is so important!), the actors were amazing especially Sarah Polley and Jake Weber. It had slick jokes, mind blowing special effects and I swear I left nail marks permanently in my husbands arm because I was so scared. I was whipped around emotionally, my heart was in my throat, and I was so completely satisfied I almost wept with joy. You really have to get the Unrated Directors cut to get the whole experience; the extra features on the disc were worth it. I love a good commentary.<br /><br /> The only bad part of the whole movie, and I see that other reviewers have pointed this out, was the zombie baby. My problem is the baby itself, not that I am upset by it, just that the effects used weren't good enough so I wouldn't have even tried it. It is really hard to do anything scary with babies without them being animatronically laughable or in this case mediocre CGI.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>imagine that, i bet that'll give a scare. i love zombies, just about any horror flick with zombies will make my day. when this first came out, i had high expectations for it, and boy it sure didn't let me down. the first was great for being what it was, mad props. george romero is a wicked man, in a good sense. he does magic with all of his zombie movies. old and new. it's hard to do it like he does, no doubt. but this one, no doubt was up there as well. my kind of thing, the living dead, the blood, the chase, the victims, chaos everywhere! i applaude it as well. and the fact that the zombies were faster was a good idea. i mean it's creepier when they're slow, but when they're fast it's just excitement cause you don't know if they're going to get you or not. the remake was a good one i got to give it to them. the actors did a really good job, ving rhames is the man. great actor, much respect for him. the makeup was great too, overall it was very satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Well, it's fun if you like end-of-the-world movies as I do.  A terrific cast and taut direction help to make this by turns frightening, depressing, humorous and outrageous.  The opening sequence, with the morning of first attacks and then the opening credits with the song "When the man comes around" by Johnny Cash, is one of the best things ever filmed.  In fact, the soundtrack is one of the strengths of the film.<br />And just to let you know:  zombies are much scarier when they run after you, as opposed to shuffling!</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>This movie was excellent! And I love the fact that although a remake, they didn't follow the original scene for scene, like so many other remakes do.<br /><br />for starters, You just gotta love CJ, Steve, Mekhi Phifer, and the rest.<br />I also like the fact that there were MORE characters than the 4 in the original.<br />I LOVED the humor too- " The fat chick at Dairy Queen-DEAD!"..and CJ always saying "F*ckin Nursery School!"-Steve and CJ just crack you UP !<br /><br /> The only thing I really didn't care for was the running zombies, Zombies just seem more MENACING when they move<br />s-l-o-w-l-y, like in the original.<br /><br />We also don't see as much of the mall as we did in the first,and that was one of the things I found so intriguing...Living in the mall.All in all the storyline in many ways is better than the original,although I liked the original as a whole better.<br /><br />Andy across the way in the gun shop was a nice add on too.And thier escape plan, too was SOOOO cool !  .... Just an AWESOME remake that DON'T dissapoint! I REALLY wish they would make a part two, also.<br /><br />I really hated the very end where we assume they got eaten..they could fix it so they get away, and do a take off from there...I would just really love to see a 2nd part to this,the possibilities are so endless.Anyway, This movie RULES, and is a MUST for any collection!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Only a few more months and Zack Snyder's true cut of his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead will be out on a special dvd edition. This new director's cut should make an already classic in the making horror-film into something even better. Zack Snyder did Romero proud with the film he created and made fans of the zombie-film subgenre howl with delight.<br /><br /> Where Romero used his sequel to his other classic horror film, Night of the Living Dead, as a visual canvas to create an essay on the societal, political and philisophical path humanity was careening towards during the late 70's and early 80's, Snyder just decided to make the best undead-apocalyptic film he could make. This film has some very disturbing images of how a world would look like when faced with an event with &quot;apocalypse&quot; written in bold. The way some of the scenes were shot in cinema verite style looks like some of the news footage they show on tv dealing with riots and realtime battle footage on the ground.<br /><br /> From the first five minutes it kicked me and most of the audience in the gut and doesn't let up. This all happens before the opening credits even come on. I knew Dawn of the Dead was in good hands when Snyder used Johnny Cash's The Man Around The Corner as the opening credits track. The Man in Black's distinctive voice playing over scenes of the world trying to comprehend the sudden rise of the dead to feastt on those still living.<br /><br /> Even the humor that was sprinkled throughout the film had a morbid, twisted, sick angle to them. Those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead will see some of the original actors doing cameos that fit well into the film. But it wasn't just gore and humor. There was alot of humanity in this film. I guess when one thinks they may be the only living people left on earth, sometimes living just to survive may not be enough.<br /><br /> It doesn't mean that this film is lacking in blood and brain-matter. The gorefactor in this film is high, but it wasn't gore for the sake of having gore. This film's basic premise is of the recently dead coming back to life to attack and devour the living around them. I don't think a film with this premise can escape showing a living human being being ripped apart and devoured by a mob of putrefying and hungry zombies. They've actually had to cut back on the gore to get an R-rating for the film. I'm not sure what they cut out, but they skirted the realm of receiving an NC-17. This film ups the standard upon which make-up effects will be set to. They didn't skimp on showing what a bullet and/or a spray of 12-gauge buckshot would do to a human head.<br /><br /> The acting, for a horror film, was good enough that you will care what happens to the survivors. Sarah Polley and Mekhi Phifer are two who had stand-out performances. Ving Rhames was his solid, dependable self. But the two actors who stuck in my mind were Jake Weber's Michael and Ty Burrell's Steve. Weber's Michael was like an everyman --- a calming and levelheaded presence in a world that is anything but. Burrell's Steve had every line which broke the tension and horror, giving the audience a chance to laugh and catch its breath.<br /><br /> If there was a flaw in the film it would be in the uneven feel of the script dialogue. A majority of the dialogue is good, but some weak lines are heard here and there throughout the film. And certain horror conventions and cliches are used, but not too much to turn the film into a Scream-like film that winks and shows the audience how clever the script is.<br /><br /> For those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead and have been trying to find a reason to hate this remake, I say that if you give this film a chance and watch it on its own terms then it will surprise and entertain. Not better than the original but it succeeds in giving this subgenre of the horror field a lifegiving boost. 28 Days Later was a tease of a horror film compared to this remake.<br /><br /> I highly recommend this film to horror aficionados and to film lovers. It may not be Kubrick, Fellini, or Kurosawa, but it doesn't set out to be. It just tries to scare and disturb you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR.html">A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead is generally seen as one of the all-time classic horror movies - particularly in the Zombie sub-genre. George A. Romero made a killing for himself with his "Dead" trilogy (Night, Dawn and Day) and this is the 2004 remake of the second part of that gory trifecta. Fortunately, whilst the film has the same basic premise, it manages to add a whole series of plot twists which are not in the original. This should delight old and new fans alike - why just make a carbon copy of the original?<br /><br />Okay - so what's the basic premise? Well, an unknown disease is ravaging the planet. Once they have suffered a bite from an infected human, the victims rapidly waste away before dying a sudden death. Even more sudden is the re-animation of the corpses. Within 1-5 minutes after checking out, the corpses check back in with a maniacal blood lust that can only be sated by feasting on warm human flesh. The opening scenes of this movie are superb. The introduction of the zombies will have you on the edge of your seat, as they take place in an all-too-familiar everyday environment, giving an air of credibility to an incredible story. This is very much in the mould of the excellent 28 Days Later... and really sets the scene perfectly for the bedlam that follows. The only horror film I have seen recently which delivers such an impactful opening is the darkly delicious Final Destination 2. As the USA descends into hysteria and madness, with family members devouring each other willy-nilly, small groups of people huddle together and feverishly try to find refuge from the growing hordes of psychopathic zombies.<br /><br />Unlike your run-of-the-mill zombie of yore, these mothers don't shuffle aimlessly towards you - they run like the clappers and head directly for your jugular! A dwindling group of ever-more desperate fugitives from the zombie masses include a cop (Ving Rhames), a nurse who has just witnessed her neighbour's daughter rip her husband's throat out (Sarah Polley) and a man who is caring for his heavily pregnant wife (Mekhi Phifer). Gaining entry to a local mall, they are incarcerated by a bunch of paranoid, and power-crazed, security guards. Whilst initially they fully expect to be rescued by the armed forces, as the days pass by there is a growing realisation that there will be no saving "charge from the cavalry" and they will have to work together to fight their own way out of the mall. From the roof they spot a lone man, Andy (Bruce Bohne) on an opposing rooftop - fortunately directly above a gun shop. Communicating with binoculars and whiteboards, they strike up a friendship and determine to pool their food with Andy's guns and break out of their self-imposed prison...<br /><br />The pacing of the film slows a little during the middle third, becoming a little less tense and verging on the repetitive. This is only a relative observation however, because the opening minutes and the final reel are top-notch. The acting is credible throughout and even the dialogue has a refreshing touch of reality most of the time. There are a couple of weak plot points (a budding romance just does not make any sense given the recent history of the characters) and some of the scares are telegraphed too far in advance. The use of exploding gas bottles is a little - forgive the pun - overblown at times too (be careful - your barbie could take out a city block)! The editing too, can be a little frenetic at times, but this is a relatively minor peeve and can be forgiven when you consider the overall vibe of the picture. The casting is quite appropriate, with all of the main characters filling their roles rather well, and some interesting cameos to watch out for with the likes of Matt Frewer (Max Headroom anyone?) and horror royalty Tom Savini (Day of the Dead).<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is a winner. It is by no means perfect - I thought there could have been more black humour in the mix - but it will not disappoint fans of the flesh-eating zombie genre. The film does contain a few jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but the flesh-eating is surprisingly a little under-done. That is not to say the film lacks gore - amputations and eviscerations do figure, but by and large your run-of-the-mill exploding head shot is the main course. This film has much more of an action component than the original, which was a straight up horror flick. In the true spirit of cheap horror flicks though, the obligatory gratuitous breast shots do still make an appearance. The make up special effects are superbly done and there appears to be a satisfying lack of (all too often painfully obvious) CGI on offer (bar the obligatory fireballs, and a couple of helicopter shots). In the main, this is a no-nonsense zombie-smashin', shotgun-blastin', action-horror fest. Perhaps not quite as chilling as the 1978 original, Dawn of the Dead: Director's Cut (2004) will delight fans nevertheless. Highly recommended for zombie aficionados everywhere. Oh - and by the way - it is essential that you watch until the ending of the closing credits as there is important plot information interspersed among them.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Finally!! A Director (Zach Snyder) covered all his bases and put together a fantastic movie that will be remembered for years to come.<br /><br />The opening sequence to DAWN OF THE DEAD is so so good. From the subtle hints of empending doom like the nurse mentioning the man who was taken to I.C.U. from a bite, or the special report coming on the television as our two stars unwittingly take a shower and prepare for bed.<br /><br />When morning comes... you as a viewer feel the dread in the air. We KNOW what the actors DO NOT and it works perfectly. The intense scene that follows, the zombie isn't slow, moaning and dim-witted and the car as ANA (Sarah Polley) drives through her neighborhood, watching the turmoil unfold as the camera zooms higher and higher to show that the world is being consumed by the deadly virus.<br /><br />The movie works on all levels. Screenplay is sharp. Dialogue is crisp. Acting is top notch. The tension has payoff. There is dark humor and a great finale that carries on through the credits.<br /><br />I don't get scared by movies anymore. I've seen too many. Yet, Dawn of the Dead worked, and worked WELL!! If you like this sort of thing... get it! You won't be disappointed!</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>No fiction here folks, we have zombies everywhere, and what better place to see a showdown than where zombies always congregate?  Yes that is correct, a shopping mall!  Overpriced clothes and overrated albums that fill the music store shelves are all obstacles and cover for a supreme setting!  Zombies are everywhere and when they realize that the place where the indoctrination is highest is the mall, which is where they go!  Some humans are there and they are hiding from them.  Now, don't you think that was kind of strange?  If you are going to hide, the mall is one of the last places of resort.  Well I can understand that it is a movie so we need some action followed by a showdown and rescue.  The extra features are so fun and they have the video diary of this goofball who was on the adjacent roof.  This guy was starving to death which of course can show you how even the humans are not always prepared.  I am sure he had some eco friendly water around but realized it was better used to keep the toilet from reeking.  Then it also shows the importance of owning a gun so that you can protect yourself when attacked, because in real life as well as this movie, the police are reactive and not proactive.  And well, we know what happens in the movie when they are reactive, all mankind loses.  A flamethrower would have been a nice touch, but who's complaining?</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>one of the best remakes ever made along with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, hey this one had chainsaws in it too.  great story, awesome effects, scary as hell and good acting, plus tons of gore (excellent effects) and the make up was perfect, plsu watch for cameos from the origional Dawn Of the Dead cast!! a must have!</p></br><a href="../users/A5DIAZ5GT3MC.html">A5DIAZ5GT3MC</a><br/><p>Zach Snyder's remake of George Romero's 1978 cult classic is more of an update than a retread. Aside from its mall setting, a couple of cameo appearances from original cast members, and a few dialouge lifts, this movie is its own entity, which seems to ask why the makers would even release it as a remake? If "Resident Evil" wasn't a credited remake of "Day Of The Dead" then certainly this shouldn't be one of "Dawn". Though in Hollywood where it's much easier to market movies that are based off previously-existing films and TV shows, it's not that much of a surprise as to why the producers chose to go with the "Dawn" title. <p>I was one of the most skeptical of the idea of a "Dawn" remake scripted by "Scooby Doo" movie screenwriter James Gunn but the movie actually provides quite a bit of bang for your buck. The zombies in Snyder's "Dawn" are less the slow-moving creatures from the Romero world and more like the fast-paced infected terrors in Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later". While some Romero traditionalists might view this as "cinematic blasphamy", it does make the walking dead a far greater threat and adds a far greater deal of tension to the film. <p>Like the original, the new "Dawn" involves a group of people trying to survive a zombie plague who take refuge in a shopping center. Instead of only four characters, there are more than a dozen or so, the central being Sarah Polley's good-natured nurse and Ving Rhames' survivalist cop. Also thrown in the mix are a rag-tag trio of mall security guards, a drug dealer and his pregnant girlfriend, and a handful of other survivors. Snyder and Gunn never really explore the type of social commentary that many often associated with Romero's "Dead" films. The characters do argue and have their differences but it only becomes a problem in small portions. Where Romero showed society being ripped apart by its own inability to function in a crisis, Snyder chooses to go more for the "Assault On Precinct 13" approach. Mankind is being wiped out by the strength of its opposition, not by its lack of unity. <p>Zack Snyder's direction of "Dawn" is both hit and miss. The opening five minutes or so are a real poor start but the moment that Sarah Polley's Anna is thrown into the chaotic Wisconsin streets, we are bombared with amazing images of widespread terror. Similiar images involving amusing sight gags and fast-paced imagery prove rewarding but Snyder seems to also suffer from the "Michael Bay" snydrome of throwing in flashy shots for the sake of being flashy. One such case involves one of the film's only major human conflicts in which two characters are pitted against one another in a sort of stand-off. We're treated with all sorts of violent eye candy as blood spills, brain fragments erupt, and we're treated to close-up after close-up of empty shells hitting the floor. What should have been a powerful character moment is reduced to a loud gun battle with about as much emotion as a Super Bowl car ad. A concluding ode to the "Blair Witch Project" also smacks of a director more intruiged by cheap visual flare than good story-telling. Snyder is more or less the Michael Bay to Romero's John Woo. <p>James Gunn's script, while devoid of any of the real character interaction and social commentary that made Romero's "Dawn" such a powerful film, does have a good deal of fun with its content. Having the characters bounce golf-balls off their zombie counter-parts' heads and play a "shooting game" that involves celebrity look-a-likes adds a lot of humor to the film without down playing its intesity. If there is one thing that I can definetly say is done right with this new "Dawn", it's providing tense moments. As mentioned before, the zombies are not slow-moving so escaping from them is far more difficult. The humans aren't given the ability to play around with them like they were in other films. Aside from the quicker zombies, Gunn does his best to stay loyal to the Romero mytholigy though there are some instances where his attempts to create new shocks out of an old premise result in some awful ideas such as a predictable and thorougly cheesy "zombie baby" sequence. <p>"Dawn Of The Dead" is probably one of the better remakes to come out in awhile. While it isn't on the same level as say, John Carpenter's "The Thing", it does do an honorable job of making zombie movies both scary and fun again. It is far more of a stand-alone film than Savini's remake of Romero's "Night", which more or less played the same exact story with a different cast. It also outshines the handful of zombie films, such as Paul Anderson's "Resident Evil", which borrowed so heavily from Romero's "Dead" films. Only "28 Days Later" can really boast doing the job better. I think it would have worked fine on its own merits without using "Dawn" as its title but I'm sure that Richard Rubenstein is happy to get the check in the mail.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Dawn Of The Dead" is brilliantly creepy! This movie is a little bit better than "28 Days Later" because it doesn't seem to stop in the middle of the story. The story is about a nurse named Ana, played by Sarah Polley, whose world is turned around one morning she wakes up and finds zombies everywhere. She finds a group of survivors, headed by, Kenneth, played by Ving Rhames. They go to a deserted shopping mall for shelter. Part of the group of the survivors are Michael, played by Jake Weber, Andre, played by Mekhi Phifer, and Andre's wife, Luda, played by, Inna Korobkina. When they get there, they don't receive a warm welcome by the security guards, CJ, played by, Michael Kelly, Terry, played by, Kevin Zegers, and Bart, played by, Michael Barry. More survivors start to show up. Norma, played by, Jayne Eastwood, Tucker, played by, Boyd Banks, Monica, played by, Kim Poirier, Nicole, played by, Lindy Booth, Glen, played by, R.D. Reid, Frank, played by, Matt Frewer, and Steve, played by, Ty Burrell. There is also another survivor, a gun shop owner on the roof of his gun shop store, Andy, played by, Bruce Bohne. The events that occur are very frightening, indeed. This movie is creepily interesting and powerful moving, at times. This movie is well executed, thanks, in part to its director, a first-time filmmaker, Zack Snyder, whose direction of the movie was brilliant and powerful, without compromise and this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen, better than "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (2003). The performances by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer, are excellent. The rest of the cast are great. The screenplay by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplays to "Scooby-Doo" (2002) & "Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed" (2004), did a excellent job on the screenplay, which is, a great companion to Romero's original screenplay. The music by Tyler Bates is excellent. The cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti is excellent. The make-up on the zombies by David LeRoy Anderson is brilliant and they look really convincing. The film editing by Niven Howie is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook & Joseph Middleton is great. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny and costume design by Denise Cronenberg is excellent. The movie is well executed in every way. This is what why we go to the movies for. Brilliant execution and an well done idea by Zack Snyder.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EAI4948TW53X.html">A2EAI4948TW53X</a><br/><p>Get over it people, and get a life. This movie was awesome. So what if it is a remake of the original dawn? They are both awesome. Other than the mall core concept, this movie is totally different. So stop whining like a three year old girl with a stubbed toe and accept it. You are the same people crying about the new star wars movies. You need to get out more...<p>as far as the movie goes, i said it before, awesome! Does not IN ANY WAY dissapoint. The zombies are fast in this one (like 28 days later) and there are more people in the mall now. I won't spoil it for anyone.

I can't believe I just wrote that! (especially about a remake). Anyway, Zack Snyder sets the tone of horror right from the opening credits and maintains it through the very last end credit. This is no small task. But, hey this guy's obviously got a pair trying to remake Romero. The cast is perfect, the violence abounds and the message is chilling. Snyder keeps the viewer in a state of suspense throughout the film. Call me sadistic but I love the fact that every single one of these characters gets it in the end. What a horrifying thought, nothing but zombies roaming the earth. As for a social commentary, at this point nihilism may be the only thing left to save our sorry world from mall culture and consumerism. A must see, must own DVD for horror fans. Highest Recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead movies have always been something of a guilty pleasure of mine.<br /><br />Let me just say that the 1978 version is much better but just because that is the case do not sell this one short.  The first 25 minutes or so are great the world collapses and people begin a desperate stuggle to make it however they can.  After that the movie kind of falls flat there are several reasons for this.<br /><br />1.  The lack of interesting charecters its like the world ended and only the most depressing annoying people survived.  I can honestly say that other than Steve I felt more sympathy for Andy the guy maroned in the gun store across the street than I did for any of the rest of these people.<br /><br />2.  The movie introduces certain facts and asks us to ignore them I found this to be quite a draining task.  The Zoombies are super strong and have the ability in a group to take a truck and run at super speed and some little glass is supposed to stop them?<br /><br />If the power is out at end than how does the elevator work for the gang to get down to the garage?<br /><br />Overall-The movie itself is not a total waste of time and some of the DVD features including "This just in" and "Andy's Final Days" are very interesting.  Also if you renting the DVD for the deleted parts don't bother they are really crap.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>i was very sceptical when i heard they were remaking a horror classic and amazing film like Dawn, but then when i senn this i absolutly loved it, new take plus a nod to the origional, and the dvd is great, with lots of extras, a must have for anyone.  I have to say if these remakes (TCM and Dawn) are made this good keep em comming!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Some Romero purists no doubt find it a sacriledge that a remake of his classic zombie film was even made.  Yes...the original stands not only as the greatest zombie movie ever made, but also a bonafide horror classic.<br /><br />That said, director Zack Snyder's remake, or re-imagining if you will, has a LOT going for it.  First of all it has a much bigger budget and as a result has better special effects, better production values, and superior acting.<br /><br />Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer are all names and faces that the audience is familiar with.  And look for TVs Max Headroom (Matt Frewer) in a bit part.<br /><br />The Story begins with Nurse Ana (Polley) sleeping comfortably with her hubby in a nice upscale suburb in wisconsin.  Suddenly her husband is attacked by the little neighbor girl and has his throat bitten out.  within seconds he rises from the dead and attacks Ana.  She narrowily escapes in her car and finds the city on fire and people running about madly.<br /><br />Soon she meets up with cop Kenneth (Rhames) and then Micheal (weber), Andre (Phifer) and Andres pregnant girlfriend Luda.  They decide to break into a large shopping mall where they encounter three mall security guards led by the aggressive CJ (Michael Kelly) who have claimed the mall as their own.<br /><br />Later they are joined by another group of survivors as they make the mall their own and later try to flee by boat to what they hope will be small islands uninhabited by zombies.<br /><br />Snyder has taken a page out of "28 Days Later" and instead of making his zombies slow and shuffling like Romero, has made them move at full speed and hell on wheels.<br /><br />This does certainly make the zombies much more dangerous since they are stronger and faster and more difficult to get away from.  You're just not going to run out into a crowd and dodge them or keep them at bay with a torch.<br /><br />On the other hand making them faster makes them less scary in a way.  Because they move so fast you never really get the kind of up close looks at them the way you did in the original.  That's a shame because the FX teams did a great job with the makeup, but you often just catch glimpses of the zombies.<br /><br />One thing this Dawn had that the first didn't was the tough female lead in Polley.  Also standing out was Michael Kelly as the head mall security guard who is a gung-ho rent-a-cop but shines as the courageous leader at the end.<br /><br />While this unrated version packs in some of the gore left out of the theatrical version, it still is not as raw and visceral as the original.  While we have many bites on victims, we don't have the dismemberment, and entrails being torn out and eaten as we did in the original.  Although there were a lot of very well-done effects of zombie heads being blown off and later documented in one of the featuretts.<br /><br />The remake doesn't quite have the undertone of black comedy and social commentary of the original but does have it's share of funny moments such as when gun store owner Andy is sniping at zombie celebrity look-alikes like Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds, as well as a funny part with the security guards taking a quiz out of Cosmopolitan magazine.<br /><br />In all, This Dawn is a welcome addition to Zombie Lore.  Better I think than 28 Days Later and leagues ahead of many low-budget movies, but still not a classic like the original.<br /><br />Great DVD extras cover special effects, makeup, deleted scenesm Andy's secret tape, and more.<br /><br />Well done!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I had seen this movie a couple of times and it's just great. The plot is pretty straightforward, even though it relies mostly on clich&eacute; themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.<br /><br />Sarah Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic. Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge. I just wished the zombies were bit slower because at times it seem a little bit unnatural of the things that they were able to do.<br /><br />First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively though, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves. The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap. What really impressed me about this film was towards the end when they took the boat and landed on an island.... Fulci's next zombie flick took place on an island... nice hand off, someone did their homework.<br /><br />`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film .Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most horror offerings that is dressed to kill. Not as persist as Romero's original (thank goodness), but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>As a fan of the original I approached this remake with extremely low expectations, especially after suffering through the inept Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.  Unfortunately Hollywood execs don't have the cajones to front a big budget Horror movie unless it can guarantee an initial curiosity from moviegoers.  Cue the current remake trend.<br /><br />The original Dawn is considered by many Horror fans to be a masterpiece(yours truly included); it's an emissary from the Golden Age of Gore.  Amazingly the 2004 version updates the original without coming off as cheap or a cop-out.  It works because it plays the Horror straight.  There isn't a big push to infuse humor(although it's there, don't worry), the Horror is center stage and omnipressent.<br /><br />First and foremost the focus is the survival situation. I love the scene where Sarah Polley's character just drives by a woman pleading for help. Instinct has kicked in, self preservation is all there is.  As you watch you get the feeling that each character is acting as they should.  That in itself is a rarity in Horror films.<br /><br />Second is the saving grace for this film and that's the excessive gore.  One of, if not the key elements of the original Dawn was its gore fx (from genius Tom Savini).  This remake really sets a new standard for big budget gore, as in its:<br /><br />A. realistic enough to make you ask "How'd they do that?"<br /><br />B. presented as something new<br /><br />This movie succeeds on both levels and after watching it you will never look at a truck backing up the same way again.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead was not only one of 2004's best surprises it was one of the year's best moviegoing experiences.  Highlighted by an impressive cast including Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and the exremely underappreciated Jake Weber, Dawn of the Dead provides non-stop action and genuinely frightful moments.  Watch the original and then watch this.<br /><br />P.S. Don't forget to sit through the credits!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, "Night of the Living Dead."  This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.<br /><br />The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society.  This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach.  It may seem impossible for someone to actually "dumb down" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here.  For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition.  The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing.  Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original.  There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre.  There's even a very subtle homage to the great "Carnival of Souls," the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his "calling" as "just a job."<br /><br />Although the film isn't really all that scary, "Dawn of the Dead" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>Ha! Okay, I'm probably not the first one to use that review title, but it was such a great moment in the film! Anyway, Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the original George Romero classic zombie flick of the same name. The original film is probably the greatest Zombie film ever made. Second best is probably "Night of the Living Dead," which Dawn was the sequel to. There was also "Day of the Dead," which was the weakest in my opinion, but still good, and a 4th film MAY be coming eventually. This remake, however, is a very different film. Luckily, it's also a very good film.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is the story of (surprise, surprise) a zombie holocaust. A group of survivors holds up in a mall, and eventually, has to escape. These are the similarities between Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and George Romero's original. This time around, however, the zombies RUN, the survivors are larger in number and much more likable and relatable, the story is less social commentary and more action/horror, and one woman is pregnant with a baby that is just... "breathtaking," as a Seinfeld fan might say. All this adds up to a very good movie! Not one to top the original, but definitely loads of fun and highly rewatchable. With each viewing, the closer it gets to the level of the original in my book. It may be my preferences for slow zombies and unexplainable causes that keep the original a notch above for me. The music was perfectly chosen. That jazzy version of "Down With the Sickness" is a new fave of mine. The cast is wonderful, and I'm always ready to watch anything with the heart-melting Lindy Booth. Jake Weber is just fantastic as the TV salesman who was born to lead. Ving Rhames kicks azz, as usual, as the tough guy policeman who can't escape his own sense of empathy. The characters of Steve and C.J., the smart-alec yuppie and the mall security guy, are just hilarious. Sarah Polley, who plays a young nurse who just lost her husband to the plague of zombies, may get a bit annoying in some of her more "bleeding heart" scenes, but she plays the part well; and Mekhi Phifer is extremely believable as a young father-to-be who doesn't want to accept the loss of his dream and the things that are happening to his family. I could go on about the rest of the cast, but suffice to say they are excellent. I've always been a fan of Matt Frewer's (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Psi-Factor, Max Headroom).<br /><br />Director Zack Snyder shows masterful skill in a first feature film, and the gore and effects are outstanding.  There are some really great and unforgettable scenes in this film. The opening, with an adorable little girl turned monster, kicks everything off perfectly, letting you know exactly what kind of film you're about to watch. The relationship between Kenneth and Andy was a wonderful touch, though I still wonder why they didn't go down to the toy store and get some remote control airplanes and helicopters to send food to Andy. Well, if you haven't seen the movie, you have no idea what I'm talking about there, sorry. It's good stuff though, trust me. There's this scene towards the end involving a chainsaw that will disturb you intensely AND break your heart a little at the loss of a cutie-pie cast member. I won't give away who; I don't want to spoil it for ya. That was even worse than the baby scene, I think. It was horrible!<br /><br />This unrated, Widescreen, Director's cut version is awesome! It's not LOADED with extras, but you get plenty, and they're great. There's some behind the scenes zombie stuff, a fun commentary with the director and one of the producers, a great fake news segment chronicling the horrible events, Andy's own home recordings throughout the ordeal, and some fine deleted scenes. Plus, the movie itself has an additional nine minutes of footage not seen in theaters! More character development and more gore! Great flick! Pick it up! Definitely a must for any zombie collection, and, along with "Sean of the Dead," one of the best of the new breed of zombie survival horror!</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>I honestly have to say I am not a horror film fan.  I have never been fascinated (or even very scared) of most horror films with the exception of the very best ones like The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Masacre or The Omen.  Mainly because most horror flicks are just slasher flicks, and if they attempt to be anything more, they are just kidding themselves.<br /><br />With that said, I must say I was very impressed with Zach Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead.  He obviously appreciated the original and did a remarkable job of staying faithful to the horror aspect.  The satirical aspects of Romero's version where people indulge themselves in a materialistic setting has been totally abandoned but certainly not missed.  This one goes more for action, suspense, horror and apparently in this unrated version, more character development.  I never saw the version in the theater so I cannot make the comparison, but I do believe the characters do get fleshed out (no pun intended) quite a bit, especially with Mekhi Phifer's character and his struggle on what to do with his pregnant wife, who may or may not be infected.<br /><br />The best part of this film is that it is an entertaining and well-written story before it is a horror flick.  But fear not (or fear a lot), the horror aspects are extremely creepy, especially in an early scene with Sarah Polley battling off the little girl from the neighborhood.  And as the movie goes on, the amount of gore does not try to make up for a lack of fright.  This is a great movie that happens to be a horror flick with a not so happy ending, especially if you keep watching through the credits.  The DVD extras are great, providing a lot of insight on how the effects were done and some low budget extra mini-movie/documentaries.  But strangely no theatrical trailer is included.</p></br><a href="../users/ATE5SA1VTJNP8.html">ATE5SA1VTJNP8</a><br/><p>What do Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dracula, The Shining, and Vanilla Sky have in common?<br /><br />They are all among the god-awful remakes of classics that hollywood has been cashing in on over the last 10 years because they prematurely dismiss all of the fantastic original horror that is thriving in the underground horror fiction scene.<br /><br />Surely, DAWN OF THE DEAD falls into this category, right? Well, no, not at all, actually.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead 2004 stands on its own as a gutsy all-out splatter flick. Special fx on their own don't impress me, but coupled with interesting characters, witty dialouge, and killer camera work, then they chuff me!<br /><br />Though, I think they overdid it a bit on the music at parts, it was the Johnny Cash tune during the opening credits that really set a strange, eerie apocolyptic tone that is seldom seen in film anymore.<br /><br />I fully expected this to be garbage, but was humbled by the terrific vision and effort put into this project (and Tom Salvini has a cameo appearance!).</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>Nice try filmmakers......but the original version of this classic zombie movie cannot be extinguished with a few more sophisticated special effects.<br /><br />George Romero's original movie from 1978 is still one of the greatest horror films of all time with its touch of humor, graphic gore and subtle political statements it is impossible to better. Zack Snyder has attempted to bring the original story into a new light but in my opinion he fails miserably. The story has changed and the whole concept has been modernized so that the ultimate thrill is found in the updated special effects and new zombie make-up. Sadly even the campy Romero zombies, made-up in the color of sick blueberries, outdo the new zombies. There is just something about slow moving, moaning, flesh-eating dead people, who get to invade a shopping mall and fumble around to "muzak" that just can't be beat. Snyder would have fared better had he chosen to maintain the original film's integrity and storyline.<br /><br />The cast in this film is decent (except for the zombies) with Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Bruce Bohne and Sarah Polley being the most convincing of the actors. The zombies are scary and somehow very fast and strong in this film but the best make-up only enforces the fact that they are made-up actors. Some scenes in this film are better than many others but none really compare to the original film. The best part of this movie lies in the mystery that takes place during the ending credits....don't switch menus too quickly! Zack Snyder gave it a good try but he hasn't created a classic...that accomplishment can only be attributed to a true master George Romero.</p></br><a href="../users/A19V0VJMKKRMC8.html">A19V0VJMKKRMC8</a><br/><p>I got this for my early birthday preasent because i wanted so badly to watch this on halloween night for a good scare.

For the first time in junior high I was actually cool because I saw the film.  It was a savage blend of action, gore, and satire.  It remained my favorite horror film for many years.  I didn't think it could be improved, but I was so wrong.  Zack Snyder's version is a frenzy of action and gore galore.  This film moves at a great pace.  The Director's Cut features extra gore, and some talkie scenes that I can see why they were cut.

I'm a big fan of the original, it had so much impact and is still relevant today, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better zombie movie than Romero himself. But, I gave this movie it's fair shake. I remembered last year's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," and how everyone though it was going to be a bust, yet, the movie improved on ideas from the original and went straight to the jugular with the horror. "Dawn Of The Dead," however, does neither of these things. In fact, this version plays out more like an action flick than a horror. The zombies this time around, not content to lumbering around, are lively than ever (rigor-mortis what?) and go after their food with swift speed and tenacity, which you would think makes a movie scarier. But it doesn't. All I kept thinking in the back of my mind was "What a "28 Days Later" rip-off." Don't get me wrong, I loved that movie, but it shouldn't be the meter-stick by which all future zombie movies are measured (especially since they weren't really zombies in that movie). Director Zack Snyder does an overall good job with the material, as a first time director, you can't discount him much. When viewing the supplemental material on the DVD, you get the sense that he is excited by the material and really loves the genre. The good intentions were there with this movie, but for many reasons, it just unravels. For starters, I found myself laughing in spots that I shouldn't have laughed at (Am I the only one who busted a gut laughing at the part where Ana's husband is chasing her, gives up and then attacks some random lady just standing there?). The movie tried to inject light-hearted moments and some bits of black humor into parts that should have been played a bit more seriously. I hardly felt any tension in this movie (maybe something to do with hearing a swing version of Distured's "Down With The Sickness?"). The characters aren't much to write home about, either. In the unrated cut, there is an introduction done by Snyder himself explaining how much extra character work is injected in the new cut. Boy, would I have hated to see this movie in theaters! What character? Characters go through hell and back, and seem to forget about it all in the span of a few days. One character, who lost her husband and daughter falls for the leader of the group after only, what, a week? The only character who manages to grab the emotional resonance of the situation is Mekhi Phifer's (he's great in this movie). Great actors like Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames are just wasted here and not given much to do. The characters do stupid things and half the time, I can't be sympathetic when they bite it (literally). The good parts of this movie, however, are the action. When something happens, it happens. I loved the part where the zombies were all pressed up against the fence, engulfed in flames. It looked like something straight out of Hell. Also, the gore was top-notch. True to the spirit of the original, there is no C.G.I. present (that I can tell -- I watch a lot of movies). Plus, we get cameos from actors who played in the original (Scott Reigner, Ken Foree, and Tom Savini). But overall, I walked away from "Dawn Of The Dead" 2004 with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth -- which wasn't necessarily inspired by the throwaway ending (what was the point again?) There's cheap thrills to be had and for a first time out, Zack Snyder does a bang-up job. That's why it gets three stars and why I recommend at least one viewing. After watching this movie, I read that Eli Roth, director of "Cabin Fever" was approached to direct this movie, which makes perfect sense. This movie sets out to do a lot of things "Cabin Fever" did, mainly, injecting deadpan humor into deadpan horror. Unfortunately, it just doesn't pan out so well here.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>It's always a gamble to remake a classic even if the original is a low budget independent horror film. Zack Synder's remake of George Romero's 1978 film "Dawn of the Dead" is every bit as vital, scary and gory as the original film. It's also as unique in its own way as the original film. Synder and screenwriter James Russo keep Romero's basic premise intact but go their own way with much of the story. A mysterious virus has caused the dead to be resurrected as mindless, hungry zombies. These guys aren't your typical lumbering, slow motion zombies either. They're fast moving and deadly (much like those in "28 Days Later"). Once you're bitten by one of the living dead, you will die and become one of them yourself.<br /><br />Sarah Polley plays a nurse who hooks up with a police officer (Ving Rhames)and others fleeing the carnage. They take refuge in the local mall (much like the original film). Here they encounter a trio of security guards who have taken control of the site. At first the group of four strangers are kept under lock and key but, eventually, the tables turn. Unfortunately, the flesh eating zombies are always just outside the door waiting to get in. Like the original, the film dives right into the tense action sequences that dominate the first half of the film. Towards the middle of the film the pacing slows down just a little bit as the survivors make their home in the mall and invite other survivors in as well. The character development and performances here make this more than your standard horror movie. I read a review here that stated the person preferred the original theatrical version. I beg to differ as I feel that the Director's Cut is much more complete and allows for the characters to distinguish themselves as to who they were prior to the crisis. This makes characters that much more believable.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks pretty darn good. The greenish tinge to the film, oversaturation of color and dark image quality was inherent in the original theatrical version. There's some minor haloing effects but, other than that and a few digital artifacts, the representation here is very, very top quality. The colors are true to the original theatrical version and the sharp image quality makes this one to use as a demo for a high end DVD system for most of the film. The 5.1 Surround Sound mix comes across with crystal clarity and the surround speakers are well used to drop you right into the middle of the survivor's experience.<br /><br />The unrated edtion has some pretty cool special features as well. "The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed" is a short DVD film that was made specifically for the DVD release and focuses on a gun shop owner stranded on his roof across from the mall who communicates with the survivors via signs. Likewise, the second film "Special Report: We Interrupt This Program" is kind of an extension on the TV footage we briefly glimpse in the movie. It's actually original to the DVD itself and both are unique in that it expands on the original movie's scope and concept. Neither has the best production values nor the best acting but considering that they were made for this DVD release, that's not a surprise. It's like reading two short stories related to a larger novel in that it expands on the experience.<br /><br />We also get a really good audio commentar from Synder and his producer as well as 12 minutes of deleted scenes that weren't put back into this edition. It's clear why most were cut--they didn't work or didn't add anything to the experience. It's still good to have them here. "Attack of the Living Dead" looks at how some of the deaths of people and living dead was created for the film. It might be too much information for some folks. The featurette "Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads" says everything it needs to in its title.<br /><br />All the featurettes are, for the most part, exceptionally good. If you purchased this at Best Buy or one of the other stores, some were including an extra disc with three featurettes. I haven't had a chance to watch this extra disc yet but given that it isn't included here, I'm not going to really go into it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Based in Millwaukee, this film is a non stop thrill ride.

Another guy across from them at a gun shop was stuck too. the zombies don't eat animals just people.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Watched Dawn of the Dead (in its unrated version) last night...<br /><br />In brief, the movie is about the fall of civilization, and how the survivors cope with it, with the cause of the apocalypse is still clamoring at the door, demanding their lives as well. Of course, the cause of the apocalypse this time is the rise of rather feral zombies, and those who die as the result of being bit by a zombie are doomed to have their bodies become zombies as well. This last piece of knowledge is not spread fast enough to prevent the fall of civilization<br /><br />The movie opens as a zombie child bursts into the heroine's home, kills her husband, and then the dead husband turns on her. Fleeing her home in her car, she notices, for the first time, that suburbia has descended into chaos, with zombies roaming the streets, seeking unsuspecting human prey. Eventually, the heroine, and a scattered band of other folks she encounters, retreat to the neighbourhood mall, where they hole up, at least for a time. There, the despair of their situation sets in, as contact with the outside world falls away, and they realize that rescue is not coming, and more and more zombies circle the mall.<br /><br />There is gory violence, a hallmark of movies of this genre. The humour is rather macabre (ref. shooting the Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds zombies out in the parking lot, for fun). There is a hint of desperate sex. Interpersonal conflicts come up all the time: lots of differing opinions as to what to do about their desperate straits, not helped by the fact that they've all had to arm themselves with guns for protections. At the same time, a few of the characters reach out to each other for emotional support, in a rather believable way.<br /><br />The zombies are a means to an end. This is an apocalypse story, and I have seen similar storylines with triffids, with nuclear war, with biological nasties gone awry. The point of stories like this, when told well, is to illustrate how small groups of people can deal with stressful and severe situations. This movie fits into the "thoughtful" end of the horror genre.<br /><br />The movie is replete with gory violence, and is not for kids. For those who are interested in thoughtful horror movies, then this might be your cup of tea.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The newer "Dawn of the Dead" has a simple, yet great opening, in which Sarah Polly (!), the heroine of the film, witnesses the end of the world.  It's a dynamite opening, and as it shows, Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of the George A. Romero classic lives up to its name.  In short, it's a must for any horror fans.<p>The new "DOTD" basically follows the same route.  Sarah Polly's nurse Anna is suddenly attacked by a group of zombies, and is trapped in a shoping mall as a makeshift fort, where she and other survivers have to think of the way of survival.  The "living" include; Ving Rhames (as a tough cop), Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer (and his love), and others, plus a dog 'Chips.'  You can see among them the faces like Matt Frewer, and from the original there are cameos of Scott Reinger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree, all of whom appear on TV. <p>The newer one has made a big change: the zombies run, and run very fast.  While Romero's zombies walked like old-fashioned robot, the updated 'un-dead' run wild, which is really scary.  Though the rule of "bullet in the head" is the same as old, the survival gets harder than before, and consequently the film gives greater number of characters, which have to go one after another.<p>Interesting thing is, this "DOTD" knows that good horror films need inevitably a slight amount of humor (dark ones), and it does not fail to give that to us.  The "KILL ROSIE GAME" played with another surviver who happens to live in a gunshop across the street makes you laugh, embarrasingly perhaps.  It's a guilty pleasure, sure, but what did you expect from a film titled like this?<p>We have two big surprises -- one, you never dreamed of seeing Sarah Polly, who had been in mainly indie films like "My Life without Me," in Hollywood's major horror film.  The casting works tremendouly, because as you know, she can really act (like Drew Barrymore, she was a good example of successful ex-child actor).  Two, the real surprise is that this is the feature debut of director Zack Snyder, whose impressive visual sense matches the storytelling skills.  Want to remake "Superman"?  GIve it to him. <p>Actions are bloody, full of gore splutterd across the screen, but, well, this is supposed to be so, and as such "DOTD" delivers.  The film is appropriately loud and violent, but occasional tongue-in-cheek moments tell us that this is an entertainment.  Not a healthy one, maybe, but certainly gripping and chilling, with a bit of funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>The bigger the budget, the worse horror film you make.<br /><br />This adage has proven dead on the money on this expansive, obviously slicked-up remake of Dawn of the Dead, one of the best (if not the best) horror films ever made.<br /><br />I'd been attempting to watch the recent slate of horror-classic remakes with a fair eye.  Before having seen the actual films, I'd expected this film to be the best of the bunch.  After all, the original Dawn of the Dead was a high-adventure comic-book tale with plenty of set pieces and scope in itself, so how much could they screw it up?  Unfortunately, this one turned out to be the worst of the bunch, by a mile.<br /><br />I'd expected the lack of horrifying ingredients, edge, and risk-taking.  What I hadn't expected was a story devoid of narrative thrust and engaging characterizations.  With the high budgets, long pre-production times and endless rewrites, shouldn't this be the strength of Hollywood features?<br /><br />The Dawn of the Dead remake is first and foremost characterized by its utter lack of interesting characters.  Despite a cast which includes the intelligent, ever-watchable Sarah Polley and rock-solid Ving Rhames, there isn't a single truly compelling performance in this film.  Clearly not the actors' fault, because their characters are big black holes of nothing, indistinguishable from one another.  Mekhi Phifer is especially stuck with a non-character of stunning shallowness, fatally hurt by the wooden presence of Inna Korobkina as his pregnant wife.  The one element that this remake adds to complicate George A. Romero's original zombie concept, and director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn screw it up royally by having these two characters remain complete blank slates.  So when the moment happens, it's more an "Oh, okay" than what it's supposed to be -- an "Oh my God".  In a desperate attempt to make bigger action set pieces and splatter more gore, Snyder and Gunn pile on the characters -- to no avail.  Having something like 16 characters holed up in the mall only serves to make us never care about any one of them.  Romero achieved far more layers and touched on many more facets of the social spectrum with the four characters in his original Dawn of the Dead than Snyder does with over a dozen half-baked characters.  We don't even know most of their names, so they become utter stereotypes -- the "old lady", the "rich boy", the "naked girl", etc.  So when one of them dies, we simply treat him/her as cannon fodder.  When the characters of Ana (Polley) and Michael (a blank-faced Jake Weber) kiss, I groaned out loud -- when did this happen?  Why?  How?  And so what?<br /><br />The story also lumbers along with lots of tiny little obstacles that never add up to anything.  While Romero's original script threw you into the middle of chaos and grips you in a sense of dread from the first minute, it took this remake over an hour before things finally start happening.  And while we're at it, the way exposition is handled in this film is simply amateurish.  "Zombie bites make zombies".  Even if you haven't seen the original film, seems like a pretty easy thing to guess, right?  Well, Gunn's script treats it as if it were a big reveal, a piece of news that will make the viewer go "ahhh".  But I'm willing to bet a brand-new viewer who's never seen the original will have guessed every single one of the setups and payoffs 20 minutes before the film finally reveals it.  And if you're gonna treat the zombie threat as if the Night of the Living Dead films don't exist (a perfectly viable narrative position to take), then work on revealing the zombie threat step by step.  The "little girl attacking the bedroom" scene of this film is just laughable, with no satisfying build and gradual complication.<br /><br />There is one thing this film does well, and that is cinematography.  While the editing is the usual hyperactive music-video nonsense, the look of this film is wackier, less obviously commercial than most Hollywood fare.  And that's a good thing.  While it's still a relatively high-gloss look, the hyper-contrasted look of this film does contribute to the down-and-dirty zombie backdrop.<br /><br />All the story and character issues aside, my biggest gripe about this film is that there wasn't a single moment where I was horrified yet glued -- namely, a single moment of successful horror filmmaking.  Even the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and even Cabin Fever (which I did not exactly like), delivered moments of arresting freakishness and sometimes downright terror.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead did not.  Blood, brains and guts splatter all over the place, but it's all predictable and more loud and obnoxious than terrifying.  So it played more as a slow action film than as a squirm inducer.<br /><br />I didn't expect this film to come up to the standards of the original.  Few, if any, remakes do.  But I did at least expect a film that works on its own terms.  This remake does not -- four or five times I was tempted to turn the DVD off, and I actually did, 50 minutes in, and didn't feel the least bit guilty.  A good film should make the viewer not want to pick up the phone.  This Dawn of the Dead remake is a passable copy, at best, and an uninvolving, loud, semi-interesting mishmash at worst.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>........is because they've only been dead for a day and their bodies haven't stiffened up completely yet.  In the original Dawn of the Dead, zombies had already taken over by the beginning of the movie.  The remake, however, shows us the apocalypse from the very beginning.  But regardless, zombies that run are far more terrifying and I'm glad the change was made for this movie.<p>I remember when I first heard of the production of this movie, I, like so many others, had already condemned this to be one of the worst movies of the year.  After all, why do a zombie remake?  All zombie movies are essentially the same; zombies take over, a group of survivors barricade themselves in some sort of shelter, most end up dying, a few survive.  Logic persists that a filmmaker should just do another movie rather than dishonor a classic.  Stephen King wrote an interesting article in Entertainment Weekly regarding the Dawn of the Dead remake.  He wrote that the original was so shocking because it pushed the limits of what can be shown on film.  There was a classic scene, in particular, were a terrified woman runs into the arms of her husband near the beginning of the film.  Expecting to be safe from the army of zombies, she then looks up towards his face only to find his expression cold and lifeless.  He then takes a huge chunk out of her shoulder.  At the time, that was going too far, Stephen King writes.  Nowadays, that's no big deal.  How could the remake push the envelope like the original did?  Most of time, studios won't even try.  They'd rather do a lackluster job and cash in on the name.  I'm happy to say that the Dawn of the Dead remake has all the elements that made the original so magnificient, as well as pushes the envelope far beyond what any of us expected.  That particular scene in the original....now replaced with an eight year old girl, biting into her bewildered father's neck as blood shoots out in streams.  An obvious homage to the classic scene in the original, but improving upon it.  But it only begins there, this entire movie is non-stop zombie destruction.  Some of the most creative uses of gore I've ever seen in a movie.  Zombies running down the street get their heads splattered in real time with no editing away and then back to the zombie.  A survivor accidently getting sawed in half by a clumsy ally with a chainsaw.  A zombie woman giving birth to a zombie baby and much, much more.  In my humble opinion, this surpasses the original in every single aspect imaginable.  Not only should remakes be this good, but ALL horror movies should be done like this.  This, people, is how it's done.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.<br /><br />While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.<br /><br />Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.<br /><br />I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.<br /><br />First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.<br /><br />DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.<br /><br />The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.<br /><br />There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them `in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.<br /><br />Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the `fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say `crikey!' Yes, the `turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.<br /><br />I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.<br /><br />This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.<br /><br />Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>I loved the original 'Dawn of the Dead'. So much so that when I heard it was being remade, I shook my head and sighed "Well here we go again. Another dud for Generation Xers to sit through while the original reigns supreme."<br /><br />Well it's true and not so true. I like both movies. They both have very good parts. I still prefer the slow moving zombies of the original and older films, but the new Dawn of the Dead has a charm all it's own.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is amazing. As our heroine flees for her life as her husband is turned into a flesh eating maniac in their own bedroom. The little girl was just disturbing in her initial attack on him. As she races out of the bathroom and gets in the car, panic has already taken to the streets. Car accidents, zombies eating their victims on a bus, it's just a total nightmare.<br /><br />Then the plot foolows the original as our desperate heros barracde themselves in the mall. Here they find three security guards who at first are none too welcoming. After everyone gets along the usual fun begins. There's target practice in the parking lot ("Burt Reynolds! Get Burt Reynolds!")<br /><br />A truckload of human refugees arrive and we get more characters to interact with. Before they escape the mall though, The zombie birth and zombie baby is a great scene.<br /><br />In the basement of the mall we get a little McGyver and two trucks are made into Mad Max type vehicles. The plan is to get to a boat and sail off to somewhere.<br /><br />The ending during the title credits gives the film more of an ending than the original did. The original was just a cliffhanger, but we see here in the remake that their survivng the mall was for nought.<br /><br />All in a all a great zombie movie. I realize now that modern zombies move fast thanks to 28 Days, but I prefer the slow stupid zombies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LP6O85Z894GT.html">A1LP6O85Z894GT</a><br/><p>Actually, I rate this film as 3 and a half stars. Also please understand, as one reads my following review that I am generally not a fan of gory films.<br /><br />Now released on a finely packaged DVD, this film "ain't" your daddy's zombie movie. Gone are the somnambulant and passive cannibals of old, content to merely stagger in white-faced blackened eyed conformity in search of mass consumerism. Screaming into their place are now the lightening fast, rabid, bloody-eyed ravagers of DAWN OF THE DEAD, utterly devoted to devouring any and all fools who desire to stand defiant. These are un-dead capitalists with attitudes eager to exploit any weakness.<br /><br />This remake of the 1978 cult classic largely eschews the original's blatant social satire in favor of legitimate chills, thrills and gross-out, not to mentioned a multitude of smart film references appropriate for an audience weaned on DVD's, MTV, video games and Reality Television. It also brilliantly utilizes Johnny Cash's apocalyptic "When The Man Comes Around" for a blood soaked opening title sequence that establishes a mood of alienated unease.<br /><br />Like the original, DEAD concerns the survival efforts of a band of humans barricaded in a shopping mall (complete with delightfully narcotic Muzak!) against a gruesome horde. Fortunately, this version boasts a higher budget, raucous alternative rock music score, stronger actors and smart visual allusions to everything from Poe's "The Masque of The Red Death" to ALIEN, THE ROAD WARRIOR as well as the original film.<br /><br />DAWN OF THE DEAD rightly knows it isn't high art. Its number one objective is to scare the dickens out of the audience and provide some great action sequences and a few obsidian-hued barbs at contemporary consumerist culture. Not afraid to embrace a disturbing and down-beat ending, it wisely knows its limitations and, as a result, achieves its goal.<br /><br />The DVD is filled with a truck load of interesting extras. "Andy's Home Movies" and "The News Reports" are both smartly written and entertaining. The "behind the scenes" featurettes is perfunctory yet fun. It is obvious the filmmakers and actors had a great time creating this blood drenched roller coaster.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>What could be more frightening than waking up one morning and finding out that the whole world is turning into zombies?  DAWN OF THE DEAD is a cataclysmic, desperate film that spares no punches in delineating the hopelessness of such a widespread and untraceable epidemic.  This remake far surpasses the original in its intensity and of course it's a much better made movie.  While George Romero's original is definitely a cult classic, it remains a low budget film that never felt real.  In Zack Snyder's version, the situation seems real and the characters' fate can only be surmised as doomed.<br /><br />An intelligent script and cast help elevate this zombie flick.  Jake Weber as Michael, the nice guy next door type adds a brooding sensualism to his role; Sarah Polley has a tough endurance that makes her very likeable; Michael Kelly as the macho CJ is effective as he starts out as a smartass and ends up heroic; Mekhi Phifer is good in the role of the expectant father who must face a horrible truth; Jayne Eastwood as Norma is reminiscent of every truck stop hostess out there; Ving Rhames is solid in his cop role; and the rest of the supporting cast including Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, do well.  The extras are okay, but they don't add much at all to the movie.<br /><br />All in all, for zombie flicks, this one is up there on top.</p></br><a href="../users/A25PM9JGHPU8EI.html">A25PM9JGHPU8EI</a><br/><p>It's a damn shame the "unrated" cut has to wait until release on dvd; I'd love to see the added splatter and gore on the giant screen. This movie has great zombie action. It's up there with classics like "Dead Alive" and others. I would like to have given this 5 stars; I would have if there were an abundance of close-up, slow-motion shots of zombie heads EXPLODING! That, and an emphasis on chainsaw usage.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>To say the idea of remaking George Romero's all time classic Dawn of the Dead drew a simultaneous groan from horror fans (including this one) is an understatement, but Zack Snyder's big budget remake is a surprisingly solid and fun zombie apocalypse.  Bloody, tension filled, and even filled with surprise twists and turns, this Dawn of the Dead has far exceeded my expectations, and the nicely assembled cast (including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Jake Weber, Ty Burrell, Kevin Zegers, and Michael Kelly, as well as cameos from original Dawn stars Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and FX wizard Tom Savini) does solid work.  James Gunn's screenplay also includes many odes to the original, and even though it does in no way shape or form work character development magic like the original, it doesn't try to, and it's all the more enjoyable for it.  There are those who will no doubt scream blasphemy (most likely the same people who turned their noses against the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake), but this new Dawn is an enjoyable horror fix.  One last thing to Hollywood though: stop remaking classic horror films while you're still ahead.  Not too long ago I heard about a Hills Have Eyes remake, and that idea alone doesn't sit too well with me; what's next, a remake of Last House on the Left?  I really hope not.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>3 1/2 stars actually.not as gory or darkly humorous as the original.there are many moments that are new and that will make you forget that it a remake.it seems as though the director,as many seem to do,has saved the best version of this for the DVD.does it really make sense to go to the movies and see the second rate version?why dont directors put out the best version?oh,yeah,i remember now....WE ARE GULLABLE!WE LOVE READING''DIRECTORS CUT!THE VERSION WE COULDNT SHOW YOU IN THEATERS!''tagline and hollywood doesnt mind taking our money.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>I can't give the film 5 stars because it's no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or CITIZEN KANE.  Also, it gets docked because the original idea came from George Romero, and these filmmakers are putting thier own spin on it.  But other than that...this movie delivers chills, thrills and more than a few solid laughs.<p>I'm a fan of the original, but I haven't seen it in years.  Of course, the special effects in the original weren't so great compared to what we can do today (or frankly, to what Romero did in DAY OF THE DEAD), but I actually remember the original being grosser.  When the zombies caught someone in the original, we got to see disembowlings and lots of chewing on flesh.  YUMMY!!  In the new movie, there isn't time to dwell on it so much. It moves at a brisker pace than the rather long original (it was nearly 2.5 hours if I remember, compared to 100 minutes or so now).  <p>Anyway, surely you know the basic plot by now! Flesh-eating zombies are rising from the grave and making more zombies faster than you can say "nuclear holocaust."  They can only be killed by a shot right through the brain (or perhaps being burned completely) but most people are killed before they have a chance to even try killing the zombies.  A few survivors make their way to a shopping mall, and barracade themselves inside.  The zombies are constantly threatening, but as is often the case in such films, the bickering and power-struggles of the survivors are nearly as dangerous.  Who will live?  That's the ultimate question.<p>The important thing in movies where we take a large cast and kill them off one by one (ALIENS...good,  DEEP BLUE SEA...not so good) is that we learn to care somewhat about the characters. And the movie has VERY little time to sketch the characters, so they have to handle it well.  DAWN OF THE DEAD handles it very well.  Each person is given sharply drawn characteristics, and just enough complexity that we immediately throw our allegiances their way.  Even the "bad guys" have their moments.  In the end, we hate to see ANY humans, even the nasty ones, succumb to a zombie.  And most of the characters get at least one good laugh to their name...so we like them for that!<p>The nominal "lead actor" in the film is Sarah Polley, a nurse, who is the only one of the band of survivors that we meet BEFORE the zombies take over. In a brief, maybe 10 minute, opening, we see her at work, coming home to her suburban town and cuddling with her husband. All around her, little clues about the brewing trouble are being dropped, but we also see very easily how she could be missing them...so imagine her surprise to wake up in the morning to find the world she has known is gone forever.<p>Polley is a good actor who has never gotten big Hollywood recognition because she isn't a traditional beauty.  But, much like in the original DEAD movies, there aren't really any pretty faces in these films.  The aestetic is to give us BELIEVABLE looking people...people we might see on the street.  US!!!<p>Ving Rhames is the other "big" name, along with ER's Mekhi Phifer.  But being a "name" in this movie is no guarantee of making it to the end.  <p>Part of the fun is guessing who's next to go.  And just about every death is different than any other, so that we get to "experience" each loss.  Thus, the movie is brutal, but it feels a bit human too.<p>The action scenes are all tense and well-executed.  And the biggest success of all:  no moments where you say to yourself, "Oh, come on, NO ONE WOULD DO THAT!!!"  There is one case where one of the characters does something VERY foolhardy on her own (involving chasing a dog) but by then, we KNOW that she is a person living on the edge of sanity as it is, so we buy her doing something stupid (which she doesn't pay the ultimate price for anyway).  Otherwise, these are desparate people, often forced to do insane things because they have no choice...not because they made stupid choices.<p>I really enjoyed myself at this film, and if you're a fan of in-your-face horror, you MUST check it out.  It's nice to know that this kind of movie can still be made so well.  With 28 DAYS LATER and now this great remake...it's been a good couple of years!</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>See my review under, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, 2pc....................for the younger group, take time, and check out Romeros original,(1978) maybe it will sink in, skip laughing at the clothes or dialogue, just indulge yourself.

Cuz she turns into a zombie in between the birth and he's still wanting the baby. and then later he gets shot. But before that he has to kill his wife before she gets off the bed and turn him into one. It is one intense movie. Alot of the gore scenes had my pupils enlargening by the second<br /><br />That's how intense and great this movie is. Scary as can be. Intensely great plot. Creepy as heck scenes with the zombies devouring and slaughtering humans. Not to mention all the fatalities. I think this will stay a classic 120 years from now. although I probably won't live to be 120 years old. you can count on this being watched more and more and more every chance I get. It chillled my blood. Dialated my pupils. made my jaw drop wide open more times then I can count. This should get a whole bunch of movie awards if it hasn't already. This is truly one freaky and interesting horror movie. I was hooked from beginning to end :)<br /><br />If you like horror movies with Zombies. see : Dawn of the dead, House of the dead, Night of the living dead, Return of the living dead, and so many others I can't even think of<br /><br />This is one intense movie that was so worth the buy on dvd.

Most horror films today are little more than slice and dice butchery videos. This one is well made, fast paced,  suspenseful, and scary. It rises far above the genre because of good acting and directing. It is still little more than a zombie flick - but one that shows craft.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Flawless? Nah. While this has enough material ot hold any horror fan's interest and more, sorry, folks; I have to say it. Romero's version was still way better overall. The problem with this one was a lack of character development, yeah, but more so, a lack of plot development. Certain points simply moved too quickly, other too slowly. It was more about the zombies than the background behind them, which is the truly important part that makes the first one jell so well. There were just too many jumpy sequences, not enough time allowed to really get to "bond' with any characters, and some truly unrealistic characters and situations. I thought Andy was a nice touch the first one could have benefitted from, but the Chips thing was just fairy-tale time. Using a few original cast members was cool.<br />As far as acting, it was pretty lame. I don't know what Ving Rhames was thinking, unless it was a helluva paycheck. And even the gore level in the director's cut was disappointing; the original was FAR more stomach-churning. And let's face it; in a film based on walking dead people feeding on the living by taking bites out of them, gore should play a definite part. It was a good try, it really was, but Romero's is still #1. See both and you'll understand.<br />PS: If you haven't seen this yet, be careful of a few reviewers who apparently felt they needed to replay the entire plot scene by scene.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region Free<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3 / Advanced Profile 2 (U-Control)<br />Running time: 1:49:12<br />Movie size: 21,40 GB<br />Disc size: 21,96 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 17.10 Mbps<br /><br />DTS-HD Master Audio  English  4288 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 4288kbps (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 1536kbps)<br />DTS Audio  French  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />DTS Audio  Spanish  768 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 24-bit / 768kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />DTS  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / French / Spanish<br /><br />Number of chapters: 20<br /><br />#Audio Commentary<br />#U-Control</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This is okay, but George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is hella better than this, because it is a classic zombie movie that's a sequel to one of my favorite zombie movies; Night of the Living Dead. The remake doesn't seem like a sequel to the Night of the Living Dead remake, but a film on its own. I guess I'm old skool about my horror movies, but good horror movies are hard to find these days. If you love modern zombie flicks, you'll probably like DAWN OF THE DEAD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>I love the original "Dead" series by George Romero. I strayed away from this film for awhile, due to the fact that I'm not a fan of remakes. Anyway, while flipping through channels once, this film was on. So I decided to view this movie, not expecting much of course, however, I was curious about this film. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.<br /><br />A group of survivors barricade theirselves in a mall when an unknown plague causes the dead to rise and hunt for flesh. They are fine at first, but then they start running out of things they need to stay alive, such as food and electricity, and the zombies begin to find ways to get to them.<br /><br />The only flaw I thought the film had is: Zombies aren't supposed to run, or twitch. I know movies aren't real, but they still contain certain laws of nature, and a zombie wouldn't be dashing down the street. In the end, I still prefer Romero's masterpiece. If you want an action film, see the remake. If you want a horror film, watch the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead," as everyone knows, is a remake of a "classic" George Romero movie -- unseen by me.  Perhaps because I didn't have to carry the obligatory baggage of the cult classic with me while I watched this movie, I really enjoyed this "Dawn of the Dead" as a chilling, scary flick that stayed with me well after the final credits roll.<br /><br />The story of "Dead" is about as simple as it gets.  For an unknown reason (while the DVD jacket refers to a "virus," the movie never explains it), corpses are re-animating as zombies . . . with appetites.  How this all gets started is unclear, since it appears that one becomes a zombie by being bitten by a zombie, raising an interesting "chicken or the egg" logical problem.  But you don't watch movies like "Dead" to think deep thoughts -- you watch them to get the bejeezus scared out of you.<br /><br />And "Dead" delivers the goods!  The opening scene is a masterpiece of building tension.  Our heroine, Sarah Polley, a nurse, finishes a long shift at the hospital and obliviously misses several hints that something is going very, very wrong (including changing the radio station just as a critical "news flash" hits the airwaves).  She heads home, chats with a cute neighborhood tyke, and has a romantic night with her husband.  She wakes to find the tyke chewing on her husband's carotid artery, and soon she's fighitng off her husband, now a zombie.<br /><br />She escapes her husband, who gives up chasing her car to eat a neighbor who walked outside in her bathrobe, unaware that the world is coming to an end.<br /><br />Soon, she is in the mall with a gang of survivors, each with separate subplots and varying degrees of likeability.  The mall becomes the survivors' refuge against the rampaging hordes of zombies.  The movie skillfully balances the need for the survivors to occasionally run into zombies for the action scenes with the survivors' intelligence -- we don't have too many instances where we scream "What are you thinking?" to the characters as they wander off by themselves to their doom as in so many other horror movies.  The survivors' generally intelligent behavior highlights the scare-factor -- one is hard-pressed to find instances where we'd react much better than the survivors under the same circumstances.<br /><br />In an effort to avoid spoilers, let's just say that the gore-factor is high, but not overly so (well, once you're somewhat used to the fact that we're dealing with flesh-eating zombies).  There is a subplot involving a pregnant woman that is downright disturbing, but is well-acted and comes across as both terrifying and heart-breaking without being exploitative.  But director Zack Snyder is able to generate tension and scares by implication as well as by direct action, which is always good in a horror movie -- the terror that you imagine is usually scarier than what you actually see.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent horror movie.  Make sure you watch through the credits to see the "real ending!"</p></br><a href="../users/AILBDL6ATVDCJ.html">AILBDL6ATVDCJ</a><br/><p>From the opening scene in a hospital till the last scene of the movie the B-movie effect was a little too strong.  I'm not saying this movie is terrible - not saying that at all.  But I think the movie relied too much on special effects and gore.<br /><br />One of the best ways to pull people into a movie is to make the characters likable.  I found myself not caring, even the slightest, whether any of the main character were ripped to shreds by the zombies.<br /><br />The movie "28 Days Later" managed to do a much better job with this concept.  The characters and dialogue were much more interesting.  I would recommend "28 Days Later" to anyone thinking of buying this film.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>A very lame attempt to reguvinate the franchise that is the dead series. Sure, it has style. But the gore gets reptative, the characters are two dimensional and the plot . . .well, actually there's not too bad on plot. this one ends differently than the original. Way different. On a sharp note you might say. But I would have liked it much more if they used more items in the mall. All they ever did was hang out in the cafe area. Totally lame, man. All that free stuff and you're not going to use it?</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is a good modern horror movie.  I'm glad they didn't go for the PG-13 horror that seems to prevail these days.  The unrated version is even better, leaving in some of the more gruesome killings.  While it is titled the same as the classic Romero picture, it is more of a homage to the man.  Aside from taking place mostly in a mall, the film has all new characters and plots.  Also, the zombies are not the plodding Romero dead, these creatures can move fast.  Some people don't care for it, but I found the movie was very effective with the running zombies.  This is worth having in your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/ANEDXRFDZDL18.html">ANEDXRFDZDL18</a><br/><p>Dawn of the dead stars a nurse whose boyfriend comes down with a strange disease which turns him into a flesh-eating zombie.

Director Zack Snyder utilizes the technology of today to enhance the movies realistic feel. Dawn achieves this realistic quality. In the past few years there have been a string of so called Zombie movies to hit the big screen. Resident Evil, 28 Days Later and Cabin Fever feature the undead.  Zombie movies are popular today because of the video games that feature them. The players can kill the Zombies just like the movies.<br /><br />  Dawn of the Dead (2004) Unrated Director's cut is gory and realistic. Every detail is carefully explored to give a realistic feel if the undead were to conquer the planet today. This movie is scary in the fact of, if this scenario came true, but not scary in deliberately trying to pop zombies out of hidden camera angles that will make you jump out of your seat. (Okay some pop outs!) This movie is more of in your face reality. The pregnancy and baby born scene do nothing to help the movie move along and it should have been just left out.<br /><br />  If you want to see realistic images of killing Zombies and gory blood sucking scenes, then this movie is for you. The unrated DVD should not be seen by children under seventeen; hence the rating. The plot and ended do nothing for this movie but take a back seat to the realistic action/bloody scenes.<br /><br />  I have one question for the Zack Snyder; why Milwaukee? What did we ever do to desire such a horrific setting!<br /><br />  The majority of the bonus features can be skipped. The only ones worth watching are the behind the scenes filming of the makeup/special effects and the deleted scenes with commentary by Zack.<br />  Add this to your DVD collection if you are a realistic Zombie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>Where this is the last place to hid from blood-thirsty zombies.  Dawn of the dead is a remake, just like The grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacere, ect.  But unlike the Grudge and texas chainsaw massacere, in my mind it's a very good sequal, but despite how hard it tries(And believe me, this movie did put effort into it) It just didn't have the magic the original had(Maybe it's because I seen the 1st and expected to much out of this one).<br /><br />This movie stars Sarah Polley who is a nurse who has a nightmae, only to find out that(GASP!!!  OH NOO!!)It's not a nightmare.  It's for-jorkin' real, and everthing is about to get real messy. She then runs into a cop(Ving Rhames) with a big shotgun ann in her face like the media to a celeberty.  When they're cool with eachother, they run onto a everyday guy(Jake Weber) and one bad man with a berreta a pregnat woman(Mekhi Phifer).  The only place left for these band of people is the mall.  But security gaurds are there as well, but insted of help them, they wanna give them the finger, that's until they come up with a messed up truce, and believe me, at a time like that, it's messed up like a totaled car.<br /><br />The one thing I loke about this movie is, no boring introduction, no long tedious explanation, it cuts to the chase like a Cheetah.  You see blood and gore a few minutes in as the movie begins.  The plotline is pretty simple, like it's predissecor, so not much new on the plotline.  You get infected you gotta die.  And the change from slow moving able to walk byable Zonbies to the 28 days later style, try to run without a gun, and you'll get iced kind.  Presents more fear.<br /><br />This movie also has quite a bit of realisim in it.  Like if you wanna live, sometimes you just gotta say to a friend that's dead, better you than me.  And man it shows how loves not only blind but stupid and demented.(I mean seriously why risk my life for one who's already undead and affected.)  But hey, they say love is pain, and pain hurts, and so doeas love.<br /><br />One thing I couldn't stand about this movie is that it has some annoying cliche's ,and stupid stuff in it.  Like most of the protagonists being young people(Seen that in horror films for the past........... jeez I can't remember).  Videotaping sex, while Zombies are outside(Either they're enjoying their last moments, or just don't realize they're in danger.  Having that in the movie was pretty much uneeded and stupid)  Forshadowing(I mean, when the main forshadow is first mentioned, I saw it comming, then it comes, and it's just too expected.)  And dull emotional horse-crap.  I'm serious the ending is so old, it makes Al Pacino looks like he can be in a porno flick.  And like I said love hurts, but in this movie, it feels like every other fake Hollywood crap that makes you wanna say O what and I care.<br /><br />Altho what I couldn't stand, and that crappy ending made my review a 3 stars, everything else before the ending was excellent, but, to me, it's usally the ending that makes a movie.  Why do you think Shawshank Redemption left you with a pleasing end.  Man, I wish more films today would work on endings, but this is definitly a worthy gorefest of a sequal.  I wanna try to get the uncut version, cuz I'm pretty sure it's goryier than what I saw on Starz.<br /><br />peace</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>I've never seen the 'horror classic' upon which this movie is based, so this little review is coming from (a) someone who doesn't even like horror movies and (b) someone who is about 100% less educated about the whole idea behind this film. I, do, though, know when I hate a movie and when I love it, and oddly enough I can't say either about Dawn of the Dead. It's one of those strange, middle-of-the-road movies that I liked enough to sit through, but disliked it enough to not really recommend it to anyone. For one, the movie has enough character development for three typical slasher films, and it might surprise you to know that the whole middle stretch of the film favors that over gore. And it's a welcome change that only occasionally tried my patience. But all the sitting in the mall and fending off the zombies eventually comes to an end, and the movie comes to where it unfortunately stumbles: its long, drawn-out, completely overdone conclusion that you just eventually hope gets the hell over. For a movie that was doing so well up until that point, it commits the sin of overkill and just crams as much in as it possibly can...including over the end credits. Please, would someone tell me why in the hell some directors must stretch the conclusion of their film all the way through the end titles? I think it's called 'lack of talent,' and for all of the intelligent, promising things in Dawn of the Dead, it's the overkill and that finale that takes it from a B- to a GRADE: C+</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Throughout this film, I couldn't help comparing it to the god-awful 28 Days Later, although this is loads better. It's more realistic, but I just couldn't help thinking about the 28 Days Later plotline. (The 'zombies' - a word that is never mentioned in the movie, but is batted around constantly - are eerily similar)<br /><br />Things happen very quickly in the movie, so by the first 10-15 minutes are over, you're left wondering what more could possibly happen, and whether it will just be fillers. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed, and found the movie moved fairly quickly, with minimum slow bits (mainly happening while they're preparing to leave the mall). Compared to the original (which I haven't seen, just heard about), Zack Snyder's version seems a lot quicker, and has been updated a lot more, while inventing a new take on the original.<br /><br />The cast in this include Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and the fabulous Mekhi Phifer. I found there wasn't much character development, all the characters are very stereotypical. Ving Rhames was just thrown in as the tough cop (much like the usual roles he plays, all muscles, and a sensible head on his shoulders). And Mekhi Phifer has a heavily pregnant wife, who doesn't get that involved that much. Neither of their characters do, they just get appear in a couple of scenes, and then get brought back for a spectacular finale. You got a jerk who introduces himself as one and stays one till he dies as a zombie (with a smile on the heroine's face, of course) and a more ruthless jerk (being an armed security guy) who does a complete character flip-flop for no obvious reason - if you don't count the fascination about the sudden topic of the hour: TRUST and uou got a romance without a chance (another twist you can see coming from a mile away) between a nurse-turned-heroine and a TV-salesman keeping the cool head among them.<br /><br />In one of the most memorable scenes, complete with dark humour, Andy, the guy on top of the store opposite, who hasn't yet been bitten shoots down the gathering 'undead' downstairs because they resemble celebrities, earning points with Ving Rhames every time he guesses the right one.<br /><br />The ending kind of ruined things for me, and will probably ruin it for others too. Just when you think they've escaped the madness (although there's a feeling in the pit of your stomach that something bad is about to open), the credits roll, and we see a series of shots filmed by the survivors using a camcorder they find on the boat. There are a couple of scenes of Steve (the owner of the boat they use to escape) and his girlfriend (still left on the camera), then the survivors finding a small boat with a still-animated zombie head in an icebox, and finally them running out of gas and landing on an island where they are attacked by zombies. There are then a series of brief almost-subliminal flashes of zombies "attacking" the camera.<br /><br />Apart from the disappointing ending (I should have begged to have it switched off as soon as the credits started up), I loved this movie, although it's one of those particular movies that I wouldn't want to watch again. (Along with 28 Days Later, which I wish I'd never watched!) Not because it's a bad movie, but because it's just so shocking, and gory, that it'll stay with me for a long time afterwards. Thankfully, I didn't have nightmares or wake up screaming during the night, thanks to someone who wouldn't shift over, and kept stealing the duvet, leaving me freezing! I didn't have a chance to have any nightmares! :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>The original "Dawn of the Dead" still reigns supreme as do films like 28 Days Later - even dare I say it Resident Evil in comparison to this awful half baked MTV borefest.  The film opens promisingly (albeit this only about 5-10 minutes in and that is including the stylishly effective credit sequence with Johnny Cash singing) and then goes completely downhill with characters you could care less about (some of these people are so grating you will want to destroy your television set in total anger), and a shocking absence of any action, suspense or detail in place and atmosphere for thirty or so minutes of the film before it goes into all the blood and carnage which I'm sorry to say isn't really all that as many of these reviewers have said...I have seen much better and on a much smaller budget.  And what is Zack Snyder, the director's obsession with so many shots of falling shotgun rounds...Gets really tedious after the fiftieth time. This is an overproduced film with a terrible script and no sense of focus and believability.  The original film grabbed you in your gut on a purely visceral level as well as stimulating your mind intellectually from a satiric and apocalyptic point of view.  Romero's film had something to say...This remake or repossession as I care to think of it in this case has nothing to say and really doesn't entertain at all.  It's like watching a slow motion car wreck but on that show Real TV with two crash test dummies in the driver's seat while really terrible music and dated 70's music like Christopher Cross is playing in the background.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>This is a very pitiful and sad remake of George A.

It is AN UNWRITTEN LAW in good Horror movies that zombies are supposed to walk in a slow shuffle. No doubt the makers of this film realized that today's youth have a very short  Attention Span thanks to the flashing 3 minute video clips on MTV so they decided to speed things up. Forget this movie and watch the original 1978 Classic if you want to see how it is done properly.I give this movie 5 stars because it does have some "Shock Value".</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I didn't like this movie, first it wasn't even scary at all.

Maybe instead of wasting tons of time in makeup w/ the "dead" ppl they should've spent more time on the plot.

Comedy and horror dont mix, because i cant be scared if something is making me laugh.  The violence isnt anything special, and mostly is just a poor atempt to make it shocking but it doesnt work, especialy when they are sitting around on the roof playing a game to see if some guy can shoot the zombie that looks like a celebrity, yeah thats scary, theyre havin too much fun to try and pull off a scary situation, it seemed like fun to me.  They also never explain why everybody turned into a zombie, at least not in a way that makes sense.  Its also incredibly predictable and you know everything before it happens, its so obvious.  It made me laugh, not necesarily a bad thing but when im watching a "scary" movie i dont want humor, the performances werent anything above soap opera level, the story isnt exactly somethin you could make a good movie with in the first place, so i guess you shouldnt expect anything from this because you will be disapointed, i guess my hopes were to high for movie with zombies that didnt suck, every movie ive seen with zombies does (28 days later, resedent evil 1, house of the dead i cant believe they ruined that game, it was great, the movie was ridiculous, the list goes on...) and this is no exception.  1 out of a 10 for making me laugh, think of it as a comedy and you might not be so disapointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>It's difficult to give a review of a film that's just spent a couple of hours spitting in your face and telling you there's no hope, other than to say: message understood. The pregnancy story line was particularly cynical.<p>The photography was the usual 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigations' garishness that's currently in vogue, and I wish it wasn't.<br />Character action was jarring. The young security guard and the girl who liked the dog seem to have become an item at one point, but God knows when. Editing is frustrating and counterproductive. There was a particularly odd jump cut when they left the gun shop.<p>Ultimately, George Romero just had that indefinable auteur ability to give his original an inner life. He makes you interested in his characters and has an earthy, blue collar sensibility. Deciding against a bleak ending, the final lines of Romero's film make the picture.<p>This remake is strictly business.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this film but it didn't hold my interest past the first 15 minutes.

The remake of Dawn of the Dead shares some of that sensibility.  The classic setup is that, one night, everything is normal, but when the world wakes up the next morning, the apocalypse has come in the form of a war with the undead.  (We've been preparing for it for so long, I'll be a little disappointed if we never have a war with the undead.)  The best part of Dawn of the Dead is how it handles this beginning - the way the central character survives her first zombie attack and heads out of her house to see the chaos that surrounds her.<br /><br />Of course, there is nothing original in this movie.  Lately, the zombie film has been making a comeback and this film is cashing in.  The new model is 28 Days Later, which this film follows; unlike the original, the zombies in this film are strong and fast (where do they get their energy?).  It also steals the "look" of that film, with its strobe-effect shutter speeds.<br /><br />Of course, this film can never replace the original - the earlier film is too important.  However, it is still a good movie.  Think of it as an homage to the original, as opposed to a remake.  In the seventies, George Romero had to work his magic with little or no budget.  The point of this film is to make a zombie film with a big budget, first-class special effects, and good actors.  A lot of the social satire of the film is lost, but it thankfully keeps the bleak outlook of the original films.<br /><br />All in all, it is a worthwhile rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>Not too long ago, in one of my reviews, I expressed my longing for the remake of George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" to prove wrong the hoopla that the mass arrival of classic remakes was to no one's benefit. Marcus Nispel delivered a heavily stylized update of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" that really didn't improve on anything except cinematography (by the same DP of the original). The decision to give these films to virtual unknowns was a huge gamble on the behalf of the studios who financed these remakes, and this time, they got it right. Zach Snyder, with an assured hand and a respectful nod of the hat to his predecessor, has crafted a remake worthy of comparison to the original. Though not half as socially relevant or satirical of the times, this "Dawn of the Dead" blasts from start to finish with a single-minded energy that makes it the best of the remakes so far.<p>The opening of the film, rounding out at about ten minutes from production company logo to "Directed by Zach Snyder", is one of the most compelling, scary, pulse-pounding introductions I've ever seen. It deserves comparison to Takashi Miike's hellacious "Dead or Alive." Complete with Johnny Cash's fantastic musical accompaniment, it strikes a tone that is hard to live up to for the rest of the film, but Snyder does his best, and manages to come out on top.<p>The plot is simple, and has been done before, but rarely with such zest: An unexplained phenomenon (what explanation could possibly suffice?) sweeping the nation is turning human beings into flesh craving ghouls, quick on their feet, and vastly increasing in numbers. The disease, virus, or whatever it is, is only transferrable through the bites of the infected, no matter if it's a tiny nick or an artery-tearing gash. Sarah Polley very simply observes: "Bites killed her. Bites brought her back." Polley is one of the rogue's gallery of survivors that inhabit Crossroads Mall during the invasion, along with Ving Rhames' tough as nails policeman, Jake Weber's sensible divorcee, and Mekhi Phifer's desperate former felon. The acting in the remake is vastly superior to the original, and gives us a wider variety of characters to identify with, which is an important step because of the absence of Romero's looting bikers. These are, for the most part, likable people, and even the ones we would sooner see mauled to death have moments that make us laugh. ("Alright, we draw straws, and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.")<p>The best scenes of the film are between the Ving Rhames character and a gun store owner across the parking lot from the mall, named Andy. They converse through the use of binoculars and dry-erase marker boards, and even manage to play a game of chess. In one hilarious sequence that is on a par with the best satirical moments in the original film, the mall survivors pick out celebrity lookalikes in the zombie crowd and flash their names to Andy, across the way, who picks them off with a sniper rifle.<p>As I said before, "Dawn of the Dead" is pure energized filmmaking of a high caliber. It doesn't try and be Romero's original film, and in that way, it stands on its own, with its satire carefully concealed in its music (when the survivors first break into the mall, "Don't Worry Be Happy" plays over the speakers). The action sequences toward the end are shot half on film and half on digital video (a la "28 Days Later"), and in one effects shot, involving a propane tank and a flare, we get one of those rare moments that inspires applause during a film. This, combined with the performances, great makeup effects, an embrace of the gore that Romero pioneered, and that kinetic opening, make this a perfect companion piece to sit next to the original "Dawn" on collectors' shelves everywhere.</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>...Van Helsing, though other than their makers shared lack of talent and the "meaninglessness" of the so-called story behind them, well, I would not compare them. And I WILL NOT waste any more time on this movie writing a long review on how awful it is made, and what a pointless movie "Dawn of the Dead" is! It is not even bad-funny if you get my meaning, you suffer yourself through this movie -and in the end you feel like one of those damn zombies, I mean: I wasn't expecting intelliguence from a movie with this name, but I expected to be scared, or at least entertained. No, it is just bad -and that's all!<br /><br />The acting is unbelievable (in that negative sence of course), and the lines they throw at eachother must be written by a violent teenager from Harlem or something).<br /><br />Yes, in fact -I'm left with the impression that a kid (or many kids) has come up with the idea of making this sorry excuse for an action-horror-splatter-movie. What a mess, and what a waste!<br /><br />Rent first, do not buy -and watch Braindead or Bad Taste instead (and if you already have, "Dawn of the Dead" isn't anything like those -if again you liked them...).<br /><br />Hated it! UNBELIEVABLE BAD!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is about some people that set up in a mall and shoot some zombies in order to stay alive.  The acting is pretty terrible and the plot is stupid.  If you like watching people shoot flesh-eating zombies with a lot of blood and gore, this is for you.  But, other than that, there is simply nothing to this movie...this is just not enough to keep my interest.  So, if you're looking for a real horror movie or dare I say "scary movie", don't even think about watching this garbage.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>First... you should know there are four versions of this film available. They are:<br /><br /> Widescreen<br /><br /> Fullscreen<br /><br /> Director's Cut Widescreen<br /><br /> Director's Cut Fullscreen<br /><br /> Well... as a longtime zombie fan, I must say that I felt worried when I heard they were going to ramake one of the best horror films ever made. But after reading about it and watching it, I understood this film was NOT a basic, simple remake... it was a &quot;reenvisionment&quot;.<br /><br /> They took the original premisse and worked a new movie into it. ...Simple as that. In this way, I think no &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; fan should feel angry about &quot;new guys touching the classic film&quot;.<br /><br /> This NEW &quot;DOTD&quot; is a completely new film with all the budget, effects and ideas the 21st century can afford (today, this film can do many things it was not allowed 25 years ago!). Like me, the real fans will still feel confortable enough with some references the screenwriter threw in just for our amusement (can you spot them all??).<br /><br /> The premisse is known... It appears that America is turned overnight by a plague os zombies... we see it happens (in one of the best horror film opennings ever made!!!) almost step by step until a group of people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall.<br /><br /> Having said this, I have to admit I cannot choose between the two films (as many people will try to do) because they are so different in so many ways........ anyway... I do believe the simple existence of this &quot;remake&quot; is a great homage to the original film which stays at the cathedral it belongs. Thus, this new version will surelly attract a whole new legion of fans who did not see the original. In fact, it will bring a new (comercial) life to the original - as the Anchor Bay new dvd proves it.<br /><br /> Now, about the film....<br /><br /> I like it very much. To me, it is better than RESIDENT EVIL (which I liked very much) and better than 28 DAYS LATER (whose 30 last minutes I hated). Mr. Snyder seems to have a strong eye and a great sense of composition. His directing seems firm and sure. Many people may not know, but hes comes from advertising films and I sure noticed his strong sense of pacing.<br /><br /> I was also afraid this film would have an &quot;all-too-beautiful&quot; advertising look. Well, it doesn't. It looks real and well situated.<br /><br /> The casting seemed also like a good choice. While there are so much more characters than the original film, the chemistry between them, the plots and their backstories are nicely interlaced. I really liked these characters.<br /><br /> The major plot news is the fact that this film gives a lot of attention to the sense of confusion the characters go into as they witness the &quot;dawn of the dead&quot;... and its massive impact on society - in this sense, the first 20 minutes of this film are some of the best horror-film setups I have ever seen. Yes, it has lots of scarry moments and you should enjoy every one of them!!<br /><br /> Need I say the makeup is over-the-top studio quality?<br /><br /> Anyway, I think this film is a terrific horror film. It is fun, scarry, fast, loud... all in the right portions. It should be seen without prejudice. Obviously, the film has a few details I did not like (which I don't think I should discuss here... ok, I will... I thought the baby zombie was dull!!!), but I still think this to be a winning project. I hope it film is a huge success and I hope finally Mr.Romero is given the green light to his project.<br /><br /> The director's cut does not add too much to the film. The changes I noticed are very discreet... a few more short scenes. I recomend it simply bacause in the case of a good film such as this, why not stay with it 10 more minutes?<br /><br /> More extras?<br /><br /> I loved the news covering the zombie outbreak. They DO look real enough to make you wonder. The documentaries on makeup and f/x are also fine. In short, this is an exemple of good extras and the right way to make a DVD.<br /><br /> Al last, zombies are fully into mainstream Cinema!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Dawn of the Dead (2004): 10 out of 10: I sympathize with the fan boys that feel any remake of Dawn of the Dead is sacrilegious. You get an emotional attachment to films that scared you in your youth. (One on mine is Assault on Precinct 13 that was remade recently and I just know I will be disappointed with the remake. I am still scared of ice cream trucks as a result of seeing that film when I was 9)<br /><br />Remakes themselves have a well deserved bad reputation. (Easiest movie trivia question: What is the best film remake? The Maltese Falcon of course. That Humphrey Bogart perennial was a remake of a 1931 film of the same name. I'm sure back in 1941 that there were a couple of people complaining that Bogart was no Ricardo Cortez and the ruined the story by taking out the affair and homosexual subplots. The first film after all was a pre-code affair.)<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead is in reality a different movie than the original. This is no shot for shot Psycho remake nor is it the same movie with a glossier CGI coat of paint. It is a faster more intense zombie film. It is one of the best action horror films of the last ten years. The opening twenty minutes in simply one of the scariest action packed sequences I have ever seen. By the time our band of protagonists gets to the mall they are not the only one's catching their breath.<br /><br />It becomes a pretty good sized group at the mall and you end up slogging through some slow bits as the zombies eat it down to a more manageable size. The acting is across the board good and the effects are suitably gory and plentiful. Director Zack Snyder wisely dumps much of Romero's sociological subplots and replaces them with a more timely commentary. (Instead of zombies as consumer motif we have shooting undead celebrities. And instead of an outwardly hostile motorcycle gang, we have a more subtle power struggle between the otherwise powerless.)<br /><br />The updates honestly work, as a more literal remake would have simply fallen flat. Is Dawn of the Dead better than the original? I won't say. Is it one of the best films of 2004? Yes. Is it better than Romero's own sequel Day of the Dead? Good Lord yes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>"Dawn of the Dead" is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.<br /><br />THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope?<br /><br />Although the basic plot is the same as george Romero's orginal film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No?<br /><br />I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense "Dawn" is a 5/5 Star film all the way.<br /><br />What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.<br /><br />One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.<br /><br />The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.<br /><br />Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.<br /><br />The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.<br /><br />The threatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of "Dawn of the Dead."</p></br></body></html>

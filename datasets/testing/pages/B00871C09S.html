This thriller explores "what you shouldn't see" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />Photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some ("Miss Torso") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.<br /><br />But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.<br /><br />Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of "Rear Window," that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.<br /><br />Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.<br /><br />Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the "girl who is too good for him," who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.<br /><br />"Rear Window" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous. A well-deserved classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Hitchcock is becoming a treasured family evening activity in our house.  We have more than a dozen of his films in our collection, which draw us in for a forget-the-world experience of suspense and drama.  OK, the characters are not necessarily all that deep, but there is a engaging quality to the films that is a magic all its own.<br /><br />Because of the static setting of the film, this is one of the last ones we watched.  It starts slow, with a relationship that is fraught with tension:  Grace Kelly wants Jimmy Stewart, but he is holding back - because she is too perfect, he says, but also because he fears a basic incompatibility.  She is a fashion and social goddess, he a news mag photographer who is convalescing after an injury sustained by standing in the middle of a race track.  She wants him to stay in NYC and take up fashion photography, where they can go to the finest places, he doubts she would want to give up that world and travel to the jungles of Asia with him.  Kelly, who is absolutely stunning in her prime and reeks of NYC sophistication, is wooing him, the doubter, the pursued one.  With a hip cast, all he has to do is watch his neighbors, quite a roster of characters.<br /><br />THere is Raymond Burr in an unhappy marriage, lonely women, and a newlywed couple, who are active behind closed shades all the time (though the new husband shows signs of reluctance and fatigue.)  It is a wonderful social observation of a happening neighborhood, The Village.  Soon, he observes what he thinks is strange, and has trouble convincing Kelly, a detective pal, and his nurse that something is really going on.  However, with so many signs, Kelly begins to participate, in a way to prove to him that she is not what he thinks she is.  An adventure, largely just observed by Stewart from his room, ensues that builds to a frightening climax.  If ever you doubt that Hitchcock has a certain genius, you have to experience this.  There are also flashes of humor and sexual innuendo.<br /><br />There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  Hitchcock is perhaps the only "old" film director that my kids consistently love.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>By today's standards, a film like "Rear Window" would seem quite uninspired, unoriginal, and just plain derivative (see: Disturbia).  However, when one considers that Hitchcock's "Window" actually SET the standard, it really can be considered a groundbreaking film.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Rear Window" sees photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg, with nothing else to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city-dwelling neighbors.  One neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) in particular, though, arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife.  At first, things seem relatively harmless, until Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, making things a whole lot more personal.<br /><br />Once again, this movie shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of his time.  In 1954, while other directors were cranking out B-pictures, character flicks, or even "variety show" events that did nothing more than draw crowds, Hitch was crafting a spooky tale of voyeurism that still holds up very well to this day.  The directing is fantastic, as Hitch slowly builds the tension to a few scenes towards the end that will make your blood run cold.<br /><br />The acting is also top-notch.  You can't go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly shows that she isn't just a "pretty face" as well.  Raymond Burr (though only uttering a few lines of dialogue) is also intriguing as the antagonist throughout.<br /><br />About the only criticism I have of this film (what drops it from a 5-star to 4-star rating) is that Hitch puts in some character development just for the sake of character development...it doesn't really lead anywhere.  A full 20 minutes could have been cut out in relation to character-building, and the overall product might have been more exciting/better paced.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a great movie that truly stands the test of time.  Whatever you do, don't go for the "remake" Disturbia.  Instead, immerse yourself in Hitchcock's original fare and see the master at his best.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>It took me several viewings over many years before I really appreciated this film. Now I absolutely love it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film.  Having it on a pretty-clear DVD transfer didn't hurt, either.  Eventually, I'd like to see a sharp Blu-Ray version of this movie.<br /><br /> "Rear Window" still dated quite a bit with the dialogue, but the focus of the story, namely Jimmy Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment, never gets old.  It is a storyline which entertains and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart provides the fun and Grace Kelly is there for looks.  The people Stewart observe are really interesting.<br /><br />Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the crowded  apartments keeping their blinds open all the time?  Maybe it was just a more trusting world back in the 1950s!</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>This is my second-favorite Jimmy Stewart movie ( VERTIGO being my favorite of both Stewart's, and Hitch's ). I have always been amazed by the intricacy of the staging, and set design in this beautifully, and brilliantly orchestrated psychological thriller, that juggles droll humor, social commentary, and mounting suspense with such aplomb, and twisted, though, surgeon-like precision. REAR WINDOW is an exquisite film, and should be in any serious collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MX6D3JK6IKDW.html">A1MX6D3JK6IKDW</a><br/><p>When Alfred Hitchcock offered the lead role in this film to Jimmy Stewart in 1954, Stewart was reluctant:"Gee, that didn't seem like much of a part. But, Hitch could do that..create a good film out of next to nothing." So, Hitchcock paired Stewart with Grace Kelly (old enough to be his daughter) and came up with a gem. which seems to have faded a bit with time. Laid up with a broken leg, Stewart all but rejects his girlfriend, Kelly, preferring to snoop on the neighbors with a pair of binoculars. Just imagine a Matt Damon or a Leo DiCaprio pulling a stunt like this today with a Kate Winslet type, Anyway, Stewart"s  reconnaissance missions eventually turn up what he's convinced is a wife murderer; the type that likes to dismember his victim. But our voyeur is having the darndest time convincing police officer Corey until... This is still a very good movie, well worth your time. But time does change one's perspective, especially after 53 years.</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>Hitchcock remembered that Joseph Cotten`s wife almost panicked toward the end of the film when they watched it at the premiere.<br /><br />The film owes a lot to script, Edith Head, scenic design, James Stewart, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr. Grace Kelly is visually right, but her speaking voice is phony and a letdown. Indeed her siblings teased her when she came home to Philadelphia on visit. She sounds like Norwegian actress Greta Gynt in the thriller TAKE MY LIFE.<br /><br />But the suspense is great and it IS HITCHCOCK at his very best.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CW9IQAPFEYLM.html">A2CW9IQAPFEYLM</a><br/><p>Jimmy Stewart is a photojournalist confined to a wheelchair in his apartment with a broken leg. He spends most of his time gazing out the window at his neighbors, until one day he sees something that looks like a murder taking place. Grace Kelly plays his lover; she wants to marry him, but he thinks her pampered life makes her unsuitable for the rough life he leads. She, of course, leads the way in the dangerous murder probe they set out upon. It's to Hitchcock's credit that he had Kelly believe Stewart's story almost from the start, so we don't have to endure his trying to convince her it's true. (It also allows the picture to focus on its single point: she's no mamby-pamby and can do anything Stewart can.) The early going is rather slow - only the snappy dialogue saves it, though the suspense builds nicely near the end. Thelma Ritter is very good as Stewart's nurse - she has most of the wisecracking lines. The camera never leaves the apartment or the courtyard: Hitchcock loved the single setting idea during this time (see also ROPE AND LIFEBOAT). Definitely worth a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>While I do prefer psycho over this one, Rear Window still is a masterpiece of one of Hitchcock's best. The cast has two greats in Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, the music is classic, the suspense is fanastic, and the plot's perdect. The plot is centered around a photographer played by Jimmy Stewart who is sidelined because of an accident. He thus is in a wheelchair and lives life by inspecting and observing everyone in the neighborhood. He has his binoculars and learns that one person might be an opera singer, and another might be a writer. That's what he does the whole day. What's so fantastic about this is a study of people and their hobbies and jobs. The photographer has nothing to do and can find out dark secrets of some neighbors even. When he is convinced that the wife of one neighbor has dissapeared, he inspects the husband, convinced he has killed her and burried her in her garden. He then sends his girlfriend over to the man's apartement to inspect. His plan is dangerous but absolutely brilliant. The movie itself is brilliant with a great score, one hell of a neat plot, and a great finale. The suspense is great and Hitchcock once again has proven himself to be a legendary director.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>Why is Rear Window one of my favorite movies? Every time I see it I wonder and I come up with new things. One thing is outstanding and that is Jimmy Stewart. He is a photographer who broke his leg while on the job at a racing track. Strangely enough photos of the crash are in the opening scenes. Because he cannot move he is in his chair for the entire movie. The dialogue between him and his nurse is superb, especially the nurse has some great lines.<br /><br />He is dating the beautiful Grace Kelly who he thinks is just to perfect for him but she doesn't seem to mind. The dialogue between them sounds like that between two people who have known each other for a while. Words that bystanders might find horrible but they are perfectly happy with.<br /><br />While sitting in his chair Stewart has a chance to look outside his rear window at what is going on outside. There is a dancing lady, a composer, a sunbathing woman, a single woman and a just-married couple. This by the way for a long time was the biggest inside set ever built for a movie.  The thing he notices most however is a married couple and the story will be about them, since he thinks the man has killed the woman and is trying to get rid of the body everywhere. At first no one believes him, especially his friend a police officer. But the evidence gets more and more certain and more people start believing him, leading to a very tense end scene of the movie. This is of course, still a Hitchcock film.<br /><br />The great thing is that even as a viewer you are convinced that Stewart is wrong, he just seems to be a sad wheelchair bound man that can't wait for another week before the cast can come off. He scratches himself with a backscratcher while making crazy assumptions based on the scarce things he sees at the other side.<br /><br />It's a very funny movie too and that is especially in the dialogues between the people. An example: Gunderson: It's about time you got married, before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. Jeff : Yeah, can't you just see me, rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife...  Gunderson: Jeff, wives don't nag anymore. They discuss.  Jeff : Oh, is that so, is that so? Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss. In my neighborhood they still nag.<br /><br />Rear Window is, together with North by Northwest, my favorite Hitchcock movie. It is well-acted, incredibly funny and of course has a great and unexpected ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Jimmy Stewart plays L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, a photographer laid up with a broken leg who has taken to spying on his neighbors to alleviate his boredom.  He becomes suspicious that one of his neighbors, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), has murdered his wife (Irene Winston) and enlists his beautiful girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), and visiting nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), to investigate.  There is a lot to occupy your mind in this film aside from the pure suspense of the plot.  You can ponder Jeffries's inability to commit to Lisa (could the cast on his leg be a symbol of impotence?).  Jeffries's profession is essentially voyeuristic--has he forgotten that he can be an active participant in events?  Aside from his reluctance to engage with Lisa, there is at least one crucial moment in the film when he remains inactive even though there are avenues of action open to him.  Director Alfred Hitchcock even alludes to the voyeuristic nature of film-watching; at times our characters appear to be filmgoers on the edges of their seats as they view the goings-on outside Jeffries's window.  This film is highly recommended./</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I saw Psycho for the first time about two years ago and loved it, but I liked this one even better and that's saying something. James Stewart is wonderful in his confining part as an everyday man who just happens to be dating a Perfect 10 of a woman played by Grace Kelly. And as a number reviewers have already stated, her opening close-up shot is breathtaking. This is my first time seeing her in a film even though I have heard of her beauty many times and man is she amazing to look at! I am a guy in my twenties and have seen more than enough beautiful woman who bare it all these days on film, but Grace Kelly is a classic beauty that captivates me everytime she is on screen fully clothed and all. Sorry, I got a little off track thinking about her. I think almost everyone knows the plot and if you don't go rent or buy it today. I just purchased Vertigo and The Birds today, so let me end this review so I can relax while watching the master of his craft work his magic again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q457CES5ZUZ.html">A2Q457CES5ZUZ</a><br/><p>&quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; have been referred to as Alfred Hitchcock's voyeuristic masterpieces with good reason.  The latter film relates to Jimmy Stewart playing a retired detective determined to make another woman into someone he believed had previously existed but never did, and was only a fictitious creation of her lover, who was a clever murderer.  Kim Novak, in one of her early efforts, played the dual role with just the proper measure of ethereal distance.<p>Four years before &quot;Vertigo&quot; previewed Hitchcock directed another powerful voyeuristic film with Stewart cast in the male lead, this time opposite another blonde bombshell, the future princess Grace Kelly.  Based on a story by master thriller author Cornell Woolrich, &quot;Rear Window&quot; is about a successful photographer who, after breaking his leg in an accident while covering an automobile race, is laid up in his Manhattan apartment.  In between visits from gorgeous socialite Kelly he whiles away his time observing his neighbors from the apartment building behind his own, separated by a courtyard.<p>Stewart lives as a voyeur, spending his time observing people like Miss Lonelyhearts, the woman who fixes herself candlelight dinners she shares with wine and music with imaginary love interests, a composer constantly at work at his piano, and a seductively constructed ballet dancer with a seemingly unending host of male admirers.  Kelly becomes concerned over his interest in observing the ballet dancer.<p>Eventually Stewart becomes preoccupied, however, with another neighbor, the husky, white-haired Raymond Burr, several years away from his future starring role in the Perry Mason television detective series.  Stewart notices that Burr's wife is ill and confined to bed.  He then becomes increasingly preoccupied with Burr's comings and goings at various hours of the night.  At first Kelly tells him he is concerned over nothing.  He then attracts her interest, and finally that of his detective friend and former World War Two Air Force buddy Wendell Corey.<p>Just what is happening?  Are their imaginations overworked?  The finale is spelled out in typical Hitchcock fashion, after he has worked his audience's curiosity to overpowering levels.  Hitchcock seemingly loved little, if anything, more than tweaking his audience.  The curiosity grows and grows until the finale.<p>The color and camera work are spectacular.  We stare into the lives of individuals who are unaware of the fact that we are there.  That is, until Raymond Burr begins to suspect something.  At that point the story moves into high gear, all the way to its compelling climax.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TV6SBCWT7P8S.html">A2TV6SBCWT7P8S</a><br/><p>Rear Window and North by Northwest are my favorite Alfred Hitchcok films and rank very highly on the list of my favorite films overall. Although they are very different films, they both share great suspense, creative plots, some humor, and wonderful stars - what more could you ask for in a movie? Additionally, Rear Window offers some interesting insights into human nature and shows that, like L.B. Jeffries, we (as movie watchers) are essentially voyeurs. <p>Basically, Rear Window is about photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) who, not being able to move due to a cast on his broken leg, starts to use his powerful camera lenses to observe people in the neighboring apartments. While watching, he notes the strange behavior of one man...and then begins to believe that the man murdered his wife. With a beautiful girlfriend (Grace Kelly) at his side, Jeffries investigates the situation, creating a great deal of suspense. The movie has a wonderfully clever conclusion which I am NOT going to describe: watch it and find it out for yourself!  <p>Anyhow, this is a true thriller, Hitchcock style. It features classic actors (James Stewart, especially, is amazing in this film), a creative, original plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and interesting thoughts about voyeurism, etc. As a last point, Rear Window has a real sense of atmosphere - it really transports the viewer to the apartment building in the hot summer. All in all - this is a FANTASTIC film - I don't know how else to recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism.  When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?<p>Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While "Rear Window" as a whole is probably not quite at a level with "Vertigo" (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions.  Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says "Be Careful, Tom".  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.<p>Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.<p>The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the "Ice Maiden" in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.<p>This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between "Psycho" (#18) and "Vertigo" (#61).  I personally think more highly of "Vertigo" but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10.  "Rear Window" is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>I was prepared to dote on this DVD since Rear Window is my favorite Hitchcock film, but it was even better than I had anticipated.  The film has been restored (by the same marvelous team who restored Vertigo), and it looks wonderful.  The images are sharp, the color glorious.<p>Also included on the DVD: &quot;'Rear Window' Ethics&quot;, a documentary about the film's restoration (complete with interviews with crew, cast members (such as Miss Torso) and Pat Hitchcock O'Connell, Alfred's daughter); an interview with screenwriter John Michael Hayes; production photographs and notes; trailers.  There is also supposedly access to the original script, but I have not yet been able to access this running the DVD on a Mac.<p>Options include running the film in French and the availability of Spanish or English subtitles.  Widescreen format.<p>One thing I am missing: I believe there is a version of the film with closing credits seen as the blinds in Jeffries' apartment lower, mirroring their being raised during the opening credits, but this ending doesn't seem to be here.<p>You cannot go wrong with this exciting DVD edition of one of the greatest films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AW3VZ5O895LRK.html">AW3VZ5O895LRK</a><br/><p>Jimmy Stewart is a reporter confined to his high rise New York apartment building because he is recovering from a broken leg.  Grace Kelly is his fiance.  She comes over to help him with his recovery, although he is crankiness personified because of his condition. However, things look up when Stewart finds himself more and more engrossed by what is going on at his neighbor's apartment in another high rise, facing his.  The neighbor is played by Raymond Burr and Stewart starts to worry that Burr may be planning to do something awful to his wife.  This is a real nailbiter of a movie because Stewart is hugely limited on what he can do to help by being confined to his wheelchair. We are back in the 1950s so a phone is his only instrument of communication.  Also, Kelly is never there when the most suspicious things with Burr occur so Stewart's going to have trouble making the police believe him.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this is an extremely satisfying exploration of a man's bored voyeurism turning into a rollycoaster of a nightmare. Stewart and Kelly starred in several Hitchcock films. Stewart excels at playing the regular ok guy for whom life turns nightmarish in Hitchcock's films.  Kelly excels at playing the beautiful blonde society woman.  She is unaccustomed to crime interrupting her perfect life yet she can face crime with cool aplomb. For those who have only ever seen Burr in his heroic tv roles, they will be surprised to discover that he usually played dark or villainous roles in his earlier movie career.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>"We've become a race of peeping toms. What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change." So says Stella (Thelma Ritter) at the start of "Rear Window". Alfred Hitchcock's best film and one of my all-time favorites. It's a key line into the film which was taken from a short story called "It Had To Be Murder" written by Cornell Woolrich and made into a screenplay by John Michael Hayes.<br />"Rear Window" gives Hitchcock the chance to explore one of his favorite themes;voyeurism. L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer for a magazine who managed to break his leg in an automobile race track accident. He has a cast from his foot up to his hip and has been in it for 6 weeks. Jeffries' passes his time by staring outside his window looking (or spying) at his neighbors. I've noticed many people seem to overlook something cruical in this. Jeffries as the saying goes is a "watcher" NOT a "doer". He is by profession a photographer. He's always seeing the world through his lens. Never actually experiencing life himself. I bet even if he wasn't injured it seems like the kind of thing this guy would do anyway. It's in his blood. It's how he makes his living. By capturing moments of people's lives or popular events. But, one day, Jeffries is going to see too much.<br /> What makes "Rear Window" such a great film is the way the screenplay is constructed. The viewer never knows more than the lead character. Everything we see, we only see becuase that's exactly what he sees. We can only draw the same conclusions he does, because we only know as much as him. If he says 1+1=3, we have to go along with him, because we don't know otherwise. And this is where all the suspense leads in. You see, for those who have never seen this movie. Jeffries thinks he has seen one of his neighbors murder his wife. Mr. Thorwald (Raymond Burr, who would later become a lawyer, go figure!) was seen leaving his house several times durning the night. We see him wrap up a saw and knife. And the next morning his bedridden wife is gone! Was she murdered? Or is there a reasonable explaination for everything? We are lead to believe she was murdered.<br /> Hitchcock has such a confident feel for the material. I don't know if his directing was ever better. Some may argue "Psycho" or "Vertigo" but, whichever film you chose you can't deny how brilliant his directing is here. The way he adds to the suspense. Our emotions go back and forth. Was there a murder committed or not?<br /> As with all Hitchcock films you can expect that dry wit. In my opinion it has never played off as well has it does here. It's all over the place. Take Thelma Ritter for example. She plays an insurance company nurse sent to take care of Jeffries. Her dialogue is full of witty remarks. Just about ever word she choses to use seems inappropriate at the time. There is also a character named "Miss Lonelyheart". A scene involves her getting dressed up, ligthing some candles, dimming the lights, fixing the dinner table and than pretending she has a gentleman guest. It may not sound funny as you read it, but, to see it will put a smile on your face.<br /> Besides Stella (Ritter) no one enters Jeffries apartment except Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly, looking her absolute best!). A designer who is a well known Manhattan socialite. Things are rocky in their relationship as Jeffries thinks she is "too perfect". But, naturally it's takes a murder to bring them together.<br /> "Rear Window" was quite a big hit when first released. Hitchcock was at a peak in his career when this was made. The movie was nominated for 4 Oscars including "Best Director". When is was made it was also the largest set on the Paramount lot. But, that doesn't stop the movie from having a big city feel to it. Here's a Hitchcock movie any true Hitchcock fan HAS to see.<br /> Bottom-line: Alfred Hitchock's best film. One of my all-time favorites. Great directing, great acting and chemistry betwwen Stewart and Kelly. Hitchcock at the top of his game.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.<br />The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.<br />Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>A film destined for over-analysis, &quot;Rear Window&quot; deserves it's place in the pantheon of great films.<br />Instead of thinking about it so much, just watch the film and surrender to it's lovely storytelling style. It's like unfolding an origami bird to see what's on the original square piece of paper. (Notice I didn't say origami &quot;crane&quot;, because that would be more apropos for another film circa 1960.)<br />The acting is superb, the script is unusually crafty, and the quips are appropriately tension-easing. The film attracts attention to it's style, yet manages to make you succumb to it.<br />We KNOW Hitchcock is a master. It's just nice to be reminded time and again, isn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>It's summer in New York, but L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (James Stewart) is trapped in his apartment with a severely broken leg.  Aside from the daily visits from his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), his only diversion is watching the people in the apartment complex out his back window.  And since it is the middle of a horrid heat wave, everyone has their window open at all times.<br /><br />Late one night, Jeff witness something funny going on across the way.  The invalid wife in one of the apartments has vanished and the husband (Raymond Burr) is taking many trips out of the apartment carrying something in his suitcase.  Jeff quickly assumes the wife was murdered.  Enlisting Lisa and Stella's help, he tries to prove it.  But is he right?  And can he prove it without leaving his own apartment?<br /><br />I seem to have a weird relationship with Hitchcock.  I don't enjoy the movies everyone considers his masterpieces, but I do enjoy his lesser known films.  In keeping with this tradition, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would.  The beginning of the film was very slow as the many side stories were set up.  Even once the main story got going, I still found it rather slow for my tastes.  The ending, however, was exciting if a bit predictable.  And the acting was great, bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep watching Hitchcock's films.  But I'm going to explore all his films to see which ones I think are his best.  I doubt that this one, while not his worst, will make the list of his best either.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>So much has been said about this movie already, what's one more long description of the plot going to do?  If you want to know the entire plot, read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.<br /><br />I find Rear Window (1954) to be entertaining, fun, suspenseful, and a little scary at times all rolled into one.  The biggest reason why I like this movie is because Grace Kelly is in it.  She was a looker and her performance in this movie was Oscar-worthy.  She plays the role of Lisa Carol Fremont, who is the girlfriend of L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries, played by Jimmy Stewart.  Stewart's performance was also great.  Grace Kelly reminds me so much of Nicole Kidman, or should I say that Nicole Kidman reminds me of Grace Kelly.  Kidman's overall look she had in The Others (2001) is so similar to Kelly's look in Rear Window, especially during the early part of Rear Window.  Kidman's character name coincidentally in The Others is Grace Stewart.<br /><br />This movie takes place entirely in an apartment complex where the rear windows of all apartments are open and expose what is going on inside each apartment that overlooks a courtyard.  It's funny to watch Jimmy Stewart's character take part in voyeurism.  But his voyeurism pays off as he and several people are able to solve a murder that took place in an apartment across the courtyard.  The suspense builds as the movie progresses.<br /><br />This DVD is in widescreen format.  The extras are excellent.  There is a documentary called Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic, which describes the making of the movie with interviews with cast and crew, Hitchcock himself through an audio interview, and Hitchcock's daughter.  It also shows how the movie was restored.  Also included is a featurette with screenwriter John Michael Hayes.  Other extras include production photographs, the theatrical trailer, a re-release trailer narrated by Jimmy Stewart, production notes, cast and filmmakers, and access to the original script.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York.  Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller.  The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly.

High on the list is 'Rear Window', which contains several of Hitchcock's trademarks.<br /><br />First on the list is that Hitchcock's approach to mystery thrillers is quite different to most writers and filmmakers (to those who say that Hitchcock didn't write his movies, I can only say that a military commander doesn't fight his battles, but he controls those who do!). Usually in other people's mysteries a cast of characters is paraded in front of the viewer and the game is to guess which one is the murderer. In Hitchcock's films, it's pretty obvious who the murderer is, the question is how to pin the crime on them- preferably before they do it again. In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock plays up this aspect of the movie to its utmost, giving the lead male character a handicap which means that he can't do anything himself and has to act through others. Hitch builds the tension to an edge-of-the seat climax, in which both male and female leads are in mortal danger. Do they survive? Watch and find out.<br /><br />Then there's the claustrophobic setting. Many of Hitchcock's movies are developed from plays, but even when they aren't ('Rear Window' was developed from a short story), he tends to eschew large-scale settings and has the action take place in confined (literally in this case) quarters. This adds to the tension; anyone who has had a nightmare in which it seems impossible to escape a terrifying situation will know the feeling of paralysing fear that is induced and Hitchcock creates that feeling better than any other filmmaker. Much of this movie takes place within a single room, with the world outside observed as though it were on TV. When the TV world intrudes on the lives of the lead characters, they can't escape.<br /><br />Hitchcock liked to work with actors (and crew) with whom he felt comfortable and this movie contains a number of Hitch stalwarts, most notably James Stewart and Grace Kelly in the leading roles. They interpret their characters splendidly and are backed up by the feisty Thelma Ritter, adding light relief. There is also a group of characters whose job is create atmosphere by being observed going about their daily business and Hitchcock makes sure their stories, comical, tragic and sometimes embarrassing, are entertaining enough to make watching them seem a justifiable pastime.<br /><br />Hitchcock's films are always worth watching for entertainment, but the more you see them, the more you appreciate the technique of one of the cinema's greatest storytellers.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>This film is somewhat like a theatrical play, in the fact that it is mostly filmed on one set, the apartment complex where Jimmy Stewart's character lives. In that sense, it is somewhat realistic in detail regarding set design, although, that might also be the film's drawback. You do get a real sense of the character, through his living environment,  a character confined to a wheel chair, due to a broken leg. At times though, there's a lot of dialogue, and not very much action, like say, North By Northwest. So, if you are prepared for this type of film, then you'll enjoy, Rear Window. Also, featuring Grace Kelly, who's performance is as good as her looks, in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>"Rear Window" comes very close to be the perfect Hitchcock film that illustrates nearly all his great abilities...<br /><br />Hitchcock demonstrates in "Rear Window" that he is a great voyeur, that he loves to spy on his characters making each viewer into a voyeur, forcing audience to see everything from his hero's point of view... James Stewart is hold up in his Manhattan two rooms apartment with a broken leg... He passes his time spying on his neighbors through back window in an orgy of voyeurism...<br /><br />Speaking of technical challenge, "Rear Window" is Hitchcock prototype... Most of the film is shot from one confined set... It is also notably theatrical since it takes place in one room...<br /><br />Hitchcock forces limitations on himself, as he did in "Lifeboat" when he shot entirely on a restricted set, in only one boat... And in "Rope" (his first Technicolor film) where the single setting for the production had only walls and furniture...<br /><br />Having restricted his movements, Hitchcock is demanded to be ingenious in order to keep curiosity alive... He builds a realistic courtyard of apartments with inhabitants in it, and the restriction becomes a potency and the technique a fascinating example of what he chooses to call "pure cinema."<br /><br />Hitchcock's camera tracks out through the windows... It never goes inside the apartments... We never see close-ups of the characters... We can only see what Stewart sees... We feel like we are watching people through a window instead of in a movie...<br /><br />Hitchcock doesn't use any kind of music... We hear natural sounds, occasional live music played in the surrounding apartment...<br /><br />"Rear Window" describes Hitchcock at his best for the way it works on several levels, yet hides its own complexity... Stewart, tied in too by pressure from his high society girl who loves him and wants to marry him... Everything he sees out is related to this problem... He avoids to discuss marriage with her, though he himself does not seem to realize it...<br /><br />All the while, the people in the 31 apartments that he can see live out their little lives... The tormented middle-aged bachelor, composer/songwriter; the couple who beats the heat by sleeping on a fire escape; the newlyweds and lovers; the tragic "Miss Lonelyhearts" and her fantasies of entertaining gentlemen callers; the hearing-impaired sculptor working day and night; the vivacious and sexy blonde dancer "Miss Torso" who does suggestive routines in bikini tops and, most important, the hysterical "nagging wife" - lying in bed - and her grouchy fed-up husband, a jewelry salesman...<br /><br />One 'great shot' reveals just how involved Stewart has become in their lives when Miss Lovelyheart - in her romantic dinner for two - raises her glass in a toast to her imaginary lover and Stewart raises his glass as well...<br /><br />The urban backyard setting is the night city terrain of "Rear Window," a night city shattered by the sharp sound of a loud female scream and the sound of breaking glass...<br /><br />Hitchcok presents Stewart who sees (or think he sees) what he is powerless to stop... The insidious salesman strangely attracts Stewart's attention... His Passtime becomes an obsession after he suspects that he has murdered his ailing wife and specially when he notices that she is missing... His ravishing fianc&eacute;e (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) warn him that voyeurism is a crime and is dangerous... But Stewart persists, eventually he was turned on ... This explain perfectly his specific use of a huge zoom lens to do his peeping as he monitors the murderer's activities... The murderer and his wife became subject of Stewart's parody with the "too perfect, too talented, too sophisticated," Grace Kelly...<br /><br />"Rear Window" is visually very strong... Hitchcock designs the film in such a way so that his view is our view... He manipulates our emotions because he knows perfectly his work... He has the film synchronized in his mind... Shooting and editing are, for him, a simple mechanical phase... The creativity has all taken place before...<br /><br />The first shot of "Rear Window" is a perfect example of this reality - as his many typical first shots - for the way it visually transmits the whole complex to the audience...<br /><br />Hitchcock is a master at using his camera to create suspense... Like Stewart, we are restricted in movements, paralyzed inside the apartment, immobile, trapped in a room where we are anxious and uncertain... There is no way we can warn the outcome... This is what 'suspense' is all about--not surprise... An effect of intense and prolonged expectancy, lacking all help in the state of knowing that we possess but the characters do not... And, of course, all this great suspense is created by only 'visual' means...<br /><br />Stewart gives the performance of his life behaving at ease... He was the perfect Hitchcock character: a voyeur by profession, an unpretentious photo journalist who becomes caught in a terrifying event...<br /><br />When you see the film, feel the menacing 'look' of the murderer staring those evil eyes at you... And don't forget to catch Alfred Hitchcok in his customary cameo appearance, this time repairing a clock... Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Hitchcock as Bunuel or Fellini was always a demolisher of the Status Quo. Among the three, Hitchcock was possibly the coldest but his poignacy was always conceived by the Hitchcock`s fans as a boutade.<br /><br />Hitchcock involves us in this deligthful satyre with all the discrete elegance and extreme good manners. Don' t ever consider  our starring is a vulgar Peeping Tom. How can you dare?  He is simply a man who is wound and unable to displace, and by this cause his only hobby consists just in taking a little bit around here and there. The illusion through the window is basically the same experience between the viewer and the screen. Window and screen mean the possibility of watching other different realities from the other side of the street.<br /><br />Someway Hitchcock suggestively reminds us but always keeping a discrete distance .<br /><br />But that hazardous Peeping Tom activity has its risks and demands its prize. This occurs when he is the involuntary eyewitness of a murder. And suddenly our beloved friend becomes hunted due its hobby.<br /><br />The rest runs for you my dear reader. A love affair is the secondary argumental line and the huge stage of several open windows seem to work out as a multiple stage. So the camera is a nervous eye until the moment our hero is watched by the assasin. The camera wil be introspective from this moment, and in this case it will be an impotent and mude witness of an unfair and furious human chase.<br /><br />Only Hitchcock knew to handle with these codes as a real magician showing his new tricks.<br /><br />Stewart is simply perfect in this role. Magnificent restoration, superb photograph and as always Bernard Hermann's score is another invisible actor in this cat and mouse game.<br /><br />Voil&aacute;!</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock was in near-perfect form when he made "Rear Window," a stylish, minimalistic blend of mystery and dark comedy. This thriller explores "what you shouldn't see" skilfully, with a few funny bits thrown in. And having a cast that includes Grace Kelly and James Stewart doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />Photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries (Stewart) got run over during a shoot, and is crankily waiting for his cast to come off. While he does so, he spies on his neighbors -- some sleep on balconies, some argue, some weep alone, and some ("Miss Torso") dance in spandex. To make things worse, Jeff is having intimacy problems with his wealthy girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), because he fears settling down.<br /><br />But then Jeff's window-watching clues him in to something -- sickly Mrs. Thorwald vanishes, and her husband Lars (Raymond Burr) is seen acting suspiciously with a saw, rope and metal case. Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. He manages to convince Lisa and his down-to-earth nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), but detectives won't believe him. So without moving from the room, Jeff uses the rear window to watch Thorwald -- and find out what really happened.<br /><br />Okay, peeping on your neighbors is not just creepy, it's illegal. In the case of "Rear Window," that fact doesn't really matter. Watching the fellow tenants is as much fun as the mystery itself, whether it's the newlyweds, the pair that sleep on the balcony, the weepy Ms. Lonelyheart, or the buxom dancer Miss Torso. It makes the story even more chilling when you realize that one -- or maybe more than one -- of these seemingly harmless people is a murderer.<br /><br />Hitchcock -- who appears as a musician -- kept his deft touch in a movie that could have sunk like a stone. All the action takes place in one room, but he keeps it from feeling confining. Instead, the minimalistic set takes away all distractions, and makes the interplay between the characters even brighter. And much of the humor is provided by Ritter -- she's not a comic character, but her homespun wisdom is delivered with tart humor.<br /><br />Jeff is likable as only James Stewart could make him -- this guy is bored, crabby and in denial about his feelings for Lisa, but he's likable despite that. Kelly does an equally solid job as the "girl who is too good for him," who also proves that in a pinch she can rise beyond her uptown-girl roots. Back when many women were relegated to side roles, Lisa gets to be an equal detective to Stewart.<br /><br />"Rear Window" gives a view into one of Hitchcock's best films, a taut thriller about how, if you watch other people, you might see something dangerous. A well-deserved classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>James Stewart and Grace Kelly make a wonderful couple in this film. The mystery keeps you guessing until the end. While the focus is out the rear window of Stewart's New York City apartment, his relationship with Grace Kelly's socialite progresses and changes. My favorite aspect about this movie is the juxtapostioning of Stewart learning about his neighbors as he watches them with him seeing new aspects of his girlfriend's adventurous spirit that he didn't know existed.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>I like Hitchcock's "claustrophobic" thrillers like this...LIFEBOAT and ROPE.

The story suited him well.  A man confined to a wheelchair, watching things that may be innocent or murderous, a beautiful woman out of her element, in danger, with gradually building suspense that takes a potentially fatal turn as we watch helplessly with our immobilized protagonist, and a cliffhanger climax.  The movie has been analyzed by very smart people looking for much more than that, deeper meanings and allusions, and some of their ideas are true, and some are fun.  But it's the basic story elements, sharp dialogue, fine acting and the direction of a master that make it a great movie.<br /><br />The immobilized man is "Jeff" Jeffries (James Stewart), a Life Magazine photographer who's laid up in his New York City apartment with a broken leg.  Accustomed to an active life of adventure and world traveling, he's reduced to passing his time using binoculars and a telephoto lens to spy on the small world of neighbors across a small courtyard from his rear window.  The beautiful woman is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), a high society woman whom he is avoiding marrying on the excuse that she isn't cut out for his rambling life of action and danger, and he doesn't want to settle down.  As events across the way take a potentially sinister turn, the tables are turned as Lisa shows her grit in risky investigations while Jeff must remain passive.  Raymond Burr (of Perry Mason fame) plays the suspect neighbor who may or may not have killed someone.  Thelma Ritter is Jeff's house-call nurse who also gets involved.<br /><br />Most of the film is presented from Jeff's powerless perspective, giving the suspense an extra edge.  There are allusions to impotence and, through the lives of the neighbors, a range of romantic and marriage relationships mirroring the fears of many men and women, including our protagonists.  Much has been made of the theme of voyeurism, the window as a representation of the movie screen and so on, though I think it's easy to make too much of that.  Screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Hitchcock work in the usual Hitchcock cameo and humor, including a dog who "knew too much" (a reference to another Hitchcock film).<br /><br />The new 2-disc Special Edition DVD looks to be an excellent set.  It will include new special features:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by John Fawell, author of Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film<br />-- Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master<br />-- Hitchcock/Truffaut interview excerpts<br />-- Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock<br />-- Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mr. Blanchard's Secret<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />There will also be features carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:<br /><br />-- Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary (55 minutes)<br />-- A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes (13 minutes on the Collector's Edition)<br />-- 1983 re-release trailer for Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, Rope, and Rear Window, narrated by James Stewart (6 minutes)<br />-- production photographs<br />-- production notes<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the screenplay feature that was on the older DVD.

It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment,  the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings. <p>Professional photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both  immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and  conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior. <p>This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him.  Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing  propels the film to an exciting climax. <p>Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective. <p>All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A2S166WSCFIFP5.html">A2S166WSCFIFP5</a><br/><p>Rear Window is one of the classic Hitchcock films, made in the latter part of his career, where he could almost do no wrong. It ranks up there with Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and in my opinion the only movie of Hitch's that is better than Rear Window is North By Northwest. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly give one of their better performances. The action in this movie takes place in Stewart's apartment or viewed from his apartment. Stewart plays a photographer who has broken his leg and is pretty much immobile (the cast is from the pelvis to foot) and witnesses what he suspects to be a murder. The film can be truly horrifying. Imagine what it would be like to watch a man attack the woman you love (there is only one way a man should be allowed to put his hands on Grace Kelly) from your window and not being able to do anything about it. Or having a hulking man (the size of Raymond Burr) coming to kill you and not being able to flee or adequately defend yourself. It gives a level of creepiness that you won't find outside of Psycho or The Birds. Rear Window is one of Hitch's more chilling works. <p>The DVD gives a better picture and sound quality over VHS and it is nice to be able to skip around the movie quickly. Unfortunately there is no commentary, but with Hitch dead and virtually no action who would be the logical choice? Probably better that no one attempts a commentary. In addition to trailers and production stills there are production notes, which give you that little bit of trivia that you can use to impress your friends with. There is also a featurette "conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes" which is interesting. And an hour long documentary titled "Rear Window Ethics" which is a commentary on the film (including audio interview excerpts with Hitchcock) and Restoring the Film. The two added featurettes are a definite plus for the DVD. Also, if you have a DVD-ROM on your computer you can get to a copy of the screenplay, which plays the section of the movie (in a little box in the corner) that you are reading. Makes for a nice addition to your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A16KRCLLTHSB5F.html">A16KRCLLTHSB5F</a><br/><p>This film displays all of Hitchcock's genius - his intricate camerawork, his understanding of the mechanism of suspense and his appreciation of humor, as well as more brilliant work by his regular costume designer Edith Head - and I think that for several reasons, it its solidly his best film. For one thing, while films like 'Marnie' have long since begun to show their age, and even such greats as 'The Birds' lose something for modern viewers accustomed to slicker visuals, Rear Window is such a simple story (though not without a great depth of subtext) that it has a timeless quality. Also, the comic script is one of the best that Hitchcock ever adapted, full of crackling dialogue and fully drawn characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Collector's Edition (Universal) Widescreen DVD release of "Rear Window"......<br /><br />Think of Alfred Hitchcock and immediately you think of some of the best thrillers to ever come to the screen. His name is synonymous with suspense and horror. But his excellence as a suspenseful story teller does not end with the gripping edge of your seat story that we all love to be frightned by. It goes beyond that, as he delves into the lives of the characters that we find ourselves getting caught up with and maybe even identifying with. "Rear Window" is probably the definitive film of Hitchcock's brillant career that combines these elements, along with the humor,sensuality and the camera work he is famous for.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays the lead character in this frightning tale. He is L.B. Jeffries, a photojournalist who is now wheelchair bound,due to a broken leg. It is not just the cast on his leg that is driving him crazy, he is itching for some adventure and cooped up in his tiny apartment seems to be getting cabin fever. Inquistive by nature, this regular joe or "Jeff" as he's called, innocently starts looking across the courtyard of the apartment complex just to see what the neighbors are up to.And the beauty of this film is that we become involved with these people right along with him.<br /><br />We become intrigued by the many different personalities he is privy to. There's the ballerina, the songwriter, the newlyweds(darn they pulled the shades down!), the lonley spinster and the pitiful salesman (Raymond Burr) who seems to be saddled with a nagging wife. Hitch weaves his magic and even as Jeff falls asleep, we are still privy to something possibly sinister going on in this last apartment, and you just want to say "Wake up Jimmy, look what Raymond Burr is doing now!"<br /><br />Jeff becomes more and more involved with the lives he is intruding on, and eventually realizes there are some strange and sinister events happening and has reason to believe there has been a murder. But how can he prove this? Who would believe him? There is not enough evidence to prove it, as a matter of fact most of the evidence proves the victim is merely away on a trip.The suspense is riveting and frightning as the "suspect" realizes he is being watched, and poor Jimmy all alone in the wheelchair, defenseless, with only his camera to protect him!<br /><br />There is yet a second story line going on in this little apartment. One of romance(of course). Grace Kelly, plays Lisa, a beautiful socialite enamored of Jeff and is doing her best to direct Jeff's attention away from the window and towards her. Jeff of course finds her devastingly beautiful but is not ready to committ to a stationary life. Lisa, in some very tense moments and in her quest to prove to him that she can live any life he has in mind, risks her own life and limb to help him prove his murder theory.<br /><br />Looking for Hitch....Close to the :30 minute mark you will find him making good use of his "Time" on screen.<br /><br />Stewart is so captivating in his performance, his facial expressions alone tell the story of what he is witnessing. Grace Kelly was honored with Best Actress awards from both the Nat'l Board of Review and the N.Y. Film Critics(also for her work that year in "The Country Girl" and "Dial M for Murder"). She is simply marvelous in this role. Raymond Burr, a man of few words in this one, is terrific at scaring us to death. And I must also mention the best character actress ever to grace the screen,(nominated 6 times for Best Supporting actress by Oscar), Miss Thelma Ritter. She is outstanding as Jeff's nurse who's words seem to take on new meaning when she says them.<br /><br />The film,made in 1954, is beautifully restored and looks great on this transfer to DVD. "The Kiss" scene must be seen to be appreciated. The color seems just a little dated, but hardly noticable. The pictures is clear, in Anamorphic Widescreen at 1.66:1(the intended ratio). The Sound is very good in Dolby Stereo. Lots of Special Features(see tech info for complete list) including a featurette where you will find filmaker Peter Bogdonavich, talking about the film and even has some audio interviews with "the master" himself giving his viewpoints of certain scenes. The captions for hearing impaired are good, indicating when there is music and who is singing(i.e. Bing Crosby). But the captions are not in the black bar portion, but at the bottom of the picture. All together a great package for a great classic.<br /><br />Some great reading for Hitch fans to be found in:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380799456">Hitchcock's Notebooks: An Authorized And Illustrated Look Inside The Creative Mind Of Alfred Hitchcock</a><br /><br />Watch it with your neighbor(or maybe not...)......enjoy...Laurie</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>1954's Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock remains one of my all-time favorite motion pictures. Even though nearly 100% of this film takes place in one very small studio apartment, it's never boring, never loses momentum, and never releases its suspenseful "grip" on the viewer!  And we wonder, just as Jimmy Stewart's character wonders ... Was this murder?  <p>Kudos all around on a flawless effort here!  Favorite J. Stewart dialogue: "Well, tell me, what do you need to search .... bloody footsteps leading up to the door?!"</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's most cinematically intricate film boasts some many wondrous images, from the exquisitely detailed apartment from which voyeur Stewart watches to the beautiful Grace Kelly to an early &quot;heavy&quot; performance from Raymond Burr.  But, Thelma Ritter as Stewart's private nurse (and aide-de-camp) adds another memorable character to her arsenal of scene-stealing performances.  Although her screen time is limited, she makes the best of it.  Another may have written her lines, but her execution is typical Ritter: sarcastic, witty, and oh-so-Ritteresque.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>Rear Window is one of Alfred hitchcock's best films. The opening shot of the community is hard to believe that it's not NYC!, but a back-lot at the studios where the picture was filmed. But this is more than just a film its Hitchcock's autobigraphical celluloid version of his life! Hitchcock wasn't a pleasent man, he was very sardonic and on several occasions was very cruel to the people who worked with him even going as far as to chain a camera man over night to a camera and give him coffee laced with ex lax before hand! Even the films characters are based on people he hated for instance in the film Burr looks ever so much like Selznick the notorious producer who brought Hitchcock over from England and watched over him with a hawks eye. But as it stand the film is a perfect thriller the only downer is Stewart with his shirt off!! Kelly looks amazing as usal though she was never the best actress in hollywood she was one of the best movie stars. Stewart plays a photographer stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg. After time he becomes obsessed with the ongoing lives of his neighbors peering in on them with a zoom lensed camera. When he believes he witnessed a murder across the yard he tells his elitest girlfriend grace Kelly about it who in turn gets wrapped up in the world of voyeristic pleasure. The plot tsists and turns so tightly around the stroy that sweat and confusion pours out of your pours! The climax is jus eye popping! Flashes of color admist a darken room as teh suspected killer finally caomes out of the shadows to bump Stewart off! Hitchcock never takes you inside of the houses he leaves always on the outside looking in on everything. Rather it's a lonely woman trying to kill herself or a loose dance who has more male friends than all of New York City. hitchcock makes you look through Stewart lense and turns you not into Stewart but a pervert out for a night of arousal!</p></br><a href="../users/AW003H7Z3OCHA.html">AW003H7Z3OCHA</a><br/><p>This amazing director Alfred Hitchcock got the nod for 4 of AFI's (American Film Institute's) top 100 movies in 100 years (1998).  This incredible feat showcases &quot;Hitch&quot; at his very best !!!!  His greatest run began with his greatest movie &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954), then Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and his most famous horror thriller, Psycho (1960) all on AFI's list.<p>Rear Window's cast was meticulously chosen and performed perfectly and flawlessly.  This movie is the perfect blend of story, cinematography, acting, music, drama, suspense and most of all COLOR.  Digitally restored masterfully you now can enjoy the artist pallet at its best.<p>In summary; An adventure magazine photographer (James Stewart) is in his 6th week being wheelchair bound from a broken leg in a 2 room apartment overlooking the courtyard of an apartment complex in New York.  Socialite girlfriend (the most beautifully photographed closeup sequence of Grace Kelly) tries to persuade the reluctant Stewart to be allowed into his high adventure life.  Along with his physical therapist (Thelma Ritter) the trio get involved in a peeping Tom scenario of the neighbors &amp; the possibility of a  husband (Raymond Burr) killing &amp; disposing of his wife?  The girlfriend and therapist become predators to find the body.  Stewart becomes the victim of the husband &amp; the rest is history.<p>This the greatest movie and Grace Kelly is absolutely gorgeous!!!<p>Plenty of backgound information and incites from &quot;Hitch's&quot; daughter Patricia Hitchcock.<p>You've got to see &quot;Rear Window&quot; and then you will want to see more of this directors work.  You can't lose with &quot;Rear Window&quot;!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>James Stewart and Grace Kelly, two of my favorite actors! Alfred Hitchcock, one of my favorite directors! How can I lose?<br /><br />Stewart is an action photographer whose leg was broken in getting a special shot of a car race. He's in a cast, and bored to tears with nothing to do. So he looks out his rear window into all the other windows that face it. We get to follow quite a few sub-plot stories along with him in those rear windows. Because this is Hitchcock, several are pretty amusing.<br /><br />Grace Kelly is in love with Stewart, but she's just "too perfect." She's a buyer for a top dress shop, or perhaps the dress department in a posh department store. Evidence: in 1954, the dress she's wearing is "a steal" at $1,700. That's at least $30,000 today.<br /><br />He goes gallivanting all over the world to take pictures; she is strictly Park Avenue. She says she could get him great work doing portraits and fashion photography, but he hates the idea. What can they do?<br /><br />They can turn amateur detective watching Raymond Burr apparently murder his wife and cut her up into pieces!!!<br /><br />Of course, being a photographer and an outdoorsman, Stewart has binoculars and telephoto lenses. He also has a friend who is a detective. He tells his friend about his suspicions, and the friend is skeptical, but checks out the facts. It seems Burr has covered his tracks well enough that Stewart's friend decides there's been no murder. The wife just went on a visit in the country for her health.<br /><br />If I tell you any more, it will wreck it for you. And this is one mystery movie you really don't want wrecked for you. I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>It is difficult for me to decide which of Alfred Hitchcock's films is best. They are all excellent - masterpieces.<br /><br />Rear Window boasts a strong casting compliment, a solid story line, and a master director to make it all fly off the screen. From a short story of only thirty pages by Cornell Woolrich, the chill of murder was never colder.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is convalescing and confined to a wheelchair. His girl friend (Grace Kelley) visits, sometimes cooks, sometimes has dinner sent in. Jimmy Stewart is a photographer and as such has a natural curiosity. The rear window of his apartment faces a courtyard and the rear windows of various other apartments. He knows just about all the neighbors by eavesdropping or peeping as it may be called. One day, he notices something very strange at Raymond Burr's apartment. The wife does not seem to be there anymore, the curtains drawn where they never were before, and Burr acting jumpy, making trips out of the apartment with a suitcase, clearing the way with suspicious eyes.<br /><br />Well, there are the opening minutes and now, suspense is a sure thing.<br /><br />This film is a must for Hitchcock fans to enjoy over and over again. To those not yet fans, what are you waiting for?</p></br><a href="../users/A39IY0JU5JI69G.html">A39IY0JU5JI69G</a><br/><p>This isn't as tense and scary as a lot of Hitchcock films.  It's much more main-stream, American, 50's era, middle of the road.  That's not entirely bad.  The cast is great.  James Stewart is charming and likable as usual, Grace Kelly is exquisite, as usual in her gorgeous Edith Head created wardrobe, Thelma Ritter is endearingly wise-cracking as usual.<br /><br />The story is clever enough featuring a photographer who approaches life through the safe distance of a lens.  I didn't see a lot of chemistry between Kelly and Stewart; he seemed much older than she was, which strained the credibility of her adoration and patience.  There were other things that didn't really make sense, but overall the film pulls you along pleasantly.<br /><br />Hitchcock fans will go gaga over it, uncritically, because it is, after all, Hitchcock.  But if you just want to enjoy a movie on its own merits, this is fun, but a little dated.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a superlative film of suspense. It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment, the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.<br /><br />Professional photographer L.B. "Jeff" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.<br /><br />This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him. Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing propels the film to an exciting climax.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>While Psycho is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, Rear Window is a close second, and it is to my mind the classiest suspense movie he made.  Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly provide that classiness.  Cool and brazen Grace, subtlely provoking Jimmy at every turn, knowing he is stuck helpless with a broken leg in a cast, while she cavorts about getting too close to the murderer, and enjoying his nervousness.  The murderer is played by Ramond Burr in a strange role for him--but he is very scary.  In a stroke of genius, Hitchcock provides us a cutaway view of the appartments across the way and the dramas going on inside of them.  We start getting invested in the stories of the inhabitants.  Thelma Ritter adds something to the movie that it could not do without.  As Stewart's private duty nurse, her no-nonsence philosophies of life are very necessary for thorough scene development.  I never get tired of watching this movie.  Barbara Bel Geddes is also very good as Jimmy's secretary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Rear window was taken from a short story entitled, "It had to be Murder" by Cornell Woolrich and adapted to the screen by John Michael Hayes  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCW2TS">The Man Who Knew Too Much</a>) & (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MX7V5M">To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)</a>). To Catch a Thief was Hayes's second collaboration with Hitchcock after Rear Window.<br /><br />What makes this particular thriller one of the all time greats in cinematic history is its simplicity, revealing human nature's tendency to voyeurism.<br /><br />L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is a photo journalist, forced to sit in his apartment because of a broken leg. He becomes extremely bored because his only contact to the outside world is his editor by phone, his nurse played with humour and charm, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his stunning, rich girlfriend, Lisa Carole Fremont, (Grace Kelly) To alleviate his boredom, through the lens of his telescopic camera, he is able to spy on all his neighbours through his back window. It is through Jeffries eyes that the story is told as we get to know so many different characters with their interesting, mundane, sometimes lonely and murderous lives.<br /><br />Jefferies girlfriend, Lisa, visits him frequently, and in one scene brings in a catered dinner of lobster and fine champagne, looking absolutely ravishing to get Jefferies to stop obsessing with his telescope and his spying. Despite her beauty and the brilliant food, Jefferies has a suspicion: one of his neighbours has killed his wife, chopped up her body, and disposes the evidence in several trips with a suitcase. This fixation turns obsessive and suddenly manic as the evidence mounts against the "husband" (Raymond Burr).<br /><br />There are two story-telling devices that make a great thriller, mounting tension and the element of surprise. Rear Window has these qualities and much more.<br /><br />For me the best aspect of this film is the stories within the main story. Through the eyes of Jefferies we become intimate with his neighbours and their various situations, some interesting, some plain evil, some mostly sad and terribly lonely. It's like the old adage: if you feel your life is a drag, look at other lives and miraculously, your problems are not that serious or sad.<br /><br />I remember watching this film as a child and almost climbing the walls in fear at the end. Viewing the film so many years later, I didn't climb the walls but felt the same tension.<br /><br />Rear Window has to be one of the great thrillers in the history of film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GCHG6U8HTVIT.html">A2GCHG6U8HTVIT</a><br/><p>One of my favorite Hitchcock movies. I wish Stewart had been about ten years younger, but you take what you can get...and he was first rate. Someone wrote somewhere that Hitchcock more than most great directors needed strong, stylish actors to best show off his films. It's probably significant that some of his films that seem (to me) the weakest have leads that are uncharismatic, can't dominate the screen, or who simply don't mesh with Hitchcock's style. After Vertigo I think he ran out of male leads who had that style and who also were relatively young. My understanding is that Sean Connery and Paul Newman, both strong lead actors, did not enjoy working with Hitchcock...they simply didn't understand him and resented his directorial style, and it shows.<br /><br />I've never been too attracted to the high social ice queens that Hitchcock favored at this point in his career. Grace Kelly, however, I thought did a first-rate job of conveying her character's energy, her amusement at her own persona, of conveying a subtext of take-charge sexuality, and of being damn good looking.<br /><br />What I also find endearing is that the people in the apartments across the way were each given interesting stories that had beginnings, middles and endings...all with nearly no dialogue and all with the same distant camera angle.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for Wendell Corey, a fair actor in the Forties who seemed to get lost in the Hollywood shuffle games. And, of course, who doesn't enjoy voyeurism?</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Jimmy Stewart is L.B. Jeffries, an action photographer who is laid up with his leg in a cast to his waist after getting too close to an automobile racing accident.  From the rear window of his New York apartment &quot;Jeff&quot; can see the going's on of many of his neighbors - &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;, a middle-aged lady who seems unlucky in love,  &quot;The Songwriter&quot; who plunks at his studio piano trying to come up with a hit, &quot;Miss Torso&quot; the dancer who entertains many men in between stretching her lithe body across the courtyard from our vantage-point.<p>Jeffries also has a girlfriend, a socialite named Lisa Fremont who is played by Grace Kelly, and the Princess never looked more beautiful or graceful than in this film.  Her introduction into the movie is, in my humble opinion, the most beautiful &quot;close-up&quot; ever done, and when she kisses Jimmy Stewart how many men have wished that it were them?<p>OH! Did I mention there is a spine-tingling mystery story mixed in with all of the above?  One of Jeffries neighbors is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr, who has an invalid wife who nags and belittles him.  One day the wife is gone.  Has she just gone on a visit?  Or has Mr. Thorwald had enough and done her in?  I won't answer that question, but I promise you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once as you find out.  There is more than one scene where the suspense is almost unbearable.<p>Thelma Ritter is in several scenes as the home-health nurse who comes to look in after the immobilized Jeffries, and she steals all of her scenes with her witty and morbid sense of curiosity.<p>The restoration and transfer of the film to DVD looks great, and the extras are informative and probably about as much &quot;extra material&quot; as could be put together here 4 decades after the fact. <p>Hitchcock made dozens of films, and many of them are considered among the very best ever made.

Only recommended for those who really want to be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>One of the most celebrated films in history, this classic takes its time, but once the tension starts building, it doesn't stop until the heart-pounding conclusion is upon you. A new peak for Hitchcock in blending the story of a crime that may have happened with the dark side of human obsession--in this case, voyeurism. The movie marks a high point for James Stewart, who would be remembered as Hitchcock's most human and vulnerable hero. And who can resist the bewitching Grace Kelly?</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>This suspense yarn is quieter than many of Hitchcock's efforts, and the New York apartment life it depicts, along with how one recovers from a broken leg, operates a life as a free-lance photographer, and courts a fashion model girlfriend, are all quite changed from 50 years ago. If you must have the same tale updated, try the Christopher Reeve version from about ten years ago...it has charms of its own, but it isn't Hitchcock, and it does lack Jimmy and Grace (who is hot as a pistol despite keeping her clothes on.) In Hitchcock's version, the heroes are at least innocent, if not naive, and the bad guy is a killer, but not a psychopathic mass murderer who kills strangers for no reason. Worth seeing for the stars' performances in roles that give them little to do physically, and much to convey psychologically.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This terrific classic focusing on our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character-driven film and the suspense builds slowly into a bonafide thriller. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.<br /><br />Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer wheelchair bound after an accident while on assignment. Grace Kelly is his  icily beautiful and doting girlfriend, Lisa. Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his immobility but about his relationship with Lisa, whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no-nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella, winningly portrayed by Thelma Ritter, makes a fine contrast to Kelly. Jeff, stationary and bored to tears, begins secretly watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera, becoming involved in their plight as if following a daily soap opera; taking to heart their loneliness and finding great pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff pieces together witnessed events in one of the apartments across the courtyard and comes to believe he is spying on a killer.<br /><br />Both Lisa and Jeff's policeman pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning. Jeff's own disbelief and his girlfriend's early scorn begin to wane, morphing into an evermore dangerous pastime when Lisa becomes Jeff's legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife begins suspect that Jeff has seen too much, putting both their lives in danger. Hitchcock is marvelous here, using his own lens to show the voyeuristic inclination of us all, as Jeff's seemingly innocent means of passing the time from afar threatens to turn into a personal confrontation which he may not survive. Hitchcock deftly takes the viewer from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, until there is near panic, chiefly because we are all a bit voyeuristic, and can easily put ourselves in Jeff's situation.<br /><br />Like most of Hitchcock's films in Hollywood, it is a bit detached, but less so than others during this period, marking this as one of his finest. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart, while Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable. Jimmy Stewart gives one of his finest performances, marvelously conveying the frustration of becoming suddenly immobile, which leads him to live vicariously through his neighbors' lives. A terrific film classic, perfect for a dark and stormy night with a big bowl of popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/A27W5AJNP6YX7Z.html">A27W5AJNP6YX7Z</a><br/><p>I had seen the version of Rear Window that I recorded myself off the TV several times before finally getting the DVD. If the recorded version was great, of course the DVD was even better! I watched the special features and was intrigued by the comment about how all it really was was a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting, a shot of an apartment window, Jimmy Stewart reacting... etc. The film was so compelling I had actually never realized it was that simple!<br /><br />Of course, there was a little more to it than that, such as Grace Kelly climbing fire escapes, the little dog sniffing the flower bed, the scenes in Jeff's apartment, and the final scene. But for the most part, that's all it was. And you know a movie is excellent when it keeps your attention for that long when it's simple dialogue, seemingly simple shots, and relatively few special effects. It must have actually been very difficult to film. Jimmy Stewart was actually reacting to NOTHING. And yet, each reaction had to be subtly different. What a challenge!<br /><br />I remember watching the movie Disturbia a few years ago. I couldn't watch it without thinking of this movie. I don't know if they intended it to be an homage to Rear Window or not. But I do know that I might have liked Disturbia if only I had never seen Rear Window!</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>Few films offer this much attention to detail. Hitchcock created one of the most elaborate and stylish films ever made. Jimmy Stewart is in top form playing L.B. Jefferies, the photographer who enjoys to spy on his  neighbors in his free time. The beautiful Grace Kelly delivers a strong  female presence in the film, the scene where she first kisses Stewart is  incredibly sexy. While she is not remembered the most by her acting, but  then Hitchcock always said he used women as 'sex objects' and chose them  for their looks (the blonde goddess look seems to be his favorite), however  politically incorrect his methods were, it sure worked, and will keep on  working. Maybe Hitchcock's greatest accomplishment was making us feel like  a 'voyeur', and thinking that Stewart spying on his neighbors is a natural  thing, and we even want him to, more and more, as we get enthralled in the  mystery; did Mr. Thorwald kill his wife and is he really chopping up her  body?. We get hooked on that premise and that is when Hitchcock takes us  for a ride into his psychological roller-coaster, making us; the 'viewer',  feel like the 'voyeur', when we know that it is not right. The extremely  suspenseful ending is a knock-out and the whole film is an example of  Hollywood in it's golden years and of a genius at his peak. Extras: the  usual Hitchcock cameo; the person adjusting the clock in the piano player's  apartment. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>In this Alfred Hitchcock film, Jimmy Stewart plays a professional photographer confined to his apartment because of a broken leg. From his rear window, he is able to look out in the courtyard of the apartments around him and into the windows of other apartments. He becomes voyeur looking into to the lives of other people because he cannot get out on his own and he is bored with it. During the course of his vicarious living, he becomes suspicious about a neighbor and comes to believe that he is a murderer but nobody at first will believe him. Gradually, others come around but danger looms when the crook realizes that he is being watched.<br /><br />This has become something of a signature role for Jimmy Stewart. He gives a very creditable performance with only a single flaw. He is bored with life and bored with his adoring, socialite, beautiful and intelligent girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly. He displays ebullient, angry, pensive, playful and sarcastic moods well but he never quite manages to be convincing when he is bored with Grace Kelly. No one is that good an actor!<br /><br />The suspense in this film comes from wondering what is going to happen next and from the dramatic photography. There is no blood and gore. Kind of makes you miss the "good old days."</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>"Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jeffries."  That's what's been written on the plaster cast on the aforementioned Jeffries, an ace photographer who's been in a wheelchair for seven weeks because he got too close during a race car match.<br /><br />Jeffries is bored and listless, but at least his days in limbo gives him a view of life's passing parade through his binoculars, namely the other tenants whom he can see through his window.  The show's starring attraction is Miss Torso, a blonde buxom ballet dancer who can be seen shaking her thing and wearing nice pink bikinis-Jeffries expression on seeing her is priceless.  (Yes, she is nice, isn't she?) The songwriter who's lost his muse, a pair of newlyweds, a couple with a dog who fight the hot summer heat by sleeping on their balcony, and Miss Lonelyheart, a single woman who undergoes the being single blues.  However, during a particularly sleepless night, he notices how Mr. Thorvald, a jewelry salesman with an invalid wife, goes in and out of his apartment three times during the late hours, returning once with a large saw.  Why hasn't he been in his wife's bedroom all day?  "Something's terribly wrong," he surmises.<br /><br />Jeffries is also going through a bit of a crisis with his girlfriend Lisa Freemont, and they are quite a pair.  He's more a rough action-type of guy, having served in the war, going on tough assignments on one suitcase, entering tough situations, while she's "too perfect," having that chic, ultrasophisticated, rarified Park Avenue ambience, never wearing the same dress twice.  Jeffries is thinking that he wants someone too ordinary, someone who can bear up to his way of life if she wants to come along.  He's the old-fashioned type who thinks that "nothing has caused the world more trouble than intelligence," and goes on to discuss how psychoanalysis and interpretation of different emotional levels as examples.<br /><br />It takes the goings-on of the Thorwald apartment to draw the strained couple together, as Lisa uses her feminine intuition to realize that indeed a woman wouldn't leave such an expensive handbag, jewelry, and her wedding ring behind if she was going to leave on a long trip.  However, feminine intuition and Jeffries' speculations don't convince his war buddy and now detective Tom Doyle, who does some digging around to humor Jeffries and finds out the wife isn't dead.  And the final half hour, after a dramatic incident, when Lisa, Jeffries, and the latter's insurance-provided nurse Stella all join in and decide to brashly throw caution to the wind, that the excitement rises to a fever pitch.<br /><br />Rear Window's also one of the many New York films, showing the apartment life of the tenants as seen through Jeffries, played superbly by James Stewart in his second Hitchcock film, the other being Rope (1948), the next one to be the tepid remake of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and later, another classic, Vertigo (1958).<br /><br />Like Stewart, this was Grace Kelly's second of three Hitchcock films, the other two being Dial M For Murder and To Catch A Thief.  As Lisa Fremont, she gives one of her cold ice princess roles.  She looks elegant in her pink nightgown, and dresses well, but she provides a shot of audacity herself in the final half hour.<br />And Thelma Ritter does another great turn as Stella, giving her usual wisecracking schtick as a supplement to James Stewart's flippancy.  She tells of her talent as a foreteller of bad things, saying of the Wall Street crash, "When GM has to go the bathroom ten times a day, the whole country has to let go."  The other two players worth mentioning is Judith Evelyn as Miss Lonely Heart and as guilty pleasure/eye candy, Georgine Darcy as Miss Torso.  And it's Raymond Burr (Perry Mason, Ironside) as Mr. Thorvald himself.<br /><br />One of Hitchcock's all-time classics, and one of my favourite personal four, the others being Spellbound, Vertigo and The Birds.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MCC5MAJYJYMD.html">A3MCC5MAJYJYMD</a><br/><p>One of the best films made by Hitchcock.  Once again the master shows he is the master of suspense, even with a very limited setting.  Nice last line.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>When I was a child, I got so sick of hearing how brilliant Alfred Hitchcock was. To the extent that I never watched any of his movies, if you can believe it. Well, this one's pretty damn cool. I really don't want to overanalyze all the techniques that our beloved director employed so well, lest I spoil the fun. The plot centers around a question. Did Raymond Burr kill his wife and chop her up with saw and knife? That's the impression injured Jimmy Stewart got from peeping through the windows. We had to throw in some subplots and have some fun as well, because of the length, and it's excellent in doing that. Almost everybody sends up himself or herself a little bit, and we have some laughs in addition to trademark suspense, and it's a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>I don't think this is Hitch's best film.  It is highly ranked by film rating services, sometimes higher than Vertigo, but I can't agree.  There's something claustrophobic about what is essentially a movie set.  We are stuck in that lofty room with the big glass windows.  Jimmy Stewart peers across a courtyard and observes New Yorkers in their habitat.  When I was in elementary school we used to have projects called diorama's where we would take a shoebox and decorate it like a stage.  Each apartment in Hitch's diorama showcases a mostly silent vignette, the gorgeous dancer and her boyfriends, the lonely-heart middle-age lady, the sex crazed newlyweds, and the guy who kills his wife.<br /><br />Stewart can watch all the fun, but with a broken leg, he can't leave the apartment to do anything about it.  Hence, the suspense centers on Stewarts inability to maneuver when his girlfriend, fashion gal, Grace Kelly breaks into the killers apartment to find clues.  We see the killer coming down the hall and Jimmy can't warn her from his perch.<br /><br />Stewart and Kelly are interesting as a couple with opposite interests.  She's high fashion-society chick and he's a rough-it, world-traveling photographer.  These differences never resolve and Stewart appears maybe 15-20 years older than young marriage-scheming Grace.  The film is actually a stage play with stage play lighting and a who-dun-it plot. Great suspense, yes, but not as good as Vertigo by a mile.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>A bit slow at times, but classic Hitchock.<p>Summary:<br />L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is a photographer who broke his leg getting an exciting picture for his magazine.  As a result he has been stuck in his apartment for 7 weeks getting better and has one more to go.  He is dating Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly) but he doesn't want to marry her and he doesn't want to change his life to adapt to what married life would be like.  <p>When Jeff believes his neighbor, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), killed his wife, Mrs. Anna Thorwald (Irene Winston), he begins an intrigue that sucks in Lisa and several others and only ends when Lars comes into Jeff's apartment and nearly kills him.  <p>My Comments:<br />Either it is me aging or Hitchcock aging, but Hitchcock seems to get better the older I get.  The movie was fun to watch and the acting was pretty good.  Jeff's nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) was also a lot of fun, offering the wisdom of a wise woman's life in the time it takes to rub a man's back.  The set was brilliant (the entire story takes place in an a group of apartments).  And, perhaps best of all were the relationships that played out between the cast members.  There was love and loss and loneliness and rejection.  It was all there.<p>I never really felt any tension in the movie, but then again that could have been because there were moments when it was slow and I just didn't identify all that well with the characters.  But the film was very enjoyable nonetheless.  Great Hitchcock.  Also, the DVD special features were very informative and included interviews with most of the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>This 1954 film is taken from a short story by Cornell Woolrich. The opening shows apartment houses in Greenwich Village and the people who live there. It is 90F and people are sweating it out. [Crime goes up with the temperature.] L. B. Jeffries is a graying photographer laid up with a broken leg. His apartment overlooks the windows of other apartments, the adults there and in the courtyard. A woman comes over to give him a massage. His girl friend is from Park Avenue. The lighting in the apartments allows viewing into the rooms. Lisa Carol Fremont is quite well-dressed and brings along a fancy take-out meal. Lisa wants to domesticate LBJ, to get him to settle down and quite foreign travel. But LBJ loves his career as a news photographer (can he look into his future?). Lisa is an upper-class lady who is happy in her niche.<br /><br />At night LBJ sees a man from across the courtyard making many trips at night carrying a suitcase. He views the apartment with binoculars, then with a long-lens SLR camera. At time you hear children, but see none. LBJ is more interested in the man across the courtyard than in luscious Lisa, and this upsets Lisa. What happened to Thorwald's wife? [Decomposition would be rapid in the 90F heat.] LBJ seems cranky from being stuck in his room for the past 7 weeks. Lisa says Mrs. Thorwald would not have left her favorite purse and jewelry behind. Lt. Tom Doyle warns against imagining things, he checked out the shipped trunk. [No search warrant needed?] The death of a pet dog is ominous. Only one person didn't come out to look!<br /><br />The amateurs continue to snoop into Thorwald's life. They wonder if something was buried in the back yard. Lisa enters Thorwald's apartment, is found, but the police take her away. LBJ answers the phone without saying "hello" and talks too much. There is a suspenseful series of heavy footsteps (believable?), then Thorwald enters the room. Can flashbulbs stop a murderer? The police arrive in time.<br /><br />The temperature drops to 70F. We see what happened to the others across the courtyard. The success of this film tells much about popular taste in those times. It is basically a short story that is padded out to make a long story. I would not rate it among the top Hitchcock films. "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and "North by Northwest" were better remakes of earlier films. Such snooping about neighbors is a feature of small-town life, unlike the anonymity of a big city. But some could call this concerns of small-town life friendliness or caring. Before radio or TV.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Every film is an artifact of its era and "Rear Window" is no different so those expecting slam bang action like they see in "The Matrix" should look elsewhere. All of that said, "Rear Window" still stands tall as a film classic because of the themes, artistry of Hitchcock, the performances and the witty dialogue that we hear in the film. Unseen except for rare TV performances in the early 60's and rare revival house showings, "Rear Window" looks extremely good in its DVD presentation although clearly no complete restoration was done here like was done for "Vertigo" (but "Rear Window" wasn't in as bad a shape as "Vertigo" either). This edition looks better than the previous DVD (although it should be noted it's the same transfer as what was in the Hitchcock boxed set release four years ago)with a nice anamorphic transfer. Some people seem to think that film grain is a bad thing--it's not it's just how the film looks and "Rear Window" is no exception. Expecting this to look like a film produced in 2008 isn't realistic and it won't--but it still looks darn good.<br /><br />Extras are as follows: The extras that came with the boxed set as well as those from the previous single DVD release have been ported over to this release as well. We get two new delicious extras--a theme appropriate episode of "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" with the Hitchcock directed episode ""Mr. Blanchard's Secret" and also excerpts from the interview Traffaut did with Hitchcock for his book in the early 60's.<br /><br />Other extras: Audio commentary by author John Falwell, "Rear Window Ethics", Interview with Writer John Michael Hayes", "Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master", "Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock", production notes, theatrical trailers, photo gallery, audio interview excerpts from Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock,<br /><br />A plot synopsis is below for those intereested:<br /><br />Spying through a glass darkly (his camera lens), L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) believes a neighbor (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. His evidence is circumstanial at best and the wheelchair bound photographer has to convince his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly)of the crime. In the process he puts his friends in harm's way. Hitch laces his film with more than a touch of humor and irony pulling this thriller together as it's L.B.'s peeping that reveals the ugly underneath--revealing something unsavory about himself as well without him truly realizing it.<br /><br />Hitchcock manages to do more with less than just about any director out there. Using a single soundstage, a small cast and the witty script by John Michael Hayes, Hitchcock crafts one of his classic films. "Rear Window" has aged yes but it looks, sounds and plays remarkably well fifty four years after it's original theatrical release. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie because I had seen Vertigo and I really didn't like the casting choice of James Stewart.  But I'm on a bit of a Hitchcock thing right now and want to see all of his films.  One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment.  The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife was alive, but that the neighbor was in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious treasure and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife.  Over all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous "Hitchcock Twists", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes.  What intrigued me is that we can witness Stewart's voyeurism, taking the journey with him from curiosity to suspicion to certainty to fear, finally subconsciously delighting in becoming voyeurs ourselves.  I actually caught myself sitting up on the edge of my couch near the end of this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>One of Hitchcock's favourites of his own films, REAR WINDOW is up there with the master's best, including VERTIGO, NORTH BY NORTHWEST and PSYCHO. James Stewart has one of his best roles here as L.B Jefferies, a photographer who busts up his leg and gets stuck in an apartment with nothing to do but stare at the neighbours. Voyerism, wit and suspense are all well played and along with Jimmy's great performance, there is the amazing Grace Kelly and Ramond Burr as the surly neighbour who may, or may not have killed his wife. Franz Waxman's musical score adds a tense layer of gripping suspense, with one of the scores where the music is the 5th character. Everything about the film is brilliant. What other film could you mention where every line is classic? Stella: 'Let's go down there and find out what's buried in that garden.' Lisa Carol Fremont: 'Why not? I've always wanted to meet Mrs. Thorwald.'<br />If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. It is one of the most superbly-crafted films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>This 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic was nominated for four Academy awards.  I remember seeing it years ago and loving it.  Seeing it again, I'm reminded of the way things used to be, and it is certainly worthwhile as a retro experience.  It's interesting to see the clothing styles and the dial telephones.  There's also a mystery that kept me interested.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart is cast in the role of a photographer with a broken leg.  He's confined to his apartment which is supposed to be in New York's Greenwich village.  From his window, he observes his neighbors.  And the apartment house across the street just happens to be designed in a way that he can look into the windows of all the apartments and get a bird's eye view into the lives other people's lives.  Every day a nurse, played by Thelma Ritter, comes to look in on him.  She shares his interest in his neighbors and she counsels him about his love life.  It seems his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly, wants to marry him but he holds back because she is a society girl and he doubts if she can fit into his life of international travel to a wide variety of war-torn and isolated places.  But as the film progresses, she gets more and more involved in what he suspects is a murder in the apartment across the courtyard.  She's beautiful, of course, with an unnaturally tiny waistline which was the style in those days, and she plays her part well.  Raymond Burr is cast in the role of the supposed murderer.  Did he or did he not kill his wife?  This is the storyline that keeps the audience guessing.<br /><br />The plot moves swiftly and it certainly captured my interest.  And Hitchcock had a way of capturing suspense that is unique.  It is successful as a film in most ways.  But it's 2010 now I'm a bit jaded.  That why, in spite of my giving this film a high recommendation, I'm not exactly sure that it has stood the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>"Rear Window," of course, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most glittering masterpieces, and the great thing about this DVD is that it goes a long way in showing us why. First, it presents the film in a beautiful new restoration, with glowing colors and crisp picture definition. Second, it provides a fascinating feature in the Extras section, describing how Hitchcock designed the set--one of the most ingenious production designs in cinematic history. It contains interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, including several of the neighbors on whom L.B. "Jeff" Jefferies (James Stewart) trained his binoculars. The featurette fills us with renewed awe at Hitchcock, one of the most meticulous directors ever as well as one of the most brilliant, and at how he could keep such myriad, tiny details in his head as he made this film.<br /><br />And the film itself? I can only add my few droplets to the oceans of deserved praise it has received over the last half-century. What perfect casting: like a master chef, Hitchcock blends the disparate styles of Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr into something delicious and unique. What superbly timed suspense: if your pulse rate doesn't exceed 200 beats per minute as Stewart listens to Burr's footsteps up the stairs, growing closer and closer in a measured beat, you need to see your doctor immediately. And of course the first appearance of Kelly, a breathtaking blonde beauty arising as if from a dream, will haunt you forever. If you've never seen "Rear Window," you won't regret buying this DVD sight unseen. If you have seen it, I can't imagine you wouldn't want this DVD immediately for your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A10E3F50DIUJEE.html">A10E3F50DIUJEE</a><br/><p>I think that this is one of Hitchcock's most popular and entertaining films.  I truly adore Jimmy Stewart, and his work with Hitchcock is just magical (Rope, Vertigo, and the Man Who Knew Too Much).  Grace Kelly IS the Hitchcock blonde.  Their dysfunctional relationship is believable and well acted.  Thelma Ritter stands out, even among these two, to be a transcendent comic character.<br /><br />The story itself is still so intriguing: a voyeur witnesses a crime, but has trouble convincing others because he is prying on his unsuspecting neighbors.  I think reality t.v. proves just how much interest we all have in the lives of others.  The timeless storyline is so well acted and cleverly presented; it is difficult NOT to like this film.<br /><br />The DVD is quality, but it is obvious that the extensive reconstruction work used on Vertigo is not present here.  All the extras make it a must have.  For Hitchcock fans it is a must.  So indulge your voyeuristic curiosities ... Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Based on the Cornell Woolrich short story `It Had to be Murder' (penned under the name William Irish), director Alfred Hitchcock takes his long-time obsession with sexual voyeurism to an entirely new level. This time it revolves around a man left impotent, so-to-speak, from an accident (shown in the beginning in a photo from a car accident at a race track) which has left his leg broken and confines him to a wheelchair. The man's sole source of amusement and pleasure during the day (and occasionally in the evening) is intruding on his neighbors' privacy from the comfort of his apartment window and observing their daily lives. There are three frames in which the brilliant cinematography of the film is shaped. The first comes from the point-of-view of Mr. Hitchcock's motion-picture camera. The second is from Stewart's binoculars (only briefly) and his high-powered telephoto lens (meant of course to be sexually suggestive). And the third is straight from the window itself. Nearly every shot in Rear Window, with the exception of a few, are seen entirely from the point-of-view of James Stewart's character, Jeff. While confined in this solitary apartment building, the audience sees exactly what he sees; nothing more and nothing less. The audience is placed in the same emotional element as Jefferies, whether it is frustration, excitement, or fear. We are craning our necks just as he is to get even the tiniest glimpse of what we assume is taking place inside Thorwald's apartment - murder.<br /><br />Yet at the same time we the audience struggle with ourselves. We are all fully aware that human beings are not infallible and therefore are easily susceptible to jumping to conclusion for whatever reasons or motives, whether it stems from prejudice, ignorance, or something else entirely. This makes Lars Thorwald a sympathetic villain in a way. Ironically, Jefferies who jumps to the conclusion that Thorwald is guilty of murdering his own wife without any circumstantial evidence to prove it cautions Detective Doyle "Careful, Tom", as he glances at the contents of Lisa's suitcase which contains pink lingerie as if to suggest that she will staying the night at his place. All the same however we are still left with a sense of uneasiness. The scene in which Lars confronts Lisa and physically assaults her in his apartment before the police arrive on the scene is the precise moment which proves his guilt to us. Some may suggest rather that it is the death of the `dog who knew too much' but there was no direct proof he committed this violent crime, though audiences are meant to believe he did.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock brings up through the course of the film the analytical topic of `rear window ethics'. Is it right for a man or woman to spy on one's neighbor even if it turns out that the person is indeed guilt of murder? Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa, brings up this exact argument just when it seems as though their little investigation into the mysterious disappearance of Mrs. Thorwald has hit a dead-end. Then, moments later, a woman's scream is heard outside. The little dog which belonged to the couple living on the fire escape is found dead with its neck broken as if strangled. The distraught woman who owned the dog cries out, ""Which one of you did it? Which one of you killed my dog? You don't know the meaning of the word 'neighbor.' Neighbors like each other, speak to each other, care if anybody lives or dies, but none of you do", as if to directly counter Lisa's argument a few minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nearly as entertaining and enthralling as the murder mystery which ultimately shapes the main course of the picture, the distinctive subplots of the assorted neighbors surrounding L.B. Jefferies's apartment building stands as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's finer touches in Rear Window. The set itself is simply breathtaking. An impressive feat of engineering and filmmaking, it was built entirely within the confines of a Paramount studio soundstage with several of the apartments themselves fully furnished. Georgine Darcy, for example, who plays the exquisitely sensual Miss Torso, used her apartment as if it were her real home, relaxing in between takes. Her character of course was the most blatant examples in this Rear Window of Hitchcock willfully taunting the Production Code, although there were plenty more besides this one background character. The director nonetheless enjoyed nearly every minute of it. In order to get around the complication of filming a leering depiction of Miss Torso, Hitchcock shot her scenes in three ways - one topless, one with her wearing white undergarments, and the other with her wearing black undergarments. Playing all three versions off the Production Code, he was able to keep intact all the scenes he intended for her by making it appear as though one version was less sexually suggestive then the other two.<br /><br />In addition to Miss Torso, there is one scene in particular in which Lisa proposes to Jeff that she be allowed to spend the night in his apartment is oozing with double entendres. While proving to him that she can live out a suitcase like he can she retorts, "I'll bet yours isn't this small?" And as she exposes the contents of her little suitcase, "Compact, but, uh, ample enough", pink lingerie is revealed. The daunting eloquence of Grace Kelly makes this scene all the more erotically charged.<br /><br />Two subplots which ultimately converge, to quote the insurance nurse Stella, like `two taxis on Broadway' and shift from agonizing heartbreak to emotional euphoria are those of the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart. Miss Lonelyheart's introduction is truly lamentable with her enacting a scene in which a gentlemen caller pays her a visit, complete with fine wine for toasting, while in the distance Jefferies raises a glass of wine toasting her as Lisa prepares an intimate dinner in the background. This of course is all perfectly ironic, demonstrating Jefferies's emotional distance from Lisa and his inability to commit to her, choosing instead to immerse himself in his `rear window' world as he has done for the past six weeks. Adding to the paradox, Bing Crosby's `To See You Is To Love You' plays in the distance as Miss Lonelyheart snaps back to reality, realizes she is alone, and buries her head in her arms and weeps.<br /><br />The next we see of both the Composer and Miss Lonelyheart, alcohol is heavily involved (the Composer staggers into his apartment drunk and Miss Lonelyheart takes several stiff drinks before leaving her apartment searching for male company). In yet another slight tinge of irony, Lisa starring out the window of the apartment listening to a tune on the wind says, "Where does a man get inspiration to write a song like that?" The Composer is playing the tune called `Mona Lisa' just as Miss Lonelyheart is sexually assaulted by a man who she proceeds to toss out of her apartment and then collapses on her couch weeping. The scene and tune itself can be interpreted two ways - for the Composer it is instantly identified with the famous painting by Leonardo Da Vinci (considered his muse) while for Miss Lonelyheart it is linked with the lyrics of the Nate King Cole song of the same name which references sexual assault.<br /><br />Her suicide attempt (complete with suicide note, Bible, and an overdose of sleeping pills) at the precise moment Jefferies is calling Thorwald's apartment to warn Lisa of his impending return make Jefferies next move (should he call the police in order to stop Miss Lonelyheart from killing herself or try and save the woman he supposedly loves by warning her of Lars Thornwald's return to the apartment) all the more intense. It culminates with Miss Not-So-Lonelyheart paying the Composer a visit whose song he has been composing all this time and what ultimately stopped her from taking her own life.<br /><br />Of course there is nothing humorous about a cute little dog having its neck broken but if one could find some amusement in this scene then it would have to be Lisa's line upon realizing that the dog was digging up something in Thornwald's garden, "Maybe he knew too much". This of course is a jab at Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Much (Stewart in interviews referred to the little pup as `The Dog Who Knew Too Much), a remake of which he was currently working on to start James Stewart.<br /><br />As Jefferies explains to Stella, his insurance nurse, he's not ready for marriage and that Lisa, his girlfriend, is too `Park Avenue' for his lifestyle, as he puts it a `camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank', he stares into an apartment where a newlywed couple has just moved. From this moment on until the end of the film, every time Jefferies looks toward their apartment window either the shades are closed or the husband in his underwear sticks his head outside to get a breath of fresh air only to be called back by his sexually unquenchable newlywed wife. The irony of this couple is that when the husband announces to his newlywed wife at the end of the film that he is quitting his job, the honeymoon is officially over, both literally and figuratively, leaving her to exclaim to him, "But if you'd told me you quit your job, we wouldn't have gotten married". In contrast to the relationship between Jefferies and Lisa, it leaves their future together rather open ended, especially if these two lovebirds are already having marital troubles.<br /><br />Whether or not Jefferies and Lisa wind up together and the rest of their neighbors find some sort of happiness is entirely irrelevant. Hitchcock believed (or so he said in interviews) that the characters and the story ended when the film ended. What is for certain however is the brilliance of this film. The performances are top-notch (easily the best in Grace Kelly's sadly short-lived film career and one of the best in James Stewart's lengthy career as an actor), the script is intricately woven with meaningful subplots and wrought with tension and excitement, and director Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game. You couldn't ask for anything more. Rear Window is without a doubt Alfred Hitchcock's best motion picture of his career, if not the best of the 1950s.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV.html">A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV</a><br/><p>This terrific thriller from Alfred Hitchcock about our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism starring Jimmy Stewart and  the lovely Grace Kelly is one of his most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character driven film and the suspense builds slowly to a fever pitch, a bonafide grab the edge of your seat nail biter. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.<br /><br />Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer laid up in a cast due to an accident while on assignment and Grace Kelly is his doting girlfriend. We should all be so lucky. But Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his situation but about his relationship with Lisa (Kelly), whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella  (Thelma Ritter) makes for great entertainment as Jeff is bored and begins watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera.<br /><br />Jeff becomes involved in their lives like he is watching a daily soap opera, much to the disapproval of Lisa. He takes to heart their loneliness and finds pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff begins to piece together what he has seen in one apartment and fears he may be spying on a killer. Both Lisa and his cop pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning.<br /><br />His own disbelief and Lisa's early scorn turns into an obsession that becomes evermore dangerous for all of them as Lisa begins to believe him and becomes his legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife may believe Jeff has seen too much, putting all their lives in danger. Hitchcock uses his own lens to show the voyeuristic climate Jeff has become comfortable with dangerously changing to a one on one confrontation.<br /><br />This is wonderful entertainment. It moves deftly from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, graduating to heart pounding suspense. This is a teriffic and enjoyable film and one of Hitchcock's best. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart. Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable.<br /><br />But it is Jimmy Stewart who hits this one out of the park to dead center. He gives one of his finest performances, conveying the irritation of being in a cast and the emotional helplessness when he may not be able to escape the consequences of his own voyeurism because of it. You'll watch this one many times over. A great film to pop in the vcr late on a rainy night. Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>Show of hands please --- Who here loves anything with Jimmy Stewart in it?  How about the lovely Grace Kelly?<br /><br />Results --- [Entire world placing hands skyward.]  :)<br /><br />Well that's not surprising. Put Jimmy and Grace together (in an Alfred Hitchcock flick no less!), and you can't help but to have a classic piece of motion picture entertainment.<br /><br />One of the all-time great suspense films, "Rear Window" (1954) places us (the viewer) squarely in the shoes of L.B. Jefferies (Stewart), as he peers out his "rear window" at his courtyard neighbors. (BTW -- My spelling of "Jefferies" in this review IS correct. I've noticed "Jefferies" almost always being misspelled "Jeffries" (lacking an "E").  The spelling of Jeff's last name can easily be verified at the beginning of the movie, when the camera pans across his leg cast, revealing the words: "Here lie the broken bones of L.B. Jefferies". I assume that the filmmakers didn't deliberately have Jeff's last name misspelled on the plaster cast. Of course, I suppose that's always *possible*; but I fail to see a reason WHY they'd do it.)  :-)<br /><br />Hitchcock lets the plot of the movie unfold in sections, building the suspense and drama with his usual superb efficiency and skill.  But "Rear Window", when you stop and think about it for a minute, doesn't really follow the same "format" as many (or most) other Hitchcock pictures -- in that we (the audience) are just as much in the dark about this possible "murder" across the courtyard as L.B. Jefferies is.  In many of the director's films, "Hitch" lets his viewing audience know, right up front, that there's a "bomb under the table" (to use Hitchcock's own example from his interviews).  But in "Window", Mr. H. doesn't give us much up front, and lets us discover things as they happen, right along with Jefferies.<br /><br />There is one particular part of this movie that has always left me scratching my head, wondering why nothing was done about it during the course of the film. .... Near the beginning of the picture, just after Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) leaves Jeff's apartment, Mr. Jefferies hears a woman scream and hears glass breaking right after the scream.  Now -- my question is: WHY didn't Jeff tell his detective friend (Thomas J. Doyle) about having heard this "scream and breaking glass" when he called Doyle into the "case" a short time later? Such evidence would surely have gone a long way toward convincing Jeff's skeptical pal that something HAD indeed occurred across the yard. But this "scream" is never once mentioned in the movie.<br /><br />But, even with this little "hole" in the plot (IMO), "Rear Window" remains near the top of my list of "Best Hitchcock Films".  Everything about it is impressive --- The small courtyard (which was actually custom-built right on the movie-studio's soundstage!); the kooky neighbors; the tension-filled storyline; Hitchcock's cameo in the "songwriter's" apartment; the radio playing in the background; the "street sounds"; "Miss Torso"; Jimmy Stewart's performance; Thelma Ritter as the sassy nurse; Grace Kelly for just being there; the mysterious trips with the suitcase; etc., etc.<br /><br />This DVD comes under Universal's "Collector's Edition" label, and is packed with many first-rate extra features. Let's probe these, shall we? ..........<br /><br />>> "Rear Window Ethics" is a 55-minute original documentary detailing the making of this Hitchcock classic and the restoration process undertaken to bring the film back to visual perfection for this first-ever DVD release. Very good documentary.<br /><br />>> There is also a second featurette about the film, entitled "Screenwriter John Michael Hayes On Rear Window". This bonus lasts 13:10.<br /><br />>> Photo Gallery. -- This gallery of production photos and advertising materials runs all by itself on its own timed track.  Music from the film plays as you watch the images go by.  The gallery CAN be paused for longer looks at each image.  Running time (without pausing) is 3:07.<br /><br />>> Original Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />>> Re-release Trailers for 5 different Hitchcock films. -- Narrated by James Stewart.  Length: 6:15.<br /><br />>> Text features with "Production Notes" and some biography pieces on the Cast & Crew.<br /><br />Another small "mini-bonus" I kind of like is a video montage of Hitchcock movie clips when "Play" is selected from the Main Menu. This, however, can easily be bypassed quickly with an additional remote key stroke.<br /><br />Video and Audio Specifications:<br /><br />This color film is presented in an Anamorphic Widescreen format, and looks mighty fine thanks to the restoration efforts. The image is as clear and clean as we've ever seen it. The 2-channel Mono Dolby Digital soundtrack serves the material on screen adequately.<br /><br />Ratio Talk .... The packaging says this DVD's Widescreen aspect ratio is 1.66:1. But, due to the inherent nature of the "anamorphic" transfer process (i.e.: the requirement of placing all anamorphically-enhanced DVD material inside a 16x9-shaped [1.78:1] area of the screen), the ratio of this movie (1.66:1) will be displayed on your TV in a somewhat wider-looking ratio (closer to the more commonly-utilized ratio for movies of 1.85:1).*<br /><br />* = That is, if your TV is a "standard" set, with a 4x3-shaped screen, that also has the ability to perform the "Anamorphic Squeeze" function. But, if you watch this DVD on a "Widescreen 16x9" set, then the image should fill the entire screen (except for small "pillarboxed" bars on the left and right sides of the screen). But on some 16x9 TVs, these "side bars" aren't visible due to the "overscan".<br /><br />In any event, the anamorphic image on this disc looks quite good, no matter how it's ultimately formatted onto your screen.<br /><br />Also -- If you have a "standard" (4x3) TV with the "16x9 Anamorphic Squeeze" or "Compression" feature, and you decide you want to watch the film in its true ratio of 1.66:1, you can always turn off the "compression" feature on your TV and switch your DVD Player's settings to "4x3 Letterbox" mode. This combination of settings will allow the 1.66:1 aspect ratio to take shape on your TV screen (albeit with slightly less image clarity due to the "Anamorphic" feature being turned off).<br /><br />A four-page booklet is included inside this DVD package, with a chapter listing on the back, plus some Production Notes and reproductions of five "Rear Window" lobby cards/posters.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window" has stood the test of time for many decades, and will no doubt stand erect for many more to come.  If you like this movie, there's no better way to re-visit it than by indulging in this picture-perfect "Collector's Edition" DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>Rear Window, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is well deserving of its #41 spot on the AFI top 100 listing. It is suspenseful and interesting even over 50 years later. It touches on issues we face in our current times. And, perhaps more amazingly, it manages to pass the Bechdel test, something that few AFI movies manage to do! It has two strong, named female characters who talk to each other about a topic other than men. Most movies fail this simple test. In Rear Window, Hitchcock provides equal strength and time to both the females and males in the story line.<br /><br />Stewart is a photographer stuck in a wheelchair, resigned to peering out his windows at his neighbors. In our modern times this might seem a casual thing. Heck, we know the second-by-second details of our far off friends thanks to Twitter and Facebook. However, in the 50s this was considered less of a normal thing to do. He's even scolded by people around him for intruding on their privacy. Amazingly, we really do come to care about these people around him, even though they don't have names. The sad, lonely woman who eats alone and gets roughed up by a guy she brings home. The newlywed couple who goes from bliss to bickering. The loving couple with their cute little dog.<br /><br />Even when Stewart gets concerned about an invalid wife who seems to go missing, he's still being caught up in all the dramas around him. The song-writing guy and his piano. The ballerina with her bevy of admirers. The whole courtyard is fascinating.<br /><br />I love how Kelly shows her strength and surprises him with her independence. I also cringe when her quite astute observations are dismissed as "women's intuition" - as if they are not based on logic.<br /><br />I do find the ending to be a bit contrived. The killer was an extremely logical, methodical man who planned out every last detail of what he was doing. He knew there were multiple people aware of what was going on. Why in the world would he try to kill just one of them? Surely that would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt his guilt? Why not take off to safety? To me that's the one false note in this story. They needed a more rational reason behind what he does at the end.<br /><br />Still, a great story with a wealth of details. This demonstrates quite clearly the power of creating a rich atmosphere for a story. So many other movies have throwaway background characters who have little to distinguish them. Here we have a rich array of characters who we really care about - and when the ballerina's "not a GQ model" boyfriend comes home to her, and she clearly adores him, it's richly fulfilling.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Released in 1954, REAR WINDOW was a major success with critics and public alike--and unlike some Hitchcock films, which were praised at the time but negatively re-evaluated, it has held up incredibly well over time.<br /><br />Loosely suggested by several notorious crimes, the premise of REAR WINDOW is widely famous.  Photographer L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his New York apartment with a broken leg, alternately nursed and harrassed by his elegant girl friend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and pragmatic day nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter.)  Annoyed and bored, he begins to watch his neighbors across the courtyard--and soon notices the activites of Mr. and Mrs. Thorwald (Raymond Burr and Irene Winston.)  Their quarrels quite suddenly cease, Mrs. Thorwald is no longer visible, and Mr. Thorwald is unexpectedly given to taking packages out of the house.  Is it murder?<br /><br />The set for REAR WINDOW has long garnered a great deal of attention, and deservedly so: it is a meticulous sound stage re-creation of New York apartment buildings of the era, and with few exceptions both the camera work and sound effects are presented from Jefferies' point of view: we see what he sees and hear what he hears.  In the process, we become as much of a peeping tom as Jefferies himself, a device that tends to make audiences increasingly squirm as the film progresses.  At the same time, however, we are also privy to Jefferies' private life, most particularly his rocky relationship with Lisa, who wants marriage but whom Jefferies rejects as incompatible with his own lifestyle.<br /><br />The performances here are extraordinary, with James Stewart cast against type as Jefferies and Grace Kelly sparkling as the high-fashion Lisa.  But the real stunner is the supporting cast, which ranges from the truly remarkable Thelma Ritter to the host of players who are glimpsed from Jefferies' window as they go about their daily routines: the lonely lady, the musician, the newly married couple, the scultor, the woman with the dog--and, of course, "Miss Torso," a particularly voluptuous blonde who spends her time in what Lisa calls "a woman's hardest job: juggling wolves!"<br /><br />This is Hitchcock working at the peak of his talents, working his themes of isolation, vulnerability, and most particularly voyerism to the nth degree.  The script is tight, the cinematography is flawless, and the production designs are beyond perfection.  Critics may argue which film can be regarded as Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece, but even the most picky among them will place REAR WINDOW either at or very near the top slot--and so will you.  Truly memorable and beautifully restored on this DVD release.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Made in 1954, Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window has indeed stood the test of time. It's one of the great and grand treasures of film and it is as much of a romance as it is a brilliant exercise in suspense. Considered to be one of the all time greatest films, Rear Window really pulls you in, bringing out all our voyeuristic instincts.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart stars as Jeff Jeffreys, a magazine photographer laid up with a broken leg. Irritable and bored, he suffers through recovery stuck in a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment with little to do but complain to his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), avoid discussing marriage with his girlfriend, society belle Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), and stare out the window into the apartments of his neighbors.<br /><br />It is not yet 8 A.M., but the temperature is already in the 90's and across the court, and a couple sleeping on the fire escape stirs. We watch, along with Jeff, while other anonymous heat-exhausted city dwellers come to sluggishly to life.<br /><br />There's Miss Lonely Hearts (Judith Evelyn) in a downstairs apartment dreaming of romance, and the vivacious and sexy Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy) upstairs shooing men away. The Composer (Ross Bagdasarian) makes beautiful music but lives the life of a frustrated artist, while a hearing-impaired sculptor (Jesslyn Fax) works day and night, and two newlyweds (Rand Harper and Havis Davenport) spend there days entwined in passionate ecstasy.<br /><br />The suspense comes when Jeff grows suspicious of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a jewelry salesman, who lives right across the court. Lars has been doing strange things with rope, some carving knives, and a clothes trunk. And what has happened to Lar's wife? As Jeff becomes increasingly suspicious that Lars has committed murder, he gets Lisa to act has his accomplice.<br /><br />Lisa shows that, when the chips are down, she's as capable of breaking-and-entering a possible murderer's apartment, scaling a wall to do so, as she is of wearing couture gowns. Rear Window grabs the viewer in the same way Thorwald grabs the photographer's eye. Once the hook is in place, there's no way out of the intricate spiral of suspense, and the film is just as much an incisive study of human nature as it is a thriller.<br /><br />One of the best attributes of the movie is the huge set, designed by Hal Pereira and built at the Paramount studio. It represents the best of studio artifice, being a unit that includes the rear of Jeff's apartment as well as his view of the garden court and buildings that enclose the court. As lighted and photographed by Robert Burks, this set is as much a character as any of the actors in the film.<br /><br />But at the heart of the film are the grand performances of Stewart, who captures perfectly Jeff's mixture of fascination and abhorrence at the glimpses of life outside his window, and the beautiful Miss Kelly, who, after receiving star billing in three previous films, showed that she was entitled to it in Rear Window. After all these years, the enormous glamour of these two personalities remains fresh and attractive, and even as contemporary as ever. Mike Leonard September 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Like the Greenwich Village courtyard view from its titular portal, Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window is both confined and multileveled: both its story and visual perspective are dictated by its protagonist's imprisonment in his apartment, convalescing in a wheelchair, from which both he and the audience observe the lives of his neighbors. Cheerful voyeurism, as well as the behavior glimpsed among the various tenants, affords a droll comic atmosphere that gradually darkens when he sees clues to what may be a murder. Definately  one of Hitchcocks best, but my favorite is, and always will be Psycho. See it today.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Hitchcock directed his movies so that the audience would see and feel exactly what the characters in the movie experienced.  Never was this done more obviously or more effectively than in Rear Window, the 1954 classic with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.  <p>Stewart is a magazine photographer who has suffered a broken leg.  He is forced to spend most of his day in a wheelchair, and his only entertainment is staring out the window of his Greenwich Village apartment.  Kelly is in love with him and wants to marry him.  He wants no part of that (for some reason) and is contemplating ending the relationship.<p>It is interesting that we learn a lot about six or seven of his neighbors just by watching with Stewart.  There's the songwriter, who goes from failure to success right before our eyes, and the newlywed couple, who move in at the beginning full of love and lust and end up at the end like a couple married for 20 years.  Miss Torso is his name for a shapely young woman with multiple suitors and he calls another Miss Lonelyhearts, who is desperate for companionship.<p>The most interesting neighbor is Raymond Burr.  He has an invalid wife who disappears suddenly.  Stewart sees suspicious things in the middle of the night and develops a theory that Burr has killed his wife and disposed of her.  At first no one believes him, but eventually they come along and spy with him, trying to figure out what happened.  Stewart has a detective friend who refuses to be convinced, but Stewart tries over and over to explain why he thinks the wife is dead.<p>Throughout the film, Hitchcock has us totally hooked.  We are right there with Stewart and we are totally enamored by Kelly, who may have one of the most sensual screen openings in film history.  Thelma Ritter is Stewart's housemaid, and she dispenses advice on relationships and how to handle this supposed murder.<p>In the end, we learn whether Stewart's suspicions have any merit.  I can say that there is lots of tension and suspense along the way.  It takes real guts to make a film like this, where you are limited to one section of a room for almost two hours.  Hitchcock's genius is clearly obvious here.  One of the master's five best films of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/AD2BIAIH78QI5.html">AD2BIAIH78QI5</a><br/><p>When Grace Kelly utters that line to James Stewart, she like he has her gaze riveted to the window watching the goings-on across the back courtyard. Now we know that she finally believes his fantastical claim that the seemingly innocuous nearby apartment dweller (pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr in a white wig)has in fact murdered his nagging invalid wife.<p>Stewart has been laid up for weeks in his apartment with a leg cast, unable to pursue his adventurous life as a daredevil photographer. Bored, he has taken to watching the antics of the apartment dwellers across the way. Things look a little strange about Burr and his now-absent wife, so Stewart's long-dormant imagination takes him into a cat and mouse game with dangerous consequences.<p>I like &quot;Rear Window&quot; quite a lot: the speaking actors are all first-rate, like the aforementioned Stewart and Kelly, and also reliable Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse who has her own pet theories about where &quot;things&quot; might be buried. Then there's a  pile of non-speaking actors, the pantomine players comprising the apartment dwellers, whose skill makes the whole movie work. Costuming for Grace is great, too; there are numerous occasions for her to spin about in haute couture outfits while trying to tempt the wheelchair bound Stewart away from his voyeuristic habits.<p>If you've ever tried to piece together what the folks across the courtyard from you are doing, whether behind drawn shades or out in plain sight, throw open &quot;Rear Window&quot; and take a peek.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Why is Rear Window so important? FIRST, because it sums up all the elements that made Hitchcock a master among directors. It presents his vision of what Cinema was all about. It has a flawless screenplay with, director, stars and technicians at their peak form. SECOND, because Rear Window is one perfect example of the production triumphs the studio-system industrial line of work could generate . THIRD, because it is not just a classical work: it shows the evolution from the classical period in film history towards modern cinema. FOURTH, because it is one perfect example of mastering a technique.<p>I will not bother with the story (which by now, I guess everybody already knows it - a man on a wheelchair watching his neighbors from his window... the crime... etc.) because the story is just one small aspect of what makes this film great. In fact, what it is important to point out is that this story (which is very simple) was translated into a screenplay structurally perfect. This perfection gives depth to the characters, amplifies relationships and oppositions (the stuff drama is made of) and makes the viewer an active part of the spectacle. The viewer works his way through the film and sees things we do not see very often on today's commercial cinema.<p>Plus it is now on DVD. Restored. The image is beautiful and the sound is fine dolby mono 2.0 (although I was expecting a stereo soundtrack when I heard the DVD restoration was coming). The extras are fine (could be improved). Anyway, when the work is that great, who complains about small things? An absolute gem that demands multiple viewings and endless analysis. <p>My favorite line: Thelma Ritter's &quot;When General Motors has to go to the bathroom 10 times a day, the whole country's ready to let go.&quot;</p></br></body></html>

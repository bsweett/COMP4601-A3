No, correction: let's take a stroll down the big broad generous boardwalk of Coney Island, down past the Carousel of Dying Dreams, pausing a moment to stare at the Ferris Wheel of Decay and Death and Dissolution.<br /><br />No. Don't stare. Darron Aronofsky's sophomore effort, "Requiem for a Dream", is a subversive instrument. It should be regulated by the secret police. It is a vicious sucker punch to the unprepared, unsuspecting kidney masquerading as an anti-drug flick. Be warned, this godawful thing has teeth. You will cry. You will blanch. Your face, virtuous, untainted by human sin (relatively, in our Relative World), will get all white and taut. You will get sick at your stomach. You might puke.<br /><br />OK, there; disclaimers out of the way. Ma Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn, amazing, truly, descended from Heaven with a fiery sword of Truth, I sh*t thee not) is a pudgy, rugose widow who dreams of getting on the game show she watches with cultic fervor. She lives in Brooklyn. She's aging, bored, flabby, tired. She is Hungry.<br /><br />Her son Harry Goldfarb (the incomparable Jared Leto): living on the fringe in Brooklyn, hooking up with his needle-romancing friends on the fringes of a decaying Coney Island. Harry wants to be rich. He wants to fly. He wants to do the funky chicken dance only unrestricted "H" can bring about. He dreams of the big score. He wants to buy Ma Goldfarb a huge-a**ed Tee-Vee, where she can watch Gameshows Valhalla-style. He is Hungry.<br /><br />Oh, but there's more: Dreams are like that. Like wars, they have dictionaries of casualties. There is an infinite supply of fresh, warm-blooded young meat for the grinder. Shall we continue? We shall. There's Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans, redeeming himself), who imagines himself to be a better man---for his own life, for his progeny---than he is. He wants a quick, fast, fat, profitable score. Who can blame him? Who wants to eat catfood in retirement? Hungry.<br /><br />But now, we can't forget Marion Silver (the astonishingly gorgeous Jennifer Connelly). Can we? We cannot. She is gorgeous. Her skin pulses with life. She is a rebel. She doesn't care. Ah, but she does. Youth cares, yes it does, for maybe it doesn't know of old age, but it can feel the thing's stinking corpse-breath. So yeah, Marion will deal---but she'd prefer not to. Which is why she goes along with Harry Goldfarb's "score". Hungry? Yup.<br /><br />Half of the horror is watching a field of roses go up in a napalm strike: in that spirit, I won't spoil anything for you. Well, other than to say this: Love, as some sage once observed, is the most furiously dangerous trap of all. Darren Aronofsky has set horror to celluloid: the horror of a billion lives of quiet, and noisy, desperation. Be afraid: be very afraid.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Having Attention Deficit Disorder may not be required when watching "Requiem for a Dream," but it probably helps.  If being bombarded with many of the same images throughout the film isn't enough to make you feel this way, then the onslaught of style over substance--sped up action, rotating cameras, fisheye lenses, split screen effects--that stands in for a compelling plot will.  Based on the 1970s novel of the same title, "Requiem for a Dream" chronicles the predictable downward spiral of several characters whose otherwise empty lives revolve around drugs of one kind or another.  The most interesting of them is a diet-obsessed TV junkie (Ellen Burstyn, who rather disturbingly resembles "Three's Company"'s Mrs. Roper here)--we see her devolve into a hideous sketch of her former self with the help of physician-endorsed speed.  By comparison, the troubles of blank-faced co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans seem trivial and almost a distraction.  I'm probably just too old to be moved by it all; overwrought sequences of people lazing about, freaking out while searching for their next fix, or turning to one form of human degradation or another in desperation just seem cliched and emotionally sterile, perhaps because I still remember "Gridlock'd," "Trainspotting," "Naked Lunch" and "Drugstore Cowboy."  Nonetheless, I'm guessing younger people will be pretty impressed, and to be fair, the acting and technical tricks occasionally almost make up for the low budget and paper-thin story.  The soundtrack by Kronos Quartet is also sufficiently hip and brooding to match the mood of the film, but mute the sound during any of the repetitive "getting high" or "tripping bad" scenes and see if it still seems like something meaningful is going on.  While I saw the unedited version, I'm stumped as to what was deemed the equivalent of "NC-17" material, as there's nothing here I haven't seen on HBO--ratings nowadays really do seem rather arbitrary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Requiem For A Dream is one of the best films I have ever seen. Brilliantly co-written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, Requiem For A Dream does in fact attack you with a dramatic and remarkably candid portrayal of what a "drug" can mean to someone--and what that "drug" can do to someone. For Aronofsky, that drug could be watching television, taking diet pills or street drugs. This film is sure to have a deep emotional impact on you; and as a former social worker I could empathize with the struggles that the three or four main characters live through as they watch the destruction of their dreams because they used drugs to achieve their dreams.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet Sara Goldfarb, a lonely old widow in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn whose only pleasure seems to be watching a somewhat silly self-help show on television. Her son, Harry, is constantly hocking her television set for money--only what Sara doesn't know is that Harry uses the money to buy heroin for himself and cocaine for his girlfriend Marion. Harry is also friends with a drug dealer named Tyrone; and they scheme to buy and resell drugs on the street for fat profits. Unfortunately, just as others have noted, Harry and Tyrone often turn out to be their own best customers.<br /><br />Sara herself is on a mission. One day she gets a phone call stating that she has already won a spot on the self-help talk show-and when Sara can't fit into her prized red dress, a problem ensues. At first, Sara tried to diet; but this goes nowhere fast. A friend tells Sara about a doctor who is rather liberal with his prescription pad; and this doctor soon has Sara hooked on diet pills that eventually have her jumping around like TWO Mexican jumping beans.<br /><br />In order to make the tragedy of it all even more human and painful for some of us to watch, we see Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone all deteriorating as a result of their respective drug habits. It's not a pretty picture; but it's brilliantly acted and portrayed by the filmmakers.<br /><br />Of course, the plot can still go anywhere. What does eventually happen to Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone? Will any of them be able to kick their drug habits--and what becomes of any of them if they can't kick their habits? The last twenty minutes of the film give us a skillful expose of their new lives.<br /><br />The DVD has extras: there is a director's commentary with the "making of" featurette; and there are deleted scenes. The "anatomy of a scene" extra is also very well done.<br /><br />Overall, Requiem For A Dream is probably one of the very best films I have ever seen. It gives us an often painfully candid look at what drugs can do to people and how people must struggle to beat their addictions. I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to study this matter. Unfortunately, the film is so frank that some sensitive people will be uncomfortable; but I believe that they had to make the message strong because that is the only way to truly deal with the issues involved.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>If ever there was a movie that exposed drug addiction for the horror that it truly is, this is that film.  `Requiem for a Dream' is understandably a very hard film to watch.  Everything from its intense subject matter to its sporadic and chaotic direction is set to either draw you in or push you away.  I don't think there can be an in between for this film.  You either love it wholeheartedly or you loathe it and consider it a waste of time.  It's a film that will leave you feeling dirty, feeling depressed and maybe even feeling bad about yourself but I feel that in the right context these are all good feelings for us to have because they force us to consider things we may never make the time to consider.<br /><br />Drug addiction is painted in most films as devastating but beatable, something that can ruin lives but can be overcome.  In so many movies today we watch our main character suffer at the hands of his addiction only to watch him rise above and overcome the adversary, turning over a new leaf and moving forward on a new path.  If that is what you are expecting to see then be forewarned, there are no happy endings to be found in `Requiem...'.  In fact, `Requiem for a Dream' paints this picture so harshly, so unsympathetically one is forced to realize that not all addictions are beatable.  Sometimes, well, most of the time there is no coming back.  The reason I feel that `Requiem for a Dream' is such an important film is because it shows the audience the ugly truth behind a very common and widespread problem.  You won't walk away from this movie and think lightly of the occasional drug run.  You won't think that there's nothing wrong with a high here or there.  You will be repulsed by the very idea of a manufactured euphoria and will cringe at the thought of ending up like any of the characters portrayed in this film.<br /><br />This film is designed to prevent drug abuse.<br /><br />The film follows the lives of four individuals all connected to one another.  You have Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lady who lives really for nothing except the off chance that she could be on television.  She watches her game shows and thinks of nothing else.  Her son Harry is so dependant of drugs that he's willing to steal his mother's belongings to get the money for a high.  His best friend Tyrone is just as guilty and his girlfriend Marion is along for the ride.  The film follows each of their addictions (Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to lose enough weight to fit in a dress she's determined to wear on television) and fleshes out the pain, degradation and hopelessness each addiction leaves it's host in.<br /><br />What helps propel this film along is the stellar performances by the entire cast, most notably its two leading ladies.  Ellen Burstyn rightfully was awarded a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars for her brilliant portrayal of Sara.  She really gets inside this woman and makes her delusions so real to the audience.  She takes something that could have, in the wrong hands, gone camp or been comical and makes it so raw and emotionally stimulating.  Her pain is essentially our pain and this makes the film so much more real to us.  Jennifer Connelly is flawlessly stunning as Marion Silver.  Her character has such a subtle yet moving arch towards the closing of the film when we watch her desperation grow to the point of no return.  It's heartbreaking but also extremely realistic.  Jared Leto is also remarkable here.  He has a lot of misses as an actor but when he hits it he hits it out of the park.  His portrayal of Harry is emotional and resilient.  Marlon Wayans blew me away.  I didn't know he had this in him, but he succeeds with flying colors at making his character real and moving.  I still can't get over this performance, so utterly unexpected.<br /><br />A lot has been said for Aronofsky's visionary style.  I'm going to say a little bit now.  His direction of this film is a perfect compliment to the subject and depiction he was going for.  The chaotic editing helps keep the audience in the right frame of mind, further embellishing the mental state of our protagonists.  As we watch the screen shift back and forth violently with each depiction of drug intake we get the sense that this is really destroying the characters from the inside out.  Aronofsky expressed brilliant judgment in his decisions while making this film.<br /><br />So, like I mentioned earlier, this is not a film for everyone.  It is brutal in many ways and very hard to watch both emotionally and visually if you are not prepared for it.  If you can sit through this masterpiece though I highly recommend it because it's a film unlike any other and one that we all should take notice of.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>This is a difficult movie to watch by any standards, I think.  As a lifelong fan of oddball, disturbing and surreal films of all variety, I would say this ranks in the top ten in terms of sheer unpleasantness.  And that's saying a lot. I remember hearing about this movie quite a bit<br />when it was released and writing it off as another "Basketball Diaries", and that's what I expected when I popped it in my DVD player.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />But the unpleasantness is not gratuitous; in fact, Arofonsky has done everyone a service by translating Shelby's book into film in such a visceral and brutal manner. The performances are appropriately desperate and the actors themselves mean a lot less than what they are intended to represent: surrender, through different means, to the forces of self-destruction, narcissism, and ultimate disintegration.  One thing, though; Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would not be looking as good as she does at the end of the film at all if she was such a fervent heroin user.<br /><br />Otherwise, there is not one false note in this hellish descent into the pits of human degradation and nothing is too extreme.  Anyone who has experienced addiction in their lives will recognize from the first scene in which Harry boosts his mother's television set that while a lot of the Kafkaesque and bleakly surreal are employed here, it is all too real.  For better or worse, I will never forget this movie, and it stands as one of the most successfully realized films I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MQQI4UYT9C11.html">A2MQQI4UYT9C11</a><br/><p>A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke, shoot and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.<br /><br />Note: I got this movie from Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or not.</p></br><a href="../users/A5UMUVEV1RUS9.html">A5UMUVEV1RUS9</a><br/><p>Requiem for a Dream is one of those movies you'll never forget, yet you'll want to watch it again. Maybe not immediately after you just watched it. The subject matter is hard to swallow as it is depressing, but just so beautifully and brilliantly portrayed. The characters are all doomed and there is nothing you can do but sit back and watch them spiral out of control. Requiem, in addition to an incredible cast, features outstanding cinematography reminiscent of Drugstore Cowboy (and if you look at my review for Drugstore Cowboy, I think I mentioned something along those lines) but I'm happy to see that kind of inspiration shine through so successfully in another film. To me, one of the most touching scenes in this movie is when Harry's mother gets taken to the hospital for her diet/speed pill addiction and her friends from the apartments come to visit her. When they show the friends outside on the bench, crying and hugging, every single time I see it, I cry. Everyone in this movie does such an amazing job at making this seem very, very real and anything but a dream. Don't miss this movie! If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" is a stark, graphic and troubling depiction of the horrific fall into the abyss of drug addiction by four people.  Set against the panoramic background of Brooklyn's Coney Island using some amazing cinematography courtesy of Matthew Libatique, the story surrounds a trio of young drug addled adults played respectively by Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly.  Leto playing Harry Goldfarb and Wayans playing Tyrone Love are low level drug dealers hoping to make that one big score.  Connelly is Leto's middle class girlfriend who has aspirations of becoming a fashion designer.  They find their dreams however slowly dissolving as their heroin habits increase and their existence becomes seamier and seamier.<br /><br />The unquestioned star of the film was Ellen Burstyn stupendously effectively portraying widowed housewife Sara Goldfarb.  Burstyn spends her days enthralled with an inspirational game show.  She receives a phone call informing her that she's been selected to appear as a contestant.  As a result she convinces herself to lose weight to improve her appearance.  Unable to diet she resorts to visiting a diet doctor.  Amazingly Burstyn gets hooked on diet pills and undergoes an astounding transformation with the help of a talented make up artist.  Her fantasy of appearing on TV gets replaced by drug induced hallucinations culminating in institutionalization.<br /><br />This is not a pretty movie but is very effective in elaborating how drugs destroy the hopes and dreams of the main characters.  The musical score and the special effects chronicling the ingestion of the pills and heroin were an excellent augmentation to the storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A36HBE2C5SQ2E6.html">A36HBE2C5SQ2E6</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky's second film revolves around 4 people that have a great life and are happy, but a series of choices and mistakes causes that feeling of happiness to go away. But, no matter what, they still maintain that happiness because they have nothing else to hold onto. They all still cling onto it even though their lives are thrown into a fiery downfall.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky has made one of the best films of the 90's. He hits you hard with his sensory-based direction. He makes you react to what is being shown on the screen with a gut thudding motion that would make the strongest man cry. He has mastered the art of showing people that are all good then sends their lives into a tumbling downfall. His direction is wild and all over the place, and he does the direction with such an artistry that you can't help but merzmerized by what is going on the screen.<br /><br />Delusions of Grandour come to mind when we look at these characters. We feel some sort of pain when we watch these characters go ahead and form a niche in making their life worse until the point where they cannot turn back and realize all of the mistakes that they are making. It self induces pity from us towards the characters. We feel things when we watch the film.<br /><br />We don't even realize what we are watching till the end when we tell ourselves how we like this film.<br /><br />In my personal opinon, I was watching a mastery of filmaking. I formed that we all have our own dreams and reality that we hold onto no matter how much pain, torment, trouble or feeling that we have towards our life, we hold onto the dream no matter what. Dreams can be ruined by what we do and the mistakes that we make.<br /><br />I enjoyed this wonderful piece of film making, because it shows us a harsh and brutal reality.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>At first I was pretty hesitate to see this movie because I thought it was just going to be about a bunch of stoned junkies trying to kick their habits. Surprisingly, its much more than that and I appreciate the message delivered in this film. Harry Played by (Jared Leto) lives with his mom Sara (Ellen Burstyn). Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)and his friend Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) are tied up with the drug business, there unfortunate habits eventually catch up to them they seem to let go of reality. Meanwhile Harry's mom is also caught up with the popular use of Diet pills. His mother is A Televison Junkie who is lonely and wants to get on "Tappy Tibbons Show" which is a similar to a Richard Simmons program played by Christopher Mcdonald. Just like Harry, His mother fantasizes, she wants to lose weight and fit in that red dress so she can be famous. I won't give away the ending, but it isn't pretty. then again most movies about raging drug addicts aren't pretty, hence, the movie Transpotting. What did attract me to this movie is the message. What the director was trying to portray is that almost every thing has the potential to qualify as a "Drug." For example, Harry's mom is addicted to television and can't seem to get a grip on herself, Harry and Tyrone can't seem to stop living life on the edge ect. You get the point. Overall the acting is stunning as well, the whole cast especially Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. As for the dvd, fans of this movie won't be dissapointed either. For one thing we get the director's cut of the film, with some good interiews with the writer and cast. A good solid commentary and some interesting deleted scenes. On The documentary we get a good behind the scenes on the story and setting on Coney Island. As for quality, the director obviously, intended to use a dark grainy transfer to set the mood of the movie, which he does a great job here as well. Don't let this movie pass you by reading the back cover because its not your typical junkie movie...............</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZVERVFM25MJT.html">A2ZVERVFM25MJT</a><br/><p>Before seeing this film I had read all the reviews saying how fantastic it was.  Well, it isn't fantastic, and anyone that describes it is fantastic is highly disturbed.  For this is one of the most gruelling things that I have ever had to sit through.  It is explicit, upsetting and totally unforgettable.  But fantastic?  Jurassic Park was fantastic, this is on a higher plain.<p>Although the film doesn't really have a message to it other than 'drugs are bad', it thankfully shows both the highs and the lows of the drugs.  This is in sharp contrast to other drugs movies such as 'The Basketball Diaries' that seems to consist almost totally of lows.  It also shows that ecstasy, heroin and cocaine aren't the only forms of drugs on the market.  For example, the same cut shots and editing are used when Harry shoots up as when his mother switches on the TV, eats or drinks her coffee.  The point being that there are plenty of legal drugs on the market that have an equally destructive effect.<p>Finally, the explicit nature of the film: I found myself squirming in my seat a couple of times and there's no doubt that there are some pretty horrific scenes here.  And as for the incredibly explicit sex scenes, it's difficult to call them exploitive when they so clearly show the degradation that the character has gone through to reach this stage.  This film is not for the weak-willed.  It is upsetting and mesmerising in its sheer grotesqueness.  Yet it is also an unforgettable, important piece of film-making.</p></br><a href="../users/A3081Z4P774YR4.html">A3081Z4P774YR4</a><br/><p>One of the things I can't seem to let go of after seeing &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is how people can let themselves become victims of their own personal vices.  As terrifying it is to see one character try to escape reality by shooting drugs into an infected and rotting vein, I can't help but feel sympathy for those who seem to be unaware of how their addiction has imprisoned them.  The character of Sara (played memorably by Ellen Burstyn) is among the greatest example.  To watch a character like that change from a complacent, yet likeable human to what we see at the end of this film is nothing less than tragic.  What is surprising is how this movie doesn't turn into a celebration of drugs, but rather a stark and horrifying reminder of how habits (of any kind) can destroy the soul long before it destroys the body.  This is truly one of the best films this decade has produced.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>The horrors of addiction and the death of dreams fill this intense tale.  The film shows how so much of everything we do can become an addiction, an unhealthy and even dangerous routine if we put an unrealistic focus on impossible, materialistic dreams.  The breakneck visuals concentrate the brutal honesty of the film.  In the hands of a less talented director, the visual techniques would have appeared more like a music video and less as a narrative.  The score of the film consists mostly of variations on the same piece of music.  The haunting remixes accurately represent the film's dark mood.<br /><br />If you respected this film (it's hard to "enjoy" a film such as this), you may like Darren Aronofsky's Pi as well.<br /><br />Be sure to get the director's cut of Requiem for a Dream.  There is no reason to belittle this film by pretending that its subjects are only rated R.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>I've somehow managed to put off seeing this movie for 11 years.  It was a conscious decision.  Director Darren Aronofsky's recent success with "Black Swan" and a cheap Blu ray price finally got me to watch it.  My original hesitation had to do with the subject matter and the fact I knew Jennifer Connelly's character Marion would be sexually abused.  Now I love to see beautiful women  but brutality and rape is not my thing.  Here Marion, her boyfriend played by Jared Leto, his friend played by Marlon Wayans and the mother of Leto's character all circle the drain strung out on drugs.  Sara is the mother and is brilliantly played by Ellen Burstyn.  She is hopped up on amphetamines prescribed by a quack doctor in an attempt to lose weight.  The other 3 are your typical beautiful young people whose future is compromised by a long stint hooked on your garden variety street drugs.  The acting is superb all the way around, but this is a difficult movie to watch.  It is gut wrenching and nauseating but has brilliance about it with the sights and sounds Aronofsky brings to film. I don't think I'll ever watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) loves to watch her TV, and she loves her son Harold (Jared Leto). The trouble is, Harry's a junkie; whenever he's jonesing for junk he and his partner Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) take Sara's TV to Coney Island and pawn it. All the yentas (Louise Lasser, et al) on Sara's block know that Harry steals her TV, but Sara won't turn him in. Even the pawn broker, Mr. Rabinowitz (Mark Margolis), wonders why she lets him get away with it time after time.<br /><br />Once she gets her TV back she'll most likely be watching an infomercial by Tappy Tibbons (Chris McDonald). It seems like he's always on. Like a poor man's Tony Robbins he whips the crowd into a frenzy--and there are prizes. He claims his regimen will change your life. All you have to do is stay on it for 30 "Days of Fury." He sells motivational DVDs. Sara Goldfarb is happy just to watch it on TV, but then she gets a phone call that says they want her to be on the show.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: Harold, I'm gonna be on Television.<br />====================<br /><br />She gets carried away by the idea of being on TV. It is kind of ironic to have Ellen Burstyn playing this role, because she is a veteran actress from the Golden Age of Television. She's been on TV a lot. Burstyn has had 5 Oscar nominations and won the lead actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Sara Goldfarb, on the other hand, has never been on TV. Sara Goldfarb gets so taken by the very idea of being on television that she goes on a diet so she can fit into her red dress. An unscrupulous doctor prescribes pills that get her hooked, just like her son, Harry--but with the extreme side effect of psychosis and paranoia.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: And you should see my Harry on Television. We're giving the prizes away. I JUST WANTED TO BE ON THE SHOW.<br />====================<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is mainly about Sara and Harry Goldfarb, Harry's friend Tyrone C. Love, and Harry's girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly). Gold, Silver, and Love. At first they all have gleaming bright dreams, but everything goes dark.<br /><br />This film is based upon a book by Hubert Selby Jr.. He also wrote Last Exit to Brooklyn, and that was made into a film years ago. Selby has had a hard life and his writing is very dark. Very, very dark. There are a couple of conversations with him in the bonus material on the DVD. Selby didn't use any apostrophes in Last Exit to Brooklyn. He would write "dont" instead of "don't." I thought that it was kind of an affectation, but nevertheless, his writing holds a dark power. However, no matter how dark it gets, there is always compassion for the characters. Though Harry has pawned his mom's TV so many times they've lost count, once he gets ahead, he buys her a new TV.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Sara Goldfarb: I love you, Harry.<br />Harry Goldfarb: I love you too, Mom.<br />====================<br /><br />But this is a Hubert Selby Jr. story, so you know the good times won't last for long.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is that Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi, The Fountain, The Wrestler) was true to the spirit of Hubert Selby Jr.'s book, and the performances by Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans, as well as the other cast members, were excellent. Aronofsky shows the exhilaration, but isn't stingy showing the high price they will pay. For that reason the last half of the movie grows increasingly grim, and it may be disturbing.

It is utterly horrifying to see these 4 people ruin their lives, each with their own drug nightmare.  But what is remarkable is the mood - the consistent feeling of losing control, of fear, of dying hope - that permeates every part of it.  The only kind of film to which I would compare it is a horror film, seen by a child:  you feel trapped within someone else's fantasy, unable to extricate yourself until it ends, but this is for adults with adult issues.  Yes, they are all losers in one way or another, yet you feel sympathy for them mixed with revulsion.<br /><br />It is a great movie, but I would recommend renting it to see, you won't want to watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Elegant and melancholy, Requiem is an unsettling drama that is as beautiful visually as its subject matter is depressing.<br /><br />Each scene is excellently framed and contrasts in lighting, colors and settings allow the film's mood to parallel the highs and lows of the character's circumstances. As their predicament spirals out of control, and they shed the last vestiges of dignity and restraint, the film hurls you into their darkness - a chasm of moral bankruptcy, hopelessness and decrepitude.<br /><br />Requiem approaches the material with an objectivity that often feels brutally cold, but it handles the characters with a tenderness that makes their already mournful fates emotionally crushing for the viewer. The film does not offer us the comfort of a happy ending, so don't expect to go home smiling.<br /><br />The movie ultimately ends on a note that is starkly (and unavoidably) anti-drug, but this is not a preachy movie with some hidden moral agenda. The objective here is not to highlight the evils of drug use, but to mourn the human cost, weighed in hopes dashed, lives derailed and loves forsaken. This is after all, a requiem, a rueful ode to dreams buried and lost forever.<br /><br />The Directors Cut DVD is the only version you should consider buying. It contains the full unedited version with mature material that was removed from the watered down theatrical version. Not a movie you'll watch often, but one that will always resonate when you do. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Excellent filming style (much the same as "Pi").  Lots of strong memorable imagery.  Contains some of the most artistic and imaginative uses of special effects since "Fight Club." Altogether, it's very vivid and intense.<br />*Characters are good and well-developed.  Good focus on their drama (without being too sappy).  By the end of the film, you can really feel for their losses.  It's quite emotional.<br />*Strong anti-drug message.  Even though everything seems cheery at first, it quickly becomes dark and frightening.  It's even more effective than any other drug movie I have seen (all of the ones I've seen have been upbeat for some wierd reason).  The characters, music, and imagery accentuates this central moral very well.<br />*Excellent music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*There are a few graphic scenes at the end (and a few bits of nudity throughout the middle).  I didn't think it was as bad as everybody else says, but it's still not reccomended for the squeamish.<br /><br />Next to "Children of Men" and "The Passion," this is one of the few movies that makes me want to cry.  It is a deep, dark, and powerful downward spiral into madness and despair.  As intense as it is, it truly makes me feel for the characters (and scares me away from ever doing drugs).  Above all, it sticks out in my head as one of the best, most stylish, and most memorable films made in the past ten years.  Everybody should watch this film at least once, for it is intense and somewhat thought-provoking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The first time I saw Requiem for a Dream I was a little shaken to my core, the second time I watched it, I realized what a work of art this movie is. The story of four very different drug addicts is disturbing and yet fascinating to say the least. The last 10 minutes are the most graphic but the most important. Jared Leto's performance is the best I have ever seen from him, and of course it's Ellen Burstyn who steals the show. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are superb as well, Requiem for a Dream is a film no one should overlook. It's gritty, heartbreaking, honest, and this movie stays with you, now that's a great and profound film! I highly recommend it!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>After viewing this film for the first itme all i can say is...WOW.  Extraordinary.  This is unlike any other film I can remember.  It's a hauntingly beautiful story about four people and the affect drugs have on them.<br /><br />I say let everyone see this film.  There are some things people will not understand but at some point in everyone's life, they should see this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A13H7Q4JVK6DTV.html">A13H7Q4JVK6DTV</a><br/><p>Requiem for a dream is about four different people who's lives go through hell just to be happy at the end but thats how I see it and maybe you will too. The first Character Harry wants to sell drugs for a living but of course selling drugs in New York City is not easy because everybody sells Here.The Second character is Marion Harry's Girlfriend will do anything for drugs even sleep with other men to get it.The third character is Tyrone who's Harry's Best Friend and helps harry sell drugs but things don't look good for him when he gets arrested.Then their's the last character with the strongest Proformance in the movie Harry's mother who loves her son as much as TV she always wanted to be on it and finally gets her chance but she also wants to look good on tv so she goes to the doctor to see how can she lose weight and he gives her pills to do that but the problem is she starts to get addictive to it.The end of the film you'll have to see for yourself and sometimes it is kind of boring but thats just a very small portion but other wise then that it's a must see so buy it now.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>Other films explore drugs but this one goes further. The plot is pretty simple. Right at the start the characters are set up for respective gruesome, nightmarish cataclismic fall outs from drug addiction. The last twenty minutes in particular present a spiraling, multi-angled view of a sort of drugs hell- the veins, the needles, the pulsating arteries the physical transformations - beauty becomes gnarled, warped and frail. It makes for compulsive viewing.<br /><br />This is a movie dealing with extremes. Extreme loneliness, extreme desperation, extreme desire for acceptance, extreme addiction and extreme imagery. This is what makes it a cult tour de force along the lines of Trainspotting and Clockwork Orange (although I wouldn't quite elevate it to that league as the characters in this movie are not developed as fully as they could be). If such movies offend you, for christ sakes don't put yourself through the self inflicted torture of watching it. Remember the Director's Cut is even more gut wrenching than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is not merely a great film but an important one.  Granted, the majority of the population would find this harrowing film offputting, however, because drugs and addiction are so woven into the framework of our society it is important that this film be seen by as many people as possible.  When the film started, I didn't no where it was going.  Once it established it's rhythm, detailing the high highs and low lows of chemical dependency this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go.  Credit for this has to go to director Darren Aronofsky who establishes himself as a new and creative force in film-making.  It seems like this film was made a long time ago and I eagerly await viewing his next project(that said, I wasn't too partial to "PI").  The ensemble acting in this film is superb.  Jennifer Connelly is a stand-out as a heroine addict who ultimately succumbs to the worse kind of degradation to support her habit.  The ultimate praise, however, is reserved for Ellen Burstyn.  She not only gives a great performance but an acting performance for the ages.  Her character breaks your heart from start to finish.  The movie begins with her enabling her heroine addict son by allowing him to steal her beloved TV and ends with her being subjected to drug-treatment for becoming adicted to amphetamines because she wanted to look good for the all-important TV.  This is a great film whose reputation I hope only grows through the years.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>One of the saddest films I have seen in recent years is this film with an outstanding performance from Ellen Burstyn.  A movie that shows the real tragedy of drugs and doesn't leave anything to the imagination.  It had me thinking for days afterwards.  A must-see for those who like to count their blessings!</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Darren Aronofsky, it seems to me, is on his way to be one of the best, most influential directors of the 21st century. His work on Requiem For A Dream, like on Pi, is absolutely stunning, with brilliant use of experimental photography and editing techniques, short, thematically repeating shots (also used in Pi) and the original split-screen techenique. The movie is truly breathtaking, and I mean that most literally - I was starting to run out of oxygen after the first thirty minutes. And I only saw it on VCR. I can only imagine what this must be like in a huge, dark theatre. The harshness of the scenes and the fast, video-clip pace of the movie make it a very difficult, but very rewarding, experience.<p>The seemingly complicated plot covers for a very simple idea. The story (This time adapted from a novel, the story for Pi was written by Aronofsky himself and was much more complicated and original) revolves around four main characters, and tells their four individual tales, with the common elements of addiction, illusion and their consequences. This idea, though, is materialized wonderfully, and makes for a very, very powerful movie. All four characters - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his mother, Sarah (Ellen Burstyn), his girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and his friend and drug-dealing partner Tyron (Marlon Wayans), are remarkably well-developed, and each one is a full, real human being. Praise should go to Aronofsky but also to all four wonderful actors, especially Burstyn who did a really remarkable job as the TV junkie jewish mother.<p>The movie is shocking, difficult, painful. You'll feel like your brain is being torn out and cut into little bits. But it's worth every minute. Do NOT rent this out for good light entertainment, but watch it, and eagerly wonder what Darren Aronofsky has in store for us next. I know I am.</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>Requiem for a Dream is a revelation. While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie you&#65533;re not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if you&#65533;re a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. It&#65533;s official &#65533; this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to I&#65533;ll watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you. All in all, Requiem for a Dream is a master-work of absolute terror, drama and drugs, a haunting film that will make you think twice about ever looking at another dangerous substance. <p>NOTE: Requiem for a Dream: Drector's Cut that is even more disturbing and graphic than the cut version. Director's Cut is even better than the movie itself and has alot of good features and new scenes. I highly recommend people who enjoyed the movie to buy the Director's Cut version.</p></br><a href="../users/A29IYGR7SNPRIV.html">A29IYGR7SNPRIV</a><br/><p>I'm a great admirer of Pi, the director's first film. Requiem is simply remarkable. So many (too many) books and films try (and ultimately fail) to give us a sense of our drug culture, but this film succeeds on every level. Its take on the insidious presence of drugs, of one sort of another, in all our lives, sounds a loud cautionary note. And Hubert Selby, the author, has always taken a very hard, penetrating look at the views around him. This time (perhaps because of the film desecretion of his fine book Last Exit to Brooklyn) perhaps his involvement played a significant part in keeping the film so on track. <p>With stunning performances by the entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, this is a scarily accurate view of how drugs, of whatever kind, can creep in and overtake our lives. A film about desperation, loss, and illusions, you must see Requiem if you have any interest in (a) an outstanding bit of filmmaking and (b) how all-too-easy it is to follow the rabbit down the hole.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ARRAMXWT83PT.html">A2ARRAMXWT83PT</a><br/><p>This has to be one of the most disturbing films that I have ever seen. I just got the video the other day, and let me tell you, it had a strong impact on me. I wasn't really expecting that kind of a &quot;wham-bang&quot; ending! The performances are spectacular, and ELLEN BURSTYN DESERVED THAT OSCAR! No offense to Julia Roberts, but Ellen's performance was the most powerful for the year 2000. I agree with the rest of the reviewers: This film should be shown all around high schools everywhere. It is a graphic, disturbing account of the effects of drugs on four different people and how it sent their hopes and dreams down the toilet. The end will leave you shocked. You will not be able to get this film out of your head for a few days. Believe me.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>This film is a harrowing experience.  The principle cast of four all spiral to their respective dooms, all fueled by the use of &quot;recreational pharmaceuticals&quot;.  Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable as buds who see the drug game as a way to escape their lower socio-economic lives, even as they do not see the way that their own abuse of these drugs makes such an escape impossible.  But it is the overpowering performances of Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connelly that burned a raw place into my psyche.  Ellen Burstyn's Sara is not a junkie.  She is just a lonely, overweight middle-aged woman who dreams about being younger, thinner, and not nearly as alone.  Jennifer Connelly's character comes along for the ride with her boyfriend, but by degrees she descends lower and lower.<p>You have to watch it to see how low these characters fall.  This is not a happy-go-lucky movie.  But if you are interested in a well-made, well-acted cautionary tale about the dangers of addictions, you'd have difficulty finding one superior to &quot;Requiem&quot;.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Requiem for a Dream should be seen alone for the performance of Ellen Burstyn who shows that an actress of grandmother vintage can still can slam dunk the latest kid on the block for six and also manage to outperform everyone else even though she is part of a hip and fashionable MTV-type choppy and deranged independent film production.<p>Requiem for a Dream is not a nice movie. It is very dark, upsetting and mean but is also more than a tad bit exploitive of a number of elements that are done more than a bit over the top here. For this reason Aronofsky does cater for the shock market at times. Certainly if you think more about what you are seeing you will realize that the suspension of disbelief is remarkable but not even remotely close to the reality of life. For example - doctors do not rat out addicts to the cops, the neighborhood junkie knows exactly who is driving his car, you don't go around with a septic arm for days without knowing it, electric shock therapy is administered with an anesthetic and heroin dealers certainly don't turn up at the local supermarket in a truck to sell dope to hundreds of people queuing up on the streets. Aronofsky suspends our disbelief. He does is this brilliantly, but folks should reexamine the material a bit more closely before realizing that they have been duped into a wonderfully fantastic reality-based fantasy. Aronofsky even hints this fantasy world to you more than once and even in the closing segments. Requiem for a dream is a DREAM full of hope, desire, anxiety and failure played out to the tune of hyper-realism. It is wonderfully executed but this is fantasy mixed with a dash of reality that unfortunately too many people literally took to heart.<p>This film deserves its place as a cult classic and certainly the director is something of a talent to look out for. The premise revolves around a son addicted to heroin and his mother who is addicted to slimming pills so that she can fit into her nicest dress to play in a popular television game show as a contestant. All the horrors of the American Dream are played out to full effect and everything goes from bad to worse to terrible to extremely severe.<p>When all is said and done this is just fiction with a social comment to make but it is still hard to see what you can take away from it except maybe a sense that some people do end up in a bad way using drugs. However this should be no justification for the kind of brutality that the US government conducts in its own drug wars or the multi-millions of dollars that end up in terrorist hands from the black market drug economy (this is sort of explained during the jail sequence involving a sick guard). I took this movie as a very good social satire that is meant to shock in a "this is how bad things can get for some people" sort of way. It is a tad bit exploitative like I said, but heck some people go through this so why not film it. Just don't take everything you see here to heart and enjoy this art form for what it is - a great urban nightmare drama with some fine direction and acting to boot.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is disturbing, strange, emotionally riveting, and ultimately devasting.  All of those adjectives would seem like a redlight to NOT view this film, but the brilliance of this creation by Darren Aronofsky after Hubert Selby, Jr.'s book does what few films do - it makes a gut-wrenching learning experience.  From the hardcore heroin addiction to the even more terrifying addiction to doctor-prescribed "medication" drugs we are shown the gamut of how cruel this disease of addiction is to the victi's body, to loved ones, to the world.  The performances by each of the cast members are superb - Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans - and the supporting cast (especially the elderly friends of Burstyn's 'Sara')is very strong. But is is the directorial decision to use split screen techniques, rapid motion repetions of popping pills or preparing to shoot up and the middle-of-the-target musical score tha makes this film alomost unbearably real.  A terrifying movie that should be recommended viewing for everyone to get a take on the drug problem this country faces.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing "Requiem For a Dream," a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.<p>In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.<p>Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.<p>Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).<p>Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.  <p>Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, "Requiem For a Dream," though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shows the lives of four characters and their addictions. It is summertime in Coney Island, NY and there is a sweet and lonely widow named Sarah Goldfarb ( Ellen Burstyn)that lives by herself. Her favorite TV game show is hosted by Tabby Timmons (Christopher McDonald). Sarah receives a phony call from the show telling her that she is going to be the next contestant. Sarah feels that she has to lose weight to fit into her favorite red dress, so that she can look good for the show. Sara visits her local doctor, who prescribes her diet pills that work miraculously. Unfortunately, the pills turn out to be amphetamines. Sarah's son Harry(Jared Leto) and his best friend Tyrone(Marlon Wayans) are heroine addicts that spend all of their time either consuming , or selling to maintain their habbit. However, when their supply is cut off, Harry and Tyrone run into a fatal losing streak that manages to take Harry's girlfriend Marion(Jennifer Connely) down with them. Now all four characters must try and regain control of their lives. <p>&quot;Requiem For a Dream&quot; offers the most realistic look at addiction that I have ever seen. The story is emotional and hard hitting, going back and forth between Sarah and Harry and company. The film is shot brilliantly. The actual ingestion of the drug is extremely graphic and disturbing. After the drug is done, we see a short period when their life seems better. But afterwards, we get to see reality come crashing down on all of them with how quick the effect ends. According to Entertainment Weekly, this film is so realistic that it should be seen in high schools across America. Too bad the NC-17 rating wouldn't sit well with parents. The musical score is haunting, and extremely beautiful. It really helps to drive the movie on the downward spiral that it travels on. <p>All the performances are outstanding. Jared Leto is amazing as Harry. The character offers all the false promises of an addict and a shocking portrayal of using and hitting rock bottom. Ellen Burstyn does the best job in the film. Her portrayal of Sarah is one that we really feel sorry for. The path she travels down, was forced onto her by a dishonest doctor. The emotion that she puts forth is very realistic! Jennifer Connely, Christopher McDonald, and Marlon Wayans are also outstanding. <p>&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is a movie for the ages. It is one that will never fail to amaze audiences everywhere. The amazing story, reality of the drug scene, and performances are all flawless. The DVD is outstanding. It is extremely low priced, and the extras include commentary from the director, a making of documentary, deleted scenes, and much much more!</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full<br />of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good<br />(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm<br />ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,<br /><br />Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really<br />getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction<br />is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those<br />themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with<br />the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of<br />depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.<br />By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the<br />top, and a bit illogical.<br /><br />Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's<br />bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity. And it grew on me on a<br />2nd viewing. And I'm a fan of Aronofsky's. But I'm in the minority in<br />admiring this film, but not being able to completely embrace it.<br /><br />The blu-ray is a step up from the DVD without question,<br />but it wasn't an amazing transfer either - some white blooming,<br />some spots where the sharpness is less than stellar. Still. it's<br />a pretty great looking film, so if you love it, owning a pretty good<br />blu-ray still beats a great DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's "Requiem for a Dream" (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to "Requiem for a Dream." The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.<br /><br />"Requiem for a Dream" is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary "tough love." Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.<br /><br />The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).<br /><br />The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.<br /><br />GRADE: B-</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>The devastating, downward spiral of four individuals addicted to drugs is examined in lurid detail in "Requiem for a Dream," directed by Darren Aronofsky, who paints a vivid picture of the physical and psychological damage that can be incurred by unrestrained chemical abuse.  And it's not a pretty picture.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) are young and in love, but they have a problem; their recreational drug use has long since passed the point of "recreation," and the sad part is, they don't seem to realize it, or if they do, they're into big time denial.  Harry's friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), is in the same situation, and together they spend most of their time and resources trying to score their next fix.  Even the fact that Harry has to repeatedly hock his own mother's television set for drug money doesn't clue them in to how deep their addiction runs; which is a truly sad state of affairs.<p> Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a widow who lives alone, and only wishes that her son, Harry, would come around to see her once in awhile, besides when he needs her beloved TV, which is her only real companion in life.  Sara doesn't realize it, but there's troubled times ahead for her, too, which begin with a telephone call informing her she's been chosen to appear on a television show, which to her is like being given the Holy Grail.  Immediately, she begins to prepare for the moment, but she is bothered by her weight-- her favorite dress doesn't fit anymore.  She's just too fat (she feels) to go on TV.  The solution she discovers, however, is easy.  Prescription diet pills, provided by a doctor recommended to her by one of her friends in her apartment building.  Diet pills, nothing more.  It seems so harmless.<p> Director Aronofsky doesn't pull any punches with this film, and shows-- often in graphic detail-- just what drugs can do to a person.  Some of the images he presents are hard to take, and are not easily forgotten; like the effects of a needle on an arm when injected repeatedly into the same spot over a prolonged period of time, or the delusions caused by ingesting vast amounts of "speed."  But the visuals he offers are not the only powerful images; the psychological implications are quite potent as well.  Each character at one time or another seems to comprehend, during one of their few-and-far-between lucid moments, what's happening to them.  But they either do not want to address their situation, or they can't.  Either way, it's harrowing to watch, let alone contemplate.  <p> Ellen Burstyn was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her work here, and rightfully so; her performance as Sara, a woman who gets taken unawares and must do battle with an unexpected demon, is astounding.  It's a challenging, decidedly unglamorous role, and Burstyn certainly gave it everything she had, and it paid off.  Sara is someone with whom you can sympathize on a number of levels, while at the same time, the way she comes into her situation is so disconcerting it makes you want to keep her at arms length, because it's something you don't really want to have to think about.  Out of sight, out of mind.  It's an emotionally taxing part-- for Burstyn, of course-- but for the audience, as well.<p> Jared Leto gives an extremely convincing, believable performance, also, but his character tends to evoke mixed feelings.  On one hand, you feel terrible for him, but on the other, you realize that-- unlike Sara-- Harry came to where he is because of his own unsound judgment and choices, which casts a rather subjective pall over his circumstances, and therefore the way you relate to him.  Still, there's no getting around the fact that it's a depressing situation (to say the least) for everyone involved.<p> The same can be said of Connelly's character, Marion, who seems to go deeper into her situation than the others with her eyes wide open, and it's disturbing to see someone so young, vital and seemingly intelligent allowing this to happen to herself.  Connelly, who admirably of late has forsaken mainstream cinema for roles of more substance in independent films (like "Pollock" and "Waking the Dead"), turns in a memorable performance here, capturing that dark side of human nature and expressing it so well in terms of her character and the path she chooses to take.  And of all of the characters in the film, it is through Marion that you really get a sense of the degradation and loss of self-esteem that comes with the territory to which these people have staked a claim.  And it's just almost too horrendous to consider.<p> The supporting cast includes Christopher McDonald (Tappy Tibbons), Louise Lasser (Ada), Marcia Jean Kurtz (Rae) and Peter Maloney (Dr. Pill).  A powerful anti-drug film, "Requiem for a Dream" is a stark and realistic look at a problem that affects everyone either directly or indirectly, and it's so effective because there's no attempt to candy-coat the issue.  Aronofsky tells it-- and shows it-- like it is, and like "Trainspotting" and "Traffic," it gives you a real grasp of just how far into our lives the tentacles of this evil reaches, and how vulnerable we all really are to it.  This film may be a sobering trip, but it's definitely one worth taking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Remember the anti-drug commercial where a girl points to an egg, says, "this is your brain," and then screams, "this is your brain on drugs!" as she smashes the egg with a skillet and proceeds to demolish the entire kitchen, screaming, "and this is what drugs do to your family, this is what they do to your future..." and so on? We'll this story does give you that indication but it's so much more.<br /><br />After watching this I thought it was the most harrowing, unsettling, and yet utterly compelling film dealing with the issue of drug use, and the effects it has on those involved I have ever seen. This is, and I state for the record, in no way glorifying, sensationalizing, or condoning drug use in any way. Took me ages to finally see this flick but thankfully it's been recommended to me base on my experience with Aronofsky's recent film "The Fountain."<br /><br />It has a brilliant ensemble cast. Ellen Burnstyn had my heart by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen. It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favorite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict. Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of ....., but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come. Marlon Wayans was also amazing in his performance and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love says a lot.<br /><br />The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times. All up, "Requiem For A Dream" is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and affected mentally than "Requiem For A Dream." O by the way Mr. Aronofsky I'm your friend again.</p></br><a href="../users/AKS9SJTHTU0OM.html">AKS9SJTHTU0OM</a><br/><p>Amazing on a purely cinematic level - assaultive, hyper-kinetic, full<br />of breathtaking images and cuts, The performances too range from good<br />(Jared Leto) to extraordinary (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />But for me, after a while, the style becomes the substance, and I'm<br />ever more aware of the filmmaking rather than the story and characters,<br /><br />Also, other than 'drugs are bad', I'm not sure what Aronofsky is really<br />getting at. There are interesting implications that our real addiction<br />is to our dreams, and escaping whatever our reality is, but those<br />themes are never fully played out. So we end up with a film made with<br />the technical skill of a Scorsese or Kubrick, but missing a layer of<br />depth in favor of (admittedly amazing) pyrotechnics.<br /><br />Last, it feels like the film 'cheats' more on reality as it goes along.<br />By the end the story twists start to join the style in being over the<br />top, and a bit illogical.<br /><br />Now, all that carping aside, I still recommend this film for it's<br />bravery, performances, and technical virtuosity.

Marlon Wayans is Jared's best friend.<br /><br />Based on the acclaimed novel by Hubert Selby, this deeply disturbing film adaptation burns itself into your heart and mind as these four individuals become possessed by something beyond themselves where their dreams become nightmares of dark desire.<br /><br />The disc is a very crisp transfer with a multitude of special features that include two commentary tracks, one by director Aronofsky and another by cinematographer Matthew Libatique.  In addition, Ellen Burstyn interviews author Selby, there's a making-of documentary, deleted scenes with commentary, anatomy of a scene, production notes and more. Highly recommended.

It's more than just a film; it's a piece of reality. Dreams are formed, desired, and shattered (hence the title of the film). It's a stunning piece of work, and a depressing one. Those who have weak stomachs (or had just had a rough day on the job) should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. I personally wasn't depressed by it, but I did care for the characters as they force themselves to make some very bad decisions in life (I'm not going to give the ending away, I promise). All of the actors (especially Ellen Burstyn) are terrific; they are perfectly cast for their roles, and nothing affects their performances. Director Darren Aronofsky has done splendidly with this one. He knows how to create a hardcore drama with his use of quick shots and lighting. All in all, this is a powerful film, and it deserves the high praise that it's continuously receiving as of today. Congratulations to Aronofsky, the cast, and the crew.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>All I can say is the first 45 minutes or so I was skeptical about this movie, but from the 45 min mark on the movie got quit intense. I dont want to say to much, but, it is a movie you will hate or love there is no in between. Like I said for the first 45 minutes i was  not sure but the last 45 minutes was just so AWESOME its hard to not tell anyone not to check this movie out.<br /><br />the ending is completley unexpected as it had me  just in complete shock, and up to an an hour and half later still thinking about it.  It is so realistic and it can happen to anyone  in any situation it just make you think wow im lucky not be like that and it hits you right in the heart, wher I actually felt sorry for the mother, Harry ,marloin wayans [whatever his name was , and the girlfriend. The most shocking is what comes of the girlfriedn and the mother. for $10 the movie is well worth quit a intense ending it might offend some , but let me say one thing it was as realitic as it gets. Just an amazing ending and very emotional. Great job.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (with co-writer Hubert Selby, Jr., based on his novel) harrowing film is a study of addiction in all its forms-not just addiction to drugs, but also to television, dreams, fame, sugar, and sex.  Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple buddies who hustle drugs and get high together; they even manage to set money aside and feel like they are making successes of themselves in their own way.  They discover how precarious their position really is when the supply of drugs in their area dries up and they are forced to go on the road to find more.  Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is Harry's beautiful girlfriend, who squanders money from her wealthy family while she feeds her addiction and dreams of opening a boutique with Harry's help.  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's na?ve mother, whose belief that she will appear on an infomercial leads her into an addiction to diet pills in an effort to lose weight.<br /><br />Each of these characters is sustained by a dream that enables them to use drugs, believing that it is a temporary stage on their way to a brighter future.  By the end of the film, all of their dreams have been cruelly but unavoidably crushed and the characters themselves have spiraled into their separate lonely hells.  It's not easy to watch because the talented cast invests their characters with much compassion.<br /><br />Don't see this film if you are one of those people who believes that all movies should make us feel good.  But do see it if you believe films should make us feel deeply./</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but most people won't like. In fact, there's not a lot to like, because the movie is about four likable people falling deep into desperation and despair. The dream mentioned in the title is the American Dream of making it, of having it all, of acheiving your goals. But these people, Harry and his mother Sara, Marion, and Tyrone, all try to acheive their goals in the most dangerous ways. Watching these four change into shadows of themselves is depressing. All said and done though, this is still one of the best movies I have ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>The reasons this movie is brilliant are -in my opinion- not easily graspable for most people. This becomes more obvious if one reads some of the negative reviews here at Amazon.<br />  I read here in some reviews that this movie is poor because...it's depressive! Since when do films need to be cheery to be good? Is life that way? Is reality, anybody's reality that way? I read in other reviews that this film is not good because &quot;there's no message involved&quot; or because &quot;there's no ethics defended&quot;. I really fail to understand such mindsets. This film is a depiction of reality, a very particular reality, that of people being addicted to heavy drugs and the lives they lead. THAT is the message. It's simply a raw depiction of a specific reality that millions of people (esp. in the west) are experiencing daily. Now, as far as &quot;ethics&quot; are concerned, i'll say this: if the director endulged in some heavy pedagogic diatribe via this film to tell us that &quot;drugs can be dangerous for you&quot; i'd simply say &quot;duh&quot; and watch something else. Besides, he does show that in a more than obvious way. But thankfully, he doesnt attempt to shove an agenda down our throats.<p>  Now to the film itself: I'd already been super-impressed with the director's previous film (the equally brilliant &quot;Pi&quot;) so i was more than intrigued about this one.<br />  I was rewarded again by Aronofsky as a viewer. This film has great camera work (it's through and through cutting edge stuff visually) , great acting, minimal but efficient dialogue,<br />and an absolutely superb conceptual soundtrack (most of it is based on one theme).<p>  It surely is hardcore in its visuals but there's more quality here to be discovered as the director doesnt try to impress with cheap and unrealistic scenes. There's nothing in the film that's over the top or exaggerated and that might sound as self-understood but there are more than enough films with a drug theme that stretch things to extremes visually as if depicting things realistically isn't overwhelming enough.<p>  No need to describe the plot as 10s of other reviews have already done so, so I'll simply reccommend this film (as many others did too) to anybody with a passion for groundbreaking cinema. Extra kudos for Burstyn's performance which is definately show-stealing but even more credits for the fact that &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; doesn't merely stay on the illegal drug scene but takes a hard stab at the legal drugs. Legal they may be, but there's literally millions of people battling serious addictions from them and they continue to be prescribed massively nevertheless.<p>  An ode to antihypocrisy as well as great filmwork.</p></br><a href="../users/AQI2CW6UKF1ES.html">AQI2CW6UKF1ES</a><br/><p>I read about it on the back of Scary Movie 2, so I read up on it, and herd it was a movie about 4 drug addicts with a scary message, so I decided to buy it.  <p>I was really hoping to see a good movie, with messagaes shoved down my throat, well the movie was outstanding, and the messages were sure tough to swallow.  <p>Ellen Burstien did a fabulas performance as Sara Goldfarb, a old woman on diet pills;  Jared Leto did a great job as well, as Sara's son Harry, who was just a plain drug addict; Jennifer Connelly did a good job of playing Harry's girlfriend, Marion, who had money, but no attention, so she's on drugs; and Marlon Waynes, at his more serious, less funny roles, does very good job of playing Tyrone, just like Harry, a plain drug addict.  <p>That's pretty much all I'm gonna say about the movie, well at the end, that's where the big messages come in.  But to those who really want a more clear enjoyable reason to say no to drugs, then this is it.  I dunno if it will work or not, but it did for me.<p>peace</p></br><a href="../users/A3AKPY4LXIC24O.html">A3AKPY4LXIC24O</a><br/><p>Sometimes film can change you.

That said, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM stands along with DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES as a gripping film that bares all the pain and sadness of characters who fall victim to their vices.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful, especially the ladies.  Jennifer Connelly continues to rack up her impressive resume, and Ellen Burnstyn commits to film one of the bravest performances I've ever seen.<br /><br />After catching this film again on the Independent Film Channel just now, I've switched over to a news program where the talking heads are discussing legalizing drugs.

Even unfeeling husks like myself will not escape unscathed.<br /><br />This is a beautifully mastered film about drug addiction, but not in standard, drugs-are-bad format.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a junkie who dreams of being a better person but still regularly hawks his mother's battered TV set for fix money.  He and his friend Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) decide to go into dealing, to set themselves up so that they never have to worry again.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a lonely widow who spends her simple days watching TV, eating chocolates, and gossiping with her friends.  Until she receives a phone call saying that she has won a chance to be on television, and with this dream comes a revitalization of Sara's life.  Determined to fit into her old red dress when they call her to be on television, Sara embarks on a diet.  Unable to resist food, her only companion through her lonely widowhood, Sara goes to a quack doctor for diet pills.<br /><br />It is extremely fascinating how `Requiem' managed to tackle two separate types of addiction in one movie, blending their patterns, their cause-and-effect, and their rise-and-decline results into one sweeping expanse of cinematic pleasure.  Imbedded behind this well directed and well-photographed movie is an eerie soundtrack, with an ominous score repeated throughout the movie giving audio fuel to the increasingly horrific visuals.<br /><br />`Requiem' will leave you hollowed out, numb, aching in a profound and disturbingly vague way.  It is filled with hope and hopelessness, love and destruction, compulsion and self-defeating purposes, centered around that gaping wound called addiction.  Look for spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth), and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).  Each of these actors/actresses give us their best performances to date in `Requiem', and tip your hat to the realism from the supporting cast members.<br /><br />If you watch only one movie this year, make it Requiem For A Dream, and if you only get to watch two movies, then watch this one twice.  Also of note, if this movie touches your soul the way it touched mine, go out and grab up a copy of the book `Candy', by Luke Davies.  Also themed around addiction, it uses the same despairing approach to this tender subject as `Requiem' does.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>"Requiem for a dream" has two separate stories, yet connected through family ties and drug-abuse. <p>The first story is about Sara (Ellen Burstyn, the same from "The exorcist", if you can believe it). Sara is a middle-aged woman, overweight, addicted to watching television. When she receives a phone call telling her she will be on some TV show, it's the moment of her life. She has a red dress that she hasn't worn in some time and she can't wear it again because of her weight problem. So, she sees a doctor that tells her to take some pills instead of taking meals. Soon she is addicted and obcessed to the pills, and her life goes down the drain. <p>The second story is about Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto, from "My so-called life" and "Panic room"), his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely (before "A beautiful mind") and his friend played by Marlon Wayans. The lives of these three characters are already down the drain, because they're heroine addicts, and everything they do is in order to get more of the stuff. <p>All four mentioned actors have impressive performances. Ellen Burstyn's transformation during the film is amazing. Her performance won her nominations for both the Academy and Golden GLobe awards (and she lost to Julia Roberts, proving that what wins these prizes is lobbying, not acting). Jared Leto is also very good, but he doesn't change much from the introspective and  quiet characters he is used to play. Marlon Wayans surprised me doing a serious character, also very good. But Jennifer Connelly's performance, in my opinion, was the strongest. For once, she put aside her good looks and concentrated in doing a drug addict, sometimes ugly, desperate, puffy face, running nose, etc.<p>Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with the director, Aronofsky, saying he wanted to provide the viewers with an emotional roller-coaster. There is no roller coaster in the movie, it's all plainly downhill from beginning to end. I found  interesting some of the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.<p>The title is perfect for this movie. What is the "Requiem for a dream"? It's when you look back through your life and you realise that it wasn't as close as what you'd wanted it to be, you only spent the chance you'd got for living.<p>Grade 9.0/10</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Movies like Requiem For A Dream are like giant arrows that point out the flaws of voting bodies like The Academy Awards....this film should have swept the Oscars, should have won Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actress....instead we get safe pap like Erin Brockovich and Julia Roberts.....<p>  Requiem For a Dream follows four characters as they follow their dreams...and we see their dreams become nightmares. Ellen Burstyn gives maybe the best motion picture performance I've ever seen. Not HER best ever...THE BEST EVER. I have never seen an actor or actress lay themselves bare like this before. Watching the sweet, lonely Sara Goldfarb become a speed freak is bad enough, but the paths followed by her son Harry (Jared Leto), his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans, a true revelation..), and Harry's girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly)are equally harrowing; By the end of the film I felt like I had been sent through the wringer.....<p>  The DVD has some of the most clever packaging I've seen in quite some time: It's presented like an infomercial for Sara's favorite TV personality, Tappy Tibbins, played by Christopher MacDonald. There are a lot of extras, and I was particularly happy to see Ellen Burstyn interview Author Hubert Selby, Jr.- it was VERY illuminating.<p>  As an unflinching portrait of addiction, Requiem ranks right up there with Trainspotting, and should be required viewing for all High School students thinking of experimenting with drugs.</p></br><a href="../users/AT6CZDCP4TRGA.html">AT6CZDCP4TRGA</a><br/><p>...only in slow-motion, with lots of MTV-ish intercutting, speeded-up sequences, and a pulsating soundtrack as the carnage unfolds and the blood splatters the lens.<br /><br />Only here the carnage is not only physical but more unbearably, psychological, emotional, spiritual, and sexual.  In a nutshell: onrushing catastrophes at every level.<br /><br />This is one of those films, in the tradition of "Breaking the Waves," where during the first 10 minutes you see very clearly that the main characters---quite sympathetic, unfortunately---are going to be on a fast-accelerating downhill slide for the rest of the movie.  Unlike similar films that chronicle a steady process of chemical-related self-destruction ("Trainspotting" and "Leaving Las Vegas" come to mind), "Requiem for a Dream" will never be accused of "glamorizing" or "romanticizing" substance abuse.  Director Aranofsky seems to take special pains to capture every excruciating torture and suffering that his protagonists undergo---in fact, he even uses film and sound techniques to amplify it and shove our noses into it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is fairly bold as art, and probably quite accurate as social documentary, as an aesthetic work it simply is not very enjoyable to watch.  Both "Trainspotting" and "Leaving Las Vegas" had similarly bleak and hopeless storylines, yet managed to tell those stories in creative and interesting ways, rather than just straight-up, visually-enhanced journalistic docudrama...i.e. both were far more enjoyable because they were much more multi-dimensional, their characters were far better developed and far less predictable.  Leto, Connelly, Wayans, and Burstyn are all talented actors and appealing characters but they are barely developed beyond the black holes of their addictions and compulsions; instead they are presented as basically 4 hopeless and helpless lambs about to be tortured and eaten alive before our eyes in myriad ways.<br /><br />About the only truly original and insightful character drama is that played by Ellen Burstyn, in that we are all too rarely shown the more mainstream addictions that is sadly predominant in American society: food, television, and prescription (diet, in this case) meds.  She was the most interesting of the bunch by far, the other 3 leads are all cardboard characters we've seen a million times before, albeit played by very competent actors.<br /><br />This film could've been far more original, interesting, and insightful if it had simply focused on Burnstyn's character as a case study for mainstream America---lobotomized by TV, living isolated miserable lives in a dysfunctional community and culture, bloated by junk food used as pleasure substitutes, getting their fixes from the local pharmacy.<br /><br />Three stars for visual/aural stimulation but shallow and cliched storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>A trio of Herion Junkies (Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, Marlon Wayans) trying hard to survived thier habits but going down and been pushed Rock-Bottoms in thier serapate ways.<p>Oscar-Winner:Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist) is heartbreakingly wonderful as a lonely boob-tude addicted widow sucking down on Diet pills.

The DVD has features galore, including a commentary, interviews, trailers, and a making-of featurette.  Not for the fainthearted.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Darren Aronofsky<br /><br />Cast:  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Janet Sarno.<br /><br />Running Time:  102 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence.<br /><br />"Requiem for a Dream" tells the story of 4 people, connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship, whether it is family, girlfriend, or business partner. Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles, they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience; hopes, aspirations, dreams. Sara Goldfarb (played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn) dreams of one day being on a TV show, and one day, gets her chance. She fantasizes about how she could wear her favorite red dress, which she wore to her sun's graduation, on television; however, upon trying to wear the red dress, Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight, eventually resorting to medication. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple, Harry and Marion, who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale along with their friend Tyrone (Shawn Wayans) so they can be set for life and Marion can open up her own (legal) business. Unfortunately, their recreational drug use turns into day-to-day addiction, and things start to get ugly.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.<br /><br />The look of the film is extremely stylized, but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism, something that really works when done well, and done well it was. By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots, extreme close-ups and more edits than you can shake a stick at; Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem. The audience visually experiences first-hand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'; all this in 3rd person; all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.  Of course, all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end. The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale, which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film. The pacing at the end, when compared to earlier parts of the movie, was so fast that some viewers may find it hard to keep up, and it will literally take your breath away when the credits came up. All in all, the effect was amazing, and something that audiences haven't felt much since "American Beauty" and "American History X".  As the title indicates, "Requiem for a Dream" does not contain a happy ending. It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness; however, it does show what desperate people are willing to do, and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety. It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>This Is a fantastic movie that freaked the MPAA out when it hit theatres in 2000. It was originally rated NC-17, and We still dunno wether it's R- rated of NC-17! Though I saw the R rated one, I still liked it.<br /><br />STORY: Sara Goldfarb (Burstyn) is a widow, who has a son named Harry. He has 2 friends, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They all get hooked on such drugs as Marijuanna, Cocaine, Heroin, etc. to start a new life. Meanwhile, Sara gets a call one day from an informercial Guru named Tappy Tibbons, and so She tries a diet which you can't have Red Meat, Preserved sugar, and Orgasms. But then "no"'s drive her crazy so she contacts a doctor,and gets addicted to dieting pills. But then, these people's addictions start to destroy their lives...<br /><br />THOUGHTS: KEEP AWAY FROM THE YOUNG CHILDREN! It contains sexual scenes that don't apply "good" for ages 10-17. But then again, This is an IMPORTANT FILM, and should it be shown to every friggin' JH ans SH school kid? YES. It will show you what drugs can do to you.<br /><br />So I'm hoping that you will buy this movie. It will mess with your head for a little, then it will make you realise that DRUGS KILL! SO PLEASE BUY IT!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>One of the most surprising and enticing movies of the last years, this cult classic (yes, it`s a modern classic already) presents a superb and unforgettable perspective about the nature of addiction (not just drugs). <p>Darren Aronofsky delivers some cutting-edge moments here, managing to offer terrific camera-angles with a powerful, fluid photography and an urban, hypnotic soundtrack. He`s one of the most promising directors around, resembling David Fincher, Chris Nolan or Richard Kelly due to his videoclip-like cinematography. <p>The plot focuses the lives of four alienated and lonely individuals whose experiences with addiction lead them to a downward spiral, generating a couple of astonishing and surreal scenes. &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was one of the essential movies of the nineties, as it delivered a new perspective on drugs and its effects, but &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is equally impressive, creative and original, presenting multiple memorable moments worth rewatching. <p>Its non-linear structure may be confusing at parts, some characters are not fully developed and the overall tone of the film is way too depressing (even a bit pretentious), still &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; shines as a respectable and strong achievement nonetheless.<br />This is independent filmaking at its best, a rich and multi-layered cinematic experience that doesn`t disappoint.<p>Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A38DQCCC64K4W.html">A38DQCCC64K4W</a><br/><p>This movie makes 'Bad Lieutenant' look like a kids movie. Well, not entirely...But this is one of the few movies that had me just sitting in the dark when it was over, numb and overwelmed. The final 3-4 minutes of this film are so intense it would be hard to believe anyone could turn away; Yet this beautifully acted, sharply put together drug-love-tragedy doesn't end well for anyone, and will likely have a profound effect on those who make it to the end. Burstyn, like Keitel in 'Bad Lieutenant', throws herself into her part, devoid of any vanity or worry about how she looks on film. It is a brave, heartbreaking performance that remains one of the most unforgettable ones in recent film history. Everyone shines in this movie, and while the editing was an annoyance for some, I found it appropriate for the film...Strap yourself in and get ready to be be floored and depressed...But in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>This movie is stunnig.

Dreams destroyed. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM follows four desperate addicts on their journey into self-annihilating oblivion. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn from THE EXORCIST) lives a lonely, solitary life, trapped in the dull routine of growing old and dying. Her dream of being on television (her only companion) seems to be answered when a phonecall tells her that she has been chosen to appear on a gameshow. There's only one problem. Sara no longer fits into her red dress! Thus begins the torture of dieting, which leads to pills, addiction, and ultimate destruction. Sara's son (Jared Leto from AMERICAN PSYCHO, PANIC ROOM) is a heroin addict (among other substances). He and his friend (Marlon Wayans) just want to make that final "big score" so they can "go straight". Unfortunately, life just doesn't work that way. Marian (Jennifer Connelly from DARK CITY, HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG) is the addicted girlfriend. Her dream of turning her dress designs into a career is torched by her own hunger for various pills and powders. This is the story of human weakness in the face of overwhelming temptation. When watching this, I was constantly reminded of my own flaws, and the fact that human beings, in mind or body, just aren't made for the abuses we inflict on them. When you see the price that these people are willing to pay, you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />P.S.- This review is for the unrated, non-edited, complete version of DREAM.

In addition to this she is watching too much TV and as a result is slowly losing the plot and gradually lapsing into her own bizzare world. But her son is too consumed with his own growing addiction and the lucrative profits to be made by dealing coke with his friends to notice her decline.<br />The movie is interesting in fits and spurts, but it soon turns into an all-out sensoral assault with not much of a point to it. I don't understand how this is on some lists of "Most Disturbing Movies". REQUIEM FOR A DREAM didn't disturb me at all. THE SOUND OF MUSIC, now THERE'S a movie that scarred me for life.<br />However, Darren Aronofsky has crafted a movie which is visually stunning, and puts the old split screen technique to creative use. The soundtrack is strange, to say the least; and features a bizzare combo of strings, techo and distortion.  The cast is good and also includes Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayons. But if you're expecting something "disturbing" you'll be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>"No middle ground here: you'll either love or hate `Requiem for a Dream,'" the dust cover publicity reads. I beg to differ: I admired the film for its intensity, its fine if unorthodox craftsmanship, and its superb performances, but I found it so harrowing and depressing that I can't imagine how anyone could ever love it. Director Darren Aronofsky, writing the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr. from Selby's novel, strives to recreate the subjective experience of a junkie's addiction, to an extent even films such as "Drugstore Cowboy" failed to do. Working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Jay Rabinowitz and sound man Brian Emmerich, Aronofsky assaults us with the sensory experience of addiction, as experienced by four pathetic losers: junkie Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and speed freak mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn). Each becomes the perfect, and perfectly horrible, example of the different private hells that junkies fall into. All four actors are superb, but the standout is Burstyn, the saddest of all, a lonely widow who becomes addicted to diet pills in the vain hope of landing a spot on a TV game show. The sight of Burstyn imploding in paranoiac terror, as she hallucinates that her refrigerator is attacking her and the people on TV are laughing at her, will be etched in your memory forever. Whether you want it to be, of course, is another matter. I was glad I saw "Requiem for a Dream," but I think once was enough. The DVD, however, is cleverly packaged (as a video by Tappy Tibbons, the TV motivational speaker Burstyn is obsessed with, played with smarmy ferocity by Christopher McDonald). It contains a compelling "Making Of" documentary, as well as a bonus video of Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby, who is still the unhappiest kid in Brooklyn after all these years.</p></br><a href="../users/A38YUU4J5Q4EJO.html">A38YUU4J5Q4EJO</a><br/><p>The acting in this movie is AWESOME !!!<br />The film revolves around 4 people.<br />The characters are Ellen Burnstein (who plays the mom) Her son(Jared Leto), her son's best friend(Marlon Wayans), and her son's girlfriend(Jennifer Connely).<br /><br />The son and friend start out selling drugs, and become thier own best customers,the girlfriend also becomes addicted, followed by the Mom.She starts taking prescribed diet pills to lose weight, because she believes that she is going to appear on a talk show and wants to fit in a particular red dress, and her 'dieting' does start out innocent enough.<br /><br /> As this movie progresses we watch them become empty shells of who they used to be throughout a one year time period, as thier addictions progress.<br />(The film is shot in 4 parts, 4 seasons:Winter,Spring,Summer and Fall)It starts in the spring and<br />by the time Winter comes around, they are all living in thier personal hells as full blown addicts. Mom on her "legal" prescription speed, and the other 3 on Herion.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top rank.<br />I think it is right on the money the depths to which these four sink.<br />Addiction is not a pretty thing,and even though the empty shells of the addicts they become is disgusting to watch, it is also hard to turn away.<br /><br />The Mother's "bottom" that she hits in her addiction will make you cry, you just have to see it to believe it. And I felt the most sorry for her character too, because she was so naive' and  innocent when she began taking the prescribed diet pills, and because they WERE prescribed, she didn't see anything wrong with her use, and it continued until she was a raving lunatic at about 70 pounds, and getting shock treatments.<br /><br />We witness all 4 characters in thier spiral downward, and it is very sad to see.<br /><br />I will have to say that it is about the most depressing movie I ever saw, but this is not totally a bad thing, as there is a lesson to be learned, and that lesson is that no matter who you are,rich or poor, black or white, girl or guy: ANYone can become an addict.<br />Some make it back from the bottom, and others don't.<br />That is the reality of the situation, and this movie captures that perfectly.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>I am not weak and I like movies that can emote remote depressive feelings in me.

A lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn) gets strung out on a &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; regimen of diet and sleeping pills prescibed by her quack physician. Meanwhile, her son (Jared Leto),his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy (Marlon Wayans) are busy destroying thier lives with heroin. And that's our &quot;plot&quot;...Drugs Are Bad (ho-hum). With neither a compelling central narrative nor sympathetic character in sight, be prepared for a VERY long 2 hours. I was roped in by the hype surrounding Burstyn's performance, and while she is excellent as always, this is nowhere near her best work (check out &quot;King Of Marvin Gardens&quot; just for starters). Director Darren Aronofsky appears to be more determined to showcase his own visual technique over performances, so any subtle acting nuances are bludgeoned by annoying camera/editing tricks. There are far too many gross-out scenes (unless your idea of a good time at the movies includes watching beautiful Jennifer Connelly vomit into the camera, or a lingering close-up of a needle spiking into a pus-swollen abcess). The &quot;What...that's IT?!&quot; ending really puts the capper on an alltogether unpleasant movie experience.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>when I saw this, I really got really bored. um, yeah ok shes taking a lot of pills and shes becoming addictive. stuff like that, and basically its a stinker of a movie and I did not like it one bit but it had some powerful moments and some disturbing images that can keep locked in your head after its done, but primarily I just got sick of it in the middle. Though Leto and especially Connelley give great performances</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.<br /><br />As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.<br /><br />A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Thanks, Darren...</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>From the visionary that brought you "Pi", a Sundance Film Festival winner about a mathematical genius trying to unlock the secrets of the world through numbers, comes a tail of misery and melancholy.  For those that enjoy their vast library of romantic comedies, you're probably wondering, "If the movie's that depressing, why the HELL would I want to watch it?"  Based on Hubert Selby's 1978 novel "Last Exit To Brooklyn", "Requiem For A Dream" follows the lives of four Coney Island natives as they succumb to their various vices.  Ellen Burstyn is the star of the show and no doubt the best performance of all as Sara Goldfarb, a lonesome widow who day-in and day-out tunes in to her television, fixated by a self-help extremist named Tappy Tibbons (McDonald).  Treasuring a red dress she wore to her son's high school graduation, she aspires to wear it again but she has one small problem - 50 lbs.  She diets to no avail, unable to contain her cravings.  Upon a friend's suggestion, she visits her doctor and receives a prescription for diet pills - her downward spiral begins.  <p>Meanwhile, Harry Goldfarb (Leto) is repeatedly pawning his mother's TV to support his smack habit, accompanied by his partner-in-crime and fellow addict Tyrone Love (Wayans).  Besides his endeavors with Tyrone, Harry is involved with a coke-snorting beauty named Marion Silver (Connelly).  The footloose trio begin a trafficking operation in the hopes that they will soon score the purest pound of heroin, earning them the higher living that they dream of.  However, fate is misaligned for the three and a drug deal goes bad, landing Tyrone in jail and Harry and Marion desperate for a fix - their dance with depravity is inevitable.<p>Make no mistake - "Requiem For A Dream" will literally heave you through the deepest, darkest vortex of anguish and despair.  Take it from me - I was thoroughly distraught and emotionally drained when the end credits finally rolled.  I even noticed how irritable I felt and how easy it was for me to get upset.  The film so profoundly affected me that it put me in a completely different state of mind; it actually made me feel quite miserable.  While this may be a filmmaker's vital objective, it is not necessarily the greatest thing to gain from it (as I found out for myself).  Even the score is devoid of hope; it is neither beautiful nor enchanting in the least.  In fact, listening to the score itself for a prolonged period is about as hard to take as the film.  Built on an electronica foundation with intermittent segments by the Kronos String Quartet, composer Clint Mansell's compositions are hip and moody sonatas signaling impending doom. <p>Director Darren Aronofsky has reappointed many of his collaborators from "Pi", including nearly half his producers, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and composer Clint Mansell.  Aronofsky's vision is perfectly melded with Libatique's inimitable cinematography, providing a feast for the senses.  Using techniques such as jump cuts, peephole magnification, mounted POV cameras and simultaneous uses of time-lapse film and slow-motion frames, Aronofsky gives the viewer a glimpse of the paranoia and euphoria of the characters' highs and lows.  He even gives the time of day a distinct aura; daylight is calm and celestial, while evening is foreboding and dangerous.  Most interesting are the rapid fragments of film we see as the addicts use their drug of choice.  The jump cuts of a butane lighter, boiling heroin, rolled dollar bills, anthills of cocaine that abruptly disappear and the dilated pupils of the user lead to the all- consuming narcotic rapture.  The only thing that becomes tiresome is the loud and embellished whooshing noise that accompanies each jump cut.  Of course, this was probably added to convey the "rush" the addict is feeling.  <p>Jared Leto is undaunted and slightly disarming as Harry, but his character is hard to sympathize with since he does nothing to help himself or others.  So goes it with Jennifer Connelly as the sleepwalking Marion, a bold beauty that lives only for the moment.  She and Harry latch on to one other in a seemingly devotional manner, but the truth is that their only bond lies in their drive for perpetual sedation. Leto has been in a string of films (both TV and big screen), having made his biggest impression in 1999's "Fight Club" as a bleach-blonde devotee to Tyler Durden's detrimental campaign.  Connelly has done much in the industry but her previous roles have left her undistinguished in the eyes of critics.  Since projects such as "Dark City", "Higher Learning" and "Waking The Dead", Connelly has reemerged and proven to be a commanding presence onscreen.  Sara's downfall is the most heartbreaking to witness for she is really the only character that can be sympathized with.  As well as undergoing emotional overhauls for her character, Burstyn endured several physical transformations, all of which entailed four prosthetic necks, two fat suits and nine wigs.  Her final scenes as a cadaverous and delusional Sara are a wonder to behold, Burstyn luminous in all of her character's madness.  Aronofsky personally said of Burstyn's performance, "What can I say, she's unbelievable.  I hope that audiences will feel they've been robbed by Hollywood, a business that has not hired this woman for twenty years. It's almost a crime on the world because of her abilities.&quot;  I echo Aronofsky's sentiments and say that while Julia Roberts was impressive in Steven Soderbergh's little doozy "Erin Brockovich", Burstyn was SORELY UNDERRATED.<p>"Requiem For A Dream" is not only to be appreciated for its artistry but for tackling an addiction that few of us really understand: FOOD.  The floating mirages of cupcakes, sizzling steaks and such may be humorous to some people, but for others it is inexplicable torture.  To tackle the obsession the world has with physical appearance is a topic that few have endeavored to render onto film and Aronofsky does a terrific job interpreting the anguish that obese people endure every minute of their lives.  Here's some encouragement for those who question watching this dour ditty: Burstyn was nominated for Best Actress in twelve different festivals (including the Oscars and the Golden Globes) and Matthew Libatique won an Independent Spirit Award for his cinematography.  Warning to those who expect an uplifting denouement: stray far from this film - it will take you down with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I never read anything about Requiem for a Dream except for an off-hand comment by a reviewer about another movie, "At least it's not as relentlessly depressing as Requiem for a Dream."  That's when I realized that no, Requiem for a Dream has nothing to do with What Dreams May Come.  In fact, the two are polar opposites.<br /><br />With a completely fresh perspective (once I realized that Robin Williams was not going to pop up at any moment and crack a joke), I was able to drink in the awful, heady concoction that is Requiem for a Dream.  And it's a testament to Darren Aronofsky that I walked away satisfied and even inspired by what ultimately is a tale of self-destruction.<br /><br />The movie begins with Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) having an argument with his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) over a television set.  It seems Sara is having a nervous breakdown and has decided to chain her television set to the wall to protect it "against robbers."  Then, terrified of Harry, she locks herself in a closet. The two argue through the door...until we realize that the person Sara's really afraid of, who really would steal the television, is Harry himself.  You see, Harry's a junkie.<br /><br />In a routine that's so rote as to become familiar to everyone in the neighborhood, Harry rolls the television set to a pawn shop, who in turn gives him money for it.  And then Sara goes back to pay for it.  The exchange is a pittance (20 bucks), but it's all a lot of work to keep the illusion that Sara is not funding Harry's drug habit.<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is all about these kinds of illusions.  Behind it all lurks the very real danger of addiction; to people, to things, to routines, to hope.  The movie is truly a sad commentary over what happens when people lose hope.  It is the death of the American dream.<br /><br />From there, the movie branches into two different plots, following Sara and Harry's lives. Overweight, with her husband long dead and her only son stealing from her, Sara is a desperate, lonely woman.  When she receives a phone call that she will appear on a television show (an infomercial that plays incessantly, nattering on about "Juice"), she struggles to fit into a red dress.  It's the same dress she wore once before, when her husband was alive, during happier times.  Fitting into the dress becomes an obsession, as she shifts from dieting to medication. The doctor doles out four kinds of drugs: three of them uppers and one a downer to make her sleep.<br /><br />Harry, on the other hand, has dreams of his own.  With his buddy Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) and the love of his life, Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), they hope to stop dealing drugs by "one last score."  Harry plans to open a boutique with Marion and live happily ever after. But all of them are addicted to cocaine and they come up with all sorts of excuses to snort it.<br /><br />What's different about this movie from say, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is the ever-present Aronofsky.  There's no shot he won't attempt, no horrible act he won't film, no technique he won't try.  We watch Sara on speed, as she cleans her entire apartment from top to bottom.  We are continuously assaulted by the RIP-SNORT-AHH rush of the drug trip, which hits the viewer like a rabbit punch to the head. We are with Sara during her bad trips and with Marion during her good trips.  Dreams and hallucinations start to blend together, and always the soundtrack reminds us that this is a nightmare, not a comedy.  These people are real.  They're you're neighbors, your friends, your family...and they need your help.<br /><br />But they never get it.  Nobody has any safety net.  Not Sara or Harry; not Tyrone who lost his mother when he was six; not Marion who sees a psychiatrist that lies to her parents about her treatment.  These people have all been forgotten by friends and family.  They grasp out in vain for dreams that are largely meaningless, struggle to achieve goals without any clear purpose, and ultimately fall, fall, fall...to their deaths, into insanity, or prison.<br /><br />Every actor in this movie is at the top of their game.  Leto does an admirable job as a bleary-eyed dreamer who keeps hoping to make a mythical "big score" that will save him from all the rot and ruin.  Connelly's uses her angelic looks to full effect, such that her it's gut-wrenching to watch her beauty (and her innocence) used and abused.  Wayans shows surprising range as a wayward soul who just wants to embrace his mother one more time.  But the real star of the show is Burstyn, who displays amazing range as a mother and an old woman, going slowly mad in the humdrum repetition of her life.  Her role is extremely convincing; enough to bring back some unpleasant memories of my own grandmother's mental decay.<br /><br />Drug-trip movies rarely work well unless...well, unless you're on drugs.  They tend to replicate the experience in such a fashion that if you're not high, the movie is confusing or just plain irritating.  Trainspotting created the canvas for a movie like Requiem for a Dream.  Aronofsky takes it to a whole new level of dread, using sound as much as sight to reinforce the highs and lows of addiction.<br /><br />Requiem for a Dream is not a movie for the faint of heart.  But it is not exploitive or judgemental.  Hubert Selby Jr. isn't just writing about people who are chained to their addictions, he's mourning them.  With Aronofsky's deft touch, a grim book truly rises to the level of a requiem, filled lights and sound that follow its poor subjects to their grim conclusions.  A horrible, awful, beautiful masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COG8T9MPP3KA.html">A1COG8T9MPP3KA</a><br/><p>The film was pretty good. A true depiction of addiction. Pretty edgy at times. The thing is, with the MTV style cinematography, this film will not date well. I am referring to the &quot;self cam&quot; that proceeds the characters as they walk around. The type of cam used for shows such as MTV's &quot;Fear&quot;, where you can view the expressions of the participant as they walk around. In 15 or 20 years this will be atrocious. It ruined the chances of this film becoming a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEGRJQNU51P9.html">A2FEGRJQNU51P9</a><br/><p>A film by Darren Aronofsky<p>This is a powerful movie.  While on one hand it would be simplistic to say that this is a movie about drugs, it is also necessary and accurate to say that the movie is about drugs.  It would be just as accurate to say the movie is about addiction.  This movie is broken up into three stages: Summer, Fall, and Winter.  Each stage tracks the descent of the characters into addiction and we watch as their lives fall apart.  <p>This is the story of four people: Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and their friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans).  We start the movie with our characters about to improve their lives.  After Sara receives a phone call telling her that she has been selected to appear on television she is obsessed with losing weight and fitting into a dress that she wore years ago.  She sees a doctor that was recommended by a friend (the doctor seems like a quack doctor, however), and begins taking diet pills.  Harry and Tyrone have a plan to start dealing some higher quality drugs and make money so they can buy some of the highest quality cocaine and sell that and make serious money.  Marion is along for the ride and has dreams of her own about designing clothing.  At first everything is working fine and we are in the Summer period of the story where everything is at its brightest and warmest and most positive.  But it isn't to last.  <p>Harry recognizes that the diet pills that his mother are taking are nothing more than speed, with a downer to help her sleep at night.  He sees the signs of addiction and that she is starting to become strung out, but all she can see is that she is losing weight.  Harry and Tyrone are experiencing great success, but it is all starting to turn sour.  The rest of the movie is the slow (though at times rapid) descent into addiction and the repercussions of the drug addiction and lives they are leading.  There are arrests and Marion is now willing to trade her body for drugs since Harry is not able to provide her with the drugs she needs.  It keeps getting worse and worse and spiraling out of control for all four characters and the end of the movie doesn't give them redemption, but rather rock bottom.  <p>As I said, this is a powerful movie, but by no means is this film an uplifting movie.  Things start bad, improve a little it and just get worse from there.  This is a harrowing look at drug addiction and there is no truly sympathetic character whom I care for and hope things turn around for.  What this movie does have are fantastic acting performances from everyone involved (though I am somewhat less impressed with Connelly).  I have been impressed with both of Araonofsky's movies (the other being "Pi"), but they have both been emotionally gloomy pictures.  I look forward to seeing what he does next and while I think this is an excellent movie, I think I'll be okay never seeing it again.</p></br></body></html>

The original Superman is my favorite Superhero movie, beating out its sequel: The Donner cut. It starts off like a science fiction picture rather than a man of steel. I felt Donner handled the backstory with as much respect as some personal project. It was handled with awesome care. And what star power included! Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Glen Ford, and the previously unknown Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Christopher Reeves gathers so much love for this role that no other actor has yet to be identified as Superman. I point out one scene that strikes harder than any other, and that is the scene where Louis dies in his arms and Superman lets out a furious and screaming charge to change human destiny. It stirred my soul more than even the masterpiece symphonic soundtrack even! And we all can agree that John Williams has created one of the greatest soundtracks ever here.<br /><br />The more I think about the earth changing end, the more points I give it for creativity and fun. I put myself in supermans red cape, faced with his lovers lost, and my physical powers are surging within me. With my extraterrestrial knowledge of the physics of the universe I do something that exceeds any measure of extraordinary power ever demonstrated before. I change the course of Human history. Damn everything else. And I stop being a critic at this point and I am just a bleeding heart poet now. And it adds to me love for this unbelievable film.<br /><br />Note: I do not own this movie, but I have seen this BD product and I recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A239PPUVV8O0U0.html">A239PPUVV8O0U0</a><br/><p>With the exception of George Reeves from the television series, no one has ever cleary defined a role as greatly as Christopher Reeve (for four films no less)! Until Burton's Batman film 11 years later and more recently The Dark Knight, there has never been an epic superhero film like this. It combines great talent (in front and behind the cameras), great story (with very subtle Biblical references) and amazing special effects. The only aspect of Reeve I don't like (and its probably because of the way the writers wanted) is the portrayal of Clark Kent. I don't like that he portrays him as a bumbling fool. As Superman, he's sincere and honest but the recent animated versions and Reeves' portrayed him as a reporter who can get story and not get intimidated by criminals as easily as these movies (including Returns). Margot Kidder is feisty as Lois Lane (and believeable too, not like Bosworth who looks like she's at the Daily Planet on an internship). Gene Hackman is both lethal and funny as Luthor, able to mix the cruelness of the villain along with the wittiness in his insults to his underlings. The flying sequences are brilliantly done (and continue to get better, until 4 (they liked to use the same shot over and over) and Returns (where almost everything looks CGI, even in the shots that really are Routh, he looks computer generated). The incomprable John Williams again delivers a rousing score. His main theme and the love theme are ones not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>You would be hard pressed to come up with a better introduction of Superman to the big screen. Under the direction of Richard Donner, Superman flies not only on film, but in our imaginations. This is not the first attempt at a live-action Superman, and it is far from the last, but with a lot of work, it was the first realistic portrayal of the man of steel's powers. They knew going in that sub-par effects work would kill the magic of this movie, which is why they spent more R&D on making Superman fly than on any other single element of the movie. In the end, the tag line in the advertising boiled it down succinctly: You will believe a man can fly.<br /><br />Superman speaks to the most basic part of the human imagination. He is what we all wish we could be, both in body and in spirit. He is perfectly good as well as perfectly formed. But if we couldn't believe in his powers, we would never be able to be pulled completely into the fantasy.<br /><br />A perfect hero, however, requires a perfect villain. Gene Hackman brings the right amount of charisma to the cruel and villainous Lex Luthor. You know he is planning the deaths of millions, but there is a part of you that almost roots for him because you just love to watch him berate his underlings.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I saw this film in theaters way back in '78! I loved it then and it holds up quite well today. The FX are great for the time and for the most part look fine. Reeve's gave Clark Kent/Superman so much character and to me he will always be Superman. This is a very entertaining film and it's doesn't take itself too seriously. Lots of humor and terrific performances by all the key players.<br /><br />If I have one or two complaints it's that the Superman and Lois flying sequence is too long and I didn't like the whole "turning back time" segment at the end. I would have liked to have the movie spend a little more time on Clark's youth too. These are small grievances and I love this film regardless giving it 4 1/2 stars. It's a shame that 'Superman Returns' didn't have this much charm. I am reviewing this film on the individual release, but own and watched the newer Superman box set.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The potential for disaster was huge with the big screen adaption of Superman, but director Richard Donner knew what he was doing here, and what we have left is a super epic of one of the most popular and recognized super heroes of all time.  Christopher Reeve was the perfect choice to don the red, blue, and yellow suit, and Gene Hackman's campy yet hilarious portrayal of Lex Luthor is fantastic.  The special effects, while may look a bit dated, still look pretty good and hold up today.  This Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well, the screen tests are great to watch, and sometimes just plain hilarious.  All in all, even if you don't like the Superman comics, you will find something to love with this epic film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>It had been years since I had seen Superman.  So, I rented this one as a trip of nostalgia.  I was blown away by just how good this movie is so many years later.  Is there anyone more perfect to play the man of steel that Christopher Reeve?<p>Let this movie be a lesson to those who make movies like Spawn, Tomb Raider..., a movie must have more than explosions are special effects.  Superman is that movie.  It captures the grandness of childlike memories of superheroes without the use of  cliche.  <p>This is one to own for sure.  A super movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>This movies is one of the best movies never appreciated.  Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman are great.  Marlon Brando is, well Brando (and even more Brandoish with the added scenes.)  The special effects are of its time and might be rejected by us.  The added &quot;gauntlet&quot; scenes are worth the new purchase and only add to a movie with great performances and fine writing.  Buy it.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>Today, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  And the first of my 22 Blu-Ray discs that I already bought that I played today was this movie of "Superman: The Movie."<br /><br />Well, I just watched this Blu-Ray version of "Superman: The Movie", and then watched my old DVD of this film.  I'll have to say that buying the Blu-Ray disc of this movie proved to be a waste of money.  The Blu-Ray disc looks no better than the DVD.  In fact, I'll even say that the DVD had it's colors more in check than this Blu-Ray disc did.  On Blu-Ray, the flesh tones were rather too pink where on regular DVD, everyone's flesh tones looked more natural.  So, for this being my first Blu-Ray disc to watch and compare, I'm rather disappointed, but then again, greatly relieved.  Perhaps I won't bother buying Blu-Ray disc replacements for the DVD's that I already have and believe look quite good as the standard DVD's that they are.  I really do think that Blu-Ray is getting far more hype than they're really worth.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>The most popular superhero makes his way onto the screen with this extraordinary motion picture directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) and featuring a star studded cast including Academy Award winners Marlon Brando (The Godfather) and Gene Hackman (The Unforgiven, The French Connection), Christopher Reeve (Deathtrap), Ned Beatty (The Toy), Valerie Perrin (Lenny), and many others.<br /><br />Superman is one of the most exciting superhero flicks ever, and one of the best movies ever made!<br />You all know the story already: young Superman, Kal-el, the son of Jor-el, played remarkably by Brando, is sent to earth by his father right before his planet Krypton bursts into smithereens. He lands in a small town called Smallville, picked up by the Kent family, and raised as their own child that they name Clark. Clark grows up with unexplainable super powers, like scoring touchdowns all the time, kicking a football across the state, and racing trains and winning. Clark discovers a piece of kryptonite in the barn of his earthly parents' farm that tells him to head north, where he, or the toss of the kryptonite, builds his new home Krypton on earth where he meets the image and voice of his father who expains to him that he is not one of the humans. Years later, he's wearing tight blue pants, a red cape, and shirt that has the sign S on it. You know the rest of it so I'll stop right here.<br /><br />Superman was a major motion picture event when it was released back in 1978. It still is today despite the more advanced special effects in movies today. Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luther, Superman's nemesis who plans to destroy the world and take over, while Reeve, in his first major starring role, shines as Superman, a role he would find hard later on to escape the shadow of, and pass away nearly 26 years later and be remembered for nothing more than that.<br /><br />The film is electrifying, entertaining, engaging, and absolute fun for the entire family.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></br><a href="../users/A1YVDY3TISDRE1.html">A1YVDY3TISDRE1</a><br/><p>recently watched this filmed again- it has likely been at least 25 years since the last viewing (I was young then, not so young now).<br /><br />What I really like was the "tone" of the film.  What I mean is the emotional depth that the audience has in connecting with the characters.  For that, credit goes to director Richard Donner.  The film is mostly a drama, with light comedic touches.  It has a real nostalgic feel to it.<br /><br />brief plot:  Superman loses his parents in a far distant apocolyptic world, more advanced than Earth.  Thanks to a recording device imbedded in his satellite, Superman learns about his origin and his future purpose.  Once on Earth as he grows physically, he faces alienation as he tries to cope with "fitting in" with his peers- all the while harboring the secrets of his super powers.<br /><br />By becoming his super alter-ego, he can use his powers for good, and feel validated in ways that his Clark Kent persona cannot.  Thus, psychologically, Superman provides Clark Kent with ego balance, making him a whole and complete person.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the film is the casting.  We've got Marlon Brando (Oscar winner), Gene Hackman (Oscar winner), then new-comer Christopher Reeve, and Margot Kidder as the main players.  The casting was just perfect.  I can't imagine Superman being anyone else than Chris Reeve.  I can't imagine Lex Luthor being anyone else than Gene Hackman, and I can't imagine Lois Lane being anyone else than Margot Kidder.<br /><br />The other great piece of the film is the script.  Intelligent, inspiring, touching, adventurous, and most of all, believable.  Everyone has some "good lines" in this film, memorable lines, which to me is a sign of a good script.<br /><br />*highly recommended*</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>The first (and best) of the big-budget Christopher Reeve adventures, with the expanded 151-minute version a slight improvement over the 1978 theatrical cut. Winning performances, Richard Donner's affectionate direction and John Williams' score easily surpass the uneven special effects. A comic-book epic done right.</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Director Richard Donner's 1978 film "Superman - The Movie" is an amazing accomplishment.  Starring Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando it redefined the approach to comic book treatment and media.  It is the genesis of the mature comic book movie, a phenomenon we are still enjoying today.<br /><br />It tells the classic "Superman" origin story, and wisely takes its time to humanize the character.  Superman himself doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the movie, and the viewer does not feel cheated at all.  Instead, the movie spends time on both Krypton and Earth establishing Clark Kent at different phases of his life.  Acting luminaries Marlon Brando and Susannah York play Superman's Kryptonian parents Jor-El and Lara very well. As the movie shifts to young Clark's rural home of Smallville, his Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent are capably played by Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter.  When he does eventually turn up, Christopher Reeve is magnificent in the dual role of the mature Clark Kent and Superman, effortlessly capturing the differences between the characters and embodying each character perfectly.  He is supported by Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, the role for which the actress is probably still best known.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is humorous, but not without a very hard edge.<br /><br />This DVD edition is the first release to feature significant previously unseen footage(although a minor deleted shot of Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude was in original U.S. movie trailers).  The alterations are mostly more of Marlon Brando and Christopher Reeve in the Fortress of Solitude.  Overall, it's a fuller, more satisfying release than previously available.<br /><br />Also featuring a brilliant orchestral score from John Williams and a versatile screenplay co-written by Mario Puzo("The Godfather"), "Superman - The Movie" is a classic.<br /><br />P.S.  It is specifically called 'The Movie' because the concept of a mature superhero movie was new, and the label was used to stress to audiences of the time that it was a serious movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AFLQGO7CJVK50.html">AFLQGO7CJVK50</a><br/><p>The original superhero movie of modern times. Spider- Man had one in the 70's but was a joke, period. Superman I is still one of the better superhero movies ever made although with Iron Man released, is no longer the best. Some would say Batman was better as well. Worth buying if you ask me.</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Heck, this 1978 version of SUPERMAN was nostalgic even when it originally was released.  Featuring the likes of Marlon Brando, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Glenn Ford, and Susannah York, the film instantly became a Who's Who of established screen heavyweights.  And you can never, ever, go wrong with Gene Hackman as the villain; his Lex Luther character could very well be the best known--and best loved--bad guy in cinematic history.<br /><br />Yet--despite its numerous cornball supreme moments that still have me grimacing--the best thing SUPERMAN has going for it is charm.  This is a gloriously charming film, from its visuals of rolling wheat fields in Kansas, to its (at the time) state-of-the-art special effects--to its ever-respectful homage to its TV series predecessor.  Christopher Reeve plays the Man of Steel with humility, grace, and yes, humanity (Krypton or no Krypton).  Reeve turned out to be a home run for director Richard Donner.  Alas, Margot Kidder is just plain annoying as an aggressive, overbearing, man-eating Lois Lane, but she's merely an irritant that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />SUPERMAN is a light, fun, and entertaining movie--a lusciously glorious dose of good vibes nostalgia.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Man, time flies........not just Superman.  I say that because I vividly remember when this movie came out in the theater and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, and I on the big screen, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.  Now,<br /><br />It's still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as "Lex Luthor") and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular "Man Of Steel" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this, too.<br /><br />Personally, I never cared for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with the territory.  However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence it was just too weird watching this movie and  hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!  (The purity of the  `50s is lone gone!)<br /><br />Whatever, this is still great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>In today's Hollywood, the superhero movie is a changing breed. Films like "The Dark Knight" and "Hancock" are taking a reality-based approach to our heroes, portraying them as tortured souls who save lives out of anger or emotion, not because it is their sacred duty. Fortunately, the first "Superman" film passes the test of time as a testament to old-school superheroes...men and women that truly can be admired.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong...I consider "Dark Knight" to be perhaps the most complete film I have seen so far in my lifetime. However, after watching "Superman: The Movie" for the ump-teenth time (although this time with my 10-year old sister who was viewing the movie for the first time), I was struck by the purity of the Superman character. Whether he was rescuing a bus full of children, apprehending a petty burglar, matching wits with arch-enemy Lex Luthor, or taking time to swoop down and nab a little girl's kitten stuck up in a tree, Superman always strived to do what was ethically and morally right. I actually got a chill down my spine when Supes proclaims to Lois Lane that he stands for "Truth, Justice, and the American Way".<br /><br />Besides the symbolism of the Superman character, the film itself is also quite compelling. It really can be broken down into three acts:<br /><br />Act one focuses on Superman's doomed home planet of Krypton. The interesting visuals and cinematography of those scenes are some of the best the film has to offer.<br /><br />Act Two features a young Clark Kent as he lands on Earth, is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent, experiments with his super abilities, and ultimately learns of his Kryptonian heritage via a trip to the Arctic.<br /><br />The longest, and final, act of the film finally introduces the blue-and-red suited caped hero we all know. Key themes of this act include Superman becoming the hero of Metropolis, his burgeoning love for Lois Lane, and the penultimate battle to stop the latest diabolical scheme of Lex Luthor.<br /><br />The acting is also superb through-and-through. There will likely never be another Clark/Superman as heroic as Christopher Reeve, while Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando as Lois, Lex, and Jor-El (Superman's biological father), respectively, help to make the movie even more engaging.<br /><br />Finally, though many Superman fans may debate me on this, I also enjoyed the comedic touches of this film. Though admirable, the "Boy-Scout" aspect of Superman is, at times, a bit overdone, so the injection of small humorous moments is a welcome respite. Plus, children (like my sister!) will find Lex's comically inept henchman Otis (played by Ned Beatty) to be the highlight of the whole experience!<br /><br />There are not too many films worthy of a permanent place in my DVD library, but "Superman: The Movie" is one that definitely will be around my home for as long as I am. I recommend this exciting, intriguing, inspiring movie to anyone...period.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Superman-The Movie is a one of a kind film that isn't hardly made anymore. The movie is a classic, it hasn't aged at all and it is never boring (no matter how many times I watch it). The cast is perfect for the story and the story itself is excellent. There is just a really great scene towards the end of the movie when Superman gets really angry. You can literally feel the rage coming off the screen.<br /><br />There are just so many special effects in this movie that are simply breath-taking, especially if you compare it to the films of the same year and decade. Just the ability to make Superman fly was an amazing stunt, but there are so many other things in the film that are equally cool. Some of my favorite scenes of the film are the helicopter scene, then there is the scene when Superman goes through the Earth's core and just the special effects used during Lex Luthor's test of Superman. It is just cool to see the bullets bounce off of the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Overall, this is just a beautiful film that is totally worth buying, especially with all of the extras this DVD has.</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>The best thing about this movie are the opening credits! When I saw this movie nearly 30 years ago I was awe struck at the opening. The movie is first rate with first rate performances by Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder and of course Christopher Reeve.I enjoyed Superman I and II but didn't really care for the two other Superman movies. Don't get me wrong..Christopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and we miss him but the last two didn't have much of a plot. Superman I was and still is good high flying fun for everyone!!</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>The theatrical version of Richard Donner's Superman still holds up as the cinema's best superhero movie despite three decades' worth of advances in special effects and the arrival of almost every other comic book hero on the big screen, largely because at heart it's more a movie about what it means to be in a position where you have the power to do anything except what you really want. Although it's not without humor - it's dotted with neat little in-jokes that compliment rather than swamp the film, like Clark's brief glance at a payphone that's definitely not fit for his use - it takes itself and its characters seriously, with the absolute belief and integrity that Christopher Reeve brings to the part managing to transcend the inherent ridiculousness of a flying man who wears his underpants outside his tights. Marlon Brando's dignified performance sets the tone perfectly - this is indeed no mere fantasy, but something that carries some real emotional weight, with Kal El's journey to becoming Clark Kent and Superman one of loss and powerlessness despite his abilities. Yet rather than burying the picture the way the relentless one-note gloominess of Bryan Singer's take on the character did in Superman Returns, Donner mixes a classic epic style of filmmaking with a sense of joy and exuberance that makes the film seem a lot shorter than its 143-minutes, and throws in one of the great action setpieces of all time in the helicopter rescue sequence. Great filmmaking and great fun too.<br /><br />Also included on the 4-disc set is Donner's slightly longer director's cut and a wide variety of excellent extras including all the extras from the previously released double-sided Director's Cut edition as well as nine of the classic Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons from the 1940s. However, be warned that some early copies of the theatrical version didn't include the original 1978 sound mix but featured a remastered track with additional sound effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In a dying planet called "Krypton", a leader called "Jor-El" ( Marlon Brando) rules over a superpowerful and superstrong humanoid race sends his son " Kal-El" to Earth where he can grow up and protect the people there.

But as the following days, Metropolis does have it's daily dangers as Superman does his job and also has to stop Luthor from his evil plan.<br /><br />This movie was a big budget production that was in development since late 1976 when producer Alexander Salkind bought the movie rights for it with Warner Brothers ( who owns DC comics) and hired the director of "The Omen" Richard Donner to bring to life the beloved superhero icon of all time. People were amazed by the teaser back in late 1977 then the movie came out in december of 1978 to become one of the highest grossing movies of the year with rave reviews and a classic for all comic book fans everywhere, Christopher Reeves with the other cast are superb in it even with the three Kryptonian crooks ( Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran) who get imprisoned and become the villains for the second movie, Ned Betty as Otis and Jackie Cooper as the boss of the daily Planet Perry White. The special effects for it's time were remarkable and not only those but great acting, perfect direction, a superb music score by John Williams and heart to it makes it's the ultimate superhero movie and really set the standard for them for years to come.<br /><br />The DVD is terrific with quality remastered sound and picture, the movie itself is the extended restored cut which makes the movie even better. There's also a music-only track to hear the isolated score, audio commentary by the creative consultant team and Richard Donner, cast and crew bios, the added scenes that were restored on this DVD, awards, trailer & teaser, TV Spot, screen tests, additional music cues, two deleted scenes and featurettes.<br /><br />A must have for anyone who wants to own the esstenial superhero flick next to "Batman Begins".</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>I've been a superhero fan all my life.  I've especially loved superheroes in films and television shows.  There was just one superhero film I'd never seen - the original superhero film, without which we would have no "Batman Begins", no "X-Men", no "Spider-Man".  I needed to see "Superman".<br /><br />The film begins on the planet of Krypton, where Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sentences three criminals to banishment.  Jor-El is aware that Krypton is about to be destroyed, but the Kryptonian elders refuse to believe him.  Moments before the planet is destroyed, Jor-El sends his one child, Kal-El, to Earth.<br /><br />Kal-El's spaceship crashes in Smallville, Kansas, where he is adopted by the loving Kent family (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford).  We flash forward to Kal-El - re-named Clark Kent - in his teenage years (played by Jeff East).  After his adopted father's death, Clark travels north, where he discovers the Fortress of Solitude, an enormous ice fortress where the spirit of his deceased father, Jor-El, rests.  After conferencing with his father for a long time, Clark Kent (now played by Christopher Reeve) travels to the city of Metropolis to aid humanity.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It's spectacular.  Director Richard Donner crafts a well-told, adventurous story that held my attention from beginning to end.  Christopher Reeve was an absolutely perfect choice for Superman; the differences between his portrayals of Clark Kent and Superman are truly magnificent.  Gene Hackman is at his best as the cheery, maniacal supervillan Lex Luthor, who is aided by an enjoyably foolish Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine as Mrs. Teschmacher.  Margot Kidder does a great job of showing how head-over-heels Lois Lane is for Superman.  And Marlon Brando is terrific in his nine or so minutes of screen time.<br /><br />Another high point of the film is John Williams' fantastic score.  It's easy to hear why Williams' score is so popular amongst fans of the film.  It's everything the soundtrack to a Superman movie should be.<br /><br />The script, by David & Leslie Newman, Robert Benton, and famous novelist Mario Puzo is, at times, epic.  It's well-written, funny, and it never lets up.  It also remains quite faithful to the comics which the film is based on.<br /><br />I'm mightly glad to have finally seen "Superman".  It's a fantastic film, still ranking amongst the very best superhero films nearly thirty years later.  I can hardly wait for "Superman Returns"!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />THE DVD: I don't normally talk about the DVD in my reviews, but I've got to this time.  This DVD is spectacular.  Along with a bunch of great special features, the film looks amazing - brand new at times!  The Surround mix is really super, although the dialogue sounds a little dull and quiet at times.  "Superman" fans are in for a major treat!</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is the original, and although not the best, it is very much still the comic book super hero film to measure all others that have come since. This movie deserves recognition for the daring to attempt a comic to screen adaptation in the first place and to make a man believably seem to fly. The catchphrase in fact took great pride in the fact that the filmmakers were certain that the audience would be convinced a man could fly. Christopher Reeve, an unknown at the time stepped in the red cape and would forever embody Superman for the generations that would watch this film. Gene Hackman is dead on as Lex Luther and Ned Beatty as his cohort is hilarious. Marlon Brando's brief and multi million dollar appearance does exactly what the producers had hoped and gave this film a very rich, real and strong resonace with the viewer. The story is heartfelt and genuine, the action segments are realistic and exciting. This film defined the very reasons we go to the movies. To this very day i still truly believe that a man can fly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>A great movie from 1978 , about the Marvel comics superhero.

Though not even Superman's sweetheart, Lois Lane (a fresh faced Margo Kidder) knows that Kent is Superman.<br /><br />Anyway it is up to Superman in this adventure to foil the evil plans of the mastermind criminal Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) to destroy California. Generally thrillingly done, with a lighthearted feel through most of it, and it is noteworthy that they play a part of the 1977 hit by Supertramp, `Give a Little Bit'. It was a bit silly though when Superman flew around the Earth several times to reverse time. Couldn't he have just rescued Lois Lane to begin with. Other than that well worth seeing again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Released in 1978, Superman would be the first big buget Hollywood treatment of Superheroes and thus is historically a very important film as it showed studios just how big movies like this could be.  Directed by Richard Donner the movie covers the origins of Superman from the destruction of his planet of krypton to being sent away prior to its destruction to Earth where he would be found by Mr. and Mrs Kent and raised as their own son, Clark.<br /><br />We see Clark as a young man coming to grips with his power, even showing off by racing a train.  With the death of his father (Glen Ford) we cut to an adult Clark going to Metropolis and getting a job with the Daily Planet and meeting Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) Perry White (Jackie Cooper) and eventually his arch-nemesis, lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).<br /><br />Long before the days of computer generated special effects, the geniuses behind Superman really did make us believe a man could fly.  His first appearance as Superman where he catches Lois Lane as she plummets to certain doom, and then catches the crashed helicopter still give me chills when I watch it.<br /><br />Of course the thing that most of us will remember about Superman is its star, the late Christopher Reeve.  The man truly embodied what Superman was.  His fantastic portrayal of the geeky, fumbling Clark contrasted perfectly with his powerful and definitive portrayal as the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Gene Hackman was comically evil as Lex Luthor and was joined by co-horts Ned beatty and Valerie perrine as the film's eye candy.<br /><br />Mario Puzo, known for his best work in the original story of The Godfather, put together a wonderful researched story staying true to the classic comic.  This special edition contains several added scenes not in the original theatrical release featuring several more scenes on Krypton invloving Brando.  The main things about this great DVD are the 3 documentaries hosted by Marc McLure who played Jimmy Olsen in the movies.  They give a fascinating look behind the making of these movies and the problems of casting and pulling off the special effects that they faced.  Also great is the screen tests which feature some of the other actresses who were considered for the part of Lois Lane and a great commentary track by Richard Donner.<br /><br />Really a wonderful and valuable DVD.  It's one I will always keep!  Hopefully we will see a special Edition of Superman 2.  One of the few sequels that were actually better than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Superman is, of course, the best, the sequels were so-so.  Considering it was filmed in 1977, the special effects are still stunning.  The DVD has been given the ultimate restoration in a way that makes the film seem brand new.  The picture is pristine, and the soundtrack - well, where do I begin with how brilliant it is?  The 5.1 remix sound has been carefully done to give the viewer an experience like no other. It's the first DVD older movie I have experienced with exceptional 5.1 sound.  Nothing can quite prepare you for how brilliant it is. Even if you don't really like the film, buy it because the sound effects will blow your mind.  Margot Kidder is great in this film, whereas she became annoying in the other Superman films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TD7B0CT1NHO4.html">A3TD7B0CT1NHO4</a><br/><p>This has to be one of the best in the series.  It's even above the others in the series, due to its being so genuine and true to the original story.  In fact, it goes beyond the original, to where Superman came from.  We see the original planet, with his original parents (with an expensive role from Marlon Brando), and we see the young child learning incredibly as he orbits to Earth.  Then we see the villains get banished (to come back again, of course), and then we see the crash and Superman"s (Clark's Earthly parents) pick him up and call him their own.<p>There is so many good points about this film and when he enters adulthood and meets up with Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, you get the chills, and then there's Perry White.  Where oh where did the original series go to?  This gets better and better.<p>Christopher Reeve found his role in this movie quite well, and to watch him on film, you actually believe, through the magic of the movies, that he can fly.  <p>Gene Hackman, as "Lex Luthor" is another brilliant move, what with his evil henchman look and sarcastic humor, he pulled it off well.<p>A very enjoyable movie, and highly recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this DVD release from start to finsih. There are two version of the movie. Behind the scenes info and background information and the best part for me....<p>The original auditions for the casting of Lois Lane. Many now famous performers auditioned and didn't get the job that Margot Kidder did.<p>Watching the original uncut version with Christopher Reeve at his best was a gem. This DVD is definately worth it for the fans of the man in blue. Learning the insides from the commentary on costumes, sets and props. It was fun. ALso the intractive menus are very cool too. There's even an isolated soundtrack for the musical score by the ever popular John Williams.<p>I watched it several times on the first day!</p></br><a href="../users/A2VUP5US1F5HG5.html">A2VUP5US1F5HG5</a><br/><p>Colorful, exhilirating, and magical, Christopher Reeve's &quot;Superman&quot; is a worthy translation of the first super-hero's never-ending crusade for &quot;truth, justice, and the American way&quot; to the big screen.  My Dad took me to see this when it first came out in the 70s, and the years haven't dimmed this gem one bit.  Reeve, of course, is perfectly cast as the orphan from the stars who will become Earth's greatest hero.  Margot Kidder is a wonderful Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman has a ball as criminal mastermind Lex Luthor.  Marlon Brano's Jor-El lends a powerful authority to the opening scenes on doomed Krypton, and his lingering presence haunts the rest of the movie much as his spirit does Kal-El.  Funny, touching, and suspenseful in exactly the right touches (well, Lois Lane's mid-flight poety recital might be a bit much), &quot;Superman:  The Movie&quot; is for everyone who was ever a kid, and every boy who ever wanted to fly like Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>At last, Superman is presented the way it was meant to be! The master print for the 1978 classic had deteriorated so badly that the film, particularly the white-on-white Krypton opening scenes, was almost unwatchable. (I had even gone so far as to write a critique on Amazon.com demanding a 'Director's Cut' DVD edition, digitally transferred and remastered, be made!)<p>  Somebody was listening! While this isn't a 'Director's Cut' (Donner has said that the version that premiered in 1978 was the version he preferred), the movie has been expanded, to include a couple of brief scenes with Brando, and the famous Superman Gauntlet sequence at Luthor's underground lair (the remaining unused sequences can be seen in the 'Deleted Scenes' Chapter, on Side 2).  <p>Technically, the DVD is fabulous; the Krypton sequences are now clean and sharp, a couple of shots where, previously, color balancing problems had turned Superman's costume green have been corrected, and, best of all, the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and sounds even better than it did in 1978!  <p>Three fabulous documentaries are included on Side 2 about the making of the film, and how the flying effects were achieved. This was an incredibly expensive and difficult film to make (so much so that Donner, after 'Superman' was released to rave reviews, was fired, and replaced by Richard Lester, for 'Superman 2'), and through interviews with Donner, Christopher Reeve (who is honored for his work in the film, and his courage since his crippling accident), Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and several of the creative team, you can appreciate what a unique and wonderful film this is!  <p>Two other 'pluses'; a full-length audio commentary track with Richard Donner, and a 'music only' option, where you can admire one of composer John Williams' greatest scores!  <p>This Special Edition DVD should be an essential part of any film lover's collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The movie:<br /><br />"You'll believe a man can fly." That was the advertising tagline. Well, I can't think of many instances of it, but this was one time when a movie delivered on its hype. "Superman" fires on many cylinders, but the main one, the integral one, was believability. This film is an absolute achievement in terms of tone, style, and effects. For 1978, the effects are terrific, but also the performances and the writing really gel and sell the concept to the audience.<br /><br />We haven't seen yet the actor who can top Christopher Reeve's Superman. The solidness, the goodness radiating from his presence in costume, combined with the vulnerability and sheer hilarity of his Clark Kent are (perhaps) impossible to top. Margot Kidder turns in a feisty Lois Lane, and their chemistry is great. Gene Hackman is a credible Lex Luthor, both funny and menacing at the same time. Supporting players fill out a cast that just really inhabits the world and never feels less than real.<br /><br />The run time of the movie is perhaps a bit flabby, and this edition adds about 3 minute of new material. But I for one am quick to forgive it - it just so captures a feeling of innocence, wonder, Americana, that I'm willing to just bask in it, even when the action slows down.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Well, this is not one of the discs you'll pop in to show off "how great HD looks." The film was shot almost throughout with soft focus filters which bump up the haze of lighting and obscure detail.<br /><br />BUT: It looks as good as it probably ever can and ever will. In A-B comparisons with the previous DVD (which was great for its day) the upgrade is subtle but evident. Some shots show very strong detail, when it's in focus. Check out the foliage in Lois' rooftop apartment. Some facial shots show exceptional detail in fine lines. Whenever the soft filter is absent, you can really tell you're watching an HD presentation. The colors are the main upgrade in the Blu-Ray - reds and blues really pop, and black levels are rock solid in most shots not involving visual effects. Film grain is present and generally not too obtrusive, except during some effects shots. But I prefer its presence to excessive digital noise reduction. In the end, how you feel about this Blu-Ray will depend on your emotions for the film itself (mine are very strongly positive), and how you feel about a home video accurately replicating the look and feel of the original presentation's film stock (something I'm also strongly in favor of).<br /><br />Audio is presented in a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix. There isn't much of a workout for the surrounds, but John Williams' iconic score really sings, nonetheless.<br /><br />Extras include an hour's worth of documentaries, reprises from the DVD edition. Casting tests, trailers, a commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, and a wonderful score only track highlighting the music, round out the disc. Overall, at least average and probably slightly above average.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />I grew up with this film. I'm predisposed to enjoying it. As a Blu-Ray, it is hampered by the stylistic choices of the filmmakers, but still gives us a very good presentation of the film.<br /><br />It's a five star film in my book. It's certainly in the top 5 comic book movies ever made (and was the true pioneer in terms of big budget successes from comic book material.) I considered downgrading this disc by one star simply because it can't overcome the flaws inherent to the source material. For the paltry sum Amazon is asking for it, you really can't go wrong, though. Kids of all ages (ages 3 to 83?) who just want to feel good about the world will be transported to a better, simpler, more beautiful place. Fans of 1970's cinema will find a lot to love, as well. There are many shots which really shine in detail, and almost all of the shots benefit from zippier colors. If you don't own this film otherwise, or are just a fan of the action/comic book genre, this is a must-buy. It's a classic.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>It is about time that this classic gets the full treatment--loaded with extras.  However, if you are also interested in the Superman II special edition, it is more cost effective to get the "The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection - (8-Disc Deluxe Special Edition)" which is currently the same price as buying this set and II, only you get films 3 and 4 too (which is better than paying for them, right?)<br /><br />Also, Amazon has the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II available for pre-order which has the extended version of the film never before available (the special edition will be the theatrical release only).</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>&quot;Superman&quot; recalls a time when adventure movies had their innocence and weren't shameless corporate marketing devices.  This film has the same energy and spirit as the &quot;Batman&quot; movies, but what makes &quot;Superman&quot; a cut above the rest of the other based-on-a-comic movies is that this film has a heart.  Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast as the man of steel who parts from his father (Marlon Brando) and is transported to Earth to fight evil.  Gene Hackman is devilishly good as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder shows spunk and verve as Lois Lane.  The DVD is also an attractive package: although the picture leaves a bit to be desired, the sound is so solid, it looks like it was recorded this year instead of 1978.  Plus, the features are a real treat, including a few featurettes, and the original trailers, which show how long a way we've come in marketing films.  As with all franchises, the Superman films hit a dead end and wore out their welcome, but the original is the first and best.  Recommended for all viewers.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F8R40Z2OMIJM.html">A2F8R40Z2OMIJM</a><br/><p>SUPERMAN THE MOVIE falls into the &quot;they-don't-make-movies-like-that-anymore&quot; category.  It is a hybrid of 60's &quot;epic&quot; movies, 70's all-star-cast disaster flicks, and the late-70's special effects films (like STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS).<p>The DVD looks and sounds wonderful.  The extra's are very interesting - 3 documentaries illuminate the journey from page to screen.  The battles between director Richard Donner and his producers are fascinating.  However, in all fairness, one wishes the Salkinds (or someone on their side) could respond.  <p>There are some very cool early flying effects in the bonus stuff.  The screen tests are hilarious - Stockard Channing as Lois Lane would have been a hoot.  Lesley Anne Warren was an interesting choice as well.  However, when Margot Kidder's screen test appears it is obvious why she was chosen.  In her screen test she had a bad haircut and a 70's hippy dress on.  However, she simply glows with energy and the magic required to help the audience believe a man can fly.  <p>The film has held up well.  It moves from Greek-like Krypton to the Americana of Smallville to the zippy, campy feel of Metropolis.  Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luthor.<p>The re-inserted scenes are fine.  They are really minor additions to this great film.  They only help make it better.  (I'd really like to hear/see more of the SUPERMAN II cut scenes!)<p>SUPERMAN is a super DVD!</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>This movie is the quintessential of superhero movies from 1979 to the present day.  Every superhero movie that has come afterward, from Blade to X-men has tried to obtain the absolute perfection achieved in this movie.  Chis Reeve is incredible as superman, paired against the always excellent Gene Hackmen as his enemy Lex Luthor. <p> If you are one of the few who has never seen this movie what are you waiting for?  Go rent it now!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9FXHC1L66EW.html">A2Z9FXHC1L66EW</a><br/><p>Considering how hard it seems for directors, producers &amp; screenwriters to come up with a decent comic book screen adaptation, Richard Donner and company make it look so easy to do with Superman.  By far the best movie based on a comic book, Superman gives us a wonderful story that's both entertaining and heartwarming as it is loyal to the comic book purists who hate when Hollywood takes their favorite comic book heroes and turns them into something completely different.<p>Christopher Reeve was born to play this role, and to me (and millions of others out there) his Superman is the &quot;Definative Superman&quot; that all others will be judged by.  He's exactly how we perceive Superman to be: Logical, strong, sensitive, enduring, with a heart of gold and so on.  He is also the real reason to see the last two Superman movies.  You can say what you want about the movies themselves, but you can't say that he's not good in them, because he is.  I paticularly enjoyed the added scene in this film after he's saved Lois Lane from falling out of the helicopter (and other assorted tasks) and goes back to the fortress of solitude where he converses with his father (Marlon Brando) of how good it felt and that he couldn't help himself.  Jor-El (Brando) tells him not to be hard on himself, but to be mindful of his vanity, for it was vanity that destroyed the Kryptonians.  Finally, Jor-El tells his son how much he wishes he could hug him and Superman reaches his arms out to him as he disappears.  I really liked that.  He has never (and will never) be able to hug his Dad and there's a true feeling of saddness about this that rings true.  I can't believe scenes like this were cut from the original release, especially the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; sequence when Superman goes underground to hunt for Lex Luthor and gets hit by machine guns, masses amounts of fire, as well as cold freeze before finally reaching the entrance of the evil geniuses secret lair.  Never should've been cut!<p>I learned a lot from this DVD.  I was very shocked to learn that Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind hired Richard Donner to direct Superman &amp; Superman II (as a two picture deal) and then fired him after the first film went on to become a huge success.  Apparantly it was due to creative differences, but I think they made a huge mistake when they fired him.  I'd go so far to say that Superman III &amp; IV would've been hits, had Donner went on to direct the enire series himself.  He would've looked at the script for part III and said, &quot;This is terrible!  Are you trying to destroy the franchise?!&quot;.  A special note to readers: Richard Donner did in fact direct scenes for Superman II, and had it not been for the fact that the original Superman had gone over budget causing part II to be delayed, he may have actually finished the whole thing himself.  What a pity that we'll never get to see what the Donner/Superman Saga would've been like.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4.html">A2ZGVH5DNCK8I4</a><br/><p>Richard Donner's huge and exciting epic on the man of  steel was no doubt an ambitious project for them 23 years  ago.The salkind team gave it life and made one of the best comic to film transfers ever , the very reason why Superman works lies in it's magic and the very charm of it's cast and crew who all struggled to make an authentic film that would  appeal to comic fans as well as mainstream movie goers but  no one could have ever anticipated what Superman would do ,  but it sky rocketed at the box office , having the second  longest box office run in history.Even the director says  that no one could have played the role of the man of steel like Christopher Reeve for the hour and a half that he was  in it he was Superman and the uniform never looked better  on him better than any comic book could show him.<p>  It's cast includes the great Marlon Brando,Christopher Reeve,Margot Kidder,Gene Hackman,Jackie Cooper.The film  starts on the i'll fated Krypton where after a trail with 3 mysterious foes.Kalel played brillantly by Brando has a warning sign that Krypton is in danger,but the counsil  refuses to beleive him fearing the worst he and his wife  prepare to send his only child a son named Jorel to Earth as he sends the starship on his way the planet is self  distructing twords the sun until final distructon.<p>  When the starship lands in Smallville,Kansas he is now introduced to an elderly couple who will be his future  family.The film skips to Clark Kent's teenage years who  is played charmingly by Jeff East but must be embarresingly dubbed by Reeve is the most centimental part of the film  as he tries to cope with having super powers but when he  looses his father he dicovers a crystal and then discovers  where his future lies to the North Pole where he magically makes a fortress of solitude , there he will begin to learn about his past his father and why he is on earth after all  is said and done his father is now ready to give the world his son and we shall know him as SUPERMAN.<p>  In the film we switch scenes yet again to the Daily  Planet in New York where he plays out his secret identity and meets the specal woman that will capture SUPERMANS heart Lois Lane played humeriously by Margot Kidder when an accident happens atop a building when she is sent in  for an assignment , the world will get there first encounter with the man of steel an sets Lois heart afire,the most  romantic scene is a flying scene a memerable one with  Superman and Lois, but just as things are going well for Superman he meets his nemisis Lex Luthor who is played  even more humeriously by Gene Hackman who devises a plan for world domination and gives Superman a taste of his  own planet Kryptonite.Superman delays Luthors plans only to find the Lois is a casulty Supeman brakes the rules to save her and sets the tone for the exciting Superman 2.<p>  Packed with options such as a theatrical trailer and  deleted scenes one of them being Lex Luthor testing Superman in his gauntlet it is humerious.3 documentarys and for the  first time ever Superman in Dolby Digital now you can hear  Jhon Willam's amazing and awsome score in digital sound a  treat even for people that have already seen this movie grab Superman on DVD it is the only way to see this huge and epic classic it spawned 3 sequals the last two are  forgettable while Superman 2 is good companion peice to  the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is one of the best superhero movies of all time. superman is one of the greatest superheros. and christopher reeves plays him very well. and gene hackman as lex luthor was outstanding both actors are great at thier roles. superman is just awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>Thanks to this movie, we now have the 89' Batman movie, and all other comic book movies. After watching this again, this is what a Superman movie should be, I'd give it more stars if I could. The movie opens up with John williams soaring iconic score, and then we come to Krypton, now the original intent was to film a massive Superman movie, kind of like what the salkynds had done with the three musketeers. They wanted it to be really campy too, but Dick donner ruined that, Now it's already been said about the behind the scenes arguing between Donner and the salkinds. Christopher Reeve as Superman, Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Now, he was cut out of Richard Lester's Superman II because the salkinds were cheap and didn't want to pay him, pure and simple. Now, for it being 1978, the effects of this movie stand up pretty well, and I'm sorry, but even the modern movies could take a lesson from this movie. Because I honestly believe that Superman is flying, and it's all done without CGI, the romance between Superman and Lois is believable. Now yes, Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor over the top. But to be fair, Lex Luthor wasn't the evil billionare in the comic books yet. Now some have complained about the whole turning the world back ending, I honestly didn't care. Because that's something that Superman is capable of doing, and it was supposed to be the ending to Superman II, but because the salkinds never told Donner that he was over budget. They wanted him to wrap up Superman The Movie, thus the ending was Taken from the second movie and put in the first. And it works, this movie was ground breaking, and Christopher Reeve is Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>Who didn't know Superman ?<br />I like Superman.<br />So i must have it this edition.<br />A lot bonus insert it .. make me so haappy<br />thanks amazon makes me have this edition<br />get it from my wish list.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>i am a superman kinda person.  the first in the series.

Today, that landmark is right around the corner for this film, and that led me to wonder if it had as much to do with shaping my generation's snapshot of the Man of Steel as the original issues did my grandparents'. The world has changed in a lot of ways since the late seventies, particularly in its fashion sense - many civilians' getups are just as outlandish as Superman's - but despite his squeaky clean image and dated morals, there's still something familiar and relevant about this rendition of the big blue boy scout. He's naive to a fault, but there's no questioning his motivations and it's still refreshing to see a nice guy who doesn't finish last. Christopher Reeve is responsible for the majority of what works, and he buys into the role so completely that it's no surprise he'd be associated with the character for the rest of his life. Gene Hackman is disappointing in his first turn as Lex Luthor, but the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on and the script is impressive given its age. Although the much-maligned ending sequence is a total disaster, the rest of the story does a very good job of balancing a mature, serious tone with the lighter dalliances into fantasy that go hand-in-hand with the character.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2.html">A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2</a><br/><p>This DVD set contains Superman I ONLY but also includes a lot of feature stuff that definitely enhances the film and the actors. For example, the selection of a Superman and of Lois Lane is detailed. After explaining the casting decisions, the process is understood as not so easily accomplished.<br /><br />This film is the story of Superman (Christopher Reeves), from his mother and father's life on Crypton, to growing up as a man on planet Earth, to finally functioning as the super hero we all know. The mild sided Clark Kent works as a newspaperman, providing the opportunity to hear crime news. He meets Lois Lane but has more and more difficulty keeping the identity secret. Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) appears as the super villain and fences off in a spectacular showdown with Superman.<br /><br />In the features, Gene Hackman applauds Christopher Reeves for the decision to take on the role. Once typecast, Mr. Reeves would find it difficult to shake. Many humorous cuts are shown (not seen in the film) with Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeves. This gives the viewer insight into the actors.<br /><br />Similarly, many fine actresses were tried for the part of Lois Lane without success. It's interesting to discover oneself in the part of the casting director searching for the qualities needed in the discovery process.<br /><br />I recommend this four disc set.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the comic book based movie Superman The Movie. This movie starts the franchise with the destruction of Krypton following sending of its last survivor to Earth. From the landing of his ice craft in the fields to his experiences in high school to his moving to Metropolis and working at the Daily Planet, this movies sets the basic history and story of Superman. An all star cast includes: Reeve, Hackman, Brando, Ford, Perine and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. This movie has the sequence with Lane in a long gown going flying with Superman. Once Superman is established as a character, we enter the meat of the movie where Superman fights against Lex Luther (Hackman). Helped by Perine & Beatty's characters, Luther learns to use Kryptonite to neutralize Superman. Then he steals a nuke for purposes of setting off a major Earthquake on the west coast to move "ocean-front property" to the east.<br /><br />A grand movie with sweeping music and visuals, this is a really fun movie and worth watching several times!</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>There were super-hero movies before 1978's Superman, and some of them were pretty ok. Heck, there were even a couple Superman films. None were great. There's been many others since, some of which were pretty ok, some were great, and at least one (The Dark Knight), has completely changed the genre.<br /><br />But the first real genre changer was Superman.<br /><br />The plot for the film is somewhat minimalistic, centering around a first act introducing our character, a second act showing him in Metropolis and a third act thwarting Lex Luthor's evil scheme to... er... get real estate. Ahem. Apparently taking Ted Turner's methods and simply buying most of Wyoming didn't appeal.<br /><br />Needless to say in the real world his plan to drop California into the ocean and create water front property from desert would not work (dropping a nuke on the San Andreas fault would inconvenience anyone nearby for a nanosecond, but it wouldn't start an earthquake. Continental plates are huge). But really, the plot is secondary to the characters, and as embodied by actors such as Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, the characters really come alive, especially Superman/Clark Kent, played by then-unknown actor Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />What can be said about Reeve's performance? In many ways it makes the film. He's entirely convincing as both Superman and Clark Kent. It's hard to be convincing as the hero and the secret identity, as learned by, for example, Brandon Routh in the disastrous Superman Returns, and along with Christian Bale and Toby McGuire, Reeve is one of the few to find the balance needed to play both. Reeve's performance in the film was in fact so iconic that DC Comics began to draw Superman to look more like Christopher Reeve and even now, over a generation since the film came out, Reeve is, and will always be, Superman to many people.<br /><br />The performance is far from the only iconic thing about the film. Remember John Williams' score for the movie? I bet you do. I bet right now the theme is playing through your head. So popular was that music that it was reused for Superman Returns, giving the film at least a few good points amongst the dross. Heck, much as I'm not big on the "can you read my mind?" song, I gotta admit, it sticks with you.<br /><br />The screenplay is also quite sharp and entertaining. To this day if you're around a certain sort of person and say, "Don't worry; I've got you," they'll say back, "You've got me? Who's got you?!" It's also fun to see the level of cynicism displayed by the various people at the Daily Planet over this big, flying Boy Scout. The movie was made in the late 1970's, after all, and the attitudes reflect that.<br /><br />The tagline for the movie was "You'll Believe a Man Can Fly", and you know what? That's pretty damn accurate. The flying effects hold up well even though, though some of the other effects suffer. Now it's quite common to see people on screen flying all over the place, but this was the first movie to really do justice to human flight.<br /><br />The film is not without flaws. As I mentioned, the plot is paper thin, but it gets the job done, and Ned Beatty's character is a needless distraction. Despite that, it's a movie I still watch and enjoy from time-to-time, remembering when I was a little boy, amazed at seeing that a man could fly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>This is truly and sincerely the film that paved the way for all great comic book movies. Up until this film, no one had ever thought of putting a serious adaption of a comic book on the big screen, until WB hired Richard Donner to helm a movie based on the popular comic book hero Superman.<br /><br />It seemed like a daunting task. There were difficulties with casting the part (Clint Eastwood and James Caan, among others, turned the role). However, they finally found the right guy in an unknown. 6'4, 20 something actor named Christopher Reeve. A large group of talented actors as well as composer John Williams and other talented behind the scenes whizzes joined Donner and Reeve, and Superman was ready to fly high.<br /><br />The film begins on the planet Krypton, where its leader Jor - El (Marlon Brando) has learned that the planet is about to be done in. Wanting to leave behind an heir, he sends his son Kal - El to Earth, where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford and an actress whose name I forget). Raised as Clark Kent, he grows up to learn that he has powers far beyond a normal man, and adopts a new persona: Superman. Under his Clark Kent persona, he takes a job at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, where he falls in love with beautiful journalist Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Meanwhile, criminal mastermind Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) is plotting to wipe out the West Coast with twin nuclear missiles, and only Superman can stop him. Can Superman save the day? Watch and find out.<br /><br />This is truly a fantastic film. Reeve will always be Superman. The cast, direction and score are great, and this new special edition has it looking and sounding better than it ever has before.<br /><br />This film is an absolute must have for any dvd collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>I was born in 1976, so I spent most of my developmental years in the wonderful 80's.  Although I was still a bit young when "Superman-The Movie" hit the big screen, I caught up with him through VHS and television.  Plenty have donned the red cape, from George Reeves to Dean Cain and everyone in between.  Brandon Routh, who I have yet to see in the latest film, is the current hero of the day.  Christopher Reeve was, is, and always will be Superman to me.  I don't care how hokey the special effects look in this particular flick or how bad the third and fourth films were, Reeve is the Man of Steel in my opinion.<br /><br />This film gives us the origination story of Kal-El, son of Jor-El, of the planet known as Krypton.  If you've been around for a few years, you probably know the rest of the story, so I'll skip that and just stick with the performances of the actors and actresses.  I've gloated on Reeve enough, but I have to admit that his bungling, country-tinged Clark Kent is perfect.  He does a complete 180 degree turn when he rips open his business suit and that "S" bursts onto the scene.  Lois Lane is done with sassy flair by the great Margot Kidder.  She, much like Reeve, has become her character in my mind.  Gene Hackman hams it up as Superman's arch enemy, Lex Luthor.  His over-the-top performance is fun to watch on the screen.  Ned Beatty portrays the bumbling sidekick, Otis, and Valerie Perrine is a scene stealer as the luscious Eve.  Marlon Brando is sufficient as Kent's father, but his performance comes across as rather wooden.  Terence Stamp (General Zod), Jack O'Halloran (Non), and Maria Schell (Vond-Ah) have sinister small roles in this feature, but set the stage well for "Superman II."  The rest of the cast, primarily reduced to supporting roles, do a wonderful job with what they have to work with.<br /><br />As stated before, the special effects are pretty hokey by today's standards, but they were top-notch in 1978.  They help move the story along at a decent pace without hindering the performers on the screen.<br /><br />This film set a high standard for future comic book-based films.  While many have met, and in some cases surpassed, this standard, "Superman" will always be considered the first of the great modern comic flicks.<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of comic flicks, or anyone who just wants to relive the excitement of seeing ol' Superman fly for the first time!</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Although the majority of fans seem to prefer the sequel this origin movie is still a very entertaining cinematic excursion that had movie audiences lining around the block in 1978, only one year after the STAR WARS phenomenon had redefined the term blockbuster and transformed the movie landscape. In fact it holds up so well, even today, that the upcoming SUPERMAN RETURNS is supposably a part of this franchise, occurring six years after the events of SUPERMAN II and even features Marlon Brando in the theatrical trailer as the voice of Jor-El.<br />With a $55 million budget (which was enormous for its time) this movie eventually raked in almost $300 million world-wide (which even today stands as a quite respectable take.) In addition it featured a knock-out punch by John Williams who went from scoring JAWS to scoring STAR WARS and then onto SUPERMAN (amazing.)<br />Remastered for its 2001 DVD release this movie is a vast improvement on a master print that had deteriorated to such an extent that some sequences were close to unwatchable. This print is clearer and sharper and corrects some previous color balancing problems. It also has a remastered soundtrack that means it sounds the best it has ever since its original 1978 release.<br />As an added bonus it also features about eight minutes of additional footage that effectively doubles Marlon Brando's screen time with new scenes on Krypton and at the Fortress of Solitude. In addition there's more early Clark Kent and disaster footage. Finally rounding out the new scenes is the reinstated Lex Luthor "Gauntlet of Death" sequence which had previously been seen on network television broadcasts. In stark contrast to the ire that added scenes to the STAR WARS movies has drawn from fans, fans of this series seemed largely welcome to the additions here.<br />Where this DVD really shines however is in the special features, which are impressive. First up is a scene specific commentary by Director Richard Donner and scribe Tom Mankiewicz. After writing the first three James Bond movies of the 1970s Mankiewicz was brought onto SUPERMAN to help with the script, however due to certain legal complications he could nopt be credited for the work he did and so was handed the title of Creative Consultant. This is the kind of commentary that I love, it's screen specific and its light and friendly. It's like having Donner and Mankiewicz hanging out in your living room watching this beloved movie of your childhood with you. They share a number of memories on making the movie and its good to see Mankiewicz get his proper recognition.<br />There's also an isolated score audio track that allows the viewer to marvel at the work of Williams.<br />But there's more. The jewel in the crown special feature is the three documentaries that actually act more as three chapters in one larger feature-length documentary. Before the Indiana Jones trilogy came out with its three-hour behind the scenes feature and before the three-hour "Empire of Dreams" documentary for the STAR WARS trilogy DVD release, we have the behind-the-scenes documentaries here that presented the benchmark by which all future DVD releases were judged.<br />Hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen) they feature on-camera interviews with Donner, (the late) Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman and Mankiewicz (among others.) They cover such issues as the making of the film, the failed attempts at making a man fly and the unceremonious firing of Donner who had delivered the producers a smash hit and was already over halfway through the shooting of the sequel. Still, Donner had the last laugh when several years later he got to direct all four movies of the phenomenally successful LETHAL WEAPON movies.<br />More a curiosity as anything else is a separate feature on the Superman, Lois Lane, & Ursa screen tests that include five different actresses vying for the part of Lois Lane.<br />The younger audiences that have grown up watching SMALLVILLE on the WB will no doubt be a little confused by this movie that follows a more conventional storyline than the popular Tom Welling series. I'm probably in the minority when it comes to preferring the incredible Erica Durance as Lois Lane, but Margot Kidder does an admirable job here and Gene Hackman is an interesting choice as Lex Luthor.<br />However, where there is no debate is Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time of casting this movie Reeve embodies the part of Clark Kent and was elevated to even more mythic proportions by the courage with which he tackled his unfortunate accident.<br />Starting with the death of Krypton and ending with Superman saving California, this movie (and its sequel) set a good foundation for SUPERMAN RETURNS and this DVD should find a place of honor on the shelf of every self-respecting DVD collector.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>A wonderful, entertaining movie.  The best ever adaptation of a comic book to film, great special effects, terrific story and phenomenal direction  make this movie something to see.  The opening credits alone are the most  spectacular of any movie made so far.  The special effects hold up rather  well.  Some of the characters are bit over the top.  Clark Kent may be seen  as a little too wimpy, Otis may be too extreme of a doofus, but they are  surrounded by characters who manage to be wholly credible.  Kudos to Mario  Puzo for his script and story (he also worked on Superman II, and his  absence was noticed on III and IV: The Quest for Peace) The only other  possibly superior interpretation of The Man of Steel is the first season of  Lois and Clark. But still, a movie of this much grandeur and spectacle,  which is superior in every way to all of the Batman movies combined (sorry,  Tim.  Love your work, but this movie is better), should be viewed in its  original widescreen format.  Warner Bros. should get off their butts and  give a good digital remastering and widescreen release onto video and/or  DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Remember those PSA commercials?  For example.  I feel so dark inside I feel like I want to cry it's hard to live with a lie (this is a song).  Then the girl goes to her sister and says, "I took your necklace".  I think it was from the church of Latter Day Saints (if I messed that up and your a member, sorry).  No fear Superman is here and he doesn't lie!  He does however live one but there are reasons.<br /><br />What about the PSA about safety in the house and the pot of boiling water with the mean face.  The message was KEEP THOSE POT HANDLES TURNED IN, then the pot had a nice smiley face.  Or the plug that was a dangerous snake.  Superman has you covered he's impervious to heat.  Phew.  I better get a move on cause I'm pretty hungry.  I hanka for a hunka cheese yahoo.  Back to the review.<br /><br />I don't need to go into the plot it's Superman.  Entertainment wise it's a fun ride.  The score is classic, great, and makes me want to leap tall buildings.  The bad guys though and Lex just didn't do it for me.  They're bad guys for the sake of being bad guys, period.  I'll take Doc Ock and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a> personally.<br /><br />Supreman is still in my top three super hero movies and will be tons of viewers number 1.  For me I'll take <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OT6V00">Hellboy (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>] and Spider Man 2, but the movie was still super.<br /><br />For home theater enthusiasts this could go in the reference pile.  Sound wise crank up the beginning and that song, whoo.  Good times.  And the picture quality on this was amazing as far as dvds go.  This dvd was recognized in Sound and Vision some time ago as a reference disc.<br /><br />So remember to eat your greens and have a super day.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>As soon as I heard that Christopher Reeve died the first thing that came to my mind was my favorite scene in "Superman."  This is when Clark Kent has spied Lois Lane dangling from a helicopter atop the "Daily Planet" building, discovers that there are no phone booths in which to change in the modern version of Metropolis, and as he runs across the street he opens his shirt and for the first time we see the big "S" that stands for truth, justice, and the American way.  The second thing I thought about was the director, whose name I forget, who was chastised by a friend for considering Reeve for a serious film since the actor had played Superman.  The director's rejoinder was to stop and consider how hard it is to play an American icon like Superman (if you want more evidence of that consider how hard it is has been to cast the role for the 2006 film "Superman Returns," and that apparently they have settled on actor James Caviezel, who knows a lot about playing a character considered sacred by a lot of people).  Of course, the final thing I thought about with regard to Reeve was that he was never going to benefit from the tireless lobbying he did for spinal cord injury patients ever since he began the most famous quadriplegic on the face of the planet after that horrible equestrian accident in 1995.<br /><br />The tagline for the 1978 film "Superman" was that "You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!" but the impressive thing was that audience were willing to accept a relative unknown in the role of the Man of Steel.  Reeve did not even get top billing; in fact he was billed third behind Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor.  Yet the whole movie hinged on Reeve, not only as the heroic Superman but as the purposefully bumbling Clakr Kent.  Of course it was a put on and with Reeve it was clear, as it would become in the DC comics about "Superman" after this movie came out, that Superman was the real person and Clark Kent the faux identity (I also liked the idea that in addition to the glasses on/off variable Clark and Superman part their hair on opposite sides).<br /><br />Richard Donner filmed "Superman" and a lot of "Superman II" at the same time and at one point it was apparently supposed to be one giant movie (think "The Three Mustketeers" and "The Four Musketeers").  But there is decidedly a sense in which "Superman" is three different films.  The first, taking place on Krypton, is a solemn and almost sacred recreation of the events that led Jor-El to put the infant Kal-El into a spacecraft and send him to Earth to survive the death of Krytpon.  The second, set in Smallville, Kansas, is pure Americana as young Clark Kent (Jeff East) has to deal with the idea that he was literally put on Earth to do something more important than score touchdowns, a lesson imparted by Pa Kent (Glenn Ford, in a wonderful bit part that deserved at least serious Oscar nomination).<br /><br />However, most of the film takes place in Metropolis and has a decidedly comic tone that is different from the first two parts.  Clark Kent is a klutz, Perry White (Jackie Cooper) a blowhard, and Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) cannot spell.  Hackman's Lex Luthor has fun going over the top, playing out his grandiose plans to his dumb and dumber tag team, Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) and Otis (Ned Beatty).  No wonder Reeve's Superman comes out of this one looking so good; he is clearly taking what is going on in this movie far more seriously than anyone else.  The sequence in the film is when Superman follows up his rescue of Lois with a series of heroic deeds that go from saving Air Force One to rescuing a cat up a tree.  Certainly this Superman has more of a sense of humor than his predecessors, although clearly in an All-American sort of way.  The ending is big in a comic book sort of way, but all the larger than life stuff is grounded in the moment when Superman weeps over the body of Lois.<br /><br />Watch "Superman" and "Superman II" again some time to remember how good Reeve was in the role.  But to honor his memory skip the third and fourth "Superman" movies.  If you want more of Reeve then go check out "Someone in Time" (another instance of where his acting ability overcomes the problems of believing you can "think" yourself back in time), "Deathtrap" and "The Remains of the Day."  If you want more of the Superman mythos the first two seasons of "Smallville" are out on DVD, which connects nicely to the second act of this film, while if you catch repeats of "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" you can see the stars finally get uncrossed for the love triangle that was made up of only two people.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>We will miss you, Christopher Reeve, and we will mourn your passing as we would any other noble soul's.  We loved you as Superman, you were perhaps the only actor we would have "bought" in the role, both as dweeby Clark Kent and the chisel-chinned "Man of Steel," and your floating over Metropolis taught us all that if we found the right love we too could fly.  You won America's heart playing the part with all the conviction and vulnerability in the world, and so when your riding accident happened we were there for you too and we cheered on your fight against immobility and pain.<br /><br />You fought against government inertia and inaction, and you made ordinary people aware of the great divide between the able-bodied and the disabled, a divide that doesn't have to exist.  In some ways you were even more splendid a hero in your later years than when you were mightier than a speeding bullet.  Losing you is an event we were none of us prepared for, because I think we were all expecting one day to see you walk again, so titanic were your reserves of heroism and courage.  Alas, that day was not to be, but now you are in the hall of the Valkyries, flying high overhead with the other heroes we have loved and lost.  Sail on, sail on, Superman!</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Most everyone knows the story of Superman, how as a baby his parents sent him off in a rocket to save him from Krypton's destruction.  How he landed on Earth, was raised by great parents, and became Earth's greatest hero.  In 1978, Warner Brothers wanted to bring this iconic hero to the big screen with "Superman: The Movie".  Well audiences of course were curious to see if the movie could pull of the seemingly impossible, and to their surprise Warner Brothers proved to audiences that a man can fly.<br /><br />"Superman: The Movie" is based, of course, on the DC Comic book character of the same name.  "Superman: The Movie" is basically an origin film for the hero, which does an excellent job of adapting the legends origins and presenting them on the big screen.  Included are everyone's favorite characters, Lois, Jimmy, Lex Luthor, and of course Clark Kent/Superman.  Once Clark (Christopher Reeve as Superman/Clark Kent) comes to Metropolis to begin his life as Superman he earns the city's admiration as he saves Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) from a helicopter crash.  At the same time, evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman), is plotting to, of course, take over the world and only Superman can stop him.<br /><br />With great performances from the cast, to great special effects (especially for the time it was made and suprisingly they hold up pretty well today), and brilliant directing by Richard Donner, "Superman: The Movie" proved you can make a comic book film seriously and it will do big money.  "Superman: The Movie" is one of the best comic book adaptations brought to the big screen, kick starting a huge franchise, and setting off a trend that continues to this day.<br /><br />"Superman: The Movie" is rated PG for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>Believe it or not, I didn't catch "Superman" until April, 2004. It's a great flick with a lot of wit, well worthy of its reputation. Although a couple of things are understandably dated -- like the flying sequences and Clark Kent's glasses (which are so BAD they're laughable) -- the movie definitely stands the test of time. In other words, there's no reason to do a remake -- they got it RIGHT the first time.<br /><br />For a good review of "Superman" just breeze through the many fine critiques here at Amazon; for example, "thornhillatthemovies" just below me has a nice, thorough review.<br /><br />The reason I'm writing is to point something out that no other reviewer has mentioned: Lex Luthor's girlfriend, Miss Teschmacher, played by Valerie Perrine, is incredibly voluptuous and gorgeous! Is it just me or has anyone else noticed this? WATCH OUT for the pool scene wherein Ms. Perrine is wearing a green one-piece bathing suit -- her God-given curves are stunning! I caught this scene on TV late one night and it convinced me to buy the flick.<br /><br />Another thing occurred to me while watching the film that few reviewers mention: "Superman" is not just a comic-booky superhero flick, it's a powerful piece of SCI-FI cinema! The outstanding Krypton sequences of the first half hour confirm this. These scenes are highlighted by the magnificence of Marlon Brando, one of my favorite actors, playing Superman's father Jor-El. So, if you're a serious Sci-Fi fan, don't skip "Superman" just because you assume it's some mere superhero movie. No, it's more, much more. In fact, the screenplay was obviously written with absolutely no concern about cost, so MANY are the great F/X sequences. Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>The Man of Steel flys into the spectactular motion picture, Based The DC Comic and also appearing in Action Comics, Christopher Reeve stars as Clark Kent.Reporter in Metropolis,Illnois for the newspaper the Daily Planet,And trouble emerges Clark Kent flys to the rescue as Superman, a blue suited red caped powerful wonder.

I went through the George Reeves series, the Lois & Clark and Superboy/Smallsville series and the cartoon Superman, Justice League and, God help me, even the 70's Superfriends shows. But I've saved for last the piece-de-resistance: the Christopher Reeve classics.<br /><br />I've genuinely forgotten how great and sweet the 1978 Superman film was, and is. A feeling of enchantment is launched in the air as "June 1938" flashes on the screen, then a boy leafs thru the pages of Action comics, the young lad's voiceover commenting on the Depression and the importance of truth-dealing newspapers such as the Daily Planet in so turbulent and troubled an era. Then, the immortal John Williams-crafted Superman theme song is heard and the adventure begins. True, I've always had to grind my teeth and wait out the sterile 25 minute opening. But once the film focuses on Planet Earth and the arrival of baby Kal-El, it's all so good. The segment of Clark's child- and teenhood is depicted in an almost pastoral manner, giving heft to scenes of Clark learning how truly special he is, and how he is ultimately alone. These bittersweet moments of lessons learned will shape the man that Clark will become. Then, the tragedy of his adopted father's death, leading eventually to Clark's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude and thus, his Kryptonian heritage. There is almost a sense of intermission at this point, wherein the viewer can take a breath, relax and prepare for the second half of the film. I think I'll start a new paragraph.<br /><br />Twelve years pass. Clark, now in his Superman guise, flies away from the Fortress of Solitude. The camera cuts next to a cabbie telling his passenger that he's arrived at the Daily Planet, and Clark Kent's new chapter begins. There, he meets Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Editor-in-Chief Perry White. Clark doesn't waste time setting up his bespectacled persona  of cluelessness and clumsiness in several nicely-paced sequences that had moments of sheer hilarity and screwballness. Next, Superman's nemesis shows up, the fiendishly clever and criminal Lex Luthor and things begin to get somewhat serious, though Luthor's wacky sidekicks intermittently interject an element of humor. Luthor's plan is diabolical and ably challenges Superman's abilities. But, in the end, all is well as the Man of Steel foils Luthor's scheme and sends him packing to the hoosegow; Superman has a fleeting romantic moment with Lois. End of film.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve. Despite the all-star cast, Christopher Reeve makes the movie. He inhabits Superman as if he were his favorite pajamas, instilling in his iconic superhero that perfect blend of confidence, steely resolve and gentlemanly decorum. On the other hand, he infuses his Clark Kent with the proper amount of  "aw, shucks" country bumpkin and slouching mild mannerisms. A perfect portrayal. Christopher Reeve was born to be Superman. The reaction of the crowd upon Supe's first public appearance is still thrilling to witness. Lois Lane's freaked-out "You've got me?! But, who's got you?" is still a classic line. Margot Kidder is delicious as reporter Lois Lane:  nosy, plucky and in-your-face. She melts perfectly for Superman and routinely snubs Clark Kent. Go check out the screen test in the special features to see how much better Margot is, compared to the other actresses that went for the role. Gene Hackman plays Luthor more comically than I would've expected but, what the hell, it works. The best I can say of Marlon Brando as Jor-El is that his distinctive voice is used in the trailer of Superman Returns.<br /><br />The special effects, for their time, are wonderfully innovative and wow-inducing. The only effect that doesn't look convincing is the sequence where teenage Clark outruns a train. Everything else, perfection.<br /><br />The special features are pretty sweet: Side A contains an insightful commentary by director Richard Donner; 10 added scenes including a young Lois with her parents on a train and a scene with Jor-El and Superman; some "Superman - The Legacy" fun facts; and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Side B contains: three documentaries ("Taking Flight: the Development of Superman", "Making Superman: Filming the Legend" and "The Magic Behind the Cape"); deleted scenes; screen tests of Superman (Reeve with sweaty pits!), Lois Lane (with actresses Anne Archer, Lesley Ann Warren, Margot Kidder and Stockard Channing) and Ursa, the Kryptonian supervillainess in the sequel; a teaser trailer; and a TV spot.<br /><br />This is a classic film, full of matinee fun and movie magic. It certainly has stood the test of time. Despite the fact that I can't wait to see Superman Returns, I doubt it could live up to Superman 1 or 2. Speaking of which, I think I'll pop in the sequel now.</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>Seeing this sparkling, colorful movie again on DVD is enhanced with all the extra special behind-the-scenes features and is a real smorgasbord for audiences of all ages.

The start is slowed down by way too many details about Krypton's governmental system - you get 25 minutes of Jor-el's debate with other literal luminaries in their silly aluminum-foil costumes - and then a bunch of scenes to define superman's character while a boy (most of these are part of the "director's cut" which while fun can also be a bore).  So the action doesn't begin until about an hour into the film, and my kids had long gotten bored by it and wandered out of the room (and I got it for them).  Even for me, a hard lover of sci-fi, it was boring - so I must warn watchers who are not committed, uncritical fans:  you will probably not enjoy this part.  It is just plain too slow, even static, which means this part is poorly edited.<br /><br />Once the action starts, the film becomes pretty good.  You see pre-computer age effects to show what it wd be like for a man to fly, etc., and you can always enjoy the difference.  While they are limited to pretty silly caricatures, there is no question that the actors are good, expecially the young Reeve in the role that made him a star.  Kidder is also good, in her stunningly beautiful prime, as is Hackman.<br /><br />But we are used to kid-adult films that have become much better than this, like Spiderman, Harry Potter or the Star Wars series.  They speak to both groups of watchers with richer characters, more complex and engaging plots, and slicker effects (that last is not necessarily an asset as you can always recognize computer-generated images).  As such, Superman looks like a prototype for far far better films of the genre.  Indeed, I was surprised at how disappointed I was by the film - and my kids voted with their feet.  I didn't even find the camp aspect funny enough to make me laugh.<br /><br />Tepidly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO.html">A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO</a><br/><p>Chrisopher Reeve stars as the Man of Steel as he tries to save California from a devastating earthquake caused by Lex Luthor.

(I've never seen Smallville yet - probably not a good idea to get started on that one, I've still got loads of others to watch.) People have always said, the first actor you see playing a certain role, will never compare to anyone else. Up until now, I didn't think anyone but Dean Cain could play Superman.<br /><br />How wrong I was. After watching this film (and buying Superman II and Superman Returns), I have to say I love Christopher Reeve as Superman. Not only does he fill the suit rather well, he's hotter than Dean Cain (can't believe I once spent a "Bring Your Daughter To Work Day" trawling the internet at my Dad's work looking for photos of him!), and he brings a whole new dimension to the character of Clark Kent. With Dean, he was just a guy in glasses, with almost exactly the same hair. Christopher turns Clark into a bumbling idiot, who seems to be out of sorts with everything around him, and parts his hair on a different side, whether he's Clark or Superman.<br /><br />I certainly hope the second movie starts with more of a bang than this one did. Just over an hour before we actually get to see Christopher as Superman. I hated the beginning, and really was going to switch it off, but thankfully, I didn't. It was just way too much, and what Marlon Brando got paid was absolutely shocking. He got paid $3.7 million, and as if that wasn't enough, he also got a percentage of the profits for playing Jor-El for 12 (TWELVE) shooting days. The fee (plus the percentage) also covered the sequel, which was being simultaneously shot with the original. He didn't appear in the sequel however, as he was involved in a lawsuit over non-payment of his profit-participation for the original movie. He ultimately received about $14 million for his ten minutes on film. ($14 MILLION).<br /><br />I wasn't keen on Margot Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane. I loved Teri Hatcher's version of the character, but wasn't so keen on this one. She seemed to scream at every opportunity, and certainly played the traditional damsel in distress character, which was very grating. Teri certainly didn't do that - she gave Lois Lane (to put it politely) balls, who didn't need a guy in tights to save her.<br /><br />The film was excellent, and I was shocked at the quality of the CGI, during the flying sequences - but in a good way. I seriously expected the CGI to be worse than it was, particularly for a film made in 1978. I only noticed the CGI a couple of times, but I've seen it a lot worse in other films. I was very impressed, as I was expecting to notice it a lot.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve certainly had talent, and it showed in this. He's so hot too! It's such a shame what has happened since, and it still makes me sad thinking about it. In my opinion, he's definitely the best Superman, and I doubt that will change when I watch Superman Returns. (Although Brandon Routh could have been his twin, they look pretty similar!)<br /><br />Overall, I was really impressed with this film, although I think it could have been better in parts, but Christopher's performance more than makes up for that. I look forward to seeing the second, and then I might make a decision about the third & fourth. But then again, I might just buy it for Christopher. He's definitely hot. Even if he does wear tights, and his underwear on the outside.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>The historical importance of "Superman: The Movie" is indisputable, as a matter of fact, the importance of the character is indisputable. In the 1930s Superman was one of the earliest superheroes that came to life. In the late 1970s "Superman: The Movie" was the first comic-based movie, and ever since those historical landmarks, thousands of superheroes have come to life in the comics, and dozens of comic-based movies have hit the screen.<br /><br /> Well, many years later, Superman (the comic) has lost a lot of its appeal with younger generations, and Superman (the movie) has dated in many areas. The performances are very solid, to be honest, only "Batman (1989)" can compete with "Superman: The Movie" in that area. But the visual effects every year look more and more dated. Obviously, a movie is much more than special effects, the most important thing in a movie is the story.<br /><br /> Well, this movie tells the story of a superhero who can keep secret his identity with thick eyeglasses and changing his hairstyle, of a flying Alien that can reverse the time and events in the Earth by changing the rotation of the Planet. As you can see, the plot is very na?ve, but it's also very entertaining.<br /><br /> The romantic idea of an almost invincible superhero might not be appealing for today's kids, because today's movies present more complex characters, like the X-Men, Batman or Spider-Man, characters that have a dark side (Batman) or represent issues like the social segregation (X-Men), or have an inner struggle between having a normal life or save people that are not thankful (Spider-Man). But to people who are 30+ years old "Superman: The Movie" is pure fun. By The way, "Superman II" is better than this movie because it actually present a vulnerable hero, he is a more complex character in the second movie, his relationship with Lois is deeper, and he faces real danger.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I fondly remember this movie and looked forward to watch it<br /><br />with my 7 year old.  Unfortunately, the added scenes on Krpton<br /><br />drag the movie out waaayy too long(154 minutes!).  Maybe the<br /><br />superman purists find this incredibly interesting, but for kids it's a drag.  Superman doesn't even appear flying in his uniform<br /><br />until about 50 minutes into the movie!  This movie could be awesome for kids if it was cut down to about 1 hr 50 min., as<br /><br />the caped crusader provides an awesome role model for kids (never lies, fights for justice, and respects his parents! haha).  Anyways, it's still a classic worth seeing, just skip<br /><br />the first 30 minutes until the part where the baby/toddler of steel is in space and about to reach earth.  (-:</p></br><a href="../users/A3BFJFJRXMWXAX.html">A3BFJFJRXMWXAX</a><br/><p>For those of you who saw SUPERMAN in the theater, or have seen it since and loved it, this DVD is a must for you.  The only thing we lose here is the big-screen.  But we get so much more; screen-takes, documentaries, etc.  This DVD was produced very nicely, the picture and sound quality are quite good, the dialogue is crisp and the menus were easy to navigate.  Throw in John Williams' awesome score and what is there to complain about!?  The film retains just enough humor (witness interaction between Hackman and Beatty) to remind us that it is after all based on a COMIC BOOK (emphasis added for you detractors...)  How can you not enjoy Lex yelling "MS. TESSMACHER!!!!" or Williams amusing musical cues for Beatty's character?  Chris Reeves now embodies the persevering spirit of a character he played decades ago.  More power to you Chris.  Enjoyable, life-affirming, and classic.<p>Essential.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>What usually happens for me is that if I've been exposed for one particular stage of pop culture for a long period of time, everything else seems kind of "off". Take for instance old country music: my grandparents/parents love it but I can't stand it. So when you take Superman, in which I've watched the animated series and 5 1/2 seasons worth of Smallville, anything else might not have that same luster. Like when I see this Lex Luthor, I always instead imagine Michael Rosenbaum, or Dana Delany doing the voice for Lois Lane. However, it's still a great film that was before my time but came out at the perfect time.<br /><br />In case you've been living on Mars in a deep hole with metal music in your headphones, the story of Superman is the last son of the planet Krypton who arrives on the planet Earth. Capable of incredible powers, he decides to fight for good and stand against those wanting to cause harm or rule the planet, either/or. And so it is with Superman the movie, the same basic story but just up on the big screen.<br /><br />This is a 1970's film so some images look very outdated. Certain flying shots in particular have an obvious pasted look to them but that's ok, since 1) this is the 70's and 2) you just don't care. One fault I did find though: whether it was my DVD player, the film itself but one of the chapters got a little ugly(for me it was the pilots on Air Force One talking about Superman), it got a little pixel-y. However, considering it is an older film, it's quite something to see the film restored.<br /><br />My favorite Lex is probably Clancy Brown from the Animated Series or Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville. Here, Gene Hackman does an admirable job but there wasn't much of a threat there, he just seemed there to give something important to Superman to do. Dana Delany and Erica Durance are probably the hottest Lois Lane's but Margot Kidder is good in the role. Believable without being damsel in distress throughout the whole thing. It's up for debate whether Marlon Brandon earned his 3 million paycheck(some say 10) since he's only in here for under 10 minutes but oh well he looks good as Jor-El. It's funny seeing him mispronounce names though(it's Kryp-TON not Kryptin).<br /><br />And of course we come down to the Man: Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time(much like upcoming Brandon Routh in Superman Returns), he embodies the character, bumbling and nervous as Clark Kent and confident and likable as our main hero. He even makes a scene work when late in the film Superman does a silly time rewind but the anger he displays makes up for it. Even in the lackluster sequels he still brings his A game which is quite something.<br /><br />Da da da DA da, da da da DA da....it's hard not to finish watching Superman and not hum the main theme. It gives the opening credits a nice big epic atmosphere even though the dumb names keep going! It felt like one of the longest opening credits I've ever seen, or at least that's how it felt but the opening theme as well as the rest of the film is especially great from John Williams in a rare non-Spielberg film score.<br /><br />Personally I hate Warner snap cases and this film really should've been on a big 2 disc release instead of a flipper but oh well we get a great film and that's what matters in the end. Now let's see how the new one does.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OI841P5R6FCH.html">A3OI841P5R6FCH</a><br/><p>Man, do I love movies on DVD. How much do I love `em, you ask? Well, it's not just because of the extra features included in the Special Edition presentations. In the case of SUPERMAN The Movie, I decided to make a direct comparison between the DVD and the regular cut VHS edition. I got the disc, rented the tape, and then played both simultaneously on my TV, trying my best to keep them synchronous. I constantly switched back and forth between the VHS and DVD to see exactly which scenes were restored to the Special Edition. Yes, folks, this is my idea of a good time. Sad, isn't it?<br /><br />But, thanks to my little side-by-side comparison, I was blown away by the amazing differences between the picture & sound qualities of the two formats of the first flick I ever saw in a theater. I was able to hear all of those subtle little background noises that are harder- if not impossible- to perceive on VHS. The tinkling of broken glass and the upheaval of Krypton's crust following the movies' opening credits is a wonderful example of the DVD's excellent sound variety & clarity. Of course, it also helps when the folks who released the DVD edition decided to enhance the sound as well!<br /><br />Another great benefit of the superior audio is a better-sounding musical score. The opening titles theme is by far my all-time favorite piece of John Williams-composed movie music. No previous or subsequent Superman movie or TV show soundtrack score has even come close to capturing the essence of the character like Williams did for this movie. Ofttimes I'll watch the opening credits sequence several times in a row just so I can listen! There's even a music-only track where you can just kick back and play the DVD pretty much like it was a soundtrack CD!<br /><br />The picture quality, aside from having a bit of a solarized glow during dissolves, was way sharper that its VHS counterpart. It was so sharp, in fact, I could see the matte borders around Kal-El's geode-cradle space ship-thingy as it flew through the psychedelic cosmos, as well as other limitations of the special effects of that era that were somewhat hidden in the muddier magnetic media. Hmm... perhaps having superior picture clarity isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh? Still, it's kinda cool to look back at the FX of the times and see how far things have advanced since then. Even director Richard Donner gets a bit nostalgic about the "good ol' days" of special effects on the commentary track. He also points out a few less-than-magic moments that he and co-commentator Tom Mankiewitz (sp?) get a bit of a laugh out of.<br /><br />Then there are the new scenes, many of which passed by without me noticing much o a difference. It's likely due to the fact that I kinda remember them, since many of these bits were restored to the network TV broadcasts of the movie back in the 80s. One weird extra smidge of footage was the Kryptonian Council sending an enforcer to stop Jor-El from launching his sons' ship. Strangely enough, this little moment was never followed up; the enforcer was never seen again, save a brief appearance at the beginning of SUPERMAN II. Another cool addition is Superman running through Luthor's gauntlet of bullets, flames, and frost on his way to the criminal genius's lair (in the commentary track, Donner and Mankiewitz discussed the debate they had about whether or not they should have left the gauntlet scene in the theatrical release; they considered it too much of a "the-audience-already-knows-about-Supes'-invulnerability-so-why-repeat-ourselves?" thing, and ultimately dropped it). My favorite new moment, however, was an extension of the scene where young Clark Kent outruns the express train running through Smallville. This addition is one of those strange co-inky-dink-twist-of-fate-type moments that classic superhero books seem to have in spades. There's even a couple deleted scenes that weren't reincorporated into the movie involving Miss Teschmacher and Luthors' "babies". Fortunately, no footage was shot that made references to Ned Beatty's (Otis) performance in 'Deliverance.' Speakin' of Otis: the interplay between Hackman and Beatty's characters added a great touch of lighthearted humor to counterbalance Luthor's scary scheme to... well, let's just say it involves Luthor's obsession with real estate.<br /><br />Included in the bonus features section (aside from the stuff I've already brought up) is a three-part "making of" documentary hosted by Marc "Jimmy Olsen" McClure, a teaser trailer, and a couple screen tests featuring a laughably skinny Christopher Reeve in the Big Blue togs before he got himself beefed up for the flick (in the commentary track, Donner mentions that Reeve's personal trainer was David Prowse, better known as the guy inside the Darth Vader suit) . While I've been a bit jaded by DVD bonus features and extras lately, a few of them were almost as entertaining as the movie itself! The part where Richard Donner was confident that Reeve would walk again was kinda sad, however...<br /><br />Before I wind this review up, I'll leave you with a totally useless and time-wasting activity for you to perform while watching this film. There's a not-so-magic moment where you can see director Richard Donner's reflection on a pane of glass! He also has an intentional cameo later on in the movie. His brief performance isn't exactly Hitchcockian or Tarantino-esque, but I think he makes out okay. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (he points out both moments) while you're looking! Happy hunting!<br /><br />`Late<br /><br />UPDATE 7/20/2006: Ya might wanna hold off on buying this particular edition `til `round Thanksgiving 2006. I've a sneaking suspicion that Warner will be rereleasing this movie as well as all the other ones in super-mega-tricked-out special editions to coincide with the DVD release of "Superman Returns." Hey, they did the same thing with the "Batman" movies when they put "Batman Begins" on DVD; I wouldn't put it past the Warner guys to do it with the Supes flicks, as well...<br /><br />`Later</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>This is not a knock of Superman, the Movie. Richard Donner's take on the the Man of Steel is a bit overlong, but is terrific, and features a wonderful cast, particularly young Christopher Reeve, who gives Superman a dignity not seen since George Reeves portrayed him, in the 1950s.<p>The  special effects are, for the most part, exceptional, particularly when you  consider that the digital technology we enjoy today was nonexistant in  1978. (It's for this very reason that George Lucas 'remade' Star Wars; we  can enjoy 'miracles' on screen today, thanks to the advancements of the  last few years.) The flying sequences have an airy poetry that had never  been seen in any live action 'Superman' prior to this film.<p>The problem  in S:TM lies in the quality of the master that the video transfers are  being made from. It has aged, and deteriorated considerably over the last  22 years. What compounds the problem is that the 'Krypton' sequence opening  the film was shot 'white on white', which shows the flaws and cracks on the  acetate master worse than any other color combination.<p>This is a  suggestion to Warner Bros...Create a remastered, cleaned-up original,  featuring the deleted scenes (which were aired when the movie was  'expanded' for its first television run), all the trailers, include the  'Making of' documentary, hosted by Reeves, that aired when the film was  first released, add in an audio track with commentary by Donner, Reeve, and  Hackman (getting Brando to participate is too much to hope for!), include  an 'audio only' track of John Williams' fabulous score. Those of us who love this film  (and there are a LOT of us!) would shell out the money for this truly  'special' presentation, and future generations would be able to see  'Superman' the way he was MEANT to be seen!</p></br><a href="../users/A3VQSFORKH8B7O.html">A3VQSFORKH8B7O</a><br/><p>Many superhero/comic-book films have come to fruition since 1978, but "Superman: The Movie" still reigns as the best film of the genre. The characters from the legendary comic book come to life thanks to superb performances by a stellar cast. Christopher Reeve is still the "definitive" Superman, emphasizing his strengths while showing a bit of emotion (And not overdoing the drama, unlike Tobey Maguire in the "Spider-Whimp"...I'm sorry, "Spider-Man" movies), and his Clarke Kent is very humorous. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford give great supporting roles that compliment Reeve brilliantly.<br /><br />Clever writing and superb directing by Richard Donner ("The Omen") enhance the film, and the great visual effects make you believe a man can fly. "Superman: The Movie" is a grand motion picture that has withstood the test of time. No matter how many superhero/comic-book films come along, this will remain the standard to which all films will strive to be, and fail. A must for "Superman" and comic-book fans!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>Originally released in 1978, this first film in the series, directed by Richard Donner, became, and still is, the blue print for the perfect superhero/comic book movie. All future movies of it's kind should be so good. Unfortunatley, most of them haven't been. Save a few. This original film was the "origin" of Superman and Clark Kent. Telling it from the beginning. Basically, here is the story. On the planet of Krypton, about to meet it's end, Jor-El and his wife Lara, send their baby son Kal-El to earth in a small spaceship. Ot crash lands in the small farming town of Smallville, Kansas. The little boy is picked up by local couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent(Glen Ford, Phyllis Thaxter). Right off the bat, the little boy showed super powers. Flash forward several years, and young Clark(as they named him, and played by Jeff East for these scenes), is leaving home. Read to go out on his own and find out who he is and his true calling. Once he makes it to Metropolis, Christopher Reeve steps into the role. He gets a job as a reporter for The Daily Planet, under the employment of Rough and grumy Perry White(The great Jackie Cooper). Soon, Clark is accquainted with feisty reporter Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), and boyishly wholesome photographer, Jimmy Olsen(Marc McClure). Gene Hackman plays millionaire madman, Lex Luthor. With the help of his sidekicks Otis(Ned Beatty), and Miss Tesmacher(Valerie Perrine), Lex plans on taking over the world, unless Superman can stop him. Ned Beatty and Valerine Perrine donate some comedic relief to the proceedings as Lex's team. This is a real high class production. The performances are well done and fleshed out, and carry the film to the grand adventure that it is. Reeve was a virtual unknown at the time, and was only 26 I believe. He did a phenomenal job his first time out, brillaintly creating two seperate people in one, with Superman and Clark. He was wonderful. Hackman is a pro, and he chews the scenery with scene stealing bravado, owning every frame he is in. Kidder was perfectly cast as Lois Lane. She had that right sense of perkiness, determination, and strength, that makes the character endearing. Cooper is a delight with his portrayal of Perry, and McClure brings the right level of 'ah shucks' to his bow tied photographer. One cannot exclude Marlon Brando, who was paid millions for his few days(and few minutes)of work on the film. The script is expertly written by Mario Puzo("The Godfather"). It is such a well structured script that tells the beginning, and origin, of the legend, and is incredibly tight. Richard Donner's direction was flawless. He captures every scene and makes every moment count. There are numerous scenes here etched in fans' heads, and lines as well, and that makes for a rather unforgettable adventure. There are also some nice little cameos in the movie. The original Superman, Kirk Alyn, plays Lois' father early in the movie when they are on a train, and the original TV lois, Noel Neil, plays her mom. Now, with Bryan Singer doing "Superman Returns" for 2006, with Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois, and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, he has a lot to live up too. With Spacey being cast, it's already on the right track. The best superhero movie of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>The late Christopher Reeve skyrocketed to super stardom, launching a new genre of movies along the way, as "The Man Of Steel" in 1978's "Superman". Sadly, Reeve passed away October 10, 2004 from heart failure after suffering either a heart attack, slipping into a coma from which he would never awaken. The movie itself is classic: Oscar winners Marlon Brando ("The Godfather", "Apocalypse Now", etc) and Gene Hackman ("The French Connection", "The Poseidon Adventure", etc.) shared top billing for this movie, with Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, though he had appered in bit parts in movies like "Midway", coming in third. The strategy worked like a charm, because not only did he closely resemble the hero of the comic strip, but also because he played the part perfectly. The special effects were flawless (the film won an Oscar for Special Achievement in Visual Effects), proving that a man CAN fly. Marlon Brando was paid $10 million for 10 minutes of screen time (he appeared in the beginning as Jor-El, Superman's real father). Gene Hackman proved he could play a cartoonish villain after violent roles in films like "The French Connection". Glen Ford ("Blackboard Jungle", Midway", etc) appears in a small role as Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father. Terence Stamp and the other two who played the Krypton renegades on trial at the beginning would appear in "Superman II". Margot Kidder, who played Superman's love interest, Lois Lane, did a wonderful job, becoming one of Christopher Reeve's closest friends, both on/off screen. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty provide comic relief along with Hackman (as Lex Luthor, who would go on to appear in "Superman II" and "Superman IV") as his henchmen Otis and Miss Tessmaucher (who becomes good at the movie's climax.) John Willaims' score is irrevocably classic, identifying itself immeadiately as the main theme from "Superman", adding it to his scores from the six "STAR WARS" movies ("Episode III" to be released in theaters next summer), "Indiana Jones" and "Jurassic Park" movies, among others. Richard Donner ("The Omen", "Lethal Weapon" quadrilogy, "Ladyhawke", etc.) provides 8 minutes not seen in theaters, which enhance the film's exposition and moves ahead with the action. Also, the sound has been remixed and the widescreen format allows you to experience the picture the way the director wanted it. I have no idea why the two scenes that show up under 'deleted scenes' were cut from the film. The 2nd one would've been better if it had been restored into the picture, because it gives us an idea of the cruel way Lex wanted to punish Miss Tessmaucher. But, its showing up on DVD is okay.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Superman and Lois are flying over New York City, that is just beautiful. Although the film is based on a cartoon character, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5 years of age, though there might be some who'll enjoy the movie, no matter what. It would be nothing less than an insult to Christopher Reeve's memory to make "Superman V". The majority of people consider Christopher Reeve to be the only person who could play Superman. Memo to Warner Bros.: If you persist in making "Superman V", it'll be the biggest mistake you've ever done, because "Superman" is one of your most popular film franchises (not only yours, but in the history of movies, there has never been such a thing as a movie franchise, like the "James Bond 007" or "STAR WARS" movies that haven't gotten A TON of hype prior to its wide release). It'll be a DISASTER for you, unless you make it (if you persist on it), do what Blake Edwards did for "Trail Of The Pink Panther": put Lois Lane (Margot Kidder, of course) to remeniscence about Superman/Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve, showing up only in shots from the four films) before he was killed by kryptonite, making it a montage of footage from all four movies, releasing it in theaters nationwide. That would be,in my opnion, the best option if you want this franchise to end with a bang. Or, if you're thinking of continuing the series (bad idea unless you want the franchise to stink after four successful movies), you could put Dean Cain (TV's "Lois And Clark" and "Clubhouse", airing on CBS) in the role instead of another actor and release it straight to video/DVD. Do that, I think it'll go a lot better or don't make it at all. Why did the MPAA say that this movie had sensuality, even making it 'mild sensuality'? There was no sensuality in this movie and the 'mild language' was only one 'damn', one  'hell' and one 'a--'. Nothing worth mentioning. Same thing with "STAR WARS Episode IV", the 'brief mild language' only consisted of two 'damn's and one 'hell'. No big deal. Also, the packaging for this movie could've been better, instead of those cheap cardboard boxes. Rated PG for peril.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>This is the absolute best &quot;Superman&quot; film of all time because you get to see how it all started. You get to see Superman's father, Jor-El (played by an astonishing Marlon Brando), and you also get to see how his earlier life had been before he wore the red cape and blue. And no one could ask for a better Superman than Christopher Reeve. Reeve just blows the competition out of the water as the Man of Steel. Also, &quot;Superman&quot; has some comic relief from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Ned Beatty as his bumbling sidekick, Otis. But also, this film has a soft side when Superman falls for Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). This is the ultimate Superman movie for years to come, with action, romance, laughs, and a great storyline, this movie has it all. And the top-notch directing from Richard Donner (before &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) has never been better. Also the special features on the DVD are outstanding!! Especially the screen tests, trailers, and the deleted scenes. I urge anyone out there to OWN THIS FILM, whether it's on DVD or VHS, own it! Like I said, this IS the best Superman film to date, there will be no other film like this.</p></br><a href="../users/A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ.html">A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ</a><br/><p>What Star Wars did for science fiction and fantasy films, Superman did for comic book films. In fact, Christopher Nolan (director of Batman Begins) frequently credits Superman with how to do comic book films correctly.  He wanted his own film to be on that level.<br /><br /> I was seven-years-old when I went and watched the movie.  As a young kid, I was a huge fan of the old Adventures of Superman, and ignorantly, that's what I thought I was going to see: a movie with all the characters from the television show.  I still recall walking out of the theater absolutely dumbfounded by such a fantastic film that made Superman come alive.  It was the flying scenes that captivated me.  It looked so real to me, especially compared to the dated effects of the television show.<br /><br />Thankfully, an unknown actor, Christopher Reeve, was chosen to play the part.  In the extra features Richard Donner cites that Reeve immersed himself in the part and even made his body move in such a way that you felt he was flying, even though he was strapped into a harness.<br /><br />As I've stated in my Smallville reviews, the thing that makes Superman so compelling is that Clark Kent is his disguise, and Superman is who he really is.  Most heroes have it the other way around.  Reeve also recognized that to pull off a realistic disguise, he'd have to act much differently as Clark Kent.  Crediting Cary Grant as the man he borrowed his "nerdy" persona, Reeve successfully creates two separate identities.  It's believable that nobody would ever suspect the nerdy, bumbling, and clumsy Clark Kent was being the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Other performances in this film are very good.  Gene Hackman is great as Lex Luthor, even though he decided to give Luthor a decidedly humorous spin.  I still like Michael Rosenbaum's depiction the best from Smallville, but these are two different eras.  Ned Beatty is hilarious as Luthor's bumbling henchman, Otis.<br /><br />It's also great to see Jackie Cooper after all of these years (from the Our Gang) to take on the role of Perry White.  He's great in the role as well, giving White a fiesty side.<br /><br />Margot Kidder also does a good job as Lois Lane.  I had to admit that she was a pleasant surprise.  Considering the women she beat out for the role such as Lesly Ann-Warren and Cindy Williams, it speaks highly to her interpretation of the character.<br /><br />It's nearly an hour before Superman finally shows up, but when he does, it's a scene that even by today's standards still takes your breath away as he flies up to catch the falling Lois Lane with one hand and then catching the helicopter in the other.<br /><br />You simply can't mention the greatness of this film without talking about the timeless music of John Williams.  The opening credits that start with one of Williams' signature pieces simply speaks to the power and grandeur of this cinematic masterpiece.  Donner still recalls vividly of being literally speechless and feeling the hairs on his body stand up when he first heard John Williams' rendition.<br /><br />If you're going to do a comic book movie, you have to know the character.  Unfortunately, most people who attempt to do comic book films don't know the character, and the characters are only shadows of who they truly are.  The first four Batman films are a testament to this.  Sam Raimi is an avid Spider-Man reader, and Christopher Nolan has also been a Batman reader for quite some time.  Richard Donner also immersed himself in the world of Superman to make sure that he made a film that stayed true to the character.<br /><br />Superman is the hero that all other heroes are compared to.  There is no other hero who retains such a mystique and grandeur of goodness and justice.  Unlike Batman who is driven by vengeance or even Spider-Man who is driven by guilt and responibility, Superman is driven by a sense of trying to make the world as a whole a better place.<br /><br />Superman transcends the comic book world to be an American hero as well, as he embodies all the things that we, as Americans, hold nearest and dearest to ourselves.  This film gives us that Superman.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>Watching 1978's SUPERMAN again after all these years, I'm picking up on symbolism I missed when I saw the film as a kid.  Superman is sent to earth by a white-haired, white-dressed glowing Marlon Brando.  He grows up in humble surroundings.  At 18, he leaves home to go to a desolate location to find himself.  "Twelve years later," which makes him 30-years-old when he announces himself to the world as a super man.<br />(As Perry White rants, the reporter who gets his first interview will get the most important story since "God talked to Moses").<br />Little touches, I know, but I thought it was interesting to notice now.<br /><br />Actually, what I always remembered was Gene Hackman's funny performance as Lex Luthor.  The two lines my friends still quote are:<br />"It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to move those legs."<br />And, "You were followed again...in spite of those cat-like reflexes."<br />The special effects may look dated and the romance part is a bit much for a comicbook movie, but Hackman is hilarious and Luthor's "real estate" plot is the most inspired criminal enterprise since Auric Goldfinger tried to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox.<br /><br />The extras are great.  Watching the various actresses doing screen tests, you can see how Margot Kidder really nailed the role.  The others were good but the chemistry is there with Reeve and Kidder.<br /><br />Although it's probably lost on young people today, I loved the shot of Clark Kent running up to a phone booth and looking annoyed at the half-booth (anyone born since this movie came out would not remember that phone booths were once big enough for a man to change clothes in).</p></br><a href="../users/A356HRZZFCEGL1.html">A356HRZZFCEGL1</a><br/><p>Boy, how can I write an original review of "Superman: The Movie"?  Just about everyone knows about this guy: where he's from, what he can do, what makes him tick.  If somehow you don't know, "Superman: The Movie" will spell it out for you. I guess the best I can do is focus upon how our love and need for "Superheroes" is stronger than our urge to insult them.<br /><br />Of all the things in the world to satirize, you would think superheroes would be among the easiest.  Come on, vain, self-important, overconfident, naive jerks wearing colored underwear running around getting into trouble while fighting bad people and stopping bad things from happening (and all without getting paid)?  What a joke!  And yet, in my opinion, when movie directors take a satirical approach to a superhero movie, they usually turn out an unmemorable, unsuccessful product.  Why?  I think it's because, deep down, we want to believe in and respect superheroes and their admirably unselfish goal to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This is why "Superman: The Movie" (hereafter STM) got it right.  Especially in our cynical times, it is sort of tempting to make merciless fun of a near-perfect demigod who really does care for all people and fights ceaselessly to protect them.  STM does not.  Yeah, it needles some aspects of the Superman mythos (e.g. telephone booths you can't fit into, Clark not even feeling the collision of a taxi that gets damaged, Lex Luthor's elaborate real estate plot, Lex Luthor's inept henchman Otis), but it does so with gentle kidding.  Instead, STM takes the time to introduce Superman from the beginning, from his origins on Krypton to his interactions with the Daily Planet staff and especially his offbeat romance with the flinty, independent Lois Lane.  We learn more about Superman than just the "Super" part - his wonderful powers, abilities, and weaknesses.  We learn about the "man" part too - his values, his objectives, his hopes, his fears,and his kind, courageous heart.<br /><br />Superman has been called the "Man of Steel", but he has also been called "The Man of Tomorrow", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures.  I think STM acknowledges this, and hints that all the action, special effects, adventure, and battles of any superhero movie are meaningless unless we respect and believe in the "S" - not just Superman, but also the "S" we all potentially have underneath.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>There have been remakes that have stood up to their original sources. Scarface is one that comes to Mind. The 10 Commandments. Lolita to name a few. Then there are some films that are so legendary, so iconic, that to even suggest remaking them verges on sacrilege.The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Scarface, Citizen Kane, etc. I'd put the original Superman in this group. I think there are roles that certain actors were born to play, that they completely and positively own, that are them and, to this moviephile, Christopher Reeves didn't play Superman, he WAS and still IS Superman and any 3D cgi reincarnation of the role is doomed to invite comparisons to Reeves and will fall miserably short.<br /><br />For anyone whose been in a coma the past 30 or so years, the film lays out the origin of the son of Krypton, his escape from his own dying planet to Earth where he's raised by his adoptive parents as Clark Kent, his awakening to his powers and his destiny, and his role conflict expressed through his infatuation of a female colleague at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane, and his greater responsibility to protect the human race. Reeves perfectly embodies the contradiction of his two personas. As Clark Kent, reporter at the Daily Planet, he's modest, unassuming, weak (he needs glasses to see properly), and he, like everyone else, envies his alter ego who's the complete opposite. But even so, when you see Clark, the wholesome farmboy who sends half his check to his elderly mother, you see Superman and vise versa. Clark embodies what all of us, who've been blessed with superior abilities should be like: humble, generous, deflecting praise, using our powers to help others--Reeves embodied this principle and wasn't just another pretty boy with muscles. I don't think anyone else has or can pull off the Man of Steel with the same charisma and charm and life Reeves channeled into this character. When the Dark Knight dropped, I jumped the gun like everyone else and said that it was the best superhero movie ever made. But then I remembered this wonderful magical film and its star Reeves, Margot Kidder (hang in there, babe), Gene Hackman, John William's rousing score, and I quickly revised my ranking of the Dark Knight: it is the 3rd best superhero film ever made. This film, Superman, and its sequel, are the best Superhero films ever made thanks to a man who was even more of a Superman in real life. Rip, Chris.</p></br></body></html>

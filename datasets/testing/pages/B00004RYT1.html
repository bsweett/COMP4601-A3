Released in 1960, the master's most macarbe film was seen by audiences as tasteless and vulgar, now, 42 years later, it's seen as one of the great lessons in suspense. As Hitchcock himself once put it, "The trick is to pull the rug out from people's feet". Indeed, in what other film before or after do we see the supposed leading lady get killed 20 minutes through? Throughout the film, themes of fear, paranoia and horror are all displayed to maximum effect. Benard Herrman's terrific score is perhaps one of the most memorable film scores ever composed. Imitated to death, the notorious "shower scene" with sharp violin strings and high percussion culminates in one of the most amazing sequences ever put onto film. Other nice touches include the introduction of "mother", Arbogast's demise, and a hinting to Hitchcock's next film, THE BIRDS. Forget the sequels and Gus Van Sant's dismal remake. PSYCHO is one of the greats.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>For those who have been living on another planet, Psycho is the granddaddy of all slasher/psychological thrillers, and still the best. Janet Leigh plays Marion, a small-time thief who checks into the wrong motel for the night. It is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), an odd young man who really loves his mother. It seems Mother doesn't like Marion, and Janet's character is dispatched in the first reel. More mayhem follows until we discover the secret of the old Bates house.<br /><br />Much of the film takes place in the very scary house, with its dark, empty rooms, long starcase, and creepy cellar. The movie is spine-tingling and shocking. Those who saw it in the theatres on its first run were overwhelmed by the violence, and many still can't take a shower without locking the bathroom door.  The soundtrack was completely original at the time, and was the prototype of terrifying mood music. If you want thrills, Psycho is the movie for you. The acting and script are outstanding. The movie is in black and white, but I think that makes it even better.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young woman who is given a good sum of money to take to the bank so a customer can purchase a home, while on the way to the bank suddenly greed takes over and a chance to start a new life appeals greatly to Ms. Crane so she decides to take off in her car with the money. She purchases a new car, has a banter with a sheriff who stops her on a road, then Marion decides to stop for the night at a hotel, The Bates Motel. This is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is well troubled shall we say, even after a dinner with Norman Marion still stays the night and this is where the famous shower murder scene occurs and Marion meets her untimely end. The rest of the movie has a private detective search for Marion (only to meet his own sad end) and Marion's sister (Vera Miles) decides to also look for answers.<br /><br />Director Alfred Hitchcock truly made a great classic here, while it was made in 1960 it does still old up today thanks to Hitchcock's style and ability to show both creepiness and care when it comes to his actors. Perkins is absolutely fantastic as Bates, Leigh does well as Crane and the rest of the performances are also quite good. The shower scene was fantastically done as Hitchcock took special care to make sure no nudity or knife wounds were shown, just did the cuts and shots so well to make sure it still chilled you without being violent.<br /><br />What's great about "Psycho" is you can appreciate how Hitchcock was able to play on a lot of people's fears and how there no bad action goes unpunished (hence the greed of Marion sadly leading to her end in the hotel). Also Alfred turned the horror/suspense franchise into an art with this film that few have ever been able to recapture. The build-up and conclusion are also very well done and its one of the few movies I can pull out of my collection and watch, just to enjoy some good classic film making. **** out of 4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 12/02, 6/06, 5/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />6/06: Psycho is an art unto itself. The film is purely Hitchcock and the quintessential Hitchcock picture. Nothing ranks a greater thrill, suspense, or paradox of a film noir than Psycho. Understandably, Psycho scared a lot of people. It's best to see Psycho with another person, if you can. The prime difference between Psycho and The Exorcist is breeding from technique for suspense. While The Exorcist may seem slightly overdone and macabre, Psycho is rather done much subtly with care in a restrained way. That is what makes Psycho so scary, not too abaxial when compared to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Easily ranks Hitchcock's best, Psycho is one of the handful best films and one of the most important in cinema history. It's hard to think of Hitchcock without thinking of Psycho. I am gravely disappointed that the Academy Award failed to nominate Anthony Perkins for the Best Actor, let alone a win. Anthony Perkins will forever be known as Norman Bates. Oh man, Anthony Perkins was flawless in his performance....truly a tour de force. He was simply the catalyst of Psycho. The movie worked because of him. It also worked because of Alfred Hitchcock. How could he not win the award for Best Director? After forty-six years, Psycho ranks probably top two scariest films, top five most thrilling films, top fifteen best movies, and top ten film noir made. Psycho is all Hitchcock and all brilliance. There are too many beautiful shots and several landmark scenes. Without question, Psycho is a phenomenal film.<br /><br />5/11: Alfred Hitchcock gets pissed off when he loses the title Master of Suspense to Henri-Georges Clouzot after Les Diaboliques gets made, so what does he do? Go on and make a film that would become world-wide famous. Of course, fifty-one years later, Psycho is a timeless horror classic. Anyone can see it and be still frightened by the results. It's not so gruesome as it appears, but rather it is adroitly filmed enough to produce shock waves. That's why the film becomes so good for it. And that's why Alfred Hitchcock is regarded as one of the most brilliantly technical directors ever. Once again, and very shocking, Anthony Perkins never won the Oscar for his masterpiece of acting. All in all, Psycho is the film to see and best to be done so in the dark.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Now playing on cable TV, this 1960 thriller is one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films of all time.  I saw it in a theater when it was first released and I will never forget its impact.  And seeing it again, 50 years later, it is still just as mesmerizing, even though, this time round, I was well aware of the plot.  It's rare a film can still be called a masterpiece after so many years.<br /><br />Janet Leigh sure was beautiful.  And we first meet her wearing a bra and half-slip in a motel with her lover, played by John Gavin.  They can't marry because he still has to pay alimony to his former wife.  This is an obstacle that seems impossible to bridge.  However, all of a sudden she's thrust into a situation where she has a chance to steal $40,000 from her employer and flee to her lover across the state line.  She's paranoid about the police and even trades her car in for another model at a used car dealer.  The audience identifies with her.  We expect her to be in the film all the way through.  But that is not the case after she meets Anthony Perkins at the Bates Motel.<br /><br />He's cast as an awkward young man who tries to please.  But there's something weird about him and his relationship with his mother.  And soon there is a unexpected murder that will be etched in the minds of moviegoers forever.<br /><br />Now the mystery really begins as Janet Leigh's sister, Vera Miles, starts to search for her with the help of a private investigator played by Martin Balsam..  The plot thickens.  So does the mystery of Norman Bates' mother.  There is not a wasted word in the dialogue.  And, even though I knew the ending, I was at the edge of my seat admiring the skill of all those who put this film together.<br /><br />With the exception of a over-explanation by a psychiatrist at the end of the film, this is an outstanding and disturbing work of art.  Don't miss it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>From the opening credits to "The End", this is one of the creepiest films ever created. It's a stunning achievement from film master, Alfred Hitchcock. It's all so picture perfect: the silence, the music, the paranoia, everything. Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh give outstanding performances, and the plot twist at the end is absolutely horrifying. This is a horror classic that should never have been remade.<br /><br />A+</p></br><a href="../users/A2P2JXU9JEYNV3.html">A2P2JXU9JEYNV3</a><br/><p>Anthony Perkins always feared that he would be typecast because of the popularity of this film. His filmography reads like an actor who did just about everything. Drama, horror, sci-fi, western, thriller, comedy, there wasn't much that he hadn't done. For most people, however, he will be forever known for his role as Norman Bates in "Psycho".<br /><br />The film really needs no introduction, as it has been in the public domain for almost fifty years. This is for the small minority who, for some reason, have not seen it yet.<br /><br />The film is essentially about an almost painfully repressed young man who runs a dilapidated motel just off a deserted highway. A woman stops at the Bates Motel one dark, rainy night, and makes an impression on Norman, the young man who runs it. Unfortunately, Norman's Mother does not approve of ANY woman who would come between her and her son.<br />A number of murders take place, and a relative of the woman comes to see for herself what may have happened to her sister. The woman's boyfriend is also curious as to what may have happened, as well.<br />As things turn out, Poor Norman is implicated, and the rest is history.<br /><br />The real story behind "Psycho" comes from a novel written by Robert Bloch, who in turn, got inspiration from the story of Ed Gein, a man who not only killed people in his small Wisconsin town, but made household items from the skin and bones of his victims. There was also talk of his being a cannibal, as well. He was in the final stages of completing a full body suit, made from the skin of a number of his victims, when he was caught (this also served as the inspiration for the character of "Buffalo Bill" in "Silence of the Lambs"). He died in an insane asylum in 1984.<br /><br />"Psycho" is the most popular and beloved of all of Alfred Hitchcock's films. In it's day, it shocked a great many people. It serves as a model of how to make a horror film, and has also served as an inspiration for Gus Van Sant to lens a remake (which was an absolute bomb at the Box Office). There have been studies (I'm not kidding) of how Hitchcock filmed "Psycho", from camera angles, to cutting (editing), to lighting and panning the camera for a certain effect.<br />If you happen to be reading this, and have NOT seen this film, boy, are you in for a treat! If you HAVE already seen it, may I entreat you to see it again, as Classics such as this one never get old!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>Made with a paltry 1960 budget of 1 million and his TV show crew, Hitchcock shows independent filmgoers how to scare people and get great performances. Again, as in all his work, Hitchcock brings together wonderful set designers and locates the perfect locales.  He shoots most of it on a sound stage, but you'd never know it. The Bates Motel is really the first slasher movie set and Janet Leigh, a good-girl-bad-girl, is carved by wild-eyed Tony Perkins.<br /><br />We feel sorry for poor Ms. Leigh, but weirdly, Perkins's character is actually well spoken and sympathetic, a fellow that cares deeply about his poor old mum. The shrink explains the whole thing at the end with lots of 1950's psycho-babble.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Psycho is the ultimate horror movie. It allows viewers to use their imaginations. Our imaginations will make the killings a lot worse, than if Alfred Hitchcock were to show us what happened. With awesome camera angles that add to the horrific effect and draw us in, Psycho hits the top 100 list with a bang. If you liked the plot of obsession, sex, and violence in Hitchcock's second greatest film, I must recommend everyone see Hitchcock's GREATEST film of all time: VERTIGO. Jimmy Stewart Rocks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>By now, the storyline of 1960's PSYCHO and all of its once-surprising plot elements are well known, but the film nonetheless continues to frighten audiences and thereby maintains its reputation as a masterful bloodcurdling thriller. That's largely because of the skills and sensibilities of auteur Alfred Hitchcock, specifically his deftness at manipulating audience expectation.  <p>Hitchcock deliberately gives PSYCHO the look of a cheap B-movie exploitation flick by filming it in black-and-white and employing not his usual cinematic crew, but instead the crew from his popular TV show ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS.  As for the plot, he sets up the Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) story as if it will be further developed and continue to the conclusion of the film.  When Marion steals a large sum of untraceable cash from her employer and then drives off with plans to meet her lover in another town and start a new life, the film is obviously a straight-forward heist drama, right?  Well, just when the audience thinks it knows where this plot is heading, a deranged killer gets thrown into the mix. Suddenly the film's timbre changes and the story abruptly shifts direction, thereby disrupting viewer expectation and, in turn, invoking tension and apprehension in the audience members. And of course, this primes the audience emotionally for the unexpected scares yet to come.  &quot;I was directing the VIEWERS,&quot; Hitchcock once told fellow director Fran?ois Truffaut. &quot;You might say I was PLAYING them...like an organ.&quot;<p>PSYCHO was based on Robert Bloch's popular pulp novel, which itself was inspired by the exploits of Wisconsin killer and ghoul Ed Gein.  After Hitchcock purchased the film rights from Bloch, he engaged the services of screenwriter Joseph Stefano--who would later develop and work on the classic 1960s TV genre series THE OUTER LIMITS--to adapt the novel to the screen.  Stefano's screenplay was relatively faithful to the source material, with two notable exceptions: middle-aged, balding Norman Bates was transformed into a handsome younger man; and the murder of Marion in the shower, described in the novel as one swift thrust of a butcher knife, was expanded into a major scene in which the young woman's body is violated by multiple knife thrusts that allude to the action of a rape.<p>Speaking of that infamous shower scene, the relatively short sequence took nearly 7 days to film and required over 70 camera setups and 90 editing cuts. Since red appears nearly black when filmed in black-and-white, copious amounts of chocolate syrup was effectively substituted for blood.  The sound FX for the stabs involved the shoving of a knife into a ripe melon, a technique that went on to become the standard for future slasher flicks.  And layered on top of it all was Bernard Herrmann's shrieking violin-heavy musical score.  The final result is extremely effective, and few cinematic sequences before or since can dole out the visceral wallop that this scene delivers.<p>As with many of Hitchcock's films, PSYCHO was groundbreaking cinema.  When that knife pierced that shower curtain and continued right on through to lovely Marion, horror was yanked from the realm of supernatural fantasy and firmly grounded in real-world possibility.  The monster was now the human mind.  Friendly, good-looking young men like Norman Bates could have nasty skeletons bursting forth from their psychological closets, and no longer was it a guarantee that the protagonist would survive all the way to the closing credits.<p>The Collector's Edition DVD from Universal studios is a digital treasure trove.  The transfer of the film itself, though offered in non-anamorphic letterbox widescreen, is clean and crisp, with pristine continuous-tone grays and dark, rich blacks.  Included in the delightful supplements is a 94-minute making-of documentary, the original 6-minute theatrical trailer in which Hitchcock himself takes viewers on a tour of the Bates Motel, newsreel footage, and much more.  This disc belongs in the collection of any horror fan or film aficionado.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot.  More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words.  This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.<p>Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars.  Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel.  And there, as the DVD production notes gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.<p>The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well.  Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece.  Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.<p>Much of the film's success is in its detail.  Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it.  The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.<p>There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about.  But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.<p>This DVD largely restores PSYCHO to its original form.  Although the first few minutes of the print show wear and tear, for the most part it is remarkably pristine and (after years of pan and scan television broadcasts) is returned to its original ratio.  While there is no audio commentary track, the DVD package includes the original trailer with Alfred Hitchcock, extensive production notes, and an extremely impressive documentary that includes numerous interviews, newsreel footage, production photographs, storyboards, and the like.  Even if you have the film on VHS, you'll likely want to purchase the DVD.  Strongly recommended.<p>GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>Hitch said it's "...an exquisite murder with a touch of the bizarre..."<br /><br />So...You may never want to take a shower(alone) again as "Mother" Bates  goes on a psychotic killing spree in "Psycho", the mother of all fright flicks! It stars Anthony Perkins(who "wouldn't hurt a fly"), Janet Leigh and Vera Miles.<br /><br />It's a film that has scared us silly for over 45 years now, and even though we already know what's coming, we still feel our hearts racing, everytime we hear that familiar music to murder by, and then jump when that shower curtain gets pulled back.<br /><br />You know it's one that you can watch over and over, so without further ado about the film(there are many great reviews here, speaking to the story and the wonderful performances), here's a look at the DVD.<br /><br />Universal has made a beautiful transfer of this classic and cherished work. The black and white images are crisp, sharp. The special features include a documnetary, introduced by Hitch, that runs the length of a feature film itself, and even has it's own chapter stops. It has everything you wanted to know about the making of and more! The sound, both dialouge and the wonderfully eerie music is good,in Dolby Dig 2.0 Mono (the score alone probably would be great in at least stereo, though). Languages are English (with captions if needed) and French, and there are subtitles in Spanish as well.<br /><br />Looking for Hitch?

Let's add a second gasp... GASP!!! Squared.<br /><br />This is one of the finest home-video transfers I've ever seen. It beggars description. It's subjectively perfect -- not one scratch, piece o' dust, or blemish of any kind. And it appears that little or no edge enhancement or grain reduction has been used, a problem with too many Universal transfers. (Slight grain is visible when standing near the screen.) I assume the transfer was made from the composite negative, but no information is given.<br /><br />Even more importantly, "Psycho" /looks/ quite different. I have never been so aware of how beautifully detailed and near-palpable the image is. Hitch couldn't have seen it better on the set. And the detail doesn't hide the fact that "Psycho" is not an example of "lush" B&W cinematography. I wouldn't call it "clinical", but -- /except/ where appropriate -- it has a matter-of-fact quality that fits the subject matter. More than ever, one is aware of the contrast between the plainness of "the outside world" and the "decorative fussiness" of Mrs Bates' home and furnishings.<br /><br />Watching it on a 60" plasma display, I felt I was sitting about 2/3 back in the theater, seeing "Psycho" with the sort of detail and clarity one /never/ sees in a theater. (I saw it "new" 50 years ago, and there is no comparison.)<br /><br />As for the film... One critic said that American films could be divided into "pre-Psycho" and "post-Psycho". "Psycho" is one of the most-influential films ever made, and was one of the first (if not the first) in a string of standards-stretching films that would bring an end to the Production Code eight years later and its replacement by the current ratings system. The hyprocisy of the Hayes Office was shown by allowing Marion and Sam to engage in sex without the benefit of marriage -- which didn't matter, because less than an hour later, she was punished for it. Nor did the Vegamatic scene seem to bother the censors. They were more worried about the toilet in the bathroom, which appears to be the first time a sanitary appliance was shown in an American film. "Psycho" received its Production Code Seal, and American parents actually took their kids to see it (as mine did). (Though "Psycho" was at one time rated GM (PG), it is now correctly rated R.)<br /><br />There were dissenters, of course. "The American Fascist Review", which, even in 1960, had long been complaining about the lewdness and immorality of American films, nearly went Postal over "Psycho" -- though I have to admit that its complaint about parents taking their children to this film had /some/ justification.<br /><br />Hitchcock was a master at getting the audience to identify with characters we're not /supposed/ to identify with. You /feel/ Marian's guilt about stealing the money, and when her car stops sinking in the swamp (to intentionally comic sound effects), you /want/ it to continue sinking so that Norman's mother won't be hauled away by the police. NO ONE has ever manipulated an audience the way Hitchcock does -- he saw it as the basic thing a director "does" -- so is it any wonder he's still called The Master? We /know/ Hitch is manipulating us -- and we love it.<br /><br />It really needs to be driven home that "Psycho" set a standard that hasn't been surpassed. Most (though not all, of course) post-"Psycho" attempts at making suspense and horror films are pathetic.<br /><br />A /lot/ has to be said about Anthony Perkins' performance, which simultaneously cemented and ruined his career. It's another one of those "Why didn't he get an Oscar nomination?" performances that litter Hollywood's history. He manages to be simultaneously frightening and pathetic, and believeably fluctuates between the normal and the weird. It's vastly superior to Anthony Hopkins' turn as Hannibal Lecter, which is a largely one-note performance that nevertheless won Hopkins an Oscar. Seeing this magnificent transfer on a large display makes it easier to appreciate the subtleties of Perkins' and Leigh's performances.<br /><br />I could spend a whole review on just Bernard Herrmann's music. Unlike most modern scores, it's not a continual background drone. Herrmann put music where /he/ thought it was needed, so it plays an important role in establishing mood and character. Note (no pun intended) how effectively the music mirrors Marian's turmoil when she's packing to leave -- she hasn't quite made up her mind whether to steal the money -- and when she's driving.<br /><br />Though Herrmann generally steered clear of the string section (his scores tend to focus on the brass and woodwinds), this, his most-famous score, is /all/ strings -- "a B&W sound for a B&W movie", as he said. It's rare these days for a score to even remotely approach the quality of a Herrmann score -- composers seem deathly afraid of writing anything that might attract the viewer's attention. Hitchcock attributed 1/3 of the film's success to the score, but this compliment runs both ways -- Hitchock /gave/ Herrmann a film he could write highly effective music for. When William Friedkin told Herrmann he wanted "a score as good as Psycho's" for "The Exorcist", Bennie, in his inimitably blunt manner, said "Give me a /film/ as good as Psycho".<br /><br />An absolute necessity for any Blu-ray collection, in a transfer that -- for once -- matches the quality of the film.<br /><br />PS: Let's get this straight, once and for all... "Peeping Tom" is /not/ a "British 'Psycho'". It's a piece of Emetic Cheeseburger &lt;stuff> (you can't use the C word in Amazon reviews) that doesn't come within light years of "Psycho". There, I said it. Take /that/, Martin Scorsese.</p></br><a href="../users/AL4MKKO24563R.html">AL4MKKO24563R</a><br/><p>This film was listed 18th on the American Film Institute's 100greatest films of all time and I still think it was underrated. Fromthe memorable performances by Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam to the spooky black and white cinematography to Bernard Herrmann's often imitated but never duplicated score, Psycho is about as close to perfect as a film can get. The only possible way this movie could be improved would be to somehow replace the overacted hysterical performance by Vera Miles as Lila Crane with that of Julianne Moore -- the ONLY thing better about the remake. By the way, those of you who actually think Gus Van Sandt's remake is better than Hitch's original need psychiatric care more than Norman Bates. Those of you who are fans of the original and do not have a DVD player should plunk down $300 and buy one so you can see this DVD edition. It's spectacular! Besides the usual biographies on the cast and crew, theatrical trailers, and still photos, this DVD edition contains many more valuable nuggets like the inclusion of a version of the shower scene without music. This enables the viewer to both hear the sound effects more clearly and to appreciate what an enormous contribution Bernard Herrmann's great score made to Psycho. The documentary, likewise, is not just another boring rehash of facts everyone knows, but an extremely informative record of the film with dozens of fascinating interviews with, among others, Janet Leigh, Hilton Green, Joseph Stefano and Patricia Hitchcock. In addition, the DVD includes great still photos as well as Psycho posters from both the U.S. and foreign releases. The DVD edition even includes Saul Bass' original storyboards for the shower scene (for those of you who are wondering, Janet Leigh, in the documentary, states rather emphatically that Hitchcock, and not Saul Bass, directed the shower scene). In short, if you are a fan of this great movie, you must get the DVD version -- you're missing out on so much with just the VHS tape. Finally, to all those people who gave Psycho a negative review, no one is saying that Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Halloween, etc.  are not great horror films, but NONE of the them would have been made without Psycho! George Romero has stated very clearly that the final scene in Night of the Living Dead is an homage to the fruit cellar sequence in Psycho. Stephen King, one of the greatest horror writers of all time, has stated numerous times that Psycho is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest horror films of all time. Perhaps the thing that galls me the most, however, are the reviews that state that Psycho is not scary because it doesn't reach the level of gore seen in modern horror films. That's simply disgusting! You don't have to have eyeballs being ripped out, brains being splattered on walls and guts being spilled all over the floor to make a great horror film! Alfred Hitchcock had the great intelligence to realize that you did not need to stick the camera inside someone's guts to frighten. Not once in the course of Psycho do you actually see the knife penetrate flesh. Instead of splattering us with gore, Hitchcock leaves enough to the imagination to let our minds fill in the missing details.  It's sad that so many movie fans these days are so desensitized to graphic violence and so lacking in imagination that they have to have gore spilling all over their screen in order to be scared. Thankfully positive reviews of this film seem to outnumber the negative reviews by a wide margin. Alfred Hitchcock was a genius -- one of the greatest, if not THE greatest director of all time -- and nowhere is that genius more evident than in Psycho.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GB1Q193DNFGR.html">A1GB1Q193DNFGR</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 gothic horror classic changed the way filmmakers viewed their occupation and enhanced film audiences expectations as far as what the movives could do. Before Psycho, Hollywood was in the dying days  of the age of sentiment. Hollywood produced pictures that were sentimenal,  emotional, and concerned about showcasing the human condition. Psycho with  the savagry of Mother Bates butcher knife hacked through Hollywood  sentiment and created the age of sensation. 60's movies such as Bonnie and  Clyde, the Birds, Rosemary's Baby, Midnight Cowboy, Butch Cassady and the  Sundance Kid, and the Wild Bunch are among many examples of how sixties  filmmakers became liberated due to Hichcock's magnificant diffance of  convential film guidelines with Psycho. As for the film's structure,  musical accompaniment, direction, film editing, and acting performances,  the film masterfully excels at all levels and is one of the important films  in the last 100 years. The grandaddy of the modern horror movie and the  inspiration for modern screen violence, Psycho is still a one of a kind  Hitchcock masterwork. The DVD is exemplemary edition to your DVD or video  collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Hitchcock's Psycho shocked filmgoers in many ways -- he had the sympathetic lead killed early in the movie, a gruesome (though nearly bloodless) murder scene, strong symbolism (look at all the 'bird' images in the film), a return to stark black & white filming accompanied by Bernard Herrmann's strings-only soundtrack, and sophisticated marketing. Hitch was always a bit ahead of his time, and this is one of his pictures that really makes that point.<p>This DVD edition looks and sounds great, and has many bonus features: the excellent one-and-a-half hour documentary, 'The Making of Psycho', which includes interviews with Hitchcock's daughter and leading lady Janet Leigh; a small but interesting set of production notes; information about the cast and filmmakers; theatrical and re-release trailers and newsreel footage of the film's release; the shower scene with and without music -- this was very interesting. There were also some bonus features that I couldn't get to run on my G4 Macintosh: production and behind-the-scenes photos; shower scene storyboards; lobby cards; posters and ads. The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are in English or Spanish.<p>This is a landmark film. It looks and sounds good. The bonus features are very good. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's Classic, From it being purposely shot in black and white and on a low-budget,to Janet Leigh's performance and her early demise in the movie,To How Creepy Norman Bates is played by Anthony Perkins,the movie is a Classic and one of the creepiest.</p></br><a href="../users/A244CRJ2QSVLZ4.html">A244CRJ2QSVLZ4</a><br/><p>How I envy those who saw "Psycho" when it was originally released in the theatres in 1960.  How shocking it must have been for them to learn the true identity of the serial killer.  To this day, "Psycho" continues to frighten even the most jaded of horror fans.  It has influenced directors around the world for decades.  It established the blueprint of what would later be called the "slasher flick."  It gave birth to countess imitations throughout the sixties such as "Dementia 13" and "Paranoiac."  Three sequels were made.  Despite it being a low budget production, it earned millions at the box office.  It is no wonder that my favorite web site for historical horror, The Terror Trap, lists "Psycho" in its top ten horror movies of all time.  It is a masterpiece of gothic horror.<br /><br />  Having the world famous director, Alfred Hitchcock, didn't hurt "Psycho."  Theatre patrons saw it for that reason alone.  Let's not forget that it also boasted a beautiful cast that included Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.  "Psycho" "Norman Bates," and "Bates Motel" became household terms.  They became the fodder of innumerable jokes and cartoons throughout the media world.  One of my favorite Far Side cartoons is the one where Norman Bates introduces Elvis to his mother.  The caption reads somewhat:  "What really happened to Elvis."  Only in Far Side could two legends be brought together.  In the hit comedy, "National Lampoon's Family Vacation," Chevy Chase pretends to stab his wife in the shower in "Psycho"-style fashion.<br /><br />  It was "Psycho" that made me fear large, abandoned houses, especially on Halloween night.  At the same time, I was also drawn to them with a perverse, morbid curiosity.  Numerous haunted houses at amusement parks were designed to be replicas of that old, decaying, fog enshrouded house on the hill.<br /><br />  The characters in "Psycho" feel trapped.  Many of us feel that we are trapped in worlds that are not of our own design.  How many times have you wanted to quit your job, withdraw all your money from the bank, and flee?  Just run and keep on running?  I know I've wanted to escape from the tedium of a nine to five job.  Poor Marion does just that.  She steals $40,000 (a small fortune in 1960) and runs to her lover.  Unfortunately, she never makes it to him because she meets Norman Bates who is also trapped in his own world.  He can not leave his overbearing, dominant mother.  How many of us are trapped in loveless, abusive relationships?<br /><br />  Who can forget the creepy music that accompanied each killing?  And the world famous shower scene that was imitated in countless movies?  Instead of a shower stall, it is an elevator that Brian De Palma uses in his slasher film "Dressed To Kill," starring Angie Dickinson and Michael Caine.  Even the Italians imitated the shower scene in their world famous gialli (murder mystery).  A young girl is stabbed to death in the shower in Sergio Martino's "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh."  Also, a girl is stabbed to death in an elevator in "The Case of the Bloody Iris."<br /><br />  "Psycho" is recommended viewing for all horror fans.  It is the granddaddy of slasher fare.  Other groundbreaking horror movies include:  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Halloween," "Friday 13th," "Suspiria," "Rosemary's Baby," "The Omen," "Black Christmas," "Carrie," and "The Exorcist."  They all belong in the collection of anyone who loves good horror fare.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>It is a better idea to buy this movie from Amazon than to rent it from Netflix.  I made the wrong choice.  I received a version that wouldn't play the first few times I tried, then finally played, and stopped dead 5 minutes from the end.  Gee, I wonder how it ends!<br /><br />This is a masterfully crafted murder mystery.  I am an iconoclast, and this is an icon, so I could be expected to criticize it and give it a poor rating.  No, this one deserves the best.<br /><br />It is more than just a scary shower scene.  The story is strong.  It's not simply a horror flick.  And if it is the first time you're seeing it, there are some great surprises in store.  If it is not the first time you're seeing it, you will remember it for life.  Somehow I have trouble believing that anyone still hasn't seen Psycho, and that anyone doesn't know what is really up at the Bates Motel.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>When I watched this on TCM, I knew this was a classic. But it did not make me one bit scared of the shower. If you really want to see something that will make you nervous of the shower, watch Friday The 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>Some movies we still talk about even though they where relesed over 50 years ago for example Gone with the wind, Ben-Hur, It's a wonderfull life and some others and then there is Psycho. The mother of all horror films is still the best of them all. The first real slasher flick and shock movie to be relesed. Everything about the movie is good the story, the excellent direction, the acting and the great score. The movie should of won best picture, director for Hitchcock, acting for Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. A great film that is still great to this day.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock was a true genius in terms of making a good thriller or horror film, and he invented the slasher genre for many filmmakers to follow. PSYCHO is the ultimate testament to that, and along with THE BIRDS, established Hitchcock as a true visionary with the movies.<br /><br />Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane (with such gusto too!), a woman unhappy with her job at a real-estate establishment. But when a man comes in with a bunch of money to invest, Marion suddenly develops other ideas on her way to the bank and decides to run with the money, ultimately changing the outcome of her life. She runs into the police, but nothing happens and she heads to the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates (played perfectly by Anthony Perkins) and is completely unaware of his evil nature.<br /><br />One of the most shocking happenings of the movie is the killing of Marion only 30 minutes into the movie, something no bold filmmaker (except Hitchcock) would dare do. The rest of the movie unravels the madness of Norman's world and the madness of his mother, and you'll find not what you're expecting. The end shot of the film of Norman's face features a creepy on shot of a superimposed skull and it will leave chills on you.<br /><br />When Hitchcock made PSYCHO he made sure that all the theater owners closed the doors after the movie started to make it an enormously successful device, and it worked. PSYCHO is not only a masterpiece, but a lesson that sometimes the person next to you might not be who you think they are. Definitely a must-own, a must-buy, and a must-see!</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>When I think of Alfred Hitchcock's timeless masterpiece "Psycho", I think of a movie that is very close to my heart...a movie which spawned so many imitators paying homage to it as the father of all slasher-horror movies (not necessarily the scariest as "Halloween" is number ONE in my opinion, but "Psycho" is a very close second for sure), but none quite able to imitate its individual "charm", grace and unique mixture of style, substance and theatrical structure.  "Psycho" is a model of horror cinema on so many levels: slasher horror, psychological terror, the unconscious mind, the unknown, madness, multiple personality disorder and evil...also, "Pscyho" is the ultimate "suspense thriller" of all-time.  Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh provide equally brilliant performances in Hitchcock's ultimate masterpiece called "Psycho".<br /><br />The movie starts with Marion Crane and her boyfriend together in a motel during the afternoon on an ordinary day in Phoenix, Arizona.  What started to be a drama would turn into oh so much more by the middle part of this movie.  Marion and her boyfriend named Sam Lumus who are struggling with financial issues and problems of morality regarding their "respectability" as a couple (incidentally, the name Sam Lumus intentionally borrowed by John Carpenter who named Michael Myers' psychiatrist after Hitchcock's Sam Lumus of "Psycho").<br /><br />Marion Crane is unhappy with her current status with Sam and decides to make a rash decision and actually steals $40,000 and runs off with it to meet her boyfriend in California.  Well, our imperfect protagonist begins to feel paranoid and her conscious bothers her to some degree.  Here, Hitchcock is setting the stage for what appears to be a drama where the focus is on Marion Crane, her boyfriend and the money that she has stolen.  The audience has no clue what is in store for them...there is absolutely no indication that the movie is anything but a drama about these two lovers and their personal struggle to attain a satisfactory life together.<br /><br />Crane drives on through a rain and all the while, Hitchcock brilliantly allows the audience to empathize with Crane by providing a look into Crane's state of mind as she is driving away from her problems.  The audience experiences Marion Crane's present thoughts as she acts and thinks.  Still, there is no indication of what is ahead.  Late at night and driving into a torrential downpour, Marion Crane decides it is time to pull over for the night.  She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets a energetic and seemingly nice young man named Norman Bates, whom perhaps is a little too friendly if anything negative can be said for the young man.  The two have dinner together in parlor of the motel where much of the topic of conversation revolves around Norman's sick and rather maltempered old mother.<br /><br />As they talk in a truly great scene, Marion along with the audience discovers Norman's obvious "sensitivity" about the issue of his mother's condition.  The house that Norman and his mother live in is absolutely horrifying in appearance and this is magnified through the black and white picture presented by Hitchcock.<br /><br />Along with Herrmann's eerie score, Hitchcock begins to paint a picture of something darker than just a sad couple with money problems and a young lady stealing some money.  Hitchcock brilliantly leads the unsuspecting audience along with the present mental impressions and thoughts of Marion Crane as she deals with her problems and the audience settles into drama mode, but the movie's focus changes and it is Hitchcock's magnificent use of "misdirection" that creates such strong elements of shock and horror as the audience's focus violently and abruptly changes from the personal problems of Marion Crane into a dark, disturbing and horrorfying murder mystery.<br /><br />I cannot imagine that anyone has not yet seen this brilliant movie, but in the event that you have not, I will not spoil it for you.  What will become of Marion Crane and will the authorities catch up with her and bring her to justice for stealing $40,000?  And what about Sam Lumus?  How does he figure into this puzzule?  And what about the peculiar Norman Bates and his mysterious ill-tempered old mother?  Suffice it to say that Hitchcock is the master of theatrical "misdirection" and while the focus of the audience is clearly on Marion Crane and her personal affairs, that is not what this movie is about...something darker and far more terrifying is afoot in this masterpiece of cinematic horror.  Hitchcock's "misdirection" is absolutely mesmorizingly brilliant and this aspect only amplifies the horror that will suddenly befall the audience as the movie calmly progresses to its moments of sheer terror.  Like a Picasso or Michaelangelo painting, the mood, atmosphere, musical score and setting of Psycho presents a picture of absolute beauty that is sure to inspire horror, shock and despair in the audience with one chilling scene after another.<br /><br />The shower scene in "Psycho" IS STILL to this very day unrivaled as the ultimate scene of cinematic terror which is so incredibly terrifying that nothing else even comes close to its horrifying shock and awe value.  The audience never fully recovers from this terrifying event as it comes so unexpectedly making it all the more terrifying for the audience to digest.  Can you imagine what it would be like watching this in a movie theatre for the first time in 1960?  To be overwhelmed in the dark and magnificent world of Hitchcock while watching "Psycho" is the only reasonable effect upon the viewer.  And yet, even after the infamous "shower scene" which still gets me to this day, Hitchcock is not done with horrifying the audience with his incredible shocking conclusion in this movie.<br /><br />To call this movie a horror movie is an understatment...indeed, "Psycho" is a horror movie but it is also so much more...it is the quintessential and ultimate psychological suspense thriller and with its heavy dose of sheer horror, "Psycho" creates one of the greatest viewing experiences of all-time, not just for horror movies, but of any movie.  The terror of psycho never lets up even after the movie is over...the audience has to go home and take a shower sooner or later although maybe they will put it off for a few days after seeing this movie.<br /><br />Another incredible aspect to this movie is that it is so believable and realistic...there is not one thing in this movie that could not happen in real life and in a sense, these types of things have and are happening as I write this review.  This factor of realism adds even more to the timeless horror this movie has to offer.<br /><br />"Psycho" is Alfred Hitchcock's unquestioned masterpiece and is a must own for all horror movie fans like myself...the movie just never gets old and the scenes of horror in this movie stay with you for a long time and the horror of "the shower scene" will never ever leave you and will always be the most terrifying scene of all-time.  I cannot recommend "Psycho" highly enough not just to the horror movie fan, but to any person who appreciates classic movies.  The acting, storyline, plot and directing are second to none and Hitchcock provides the ultimate psychological suspense thrillers in one of the GREATEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL-TIME in "Psycho".<br /><br />I recommend purchasing "Psycho" The Collector's edition DVD from the "The Alfred Hitchcock Collection"...the transfer is terrific with great sound and 1.85:1 widescreen presentation provides the perfect viewing experience for this indescribably brilliant film...this flick deserves a hundred stars! I envy anyone that has never seen this movie and is ignorant about it...you will never be the same after watching this brilliant horror movie and I challenge you to take a shower at night after viewing this for the first time...I can assure you that your showers will never quite be the same again. :)</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>I saw this movie over 40 years ago, when it first came out, and I remember the screams in the theater.  Although the filming techniques and the dialogue and some of the acting shows its age, the film is no less exciting to watch than when I orignially saw it.  The logic in the development of Norman into what he became is perfectly credible, whether or not there are people who have actually gone "psycho" off the movie screen.  Every time I see the movie I see at least one more thing that I didn't notice before, and I am still shocked at the "mother's" appearance and actions.  It still scares.</p></br><a href="../users/AE42JLYPXUI45.html">AE42JLYPXUI45</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock is definitely the most legendery film director of all time. His work is beyond amazing, without a doubt. Psycho is among the many greats of Alfred Hitchcock and will remain a classic.<p>  Starting off in Phoenix, Arizona on Friday, December 11th, 1960. The beautiful MARION CRANE (played by Janet Leigh) has rented a posh hotel room with her boyfriend, SAM LOOMIS (played by John Gavin), during her lunchbreak. Marion has to get back to work, while Sam has to get back to Fairvelle. Marion gets back to work a little late, but lucks out in knowing that her boss, GEORGE LOWERY (played by Vaughn Taylor) is late himself, for he is in a meeting. In comes George Lowery, following a businessman named, Tom Cassidy (played by Frank Albertson). He walks over to Marion and begins telling her about his 18-year old daughter tying the knot. He hands Marion $40,000, the money Mr. Cassidy will be using to buy his daughter a house as a wedding present. George invites Tom into his office and tells Marion to bank the $40,000 until the following Monday. Marion asks George for permission to take the rest of the day off because of her supposed headache and goes on her way.<p>  While in her bedroom, Marion packs a suitcase and changes clothes. She so temptingly stares at the $40,000 and tries to restrain herself, but not for long, for, in one quick movement, she steals the $40,000 and heads out to her car. Seems as though that Marion is on her way to Fairvelle to see Sam. While at a red light, she notices George crossing in front of her. Unfortunately, he notices Marion, but Marion, as worried as she is about having being noticed, continues on her way. She drives into dusk until pulling over to sleep. The next morning, Marion is awakened by a suspicious cop. She nervously talks to the cop and goes on her way, as the cop follows her. She pulls into a dealership and requests to trade in her car for another. She makes her decision rather quickly and pays for it with her car, plus $700.<p>  She drives on her through the morning, afternoon, and into dusk. Suddenly, it's starts to storm. She gets off a main road and finds The Bates Motel sitting quietly off the highway as if it were hidden from it. She gets out and sees nobody in the office. She looks up and finds a sinister looking house and notices, through a window, an elderly woman walking about. She beeps her car horn until someone comes running out. He finally comes to Marion's aide and takes her inside. The man who took Marion inside the office is NORMAN BATES (played by Anthony Perkins), a seemingly-sweet young man, who owns both the house and motel. He checks Marion in to cabin No. 1 because 'it's closer in case you want anything'. Marion says she wants sleep more than anything, except maybe some food. Norman invites her to the house for some sandwiches. As he goes off to make the sandwiches, Marion hears a woman, viciously yelling at Norman. The woman is the elderly woman Marion saw and it turns out that the woman is Norman's mother. Norman yells back and comes back into Marion's room. The two have supper in Norman's polar, which is located in the back of the office. The polar is decorated with stuffed birds. Turns out that Norman's hobby is taxidermy. They have a brief conversation, leading to Marion wanting to get some sleep. She goes off into her cabin and gets ready to take a shower. She steps in and begins washing herself. While in the middle of her shower, the curtain opens to reveal a dark figure of an elderly woman. Marion turns around and screams in fright as she is murdered in cold blood. The woman disappears and Norman comes in to erase the crime.<p>  A week later, a young woman runs into Sam Loomis' store and demands to talk to Sam. Sam comes out and walks over to the young woman. The young woman is LILA CRANE (played by Vera Miles), Marion's curious sister. She tells Sam what Marion had done the Friday before. As Sam and Lila are talking about it, a private investigator by the name of MILTON ARBOGAST (played by Martin Balsam) comes in and begins talking to Sam and Lila about Marion. He goes off to investigate and comes across Norman and The Bates Motel. He questions Norman, but claims that Marion stayed overnight and left early the next morning. Arbogast then sees Norman's mother and asks to question her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam, gives them the news and goes into the house to question Norman's mother, only to be killed by her.<p>  Lila and Sam have been waiting for Arbogast to return for three hours. Sam drives up there, but finds no Arbogast, but only Norman's mother. He drives back to Lila and they visit SHERIFF AL CHAMBERS (played by John McIntire). Al and his wife, ELIZA CHAMBERS listen to Lila and Sam's story of Marion's disappearance and of Arbogast's disappearance. Sam says that when he went up there, he too noticed Norman's mother. Both Al and Eliza make them aware of the death of Norman's mother that happened ten years earlier. Sam is certain of seeing Norman's mother in the house. The next morning, Lila and Sam drive up to the motel and decide to check in as man and wife, in order to search the motel. They are checked in by Norman. They settle in and begin searching Cabin No.1 and find that it was occupied by Marion. Sam tells Lila to take the job of questioning Mrs. Bates, while he distracts Norman. Lila enters Norman's fruitcellar, only to see that Mrs. Bates is dead, as the real killer is finally revealed. If you're wise, you'll take showers with the curtains open forever.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPN2VKS8E77C.html">A2GPN2VKS8E77C</a><br/><p>Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Regarded by some as the finest Hitchcock film ever, Psycho begins gently, then slowly turns dark before becoming terrifying in one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed.

You can see a man standing in the street when Marion returns to her job in an office. Can drugs or money buy happiness? Customer Tom tells about himself. Marion must deposit $40,000 into the bank. [That would be over ten years' wages for Marion.] Will she go for a vacation? People could sleep in their cars then. Who is watching Marion? [Note the product placement in automobile brands.] A voice-over carries the story forward. After a long tiring drive she stops at a small motel. [Is the rain symbolic?]<br /><br />Is motel manager Norman Bates a nice young man? What about his mother? "She isn't quite herself today." Norman's hobby is taxidermy, the preservation of the dead (like a mummy). "She's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds." Does this talk pad out the film or lull the viewer before an action scene?

[That eye is not dilated.] Now Norman has another mess to clean up and dispose of the leftovers.<br /><br />Marion's sister Lila visits Sam to inquire about her. So does a private investigator to locate the missing money. Arbogast visits hotels to search for a backtrail. One of these places is the Bates Motel. Arbogast recognizes Marion's signature, and then Norman remembers the details. Arbogast decides to go back and question Norman's mother. What a surprise! Then Sam returns to search for Arbogast.

Does the ending now seem to be unintentionally funny?<br /><br />This is a low-budget film with few actors. The story made this successful in the late 1950s. Note how Marion wears white underwear before the theft but black underwear afterwards. She was punished for her sins like in a morality play. The novel by Robert Bloch was inspired by a true crime in 1956 Wisconsin. The new highway damaged business for the Bates Motel, a reflection of the declining small businesses of the 1950s. The few outdoor scenes show southern California without traffic or smog.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ54MITON1NO.html">ASJ54MITON1NO</a><br/><p>One of Hitchcock's best films, carefully constructed, visually, and thematically. Before the slasher films were popular, which this film influenced, the psychological suspense film, done only the way Hitchcock could, was a more effective approach to the subject matter. Most of the associations of the events, takes place in the mind of the viewer, rather than on the screen. Leaving much left to the imagination, rather than having the events crammed down our throats, the way they appear in today's slasher films. The (Special Edition) DVD, contains more bonus material, but it's no big deal. Also, the newer released DVD, states that the feature film Psycho is digitally remastered, but looks essentially the same as the (Collector's Edition).</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Anthony Perkins became a household name after starring in Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho". Playing the mentally unbalanced momma's boy Norman Bates, Perkin's portrayal is both mesmerizing and haunting as he leaves the viewer enthralled with his vivid performance of one of the cinema's most complicated characters. Janet Leigh is also fantastic in this, although her character is killed off early in the film. Out of all of Hithcock's films "Psycho" is the best, with his other masterpiece "The Birds" coming in a close second.<br /> If you enjoy "Psycho" you will love the "Psycho" sequels and prequel that are available in one fabulous set: in it you get all three remaining "Psycho" films, "Psycho 2", "Psycho 3", and the prequel that was made for cable TV called appropriately "Psycho 4". There is also a remake of "Psycho" that is available individually starring Anne Heche and Julianne Moore, directed by Gus Vant Sant, that was released in the late '90's. Not up to par with the original, it is nevertheless entertaining.<br /> This particular set of "Psycho" is filled to the brim with bonuses, the best being an informative 90 minute documentary on the making of this Hollywood classic. One thing is certain after watching "Psycho": you will be nervous when taking a shower. Janet Leigh stated many years before her death that after filming wrapped she could never take a shower for the rest of her life.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I absolutely just love this movie ! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, and Hitchcock said he did it as a joke. This was his first horror movie, a huge departure from his crime & suspense drama's. Never has one scene caused so much attention and inspired all the slashers you see today. The most iconic scene ever is the shower scene,bar none. Nothing like this had ever been shown, a man who dresses as a woman due to a mother complex kills people who arouse him, and those who try to catch the killer. Anthony Perkins was typecast forever for his role of Norman Bates. Janet Leigh became an icon who refused to let her daughter watch this,of course that is Jamie Lee Curtis, who went on to star in Halloween. John Gavin is Sam Loomis, where else did you hear this name - why Halloween of course - Donald Pleasence - he is Dr. Sam Loomis - hmm.<br />This movie broke new grounds for horror suspense and even as Janet Leigh walking around in her under garments. This was Hitch's most serious horror so he appeared early (as he usually does in his films) but this movie was more subtle since this movie was not to contain any inside jokes. The music is fantastic, parts of it show up in Friday the 13th, Re-Animator,etc.<br />If you have never seen this movie, you really really must see this. A brilliant movie, in black and white, to show the grittiness of the picture. ULTRA HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.<br />The DVD that I have is the new book shaped case with all sorts of bonus features which to me are just fantastic. A lot of people still like the collectors edition, or the box set, or what have you. I went for the Legacy and I am quite happy with the transfer, features,etc. A double dip that to me was worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>A slick, taught psychological thriller. Seminal cinema. I had avoided watching this film for a long time after a friend of mine told me it was 'kind of obvious who the killer is'. Well yes and no. From the cautious, careful opening scenes, to the moment the mysterious motel/house location is established, it is clear that this is not the type of billion dollar bloodbath slasher thriller with ludicrous twists, turns, subplots, denouments. It is a closed world - dominated by the disturbed young man Norman Bates: quirky, uneasy, boyishly handsome - and his relationship with his elderly invalid mother who dominates his mind.<br /><br />Original for its shape (the shower scene is only a third of the way through) and its intelligent and brilliant epilogue of psychological ideas after a thrilling seat clutching climax, Psycho is a must.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I don't think you can call yourself a film enthusiast if you are not a fan of Hitchcock.  Part of loving film is finding solace in the technique used to create film, and truly there is no other director who possesses the technique Hitchcock possessed.  The famed director was truly a master of his craft, able to generate genuine emotion from his audience, always using every advantage at his disposal and creating authentic and moving pictures that are still unmatched even today.  While he has delivered many masterpieces, in my humble opinion `Psycho' is his finest work.<br /><br />When you watch `Psycho' there are many techniques Hitchcock utilized to the superlative degree to deliver to his audience perfection.  First, and maybe foremost, we have the brilliant score.  Music can be a key to creating the perfect mood and tone for a film.  Think back to the ominous baritone that bubbles from the depths of `Jaws' and even recently, films like `Atonement' and `There Will Be Blood' have utilized the power of music to elevate scenes and cement themselves into our memories.  `Psycho' has probably the most memorable of all film scores for I can still hear those screeching violins every time I step into the shower.  Secondly, Hitchcock shot the film in classic black and white, even though color was an option.  Now while his initial reasoning for the decision may have been to save money, the end result leads the audience down a much more fulfilling path than had he opted for a color film.  Having seen Gus Van Sant's remake (which really isn't as horrible as critics labeled it) I can honestly say that color works against this film.  The rich grays and blacks help stir the feelings of imminent danger, helping to solidify feelings of fear even when nothing frightening is taking place on the screen.  The editing is also ferociously engrossing, especially when concerning the famous shower scene.  Hitchcock knows how to keep the audience on edge throughout the entirety of the film; thus the publicity campaign `No One Will Be Seated After the Picture Begins'.<br /><br />And then you have the plot, filled to the brim with mystery and surprise.  Hitchcock takes advantage of these plot twists in order to create a film that is genuinely shocking and unexpected (the first go around) and manages to still deliver shivers upon multiple viewings.  I have not read Robert Bloch's novel which served as inspiration for the film (I don't hear many good things about it) but Hitchcock's masterpiece shines brightly from every outlet.<br /><br />The film revolves around Marion Crane, a young woman who has a lot of things going wrong for her; most notably her affair with a married man.  Desiring to find a way to make their lives easier and enable her lover Sam to divorce his wife and marry her, Marion steals a substantial amount of money from her boss's client and flees town.  In her haste she stumbles across an old run down motel and decides to stay the night.  The manager Norman seems like a nice young man.  He's thoughtful and considerate, offering her some dinner and keeping her company.  He is a tad skittish and defensive, but nothing too alarming.  Then Marion attempts to take a shower, and we all know what happens next.<br /><br />I can't for the life of my conclude that anyone reading this review doesn't already know the brilliant twist in this film, for even those who have not seen this movie are certainly aware of it, but for the sake of that one person who genuinely has no clue I will remain silent with regards to the plot from that point onward.<br /><br />Aiding Hitchcock are the phenomenal performances by the cast, especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.  There is a pivotal scene when Norman Bates and Marion Crane are eating dinner together that truly reeks with talent.  These two actors embody the souls of their characters and ooze forth with such commanding presence.  I am shocked that Anthony Perkins was denied even an Oscar nomination for his brilliant performance, creating the perfect villain who is not only fear inspiring and genuinely chilling but also honestly sympathetic.  Janet Leigh, who did receive a much deserved Oscar nomination, is also flawlessly enticing as Marion Crane.  She commands your attention and draws you into her dilemma masterfully.  The remaining cast is superb as well; John Gavin, Vera Miles, John McIntire and Simon Oakland especially delivering strong performances that support and elevate those of the two leads.<br /><br />When all is said and done there really isn't any fault to be found with Hitchcock's masterpiece.  The final frames of Norman Bates' silent madness are forever locked into my subconscious and still haunt my dreams on occasion.  Sure, there are films that are scarier and more gruesome than this classic but rarely has a film of this genre been able to reach the levels of truly sustained dread that Hitchcock captured; a dread that never leaves, only lies dormant, waiting for the right moment to unleash itself its victims once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Psycho was a film made by Film Legend Alfred Hitchcock in 1960. It was based on the book, Psycho, which was written by Robert Bloch. The book was loosely based on Wisconsin Serial Killer Ed Gein. The film tells the story about a secretary that embezzles money from her employer. She goes on the run after doing so yet, because of weather & fatigue, decides to stop by The Bates Motel. Yet, her stop there proves to be her undoing. Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is the movie he is most fondly remembered for. The movie stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh(mother of Scream Queen Legend, Jamie Lee Curtis), Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, & John Mcintire. The Shower scene in the movie has been studied and discussed over and over as to why it is so terrifying and why many has tried to copy it through the years. This collector's edition includes extras like newsreel footage surrounding the making and release of the movie; an archive of production stills; the special trailer in which Hitchcock himself leads viewers around the Bates place; credit designer Saul Bass's original "shower scene" story boards; posters and advertising materials for the movie's William Castle-like publicity campaign (No One Will Be Seated After the Feature Begins!); and, the piece de resistance, a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film!<br />The movie itself was so succesful that it spawned three sequels(one of which was directed by Perkins himself), a made-for TV movie called The Bates Motel, and a remake that stars Anne Heche-Vince Vaughn-William H. Macy-Viggo Mortensen(of Lord of the Rings fame)-& Julianne Moore. The movie was also the very first movie to start the 'Slasher' Genre of movies.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that deserves to be in any film lovers' collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Psycho starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins is a black and white masterpiece to say the least. Great peformances, fantastic direction, and a bone-tingling plot, Psycho is one film not to be missed. This film still gives me goosebumps, probably seen it 50 times and each time I watch it I see something I never noticed before. I highly recommend this "mother" of a movie, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>In my personal opinion Psycho is truly one of scariest and suspense filled movies of all time. What more can you ask. A woman accused of stealing 40 thousand dollars...the infamous shower scene...a hotel proprietor gone beserk. It's a classic! Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins clicked in this 1960 Hitchcock thriller! Believe me once you see it you'll never take a shower again!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>My caption comes from the fact that both "Psycho" and "The Texas Chainsaw Masacre" were loosely based on the same killer Ed Gein. These are completely different films of course, but I find it interesting none the less. I have seen "Pyscho" so many times that it's not something I watch often now. The movie is still brilliant and what made me want to see it recently was the fact that I finally built my home theater. I wasn't born when "Psycho" was released in theaters and after 20 years of dreaming of having a home theater(long before they seemed possible)my vision has come true! The screen I have been viewing the movies I've reviewed is 150 inches which is a little over 10 feet long by little over 7 feet high. It was almost like watching it for the first time! I saw little things I never noticed thoughout the film and the score never sounded better. If you have never seen this movie, you have missed one of the most copied films ever! The version I'm reviewing is in the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece collection box set. Four reasons to buy this movie...It's Hitchcock, Perkins gives the performance of his career, it's one of the best horror/thrillers ever made and the DVD transfer is excellent!</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Made at the peak of his career in 1960, "Psycho" was suspense master Hitchcock's last and most famous black-and-white picture--and a film that inaugurated the sub-genre of slasher movie. By the standards of today's gore-fests, it's a fairly restrained murder mystery, but disturbing nonetheless, achieving its chills more by what is withheld than shown. Hitchcock knows just how to heighten our dread of who or what might be at the top of the stairs, or beyond that shower curtain. The terrifying "Psycho" stands above most any psychological thriller made since.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>I had to write a tribute to this masterpiece of<br /><br />horror.Though in no way does Psycho stand alone<br /><br />as a HORROR masterpiece it did get us into the<br /><br />open,by that I mean the nightmares are no longer<br /><br />wrapped in bandages or have scar tissue long fangs<br /><br />and howl at the moon.No the nightmare can be at your<br /><br />next door.This movie paved the way for so many Horror<br /><br />masterpiece's.This movie as well as Rosemary's baby<br /><br />and NIGHT of the LIVING DEAD said to all the up coming<br /><br />director's O.K. we've shown you now what can you do<br /><br />with Horror films in the 70's!Well we all no what Horror<br /><br />films have came in the 70's and thank you to all involved<br /><br />in Psycho for we would not have Last house on the left-Halloween<br /><br />Black Christmas-Phantasm-Carrie-Suspira-Omen-Exorcist-Texas<br /><br />Chainsaw-Cannibal Holocaust-The Shining-Rabid or even JAWS.<br /><br />I write this for you can read any other review about the movie<br /><br />I just wanted to say Hail,Hail to Psycho(60) no,I mean NO!<br /><br />HORROR catalog is complete without this BABY!It is a difinitive<br /><br />masterpiece on the macabre A-A- BOY'S BESTFRIEND IS HIS MOTHER.<br /><br />eeee.Perkins was so fantastic still gives me shivers.My fav.<br /><br />scene the first time we see mother walking past the window<br /><br />frame in the pouring rain.Till this day that scene alone has<br /><br />buried most of the horror crap that has come out in 2000-2007<br /><br />I love the horror films from the 20's,30's 40's and the HAMMERS<br /><br />but again thank you movie Psycho for the breath of fresh air.</p></br><a href="../users/A19JYLHD94K94D.html">A19JYLHD94K94D</a><br/><p>Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there - I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten - how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.<br /><br />Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialogue and the construction of each scene and each shot - Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes - Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detevtive - all take second place.<br /><br />Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalogue, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films - Rear Window in particular springs to mind - the `madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer - that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialogue is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.<br /><br />The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene - anticlimactic and slightly too long - aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>This is an absolute thriller of a movie.<br /><br />The black and white film had a type of erie feeling to it.<br /><br />I saw this film when i was about 13,and it scared me at the time but i was in awe of such a well constructed movie.<br /><br />The movie starts off kinda boring as this lady finds a hotel room,and if you didnt know what was about to happen you might concider turning it off.<br /><br />However when she enters the shower all hell breaks loose and that realy scary music scares hell outa me each time i see it.<br /><br />That mansion is as spooky as anything,and they sure dont make horror movies like this anymore.<br /><br />The part when the sister goes up the stairs to see mother,makes me crap myself.<br /><br />This is a damn good movie,and probably the best horror movie around.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A.html">A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A</a><br/><p>poor janet leigh and tony perkins must have wondered what happened after this one came out,as neather one of them ever really out ran the shadow of this all time suspence thriller about a girl and some stolen money and a mommas boy who runs a motel and what happens when they meet.<br /><br />  we all know the story so lets talk about extras,which thank you universal,is quite a bit. from making of doc. to trailers to interviews with cast this is a hitchcock lovers dream. may all his films get this treatment.</p></br><a href="../users/A5OD2CTWK2EBA.html">A5OD2CTWK2EBA</a><br/><p>... that will never get old.

This movie is creepy good classic horror a definite must if you are a fan of haorror and you know what realk good horror is ( e.g The original 1972 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead 1978, Maniac 1980, American WereWolf in London 1980's ) I could go on and on but if you like movies like ( e.g Scream, i know what you did last summer, Jeepers Creepers etc ) then you most likely wont have this movie cause you really dont know what horror is.<br /><br />So for any true horror fans out there , you know who you are get this flick its a must for the serious fan of horrors.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ.html">A3UCNXHX2PB3KQ</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock delivers possibly the best directing job ever on a horror movie[Carpenter's Halloween and Romero's NOTL considered], with the infamous Norman Bates and his mother.<br /><br /> Its Arizona and Janet Leigh is in trouble, having stolen 40k from her boss, she's at a loss driving down a dark, rainy stretch of lonely highway late one night. But low and behold, the Bates Motel, with the 12 and 12 is available. She arrives at the motel, and nothing but terror ensues. Hitchcock finds all the right nerves and tingles them here, with some infamous murder scenes and that huanting score which captivates you. The last 25 or so minutes of this film work perfectly, and this movie just keeps on getting better from start to finish. There's no reason not to see why this is arguably the most influential movie in history.</p></br><a href="../users/A1SVXJZ3386U2D.html">A1SVXJZ3386U2D</a><br/><p>The American Film Institute recently listed the top 100 suspense films of all time.  Topping the list was Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho".  This shouldn't be surprizing for those who saw the movie back in the 1960's.  It was a shocking movie that had a lot of people whispering about what they experienced in watching it.  I was considered too young to see it back then (before films ratings) and so, in latter half of the decade, I was looking forward to watching it on TV.  Alas, the previously announced television premier of the movie was cancelled.  My mother said that there had been a murder of the daughter of a prominent politician recently and this caused it to be pulled as a matter of proper respect.  Whatever the reason, I cite the event as a comparison of movie content then and now.  What you see in "Psycho" is far less graphic than the standard horror film of today yet its' impact is greater that just about anything that came before or since.<br /><br />The reason for this is that the film was put together by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Rather than list the numerous examples of his talent on display, just consider the signature scene of the movie; the murder in the shower.  Here we have a prominent starlet of the era, Janet Leigh, being filmed while taking a shower.  That would probably raise a few eyebrows (or eyelids) even today.  However, we all sensed that something bad was going to happen.  The cuts to the house in the background and the partially audible voices arguing over the girl gave us a clue.  Even though we were on the edges of our seats, the attack still came as a shock.  I don't want to describe it too much although most of us have already seen that scene numerous times.  The series of camera shots alternating in a strobe-like effect kept us mesmerized.  The grating, alarming music that accompanied the sudden entrance of the assailant followed by the slow but steady ping of the shower curtains being pulled down, the glass-eyed stare of a dying woman, the blood mixing in with the shower water circling around as it goes down the drain symbolizing life itself draining away...  This was a whole heck of a lot in one rather brief moment on film.  We had a sense that we had seen everything yet the skill of the director and cameraman made sure that we didn't see too much.  This was one of the great scenes in cinematic history.<br /><br />It isn't just about that one scene either, this is a very compelling psychological horror movie.  The plot draws us in and once the suspense begins, it stays for quite a while.  The ending is fascinating too.  Simon Oakland's summation of what we had all just witnessed was a pretty good scene in itself.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie then make sure you don't miss it.  The standards of Television today being what they are, you won't miss any of the scenes or dialogue no matter what channel you watch it on.  But don't let that fool you, this is still a very scary movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This is not only the best Hitchcock film of them all but it is also the greatest scary movie of them all.  This film sparked every horror villain that ever graced the silver screen.  Mike Meyers, Scream, Freddy Cruegar, and Jason Voorhees would never have seen the spotlight had it not been for Norman Bates.  This film is very suspensful and takes you by surprise when you first watch the film.  It breaks every cliche that you would expect in a slasher flick.  See it and be terrified.  I highly reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Psycho is required viewing in more ways than one.  It literally was required for me recently in an American Cinema college class.  But even more importantly, the film is required viewing for any person interested in watching the incredible techniques used by Hitchcock during this film.  Even though I had watched Psycho several times before, it still had the ability to give me chills.  Watching the movie as a student/critic, it was nice to understand the variety of techniques that Hitchcock used from a learned perspective.  An incredible FIVE star film.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>"Psycho" still holds up today because of a brilliant script, outstanding performances, top-notch direction, and a host of perfectly aligned elements that produced a masterpiece that is often copied, but never duplicated.<br /><br />This film simply had everything going for it from eerie set designs to a gripping score, and from careful and clever photography to insightful characterizations.  Hitchcock created believable characters that we care about in unbelievable circumstances that scare us because as unbelievable as the situations appear, there is still the element of "yeah, but it could happen."  Sadly, in reality, events like this have happened as much as we so often can't believe the facts when we hear them (anyone remember Jeffery Dalhmer [sp]?).<br /><br />The classic story of "Psycho" takes place mostly at a run-down motel next to a Gothic home that houses a socially inept momma's boy and his clingy demanding mother who sees no woman as good enough for her "boy" seems surreal, but somehow still possible.  This psychological slasher film offers so much more than a lone deranged killer hacking away at unsuspecting victims.  Here Norman Bates, an Oscar worthy performance by Anthony Perkins, falls for Marion Crane, played with great subtly by the stunning Janet Leigh (mother of Jamie Lee Curtis whom she co-starred with in the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AM6OQ2">The Fog</a>), who has just robbed her boss and is now having second thoughts and using the Bates Motel to stop and rethink her actions.  Norman's infatuation with Marion disturbs his controlling mother who later "visits" Leigh in one of horrorland's most thrilling and disturbing moments on film.  Clever camera work and inspired direction go with the "less is more" approach that fools us into thinking we are seeing more than we actually are and we are happy to have it that way.<br /><br />What follows is a great psychological thriller/mystery as the first victim's lover, her sister, the local sheriff, and a private detective attempt to figure out just what is going on at the Bates Motel.  While the body count is nothing in comparison to today's slice and dice horror flicks, the killings in this film are nerve-shattering even by today's standards.  The disorienting camera angles enhance every frame of this film that is years ahead of its time.<br /><br />Unlike the slasher films of today with a crazed killer with no real identity to speak of and an even further detachment from reality or plausibility than anything in this film and a series of victims we care even less about than the killer, "Psycho" offers us sadly sympathetic victims and a villain much like the one in "The Phantom of the Opera." We are touched as much as revolted by the killer(s?) in this film.  This is a thriller with surprising depth and insight.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I failed to mention the terrific and all too brief moment with the psychologist in the film played by the always reliable and believable Simon Oakland (Lt. Shrank in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008972S">West Side Story</a> and Kolchak's harried boss in the short-lived TV-series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ATQYWY">Kolchak - The Night Stalker</a>).  You can't help but wish he had more screen time.  He gives a brief but memorable moment in this film that many remember as much as the infamous shower scene.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: The much later sequels during the 1980's, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66Q8I">Psycho II / Psycho III / Psycho IV - The Beginning (Triple Feature)</a>, to this masterpiece are actually not that bad and worth a viewing, including the remake, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IQVC">Psycho</a>, that is a nearly shot for shot repeat of the original only in color and with more contemporary actors for today's audience.  Do any of these films actually hold up in comparison to the original?  Absolutely not, but by themselves and in comparison to most sequels, they are fairly good.</p></br><a href="../users/A27NTH2Y9DAR31.html">A27NTH2Y9DAR31</a><br/><p>I saw this when it first came out, with my brother, and we were 12 and 15, respectively...of course, it shocked adults at the time (as well as today) but it REALLY had an impact on us! Back in 1960, there simply was nothing around to compare, as this movie opened new ground in horror, and even in black and white, it was chilling, perhaps even more so...Janet Leigh was superb, and notice her expression when she is driving away with the money from the man at the bank, who flirted with her, and her thoughts as to how he would react when he discovered the theft. There was another scene, not the shower one, which scared me to death, and the buildup to it was agonizing. In fact, every time we had to go into the Bates house, I was a wreck. When one man complained to Hitchcock that his wife, after seeing the movie, refused to take showers, the Master replied: "Have her dry cleaned..." The Highway Patrol cop who follows her, with great suspicion, is fabulous, his sunglasses obscuring his eyes, and his thoughts, and the car salesman, who is also suspicious and somewhat put off by her desperation...Norman Bates, with his collection of taxidermy, is great, and Perkin's performance here is all the more remarkable considering his previous filmwork was in "Friendly Persuasion", playing the good Quaker son...and Martin Balsam, as the detective helping Vera Miles find her sister, was excellent, and one of my favorite lines of his, to Bates: "It doesn't gel, it isn't aspic..." flatly doubting his contention that he never met or knew the lady in question. I am definitely getting the DVD collector's edition, and plan to watch it during our next thunderstorm, as if it needed more atmosphere!

First of all, the shower scene isn't the scariest scene of the movie, and would future reviewers quit putting spoilers in their reviews.

Firstly in the shower scene (filmed over several days) Leigh's hair changes from shot to shot. Second, in the scene in the Sherriff's house, the Sheriff's wife acts 'understanding' by tipping her head to one side. This would be fine, but every time there is a cut (and there are many) her head is at a different angle!<br />These are of course tiny niggles and the film is deservedly known as a masterpiece.<p>Just one more thing. If you listen to the music in I Know What You Did Last Summer, made as recently as 1997, you can tell how enduring and powerful an influence Bernard Hermann's score for Psycho is, as certain parts are near-identical.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>&quot;Psycho&quot; was originally a dime store novel that was converted into a jewelled movie under the masterful eye of Alfred Hitchcock.

She ends up at the Bates Motel, which is ran by a creepy manager  named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman notices that she is wet and  cold since it was raining outside, and offers to make her a sandwich and  get her something warm to drink. He goes into his house to get the food,  and Marion overhears Norman yelling at someone, who turns out to be his  mother. Marion starts to worry, and apologizes to Norman that she got him  into trouble. He tells Marion that his mother is not quite herself. Marion  eats her food, and talks to Norman, and then she goes into her cabin to  take a shower. Someone comes into the shower and stabs her to death. Norman  suspects that it was his mother, and cleans up the mess, and drives  Marion's car into a lake.

Unsurprisingly though, I remember everything about it, as if I saw it yesterday. That's one of the many impacts PSYCHO has, no matter how many times it's viewed. (Just for the record, mine is three so far, which includes a USC screening with Hitchcock's own daughter and granddaughter providing a Q&amp;A afterward.)<p>The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock has outdone himself with this brilliant masterpiece.

In the opening scene, Marion Crane is wearing a white bra because Alfred Hitchcock wanted to show her as being &quot;angelic&quot;. After she has taken the money, the following scene has her in a black bra because now she has done something wrong and evil. Similarly, before she steals the money, she has a white purse; after she's stolen the money, she carries a black one.<p>3) It was the first movie to show a flushing toilet on camera. This is a must know for any film buff. <p>Yup, PSYCHO did all those first. Learn it, live it, love it.<p>Anyway....Alfred Hitchcock anonymously bought the rights to Robert Bloch's great novel, for just $9,000. He then bought up as many copies of the novel as he could to keep the ending a secret. That's one of many things that made him so great. Hitchcock did take liberties when having the novel (which was more graphic) adapted, but they all work well. In Bloch's novel, Norman Bates is short, fat, older, and very dislikable. It was Hitchcock who decided to have him be young, handsome, and sympathetic. Norman is also more of a main character in the novel. The story opens with him and Mother fighting rather than following Marion from the start. I think that's one of the many reasons PSYCHO works so well. It also shocked audiences when Janet Leigh, who was advertized as the star, bit the dust a mere 50 minutes into the film. (SCREAM used this tactic by offing Drew Barrymore less than 15 minutes into the picture.)<p>The picture is filmed in black and white because Alfred Hitchcock believed the movie would be too gory for color. That adds to the creepiness and makes the film more effective, as the horrible colored remake proved. <p>A brilliant and much duplicated score by Hermann Bernard adds to the atmosphere and builds the suspense. Hitchcock originally envisioned the shower sequence as completely silent, but Bernard Herrmann went ahead and scored it anyway and Hitch immediately changed his mind. I couldn't imagine the movie any other way.<p>However, what makes PSYCHO truly immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten, is that it connects directly with our innermost fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers.<p>Speaking of mothers, you wouldn't want to disappoint Norma Bates would you? I thought not, so see the film, before you make mother really angry....</p></br><a href="../users/A3BSS2M2DPPV4T.html">A3BSS2M2DPPV4T</a><br/><p>Although this landmark Hitchcock film is over 4O years old, it still manages to instill the shudders!  Many factors contribute to this fact.  The performances are first-rate, especially that of Anthony Perkins: he was forever identified with this role (is it any wonder?) and Perkins was practically type-cast as movie audiences relished savouring his playing of demented Norman Bates.  The black and white photography is another factor towards the film's perennial success.  If this had been filmed in colour, it wouldn't have nearly the intended impact.  Thirdly, there is the classic, terrificly creepy musical score by Bernard Herrmann which is, in a word, unforgettable.  Janet Leigh is natural and effective in her playing of Marion Crane: when she takes off with that $4O,OOO, the audience goes right along for the ride!  Even Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, is cleverly cast as the receptionist at the Phoenix bank, and she somehow lingers in the memory - definitely a Hitchcockian touch: we remember &quot;Teddy&quot; and &quot;aspirin&quot;.  Handsome John Gavin is a bit wooden as Sam, but then so is Vera Miles as Lila (is that a wig she's wearing?): they seem destined to be together after the fade-out. Even as a kid, I thought the bedroom of Mrs. Bates was grotesque: hearts, artificial flowers, cupids and all - and that imprint on the bed....ugh!! The scenes in the Bate's motel office are brilliantly acted in every respect: with Leigh, Gavin and Balsam respectively.  As Arbogast, Martin Balsam is memorably honest in his playing and his death scene is particularly jolting. Concerning Lila, Sam &amp; Marion's whereabouts,  I love the scene where Arbogast says to Lila &quot;...but I don't believe you&quot; - Lila replies thusly: &quot;I don't care whether YOU believe me or NOT!!&quot;  When Mrs. Bates appears to be very much alive according to Lila, John McIntire is memorable as the gruff but essentially tender-hearted sheriff.  Eerily, he questions just who is buried in her plot in the local cemetery? - which gives the film an obviously intentional &quot;false twist&quot;  Lurene Tuttle, that great veteran character actress plays the sheriff's wife who insists that Mrs. Bate's was buried in a dress of &quot;periwinkle blue&quot; (!). Most every horror fan knows that Leigh (and thousands of women) refrained form taking showers after seeing this film upon its initial release in 196O.  Janet Leigh's &quot;blood&quot; was actually Hershey's chocolate syrup going &quot;down the drain&quot;!  The Joseph Stefano script is - if not brilliant - interesting: it was adapted from the novel by Robert Bloch.  Said to be inspired from one Edward Gein, an eccentric Wisconsin bachelor who, after his domineering mother died, went &quot;psycho&quot; in his secluded isolation. Creepy.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>When I watched this in the `90s for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.<br /><br />I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.<br /><br />"Norman Bates" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.<br /><br />What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD that is here on this page.  Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.<br /><br />I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A8F2AZWB20X1H.html">A8F2AZWB20X1H</a><br/><p>This is the movie that set the standard for horror films and makes most of them pale in comparison.  Hitchcock set out to make his audience scream and succeeded beyond his wildest expectations; I saw &quot;Psycho&quot; when it was first released and the screams almost lifted the roof off the theater.  Filming the movie in black and white was a stroke of genius; the spooky  impact would have been much diminished if it had been shot in color.  And  Lord, that music... Bernard Herrmann's score helped make &quot;Psycho&quot;  the total horror ride it is, screechy violins and all.  The cast is  excellent throughout.  Anthony Perkins is, and always will be, Norman  Bates.  Janet Leigh is terrific as Marian Crane, John Gavin and Vera Miles  give great performances as her boyfriend and her sister, and Martin Balsam  is wonderful as the cynical private eye Arbogast, who makes one trip too  many to the Bates Motel.  Hitchcock knows how to frame his shots; the scene  of Vera Miles descending the cellar stairs and finding Mrs. Bates is a  heart-stopper no matter how many times you watch it.  With Norman Bates,  Hitchcock added an unforgettable figure to the horror pantheon, and this  movie will surely live as one of the great horror classics of all time.  They just don't make 'em like this any more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>There's little I can add to what others have already written. I saw "Psycho" in the theatre when it first came out -- and, like everyone else, nearly jumped out of my seat at the famous shower scene.  But there's more to the movie than that. A lot more. It's one of the greatest suspense thrillers of all time, and Anthony Perkins' portrayal of the creepy, schizophrenic Norman Bates is still unsettling.<br /><br />The extras on the Collector's edition are worthwhile, although Janet Leigh drones on way too long, repeating herself endlessly and saying "you know" about 50 times. Someone should have edited her interview down by about 70%.<br /><br />Still, it's a great movie. A true landmark in the history of film that holds up well nearly a half-century later. Five stars for sure!</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>There is no debating that "Psycho" is one of the classic psychological thriller movies of all-time.  Heck, some might say that it even invented the genre!  What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of the Alfred Hitchcock collection of motion pictures.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Psycho" sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in order to have an affair.  While escaping the city in the dead of night, Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), when the weather takes a turn for the worse.  What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later one, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved "mother".<br /><br />In most other Hitchcock movies, the plots are more generic and the picture full of color.  In short, they are lighter experiences that as much showcase the stars and styles of the time as they do cultivate rich plots and intriguing characters.  With "Psycho", however, the entire experience is gritty and filled with some of the most interesting characters (in particular Perkins' Bates) ever to grace the big screen.  The movie was even purposely filmed in black and white to give it that extra "edge".<br /><br />When a film like "Psycho" achieves such a high degree of popularity, it sometimes loses a bit of its edge due to the fact that ever scene, character, and line has been dissected a thousand times over.  In this case, though, "Psycho" can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale.  Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy.<br /><br />In short, "Psycho" is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material (when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars).  Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out "just one more thing" that amazes you, as well as experience that "creepy-crawly" feeling regarding Mr. Norman Bates.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI.html">A1HMBIRR0RJ1NI</a><br/><p>5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />The Granddaddy of all insane slasher movies.

I still enjoyed the film just not the transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Psycho' is probably one of the most definitive films of cinema, not just horror but of pure American cinema.  The acting, the direction, the plot, script...everything is utterly brilliant and can compare with today's standards and still stand out as truly inspired film.  Alfred Hitchcock was probably the smartest movie-maker of his generation, and maybe even ours, for he knew how to get what he wanted with very little, to make the most of what he had and he always delivered something smart, edgy and ahead of it's time.<br /><br />`Psycho', of course, is no exception.  Probably his most popular film, and arguably his best, `Psycho' has been the inspiration for countless rip-offs, sequels and a remake, none of which have even come close to the power of the original.  Psycho itself was inspired by the real life account of serial killer Ed Gein, and man brutally abused by his mother into believing that women were evil.  Ed Gein himself has been the inspiration for many films including `The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and `The Silence of the Lambs', both of which fall in the line of `Psycho' as cinematic landmarks, but arguably `Psycho' was and is the most important.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to anyone who has seen this film post its original release, Hitchcock really wove a twisted web.  You see, everyone who's heard of the film after it was released has heard that it's about a crazy momma's boy who kills a woman in the shower, but knowing the story does a somewhat disservice to Hitchcock for he really went all out to weave a tangled web of mystery as to the who's and why's.  Regardless though, everything about this film is extraordinary and deserving of praise.  Of particular note is the excellent acting on the part of the entire cast, but of course Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh (who received a well deserved Oscar nomination) are particular standouts.<br /><br />I'm guessing I don't really need to explain the plot, but for the sake of discussion I will.  The movie starts by giving us some back story on our famous victim, Marion Crane (Leigh) who is involved with Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but because of his impending divorce they have no means to make it, that is until she gets her hands on $40,000.  Of course it's stolen money and the man she stole it from is all but a little unhappy.  She flees the city and stops at off the road motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives with his overbearing (oh yeah, and dead) mother.  After Marion is murdered (the classic shower scene) her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam send a detective to find her (they just assume she's missing, run off with the money and all) but what they find is a crazy house of horrors.<br /><br />`Psycho', above all else, succeeds in creating the perfect mood for a film of this nature, giving us enough air of gloom and eerie atmosphere to breathe life to this brilliant film.  Horror movies of today may try, but I highly doubt any film will really come close to what Hitchcock created with `Psycho'.  This film proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it's that silent sinister feeling that creates real, pure and raw terror, not blood gore and mayhem.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS:<br /><br />Sure, we all know the story.

It's famous for the "shower" scene, but believe, that's only halfway through the movie, it gets only better from there and ends with a highly unpredictable and classic Hitchcock ending.<br />The story is about a woman who is given money by her boss to place in his account. But, she decides to take it and run off with it. She does so, so that she would be able to live a wonderful life with her boyfriend. She stops at a motel out of town and is the only one there. Once there she meets Norman Bates, the owner, played with perfection by Anthony Perkins. She knows that Norman's a strange man as his mother lives in a large mansion up on a hill and the woman always hears Norman argue with his mom. And then, the woman is murdered while taking a shower. You're lead to believe that it's by the mother but you never will know the truth until the very end. And then, the woman's sister and boyfriend go and investigate her strange dissapearance. Hitchcock is at his best, believe me and this old thriller is way better and delivers much more frights than all the new horror movies. This smart movie is built around Anthony Perkins and his tremendous acting skills.<br />Hitchcock is probably the best director of all time. He has created in the 1950s a movie that is better and that delivers more frights that any movie now.<br />This is his best movie of all time. It is quite frankly a perfect movie. It has no faults whatsoever. The acting is spot on, the cinematography is great, the thrills are constant and the twist is brilliant. My only regret is that I hadn't seen it before the ending had been given away.<br />The score though is my favorite part of the movie. To me, the score is a crucial aspect of movies. The one here is chilling. The best of all time. Right from the opening credits, you can tell that this score is fantastic. It's plain creepy and the chords at each stab in the shower scene are spot on.<br />The most ingenious thing about Hitchcock is that the shower scene here shows no nudity whatsoever. That is brilliant. How he somehow films it without that is extraordianry.<br />It's pointless to write a longer review because everyone know the genious of this movie.

Im 22 years old and this was my first time ever viewing this film. I saw the sequals before the original. Ive seen almost every other horror film out there and loved Pyscho 2. Wasnt that impressed with 3 but I eventually saw Pyscho and I am blown away. Any fan of psychological horror should see this. It is truly one of the greats and Hitchcock is an amazing director. This has to be in the top 3 best horror movies ever, if not the best. Story is about a young man named Norman Bates. He runs the Bates Motel. A woman named Marian Crane happens to run into him while trying to find a place to stay for the night after stealing 40,000 dollars. Wont tell you what happens from there but the film just keeps getting better and better till the great ending. Amazing performances by all. Anthony Perkins gives one of the most memorable performances in film history. Also contains a theatrical trailer with Hitch giving the audience a guided tour through the bates house/motel.

Enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>By now, there are few people who don't alrady relate director Alfred Hitchcock with some of the most spine-tingling films of all time.  Having brought such features as &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot; to the big screen forever more concreted his name in the annals of film history as one of the true visionaries of the genre.  But perhaps his masterpiece, the most memorable film of his career, is the one that introduced audiences for the first time to the genre of the serial killer.  &quot;Psycho&quot;, starring Janet Leigh, would forever change the face of horror.<p>Marion Crane (Leigh) is a struggling secretary working for a real-estate salesman.  Having returned from a rendevous with her somewhat estranged boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), she realizes that the two of them can only be together in a &quot;legitimate&quot; sense, if he can first settle a divorce between he and his wife.  What's more, his debts are large, and she knows that he will never fully be part of her life until his debts are paid.<p>As fate would have it, her boss had just closed a deal with a wealthy client, who insisted on paying for the house with cash.  Entrusted with the money, Marion leaves work early, having suddenly come down with a headache.  She heads home instead and begins to frantically pack her things so that she can drive out to meet her boyfriend who lives in Fairvale, California, which is several hundred miles from her own residence.  Without pause she sets out with the money in hand to meet him, convinced that she can solve their problems by using the money afforded her by the boisterous man she met earlier that day.<p>As she drives across country, she has a run-in with a police officer, and immediately, she begins to feel the paranoia that anyone guilty of a crime would feel.  As she continues her ventures west, her mind races with the scenarios that could unfold for her in the near future.  Weary of the road, and a bit down-trodden by her guilt, she pulls off the main hightway when a heavy rain unexpectedly begins to fall.  The road she travels brings her to the neon sign of a local motel &quot;The Bates Motel.&quot;<br />She pulls in and goes into the front office where she is met by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).<p>Checking in under a false name, Bates invites her to dinner at his home, a large, run-down house on a hill behind the motel.  She accepts his invitation, asking first if she can freshen up.  Bates agrees and heads up to the house after showing her the room she will be staying in.  <p>While freshening up, she hears an argument from the house between Norman and a woman, whom Bates identifies as his &quot;mother&quot;.  Bates returns a short time later with a tray of food in hand, and apologizes, stating this mother is &quot;ill&quot; (mentally, not physically.)  They eat in his parlor instead, and during the course of their conversation, Marion realizes that she must return home, for she has made a mistake.  She retires to her room where she prepares to shower.<p>She never finishes the shower.  A woman, silhouetted in the darkness, attacks her unexpectedly, stabbing her repeatedly until she collapses into the basin of the tub, dead.  The silhouette figure flees the scene and before long, Norman returns, discovering the gruesome scene that has unfolded, knowing that the killer is none other than his mother.<p>And so the story truly begins.<p>What's interesting about &quot;Psycho&quot;, originally a novel written by Robert Bloch, is that the exposition of the story reminds us that &quot;we all go a little mad sometimes.&quot;  This simple premise is the underscoring of this story, for each of the characters, from Marion Crane through Norman Bates have a series of actions that are very cause and effect, suggesting that madness is relative to the situation and the events that impact each individual life.<p>Filmed entirely in black and white (despite the fact that films were commonly shot in color by this time), the movie uses light and shadow to incredible effect.  Where movies of today, especially in the horror genre, rely so heavily on special effects, this movie has virtually none, relying instead on situation, dialogue and character development to portray the slightly off-kilter world that only grows more distorted as the movie continues to its shocking, and (at the time it was filmed) very disturbing conclusion.<p>For anyone who has never seen this film, it is important to understand that, though timid by today's standards, this movie was so shocking at it's time that many viewers left the theater, unable to watch the movie, for its intensity was so great that it affected many audiences all over the country.  In viewing it, make sure that you watch the original Hitchcock edition.  There was a remake of the film in the 90's starring Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates and Anne Heche as Marion Crane.  Though a decent enough remake, it attempted, and in this reviewers humble opinion, failed to re-capture the essence of Hitchcock's genious. <p>The movie, whose cast also included Vera Miles as Lila Crane (Marion's sister), Martin Balsam (Detective Milton Arbogast), and Patricia Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter), is considered a film classic, and one of the AFI top 100 movies of all time.  It truly is a classic that has set the standard for the horror genre for all time to come.  Though many efforts have been made to recapture the essence of this film, there have been few entries in the annals of horror films that have even come close, save for maybe the original &quot;Halloween&quot; by John Carpenter. (INTERESTING SIDE NOTE: Jamie Lee Curtis, who made her debut as &quot;scream-queen&quot; in Carpenter's Halloween is Janet Leigh's daughter.) <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>A disturbing look into the mind of a boy who's not &quot;all there&quot;.

Psycho (1960) is still the most eerie and terrifying thriller ever made of its kind.  The DVD version is crystal-clear.  In the "Bonus Features" is a one hour and thirty-seven minute documentary that includes all the secrets of making the film plus an entertaining and delightful interview with Janet Leigh.  There is also a "Censored Shot" of Janet Leigh that never made it into the film that you can see here on DVD.  The six-minute trailer of "Psycho" with Alfred Hitchcock giving you a tour of the outside sets and inside sets is on the DVD too.<br /><br /> The A&E cable network will be broadcasting a 10-episode tv series in 2013, which is a prequel to PSYCHO (1060). It will show the relationship between young Norman Bates and his mother.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece PSYCHO remains a groundbreaking horror movie to this very day despite the thousands of imitators it has spawned in the last four decades. It was with this film that the horror genre, thought to consist of inhuman monsters and dark, stormy castles, entered the modern age and forced filmmakers to look at humanity's darker side with a contemporary look.<p>By now, of course, everyone knows the story: A woman (Janet Leigh) ends up stealing $40,000 from her boss, drives from Phoenix to Central California to meet with her lover (John Gavin) but never makes it thanks to the "interference" of a motel clerk (Antohny Perkins) and his "mother." Even to this day, however, one can ingeniously look at Hitchcock's film and admire not only the shocks, including the still-potent shower murder, but also the director's deliciously morbid style of black comedy. Perkins made his character Norman Bates into a household work for Madness, and Bernard Herrmann provided us with his celebrated shrieking score, done entirely with strings.<p>The film also marked a point at which the horror film would really tackle subjects that were taboo before--psychology, madness, murder (more explicitly than before) and even necrophilia. This is because the film, scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, has its roots in the case of the ghoulish Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn, which would also provide inspiration for the 1974 cult classic THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. These elements have helped make PSYCHO a legendary film in ways that the vast number of its imitators could never be. It's intelligent, scary, and unsettling even after endless imitations and such. Even the seemingly unnecessary intrusion of the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) at the end is far less bothersome than it seems. He gives us a good idea of what sort of a person Norman is: "He was never all Norman. But he was often ONLY MOTHER."<p>For horror and thriller fans, PSYCHO is an absolutely essential addition to your collection if you don't already have it. Pick up this one-of-a-kind masterpiece now!</p></br><a href="../users/A27QZDO1FRRFCV.html">A27QZDO1FRRFCV</a><br/><p>ITs in Black and White but still it was transferd with great effort witch made it perfect better than the VHS ver,<br />The Sound is also perfect this a a diffenit buy DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>PSYCHO, filmed in black and white, and directed by Alferd Hitchcock is a truly classic horror film. The film starts out with a woman named Marion Crane, who steals some money from her boss and goes out on the road to live the good life with her boyfriend Sam. But along the way, it starts to rain and Marion pulls over at the Bates Motel on the side of the highway. She meets the owner of the motel Norman Bates, who lives in the house on the hill behind the motel with his &quot;mother.&quot; That night, while taking a shower, Marion is stabbed by an old woman with a butcher knife. Murder, madness, and suspense follow shortly after that. Anthony Perkins gives a good performance as the disturbed Norman Bates. All in all, one of the true great classic horror films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BA72K4VK1UN1.html">A1BA72K4VK1UN1</a><br/><p>Few horror films can stack up to this one -- it's a masterpiece of the genre.<br /><br />An attractive secretary pulls off a bit of embezzlement from her employer and heads for the hills. But not being a professional crook, her paranoia really begins to weigh on her (typical Hitchcock suspense) as she tries to skip town with the loot and, as she thinks she's being followed by a mysterious man.<br /><br />Ultimately she ends up out in the boondocks at the tiny and nearly defunct Bates Motel where she meets the soft-spoken proprietor, Norman Bates, who seems to befriend her and set her mind at ease a bit with his friendly manner.<br /><br />But, as this flashy little number takes her shower for the evening (really a vulnerable moment!), she gets to meet Norman's MOTHER (who lives in the creepy old 3-story behind the motel with her son, sort of), a French-knife weilding, nasty, hussy-hating stabber.... and she isn't going to tolerate her Norman's purity being soiled with the likes of an urban strumpett!<br /><br />I'll stop there to avoid "the spoiler" but, leave it to say, Hitchcock keeps us on the edge of our seats to the very end. This film is as good today as it was when it was released. Really creepy!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1FDW1SPYKB354.html">A1FDW1SPYKB354</a><br/><p>Ever since first seeing Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork, "Psycho", it has firmly held down a high ranking in my "Top Films Of All-Time" category. "Psycho" began scaring audiences when it first hit theater screens in June 1960, and it's doing the same thing even today, many decades later.<br /><br />This motion picture has a way of "sucking you in" almost right from the start.  I'm not quite sure why, but (for me) when watching "Psycho", I always begin to start squirming in my seat just a wee bit during the film's second scene, when the man with the wad of cash enters Janet Leigh's office. It's a feeling that seems to be inherent to a Hitchcock film.  It's probably part psychological on the part of the viewer.  Since we know we're seeing a Hitchcock picture, we automatically tend to feel slightly ill-at-ease at almost every turn.  Hitch no doubt *knew* his audiences would feel this way, and took advantage of it with a masterful subtleness in much of his direction and in the scripts he ultimately brought to the big screen.<br /><br />The plot in "Psycho" is relatively simple (so it seems), but in the hands of "The Master" (aka: Mr. Hitchcock), the film takes a drastic turn 47 minutes in, with 57% of the movie still in front of us. I'm sure you know what this "turn" entails.  If not, buy this DVD post-haste, because you're one of the very few who evidently has not basked in the beauty of this motion picture.<br /><br />Between Mr. Hitchcock's inimitable style of direction, and that unforgettable Bernard Herrmann music score, how could this film be anything but what it is -- an unsurpassed horror/suspense icon.<br /><br />There's a veritable laundry list of memorable moments in the film that are almost instantly recognized as distinct "Psycho" signatures. Such as -----<br /><br />> The spooky old house on the hill, which seems to be "watching" all that happens below from its lofty perch.<br /><br />> "Bates Motel -- Vacancy".<br /><br />> The staircase.<br /><br />> "Mother" moving past the window.<br /><br />> Marion's "eye".<br /><br />> That knife-stabbing music.<br /><br />> "Cabin 1".<br /><br />> "Mother...m-m-my mother, what is the phrase? She's not quite herself today."<br /><br />> Mrs. Bates in the cellar.<br /><br />> And, of course, that dreaded "shower".<br /><br />All of these set-pieces add up to the whole that is the magnificence of "Psycho".<br /><br />The video quality on this non-anamorphic DVD looks exceptionally good for an older (1998) DVD release.  You can freeze-frame an image in almost perfect, undistorted clarity anywhere on this disc (which is unusual for non-anamorphic video material), indicating a solid transfer.  The image ratio here is the Widescreen OAR (Original Aspect Ratio) of 1.85:1.<br /><br />The audio you hear comes from Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks. It would be great if there had also been a Stereo re-mix done here, so that Bernard Herrmann's always-effective music score could be "expanded" upon in the realm of Stereo (or even a Surround Sound format).  Still, this original Mono track does very well for itself.<br /><br />This single-disc DVD "Collector's Edition" of "Psycho" from Universal Studios does the movie proud. It's brimming over with fulfilling bonus supplements, including a scrumptious feature-length documentary, "The Making Of Psycho", which runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes.  This feature is chock-full of useful behind-the-scenes tidbits and goodies that should delight any fan.  I particularly enjoyed the interview segments with "Psycho" screenwriter Joseph Stefano. This "Making Of" is one of the best of its kind to ever come down the pike for any DVD release (IMO).  It's very nearly a "second" movie on this disc.<br /><br />But the producers of this Universal Digital Disc didn't stop with just placing on it a terrific and stylish movie-length documentary feature. No, there's a lot more where that came from.  The disc also contains:<br /><br />>> Newsreel Footage: "The Release Of Psycho". -- This splendid bonus, which has a run time of 7:42, is an "Advanced Press Book on Film" (a quote from this newsreel).  This feature (I assume) was distributed to theaters around the U.S.A. before the film's widespread initial release in the summer of 1960, to demonstrate, as stated in the newsreel, "the care and handling of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' ". It's a truly fascinating glimpse into the world of promotional advertising for a major motion picture, circa 1960. This short film looks sensational too.  Remarkably pristine and clear.<br /><br />>> The "Shower Scene" (with and without music).<br /><br />>> Multiple Photo Galleries, featuring gobs and gobs of great-looking production stills and poster art from the film.<br /><br />>> "Shower Scene" Storyboards.<br /><br />>> Theatrical Trailers. -- Including the Hitchcock-hosted "Tour of the 'Psycho' Set" Trailer, which is practically a "mini featurette" all by itself, sporting an elaborate running time of 6.5 minutes! One of the lengthiest trailers I can think of.<br /><br />>> Some very detailed text-only sections: "Production Notes" and "Cast And Filmmakers Biographies".<br /><br />Also included is a very handy and informative multi-page, fold-out booklet -- which has Chapter Lists for both the film and the "Making Of" (26 Chapters each), several nice photos, and some very lengthy and informative Production Notes.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />A closing word (or two).......<br /><br />This classic piece of cinema deserves to be re-visited a minimum of a couple times per year (possibly more if your nerves can tolerate the abuse). And that's easy to do with this very satisfying DVD on the shelf.  Any true collector of horror films that does NOT have this Hitchcock spine-tingler in his/her DVD collection should be "Psycho"-analyzed -- and then pointed in the direction of this Amazon webpage ASAP!  *wink*</p></br><a href="../users/A39NS429FYXAD1.html">A39NS429FYXAD1</a><br/><p>There's little new information to be gathered from any of the Special Features on this "Collector's Edition," nonetheless you must own this excellent copy of PSYCHO if you're a serious film fan.<br /><br />Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins are both splendid in their roles as Director and Star---tho' there's little resemblance between the story of Norman Bates and the terrifying true tale of Ed Gein, on whom the original novel PSYCHO was based.<br /><br />Janet Leigh is great, even if in the Special Features interviews she seems to be auditioning for the next sequel.  She deserves credit, though, for having the strangest resume of Hollywood stars.... I mean--to have the same actress in PSYCHO, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and BYE BYE BIRDIE!?!!  Bizarre!  That should wreak havoc on anyone's "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon."</p></br><a href="../users/ACO20QL72D1E6.html">ACO20QL72D1E6</a><br/><p>I`ve seen this film numerous times and I have always found it a bit cold, made without passion. Sure the shower-scene in particular is a mind-blower, but Hitchcock was much better off in the suspense-genre...  This story simply isn`t interesting enough. It reason may be that it always had a GREAT reputation and everyone who ever saw it knew if by heart and thus destroyed the first viewing of others...  Another factor is that Janet Leigh is much 2 pretty and ladylike for her role. When I saw Anne Heche in the 1998 movie I realised that H E R Marion was indeed a low-life, tramp - sort of - who jumped at the chance of doing something stupid 2 her employer. Janet Leigh`s Marion is never at any moment stupid...  Alas, Anne was much more satisfying, as were Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore. <p>John Gavin and Vera Miles are lifeless - cardboard stereotypes and that leaves us only with Martin Balsam and the great Anthony Perkins. THEY breath life into their characters and are the main reason I like this version. William Macy and Vince Vaughn repeated their roles, but eh..... hehehehe???????? Let there be silence.  In 1983, Perkins reprised his role as Norman Bates to even better effect in the splendid PSYCHO II.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>Psycho is an over-rated film which has won critical acclaim because of its shower scene. That scene was particularly daring back in the 1960's when the film was made.  A nearly nude janet leigh was the reason! Interesting trivia is that this scene comprised over 100 different camera angles.<p>Like many of Hitchcock's films, Psycho suffers from having a very 'dated' feel about it.  The characters seems stiff too.  Anthony Perkins is creepy however, and his performance is worth seeing for the film alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A32JKNQ6BABMQ2.html">A32JKNQ6BABMQ2</a><br/><p>this is so stupid i could puke!a movie based on the exploits of ed gaines.hes also the inspiration for red dragon and some other silence of the lambs.hes the guy in texas chainsaw massacre.norman bates is only created from ed.norman runs this hotel and kills whoever comes there.his dead mom is in his head encouraging him all the way.he thinks hes a chick and even dresses up like one to kill.not for the kids unless youd like them to have aids.cross dressing and prison can both point you in the right direction if thats something youre interested in.im not.f!2k that!its obviously a horror film.in fact,theres the famous shower scene where he hacks this chick up in a shower.dont get your hopes up,theres no nudity,only a silloutte of the 2 bodies and  tiny little spatter of blood.it was the most violent scene in the world at the time.theres a quote that kind of got some recognition.morman says"we all go a little crazy sometimes".thats scary to think about.theres plenty of sequels.the last one i saw showed norman as a child abuse victim as a kid.it just doesnt get any better does it?it is considered by many[not me i think it sucks]to be the greatest horror film ever.well,i can name many way better ones like childs play,a nightmare on elm st,friday the 13th,halloween,hellraiser,the all time greatest-the shining-truckloads of zombie movies.........it just sucks.(...)</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>Even after more than 40 years, and even after having seen it so many times, I am still caught up in the tension which director Hitchcock develops so carefully. I am still shocked by the famous (infamous?) shower scene and by later moments in the Bates residence. It is thus a tribute to Hitchcock, his cast, and crew that this breakthrough retains its shock value after so many years. Hitchcock requires his audience to be especially alert to seemingly insignificant details as well as to playful insertions. More often than not, we are thus aware of what his leading characters miss. The first time around, I spotted him wearing (all things) a cowboy hat but only after several viewings did I spot Ted Knight in a small role as a prison guard. Her adulterous relationship with Sam Loomis (John Gavin) notwithstanding, Janet Leigh (as Marion Crane) was never more attractive than in she is this film. Frankly, I am still trying to wipe from my memory Perkins' portrayal of Jim Pearsall in Fear Strikes Out. It is almost as painful to watch as William Bendix' portrayal of Babe Ruth. In this film, Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates.<p>Even as I saw this film again, I wanted to warn Norman's victims before it is too late.  Marion, of course, but also Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam). Don't be fooled! He really isn't the nice young man he seems to be! And for God's sake, don't go near the house! Perhaps only Hitchcock could engage and then sustain such emotions, and do so at such a high level of anxiety. That is not the case, at least for me, with The Birds. Oh sure, a few moments which still have some bite (no pun intended) but without the seamless continuity to be found in Psycho.<p>Many think this is a great film, period. I think it is among the greatest of horror films. It redefined the rules for that genre. When first released, it defied so many conventions concerning adultery, nudity, and physical violence. What it suggests is even more frightening than what it portrays visually. Spielberg must have studied this film with great care. With all due respect to several moments in Jaws when, during my first viewing, I literally came up out of my seat in terror, it is the sense of infrequently seen but ever-present danger which captures our attention from the first underwater shot at night (I can still hear the cellos) until almost the very end of the film. <p>I have seen most of the horror films which preceded this one. With only minor deviations, they tend to follow a formula. Even at an early age, I realized that violent thunderstorms with lightning illuminating a castle against the late-night sky, especially with a sound track featuring violin music, indicate that SOMETHING REALLY BAD is about to happen. The moment I became fond of a minor character, I knew that character was doomed. These films were almost completely predictable. The only question is "When?" <p>Not so with Psycho, at least when viewed for the first time. And as I indicated earlier, Hitchcock still gets me emotionally involved even if by now I almost know the screenplay by heart. How does he accomplish that? I have yet to come up with answer that satisfies me. Meanwhile, I will continue to appreciate his art and especially films of his such as this. <p>Thanks to the DVD format, both image and sound are much clearer. I also appreciate having supplementary materials such as the documentary "The making of Psycho" featuring new interviews with Janet Leigh, Hitchcock's daughter Patricia Hichtcock O'Connell, writer Joseph Stefano and Hilton A. Green; one censored scene; newsreel footage; and the shower scene both with and without music. Excellent stuff!</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is best known for its unforgettable score and infamous shower scene which at the time of its release the most graphic murder scene ever filmed.  But Psycho is so much than just a slasher film.  It is an intensely compelling psychological thriller that draws you in with its riveting plot and first rate acting.  Anthony Perkins is requisitely creepy as motel owner Norman Bates, but he adds so much more to the character.  What could have been just a one-dimensional role, Mr. Perkins approaches it with depth and makes you wonder how Norman became the man he was. Janet Leigh is striking as Marion Crane who decides to steal $40,000.00 and ends up meeting her doom at the Bates Motel.  Vera Miles, John Gavin and the great Martin Balsam all provide tremendous support.  Psycho set the standard by which all subsequent horror films are to be judged.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>One of my favorite Blu-ray purchases. The movie is a classic in so many ways and holds up after all these years. It lives up to it's title, a true psycho killer classic that set new standards in film soundtrack/scoring, cinematography and overall suspense. Undeniable style and one of Hitchcock's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Having seen this movie several times over the years, I tend to watch at it without the dread of being shocked by the shower scene.  Looking at this lustrous Blu-ray version, I noticed that when Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) drags out the body of recently slashed Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) you can see faint panty lines. Ah, the modesty of the 60's.  Hitchcock raised the bar very high with this superior horror film and proved that the genre didn't always have to be full of blood and schlock.  What was shocking in this masterpiece is that it was so startling, compounded by the music with emphasis on heavy violin work.  It was also unheard of that the "A" list star would be butchered so early in the film.  Frankly, the second murder of the private detective (Martin Balsam) is equally shocking but then he's not a naked Janet Leigh.  Perkins is brilliant as the shy Norman with a dark secret.  The byplay between him and Marion in the parlor prior to the murder is a terrific set up.  Also watch him when Sam (John Gavin) puts pressure on him later in the film.  Perhaps more than any other film, "Psycho" turned the film industry on its head and made horror films mainstream.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>Not Hitchcock's best, but probably his most commercial and well-known of all his black and white thrillers. And I do mean thriller. Even after all the copycats since, the film has lost none of its powers to evoke the most primal fears in all of us.<br /><br />Psycho is about false appearances and how we are deceived by them. How a beautiful normal looking woman can all of a sudden just snap and do something evil out of the blue. This, along with split-personality disorders, is what Psycho is all about. About the vast gulf separating those who may do something on a whim, such as cheating on their taxes, ripping a DVD, etc., and those who are genuinely psychotic.<br /><br />This is one of Hitchcock's best looking black and white films, more shades of gray as though to amplify the ambiguous nature of good and evil, that good and evil resides in all of us in various proportions.<br /><br />But philosophy and metaphor aside, Psycho is a great film for the ages created in a time where there were no gimmicks like 3D or cgi to hide behind. A classic in every sense of the word and worth the 12 bucks or so you can buy it here for. Lastly, for those who haven't seen this movie and are sitting on the fence because this is an "old" movie in black and white, remember that color had been around for decades before this movie was made and that black and white was a style choice, as it is when it's used today. There's no such thing as an old movie anyway because if you haven't seen it it's new. Plus, who'd want them to mess up a great film like this with color or, heaven forbid, 3D or cgi? Great fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Although not my favourite Hitchcock movie (that would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HMF6W">North by Northwest (50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book)</a>) fans of this his great thriller will be very happy indeed with this blu-ray transfer which has now become the definitive and best version of the movie that is currently out there.  In addition to very good special feature documentaries we get a very good 1080p picture quality transfer and an even better DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround sound quality as well albeit there is really little surround sound to appreciate from this mostly front-heavy sonic source material but still both picture and sound quality far exceed the dvd version that I previously owned.<br /><br />The problem with whodunnit's and thrillers like this though is that the original scare value and hence appreciation of the film drops off substantially once you know the ending and unless you are a film student having to write a paper on the film or a budding director trying to learn Hitchcockian technique most casual viewers may struggle to find great rewards from repeated viewing well at least that's the case for me.  There is no doubting that this is a great classic and is essential viewing if you haven't already seen it and if that's the case this blu-ray release is currently the best way to do this.  Although I've watched this a few times I can still see myself revisiting this film from time to time although not as regularly and with great anticipation as I do for other films that I do so annually such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJLCPE">Dr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray</a>] and especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] among several others that I seem to be amply rewarded with each subsequent viewing.<br /><br />Great content, great picture and sound quality as well as special features makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>Video:<br />VC-1 | 1080p | 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: DTS-HD 2.0<br />French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Cantonese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin (traditional), Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish<br /><br />Discs:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray disc<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock directed 67 titles, including more than 50 movies, but most people would rank Psycho among his five best works. It's certainly one of his most influential.<br /><br />The marketing for the movie was clever and audiences were refused admission after the show had started. Hitchcock wanted them to experience the story from start to finish. He also urged people that had seen it to avoid spoiling it for others. I mention that because I don't want to spoil the experience for you. It's 50 years old, so the following comments contain spoilers and assume that you have seen the movie. If you haven't, please stop reading now and remedy the situation as soon as possible.<br /><br />Psycho might seem a bit tame by today's standards. It was shot in black and white to lessen the impact of seeing the blood. The murders appeared brutal through the clever cuts and camera angles rather than explicitly showing flesh being cut. As with all of Hitchcock's work, what you imagine in your own mind is more frightening than what you see on the screen. To truly appreciate the impact of the movie, imagine what had gone before when this was originally released.<br /><br />Without Psycho, we may never have seen franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Saw. But unlike some of those mentioned, Psycho isn't remotely humorous. The reason is that Norman Bates, or someone like him, could exist. That's the most frightening thing about the movie. Compare it to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker for instance. The Dark Knight is elevated above every other superhero movie because it could happen.<br /><br />Hitchcock uses misdirection effectively by opening the movie as if it is a romance. Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, meets her lover and the audience assumes that she is the focus of the story. We see her steal the money and flee the city. The camera hints at her thought processes without the use of narration or dialogue, and we see her nervous reaction to harmless encounters. It's a fascinating look at how people change under stress.<br /><br />Crane eventually needs to stop for the night and we are introduced to Norman Bates and the Bates motel. The story still focuses on Crane's character, but changes dramatically after Bates attacks her in the infamous shower scene. This is usually the first scene that comes to mind when thinking about Psycho, and it's a shame in a way. The movie is so much more than a simple murder.<br /><br />The plot switches as people start to wonder what happened to Crane, leading to a second murder. We then realize that Norman Bates is the true focus of the story. He's brilliantly portrayed by Anthony Perkins and appears familiar when we first meet him. He's shy around women and outwardly calm, but he's clearly nervous when under pressure.<br /><br />Until the revelations near the end, Hitchcock cleverly lets us think that the mother exists. In a way I suppose she does. This is a sad story and Bates becomes a character we can pity. If you think things through from his point of view, his actions make sense. Wouldn't you cover up a crime committed by someone you love? There many layers to the story and several different ways to appreciate it.<br /><br />The initial setup uses well-established Hitchcock techniques and themes. He misdirects us and uses suspense. The initial focus of the story, Marion Crane, is a woman on the run. Because she's in that situation, she becomes more interesting to us. The $40,000 she steals is a MacGuffin that serves no purpose other than to give Crane's character a reason for her actions.<br /><br />Everything flows smoothly and the pacing is effective. It's hard to be bored even for a second. The term masterpiece is overused, but Psycho qualifies.<br /><br />Video Quality:<br /><br />The universal VC-1 transfer is region free and very pleasing. Detail is excellent and instances of dirt on the image are infrequent. Even though the presentation is in black and white, the upgrade is definitely warranted. Detail is incredible throughout. Take for instance the shot of Marion Crane's eye as she lies dead in the shower.<br /><br />Audio Quality:<br /><br />One of the special features goes into a detailed explanation of how the audio track was converted to 5.1 and the results are satisfying. Ambient sounds, such as rain, greatly enhance the feeling that you are immersed in the story. Dialogue is clear and Bernard Herrmann's score has never sounded better. For the purists, the original audio track is included.

It is simply the scariest movie ever made.  I saw it in the movies when I was ten years old and now, 50 years later, it is still terrifying.  I previously bought it on DVD.  However, now with the 5.1 sound and improved blu-ray picture, I've purchased it again.  And it was worth the price.  The picture is great and the 5.1 audio tremendous.  You can really hear that water coming down during the shower sequence and the rainstorm that brings Janet Leigh to the Bates Motel.  There are numerous special features including a long Making of Psycho retrospective (on the DVD as well. )  There are two new extras: a short entitled "In the Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy."  This is excellent.  There is also a special feature on the creation of the 5.1 sound heard on this blu-ray.  I also listened to the audio commentary by Stephen Rubello, author of "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho."  The commentary is excellent.  It is such a pleasure to hear an audio commentary by someone who knows what they are talking about.  I particularly enjoyed his little anecdote about how overjoyed Hitchcock was with the performance of Simon Oakland as the Psychiatrist who explains what has been happening, near the end of the film.  I thought Oakland was great and have always enjoyed that scene.  Apparently Hitchcock got up from his chair after the sequence was completed and shook Oakland's hand, telling him that he had saved his (Hitchcock's) film.  I always find anecdotes like that interesting.<br />If you have never purchased Psycho before or never seen it (if thats possible,) then this blu-ray version is the one to get.  It is one of the most famous, frequently discussed and debated and most freightening films ever made.  It still holds up today and will probably hold up forever.  I heartily recommend it.  And remember to watch it with the lights out.</p></br><a href="../users/A22BPC7LRSGSYQ.html">A22BPC7LRSGSYQ</a><br/><p>Psycho (1960), the black-and-white masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock, is one of the great movies of all time.  It certainly is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Everything about this movie was done so well - the suspense, the musical score, the wise use of black-and-white instead of color, the acting, the scariness, everything.<br /><br />The movies stars Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) has stolen $40,000 from her employer.  At one point after driving all night she pulls over on the side of the road to catch some zzzzzz's, and when the cop wakes her up the next day, she says she's in a hurry to go.  Well, she wasn't in a hurry before the cop woke her up.  I know she's just saying to the cop that she's in a hurry in order to get away from him because of her guilt over stealing the money and her desire to keep hiding it, but this scene is kind of funny.  After driving all night again, this time in the rain, she stops at a motel for some rest.  The motel is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).  His house is a short distance away from the motel.  She says to Bates that she's hungry.  Bates says he can bring her some food, and that he was just about to eat himself.  He brings the food, then she says that she really doesn't have an appetite.  Then she says to Bates that as long as he brought the food, they may as well eat it.  They go into the office to eat, but suddenly Bates isn't hungry.  I get a kick out of this.<br /><br />That's all I'm going to say.  I don't want to give away what happens.  Read other reviews if you want to find out everything that goes on in this movie.  The now infamous "shower scene" is classic, but I think the best part of the movie is when private detective Milton Arbogast (played by Martin Balsam) is questioning Norman Bates at the front desk.  The overall performance of Anthony Perkins throughout the movie is great.  He carries this movie.  Martin Balsam is also great as Milton Arbogast.  Vera Miles and John Gavin give great performances as well.  The overall atmosphere in general is one of the strong points.  The rain, the night sky, the swamp, the motel, the house........it looks like a haunted house.  In my opinion, the second half of the movie is just as strong as the first half, if not stronger.<br /><br />Some of the extras on this DVD include The Making Of Psycho documentary, a censored scene, theatrical trailers, production drawings, the shower scene with and without the music, newsreel footage, and photos from when the movie was being shot.<br /><br />If you want to watch a horror masterpiece by Hitchcock, then this is your movie.  Very highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VP7JOT3K7PFM.html">A2VP7JOT3K7PFM</a><br/><p>XXXXX<br /><br />Early in this movie the viewer is told that a boy's best friend is his mother.  Is this true??<br /><br />This movie is a suspense/horror/the first psychoanalytic thriller directed by the "master of suspense" himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is based on the novel "Psycho" by Robert Bloch, which in turn was inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.<br /><br />Briefly, this film depicts the encounter between secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is hiding in a motel after embezzling from her employer, and the motel's owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and the aftermath of their encounter.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's traditional cameo that appears early in the story.  (Note that it is difficult to find.)<br /><br />The now famous motel mentioned in the summary above is called the "Bates Motel."  It's sign is first seen just over 24 minutes into the movie.  We learn later that business is bad at the Bates' Motel since it has "twelve cabins, twelve vacancies."<br /><br />About 28 minutes into the movie, we encounter Norman Bates.  He lives with his mean, emotionally unstable, possessive, invalid mother in a now famous sinister-looking house (dubbed the Bates' Mansion) on top of a hill near the motel.  His hobby: taxidermy (that is, "stuffing things.").  He also stutters when under pressure.<br /><br />This movie has several scenes that are legendary but perhaps the most famous is the shower scene.  It occurs 46 minutes into the movie.  This unforgettable scene took seven days to film and required about seventy camera set-ups.  It lasts three minutes.<br /><br />The performance given by Anthony Perkins (as Norman Bates) is incredible.  Janet Leigh (as Marion Crane) also gives a decent performance.  In fact, both performances were so good that they both suffered from typecasting after this movie was released.  (Also look for Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and Ted Knight, best known for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," in bit parts.)<br /><br />This movie is open to many interpretations especially psychoanalytic ones.  For example, the Bates' Mansion has three floors paralleling the three levels that psychoanalysis attributes to the human mind:  (1) superego (first floor) (2) ego (ground floor) (3) id (basement).<br /><br />The background music is incredible.  It effectively adds to each scene.<br /><br />This movie had four Academy Award nominations.  It also spawned several sequels and a remake, all of which are generally seen as works of lesser quality.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released Oct. 2008) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, you have to see this movie to see why it's regarded as one of Hitchcock's best films and highly praised as a work of cinematic art by international critics!!<br /><br />(1960;  1 hr, 50 min;  wide screen;  black and white;  27 scenes; 2 discs)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>- This review pertains to the Psycho: Special Edition DVD-<br /><br />WARNING: This review may contain spoilers!<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest thriller of them all was released in June of 1960. Psycho, which was directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, quickly became a cultural phenomenon. Hitchcock shot the film in exhilarating black and white, but he only did so because he wanted to make a horror film on a small budget. Using much of his crew from his television series, Hitchcock was able to hire competent and highly skilled people without having to spend a fortune. He re-teamed with Bernard Herrmann, the brilliant composer, who had done the scores on many of Hitchcock's films. This score, in particular, became so iconic, so famous that it's impossible to separate the music from the movie. Utilizing an all-strings orchestra, Bernard Herrmann's score heightened the suspense so much that many scenes of the film were unbearably tense for audiences at the time. But that was Hitchcock's goal, to unnerve audiences to the best of his ability. Aiding Hitchcock with this fiendish task was ingenious graphic designer Saul bass, who not only created the opening title sequence but also played an integral part in the planning of the notorious "shower scene".<br />The film's screenplay was written by Joseph Stefano and was loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch. However, the film's screenplay is far superior to the novel, which is not only contrived but also shallow and manipulative.<br />Starring a superb cast headed by Janet Leigh as Marion Crane and Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the film also featured Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, and Pat Hitchcock (Alfred's daughter). Perkins' performance as Bates is electrifying in its intensity and Leigh is wonderful as the desperate Marion Crane.<br />Anyone who's ever seen Psycho will find it damn-near impossible to forget the level of tension that's created by the combined talents of the director, cast, and crew.<br />Upon its release Psycho was a huge hit, in part because of Alfred Hitchcock's clever marketing gimmicks. He specifically told theatre managers not to allow audience members into the movie theatres once the film had begun and he insisted that audiences didn't reveal the plot twists of the film. By doing this Hitchcock intentionally created a media buzz about Psycho, which only brought audiences to theatres in droves. Although given mixed reviews by critics, Psycho was received very well by filmgoers who had never seen anything quite like it. Not only has Psycho become Hitchcock's most commercially successful film, it also ushered in the age of the modern thriller.<br /><br />The story follows Marion Crane, a financially struggling secretary at a real estate firm, who steals $40,000 in cash in order to marry the man she's having an affair with. As Marion leaves town, her guilt and her paranoia take a tremendous toll on her nerves. She begins to act suspiciously and attracts the attention of a police officer and a used car salesman, but she continues her travels troubled by her conscience. She imagines the reactions of her boss, the firm's clients, her relatives, the police officer, and the car salesman. During an intense rainstorm she decides to top at a small motel. The Bates Motel seems pleasant enough. The manager, Norman bates, seems like a decent fellow, though he has an odd relationship with his demanding mother. He and Marion have a discussion about the trials and tribulations of life and the feeling of being trapped by your position in society. Norman's humility and honesty are disarming, and Marion is weighed down by the burden of her guilty conscience. She decides to return the stolen money and then takes a shower to cleanse herself, symbolically, of her sins. But then the silhouette of an old woman with a butcher's knife appears through the shower curtain. Marion is brutally murdered, and dutiful son Norman is forced to dispose of her body and her car. After Marion's bizarre disappearance her lover, Sam and her sister, Lila along with a private investigator named Arbogast, begin a search for her. But are they prepared for what they'll discover at... the Bates Motel?<br /><br />This psychotically good DVD includes an audio commentary with film historian and Hitchcock expert Stephen Rebello, The Making of Psycho feature-length documentary, In the Master's Shadow: Hitchcock's Legacy documentary, Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Lamb to the Slaughter episode, Alfred Hitchcock / Francois Truffaut interview, Newsreel Footage: The Release of Psycho, The Shower Scene: With and Without Music, The Shower Sequence: Storyboards by Saul Bass, The Psycho Archives image gallery, Posters and Psycho Ads image gallery, Lobby Cards image gallery, Behind the Scenes image gallery, Production Photographs image gallery, production notes, and trailers.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/088411077X">Psycho</a> by Robert Bloch<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCW2SY">Shadow of a Doubt</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PPI">Rear Window</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC7PPS">Vertigo</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQEHI">North By Northwest</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240236">The Birds</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ECX0RY">Frenzy</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AL733G">Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season One</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDR814">Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Two</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TXPXD2">Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Three</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>This is one of those classic movies you just wish you could have watched when it first came out in the movie theaters and you or no one else in the audience knew what was coming!  Even if you know the basic story outline complete with the big "surprise" and have seen some of the many parodies and copies of the film the original PSYCHO is a very enjoyable viewing experience for any horror/suspense fan.  From the memorable music to the perfect casting PSYCHO is truly a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>It's well worth it NOT to learn anything at all about the plot of this movie before you watch it. Part of the fantastic thrill of watching the tale unwind is learning the ins and outs of what is going on. You probably already know the keynote situation - a knife in a shower scene - but luckily that comes early on, so you don't spend half the movie wondering what it is all about.<br /><br />Many aspects make this movie spectacular and worthy of the #18 AFI top movie rating. The black and white filming makes every shadow and corner suspect. It's not a movie about gore and blood - in fact many scenes deliberately scare you without showing you what actually is going on. Your imagination supplies the activity. It's more a movie about nerves - about wondering what is going to happen, worrying about consequences.<br /><br />You can tell how amazing a movie is when, many decades later, a new director works to make a scene-by-scene reproduction of the movie with modern actors, just to help bring the story to a new generation. Viggo Mortensen fans are familiar with this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>"Psycho" is the most astounding, daring, and successful scary film ever made... Hitchcock uses pure cinema to arouse audience emotions...<br /><br />For the first forty minutes he cautiously builds up sympathy and audience identification with a troubled fugitive, a young estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who wants to marry Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but neither can afford it... Entrusted, by a wealthy customer, with $40,000 to put in a safe deposit box in a bank, she succumbs to temptation and steals the money in order to start a new life with her lover... So the motive is love!<br /><br />We begin to feel the tension when she's spotted - leaving Phoenix, Arizona - by her boss who thinks she remains in bed with a headache... Then, when she pulls off the highway to take a nap and is awaken by a suspicious patrolman - in disturbing dark glasses - who trails her... Hitchcock's trademark-- paranoia about the police is here at his best...<br /><br />Frightened and tired by a violent rainstorm, she stops at Bates Motel and has a small talk with a twitchy cordial motel keeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins-in an outstanding performance), an attractive shy young man who seems uneasy around her and can't even bring himself to pronounce the world bathroom...<br /><br />The movie turns dark and claustrophobic when she overheard the voice of Norman's mother speaking sharply with her son, and after she learns Norman's strong devotion to his irritable mother...<br /><br />Alone in the room, she strips to shower... Safe and relaxing, the hot air rises as the water cascades over her... Suddenly she turns at a sound, her eyes dilate with horror and her repeated screams rend the air as a hand from nowhere holding a long knife plunges it repeatedly into her body... Her blood, mingling with the water, flushes down the drain in one of the most terrifying images of modern cinema...<br /><br />No one who saw the film will forget the shock effect of that scene... Not only because of its terrifying realism, with the blood gushing and swirling on the shower floor; but also because Leigh was a sympathetic and star figure... Although she had stolen, we felt involved with her (as we were involved with Marnie); we wanted her to get away; and here, with two-thirds of the film still to got we watched helplessly as the life and the beauty and the hopes were butchered out of her...<br /><br />The movie is only off one third when Hitchcock's spiral close-up of her unmoving eyeball reveals the nightmare... But the movie does really begin after her murder because once she is killed, we never stop thinking about her...<br /><br />With Marion Crane gone, our attention is shift to the sensitive Norman with a passion for birds and mother... They are very close and he guards her jealousy...<br /><br />As three people began to investigate, our sympathies were subtly maneuvered to the good-looking young man who, it seemed, must try to protect a homicidal mother... We see him distraught, cleaning up and disposing of Marion's car, with her body and cash, into a swamp...<br /><br />We have no reason to think that he himself have done the dirty work... So could his crippled old mother be the vicious murderer? Or do we have some other reason to suspect that Norman's abusive mother does not exist? We heard the old woman talking constantly to him and we see Norman carrying her to the cellar... Or is it another Hitchcock's trick? But the knife comes out again striking and killing... The high angle shot shows perfectly her mad menacing rush from her bedroom...<br /><br />Hitchcock's version is definitive, a terrifying insinuating thriller with only two sudden and vicious murders... A classic essential cinema with his rich, vivid and effective imagery in the use of light and shadow; his voyeurism when Perkins spies on Leigh in a black bra (The first time he shows a lady disrobed); his 'metaphysical vertigo' in the overhead shot as Norman drags his mother down to the cellar...</p></br></body></html>

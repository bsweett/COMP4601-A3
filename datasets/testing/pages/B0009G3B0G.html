Or those movies where the last 20 or so minutes of the film baffle you with their sweet emotionally profound dialogues? Films where your head is in such a state of whirl that you're almost gutted with beauty?<br /><br />Well, The Jacket made me stand up and clap. The last half hour of the film is not only gripping but it shows why Adrien Brody is who he is. There is something queer about the look in his eye and his imperfect yet perfect nose or is it just me. His smile,whether you like it or not, is powerful in it's depiction of both mystery and the opposite.<br /><br />The Jacket is a calm yet gravitating film. The direction is intelligent and the sets are just apt to portray the film and it's characters. It did remind me a bit of Butterfly Effect, Back To The Future and in some ways, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.<br /><br />The only slight drawback of the film is Keira Knightley's acting. Otherwise, it's a certain 9/10<br /><br />Anyhow, just so you can compare and understand why you need "the jacket" (I own the dvd now)<br /><br />Imdb.com Rating - 6.9/10 [geez the opinionated world :) ]<br /><br />My Rating  - 8.5/10 [watch asap,ignore haters and philistines]</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>You know Adrien Brody's Gulf War veteran is in a bad way in The Jacket not just because he's been shot in the head and sent to Kris Kristofferson's asylum for the criminally insane for a murder he didn't commit, but because Jennifer Jason Leigh is the most normal member of staff there. In that context, being pumped full of drugs, put in a straitjacket and left in a morgue drawer that allows him to project himself into the future to unravel the mystery of is imminent death seems almost straightforward. Yes, we're in Jacob's Ladder territory here (once upon a time it even had the same ending) without ever approaching that film's complexity or emotional power. The result is not so much bad as okay. Brody and Daniel Craig are fine, but the gimmick casting of Keira Knightley in the kind of damaged goods part that Leigh used to be able to do in her sleep doesn't really work. While it's the closest she's give to a decent performance yet, it's still all surface affectations - some of them good - but no substance, which takes away from the heart the film both wants and needs. Mildly satisfying but not outstanding.<br /><br />The extras package is small but good, with the deleted scenes and alternate endings put into perspective by the acompanying documentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>Jack appeared to have died in the gulf War, but then, did he die?  He wound up walking along a road in Maine where he met a girl and her mother, but when a cop was killed, did he do it?<br /><br />He was sent to a hospital for the criminally insane.  His treatment included being drugged and placed in a mortuary locker in a straight jacket, where he had out-of-body experiences and saw the past, and the future, or did he?<br /><br />This apparently cruel treatment, being locked in a morturary locker, seems to have worked by putting Jack in another dimension, and allowing him to solve otherwise unsolvable problems in his mind.<br /><br />At the end of the movie he was able to lock himself into a future existence through the straight jacket and the locker, but was that real, or was it in his mind, and did it matter?<br /><br />In some odd way, this movie reached a positive, if not uplifting conclusion.  It took a while to get there and I'm not all that sure it was worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>While not a solid knock out, this film still delivers quite a punch mostly because of the dedicated performances by Adrian Brody & Keira Knightley.  The story revolves around Jack (Brody), a Golf veteran who suffers a fatal wound in the war only to wake up after experiancing death having a dysfunctional memory.  A year after his death he meets a young girl and her mother after their car breaks down.  He fixes the car and forms a bond with the girl before he's chased away by the mother.  Then he hitches a ride from a cop killer and winds up taking the fall due to his unreliable memory and he's admitted into a pshyciatric ward.  This is where some crazy $#!+ goes down.  Kris Kristopherson plays a doctor experimenting with his patients, using some strange drugs and even stranger methods he has Jack strapped into a straight-jacket of sorts and contains him in a morgue drawer reserved for the dead.  Inside this drawer Jack begins to see the future, his future in the year 2007 (by the way this movie takes place in 1992) where he meets a woman named Jackie (played by Knightley in what may be her most complex and satisfying role to date) who claims that he is dead.  Jack Starks is dead.  He died Jan. 1st 1993.  It's Dec. 24th 1992.  "How much time to we have?"  "Not long."  The rest of the movie is an edge of your seat, what are they going to find, how did he die, can he prevent it type of thriller.  Jack has to make choices involving his life in 1992 that will change the outcome in 2007, if not for himself, for Jackie.  The film, the story, the overall feel of the film is exciting, while a little strange and very inprobable, but the acting on both Brody & Knightleys parts as well as great supporting rols in Kristopherson and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  This movie I believe is very underated and is actually a decent movie with decent thrills and charactors you care so much about that you disregard the flaws as minor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Singing Detective) stars as Jack Starks, a veteran who got shot in the head and miraculously survived. One day on the road, he meets a little girl and her mother as he fixes their car for them. Then, he is thrown into a mental place, led by doctor Kris Kristofferson (Blade Trilogy, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries) and the good doctor puts Brody in a straight jacket and shoves him in a small compartment. Brody goes all crazy until he finds out he can go into the future and that's where he meets actress Keira Knightley (Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Hole). Brody finds out that Knightley is the little girl he helped out on the road. Suddenly, he finds out that he dies and he goes forward into the future to try to figure out who killed in and how he died. Interesting premise anchored by Adrien Brody's performance. Kristofferson is really creepy as the doctor. Also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh (In The Cut, Backdraft), Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Sylvia) and Kelly Lynch (Road House, Mr. Magoo)</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>The Jacket boasts some solid acting, and has a wonderfully edgy ensemble cast; it's just a pity that the movie is such a hodgepodge of different genres. Part horror, time travel, romance, medical and war drama, with a thriller narrative at its core, there's no doubt that The Jacket is  imminently watchable, but it's hampered by its slick, stylish, and psuedo art-house self-importance.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from a number of different genres, The Jacket tells the story of Jack Starks (Adrien Brody). Jack has just taken a bullet to the brain in the Persian Gulf War and he is pronounced dead. But he somehow survives and is shipped home to Vermont suffering from amnesia. The last thing he remembers is walking up a snowy road and stopping to help an alcoholic mom, Jean (Kelly Lynch) and her little daughter when their truck stalls.<br /><br />He then hitches a ride with a stranger (Brad Renfro), who is pulled over by a highway patrolman. The stranger kills the cop, and Jack blacks out, only to wake up to accusations he killed the officer. Deemed mentally ineffectual, Jack is shipped off to a psychiatric hospital where he is tortured, mistreated, and filled with psychoactive drugs courtesy of the malevolent Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson).<br /><br />Becker is convinced that only through such radical treatments will Jack be cured of his propensity towards violence. He even puts Jack through a curative cycle that has him intermittently strapped in a straitjacket, placed on a gurney and wheeled into a morgue-like slot for solitary confinement in the dark. These treatments stir up Jack's sporadic visions and he begins to trip back and forth in time, from 1992 to 2007.<br /><br />In 2007 Jack connects with Jackie (Kira Knightley). Jackie is living an aimless, and sad life, working as a waitress in a local coffee shop. She's lonely and unhappy, her mother having recently died; she's also taken to drinking heavily. At first, she is wary of Jack and his time traveling story, but she agrees to help him unravel the mystery of his past, eventually becoming his supportive love interest.<br /><br />The secure and principled Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) perhaps holds the key to unlocking Jack's enigmatic dilemma. Did he really die, or is he a ghost, inexplicably traveling through time? Can fellow prisoner Mackenzie (Daniel Craig), a fellow patient who has tried several times to murder his wife, also help Jack unlock the mysteries of the jacket?<br /><br />The initial premise is interesting, but the story is too elaborate and complicated, and most viewers will probably walk away scratching their heads at the rather inadequate resolution to the story. The Jacket is also not really sure what it wants to be - it starts out as an icy, hard-hitting, and uncompromising thriller about medical abuse, but soon morphs into an otherworldly and ghostly love story.<br /><br />Plus director, John Maybury lays it all on a bit thick. There's the usual relentless and loud electronic sound design and an unremitting, choppily edited (and strangely unimaginative) visual format that projects Jack's memories and terrors onto his shaking eyeball. It's all rightfully unsettling at first, but soon leaves one feeling exhausted and somewhat worn-out after the first hour.<br /><br />On the plus side, the performances are pretty solid, with Brody gaining the lion's share of the acting kudos. He imbues Jack with a jumpy and nervy paranoia and manages to bring a strong conviction to even the most silliest moments in the story.<br /><br />The Jacket is an average slice of gothic horror that "twists genres as intentionally as it bends time." But don't let the exemplary cast full you; it's really just a movie with a slick production design masquerading as mediocrity.

Doctors soon see is alive and treat him.  A year later, he is home, and physically healed.  Mentally, he is not quite 100%.  While wandering down a country road, he helps a little girl and her mom, and then hitchhikes a ride from another driver who gets him involved in a shooting.  Once again he is injured, and soon finds himself in the Alpine Grove Psychiatric Hospital for the criminally insane.<br /><br />There, Dr. Becker (Kristofferson) begins unorthidox experiments on him.  Dr. Becker puts him in a straightjacket, drugs him, and throws him into a morgue drawer.  "You can't break something that is already broken."  In the drawer, he travels 15 years into the future and meets up with Jackie (Knightley), the girl he helped on the roadside.  She begins to help him solve a mystery about his future and perhaps even her own.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is good as the tormented Gulf War vet trying to figure out exactly what is happening to him.  Keira Knightley also gives a good performance as the woman tormented by her past.  "The Jacket" is a pleasantly bizarre and thought provoking movie.  It providw no definite answers, and encourages the viewer to come to their own conclusions.  That is a rarity in movies these days, and what director John Maybury has done is refreshing.  This is not a perfect movie, but it is a very good one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>The Jacket brings to the screen the story of a Persian Gulf War veteran who ends up in an asylum for the criminally insane for a crime that he didn't commit.  However, all is not what it seems in the mental hospital...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good, the plot is interesting (if not far fetched), while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I used to hate keira Knightly since I first saw her in "Bend it like Beckham" and her face made me nervous each time I saw her. but in this movie she was a very pretty young lady. I liked her. is this the only strong point of this movie? no it's not! this is one of the best time thrillers I've ever seen. In contrary with some people thoughts, It's not a suspense horror or a real thriller movie although it's not a drama too. best term for this movie is "Science Fiction". whatever, it was perfect and defectless. scenario was very accurate and cliffhanging! actings were brilliant. Torturing brody in that lunatic assylum really made sense and made me change my belief that assylum is better than prison. me, myself if someday stand behind a court for murder trial. prefer not to pretend that I was a maniac and accept the punishment, whatever i'll be, execution or long time prison! assylum is the worst atonement that anyone can get!<br /><br />the only problem in this movie, maybe not a problem, more missundertanding, is the character of Babak Yazdi and his mother. I'm a persian myself and they were soppose to be persians though. Persians are not black like most of indians or arabs. Persian race is a pure white race and most of them are white and color of their heir vary from dark brown to blonde. their dark skin is most cause of the sun, not their race and even dark skin persians are beautiful people, like spanish or italian people. so I think when they want to show a persian boy, they must show a real persian not an indian or Arab like and not even a persian from some minority races. persia is not like america and people there, are not too familiar with other races. and the name of his mother, Jamileh, it's not a common name in persia. I've not heard one myself since my mother's aunt died 20 years ago. so this is the fact that filmmakers who want to use persians in their movies better remember!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>On the surface, The Jacket appears to be a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest-style psychological thriller.  But it might just be a time-traveling religious meditation on the afterlife, more along the lines of Jacob's Ladder.<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is clearing out a village during the Gulf War when a child soldier shoots him in the head. Returning to Vermont in 1992, he suffers from bouts of amnesia, wandering aimlessly along a road until he happens upon a drunk woman and her daughter. After helping them both, he hitches a ride with a suspicious character that ends up being bad news. Before Starks knows it, he's been shot once again with a bullet to the head.  That's two bullets to the head for those of you counting at home.<br /><br />Starks is indicted for murder but his amnesia leaves him bereft of a coherent thought or much of a defense.  He is instead committed to a mental institution where Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) regularly terrorizes poor Starks by wrapping him in a straight jacket (hence the name) and stuffing him in a morgue drawer. Makes sense, right?<br /><br />While inside the drawer, Starks begins to hallucinate - or, depending on your perspective, time travel - and he encounters people who look oddly familiar from his past life. Throughout the dreamy, often disconnected scenes of The Jacket, actors show up in different roles to keep us guessing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Jacket is a dreamy hodgepodge of flashes: backwards, forwards, and sideways. Depending on your interpretation, Starks is actually time traveling, experiencing a trial of the soul, or simply working through his issues before he dies. While the movie proscribes to all these possibilities (there are multiple endings on the DVD), they are a series of unsatisfying choices.  Each of them punishes the viewer for investing time in the film.<br /><br />SPOILER JACKET:  If Starks is hallucinating, the film has no impact at all because nothing matters.  If Starks is time traveling, the  movie becomes an exercise in absurdity in which he's hit not once, not twice, but three times in the head; more apt for a Three Stooges episode. If Starks is dead (my preferred ending), then it's possible that he's not actually influencing anyone but merely working his way through limbo. It diminishes his selfless acts, which are ultimately really about saving himself.<br /><br />The Jacket tries to keep viewers guessing by making every possible ending the "right" one, but ends up leaving everybody unsatisfied.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a man with very, very bad luck: he is shot in the head by a young boy while on duty in Iraq during the Gulf War: hence the great tag line for "The Jacket": I first died when I was 27.<br />Does Jack die again? Or does he die at all? What, if anything is that neverland that exists, or doesn't exist between life and death? Director John Maybury ("Love is the Devil: Study of a Portrait of Francis Bacon") has a tall order to fill, as it were in "The Jacket."  This film doesn't really get going until about midway through when a couple of things happen. First of all the plot starts to make a little sense...i.e. we start to buy into it and you start to realize that Adrien Brody is an exceptionally talented and charismatic actor and you're willing, at that point, to go anywhere he is taking you.<br />Brody, part prophet, part Jesus figure, part Everyman is the key here because without him this film would quickly dive into a bottomless pit of contrivance and you would not suspend your disbelief: which for this film would be a major problem as there are inconsistencies big enough to fill an 18 wheeler.<br />Where there are no problems though, are in the physical production itself: "The Jacket" is gorgeous to look at...the bleached-out color, the jazzy jump editing both add to the overall creepiness of the film in general.<br />Keira Knightley plays her first American here and she is good, in a smudgy, alternative, damaged way as Jackie: a woman with whom Jack meets several times in the film. What's amazing is the hair and makeup people have succeeded in making this quintessential English Rose into Christina Ricci in looks and attitude.<br />"The Jacket" is not perfect by any means but it is ultimately effective and thought provoking. And though Adrien Brody once again plays a character that is more sinned against than sinning he saves the day with his empathetic, beautifully realized and centered performance as Jack Sparks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8D1VN3MVB6F.html">A2G8D1VN3MVB6F</a><br/><p>This movie was watched on an afternoon where I was not at work. I wished I was at work because work makes my head hurt less than this movie did. It involves a Gulf War veteran who comes home and is framed for the death of a state trooper. He cannot explain what happened, and he is locked up for being criminally insane. When he is being treated he is locked in the morgue, but while he is he begins to travel through time. He gets a girlfriend, but she is someone he met when he is nine. It is all very complex, but that is not the problem. The problem is not bad acting. It is bad filming and poor editing. Heck, even Knightly is good. If you find this on TV it is worth a watch, but not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>It is 1991, the time of the Gulf War. Adrien Brody plays a soldier who gets shot in the head by a boy and is taken to the hospital.<br /><br /> While at the hospital he is pronouced dead but then somewhat unexplainable happens. Jack Starks (Brody) winks his eyes. Apparently he is alive.<br /><br /> In is now 1993 and we see Starks walking along an empty road. He comes across a younger girl and her mother. Whom at the moment is incapaciated. Their car has broken down and Starks takes it upon himself to help them out. He talks to the girl and finds out their names are Jean and Jackie. Soon the mother wakes up and sees Starks talking to her daughter. She panics, for all she knows this guy could be a child molester. The mother and daughter leave.<br /><br /> And once again Starks finds himself alone on the road. This time he picks up a ride from an unknown person. They drive awhile and a cop stops them. The cop is killed and Starks is arrested.<br /><br /> While on trial Starks in found not guilty due to insanity. He is thought to suffer from illusions.<br /><br /> At the hospital doctors, headed by Kris Kristofferson (Dr. Becker) do test on Starks. They tie him up, put him in a straight-jacket and place him in a morgue. While in there he has visions. After the second or third time he meets Jackie (Keira Knightly) in the future. It is now 2007. There he learns about his own fate and all the people he knows.<br /><br /> That is pretty much the set-up for this John Maybury film, "The Jacket". I suppose when I decsribe the movie to you it sounds interesting but really its not that good of a movie.<br /><br /> I admit I went along with the movie but so many questions are left unanswered. The questions aren't even hinted at. And if you are unable to go along with the movie your enjoyment will be ruined. But what are these questions I felt needed answers? Well, what exactly is this jacket? Who made it? Why is Starks able to see into the future? What do these doctors hope to accomplish? How long has this been going on? Has it ever worked? Do the doctors know these people are able to see into the future or does each person ahve a different reaction? But since the movie does not want to get give us details you have to ask yourself, how much are you willing to accept?<br /><br /> I suppose Brody is good in his role and Knightly as well. But the movie never really allows us to care for these people. If I was interested in the movie it is not because these characters are fascinating, it is because of the action.<br /><br /> You can see a lot of amazon viewers enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it is as good as most are saying. I found "The Jacket" to be poorly written and poorly directed but it is goofy, silly, fun entertainment that can be enjoyed if you remember to shut your brain off.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Mixed bag entertainment but has its moments. Has an interesting premise don't doesn't fully develope it. Leaves a lot unanswered but either you accept the movie on its terms or you can shut it off.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>What's the difference between 1993 and 2007?  I don't know, they look exactly the same.  If only there could have been a way to distinguish the two eras visually, because as the movie stands now, you wind up not even caring if he's still alive in 1993 or travelling to 2007.  All they did was have little Jackie a child in one era, and a fetching young woman in another.<br /><br />I don't know, to me it was a little creepy that Adrien Brody meets the little girl when she's, what, 8?  And instantly he's touching her like crazy.  Her mother, Kelly Lynch, notices this, and screams like a shrew at him.  She's unsympathetic, but she's right on target.  In subsequent scenes it's clear he can't take his hands off little Jackie.  And then to have her grow up and fall in love with Jack all over again, what's with that?  I expected him to say, "I've been waiting for this since you were eight" when they fall into bed together (yuck, and he reveals his nasty little skinny emaciated rib body, i guess she didm't look south of his nose).<br /><br />However, THE JACKET made you think and that's a plus.  I just wonder if the screenwriters bit off more than they could chew.  The mystery of how Adrien Brody was able to cure the little autistic boy never did get solved, it continues to mystify on a mobius strip of time.  "How did you know?"  "You told me--in the future."  "You were the one to tell me--in 1993."  And what about that mysterious head trauma?  Once Adrien Brody realizes he's going to die of a head trauma in 4 days, he ransacks heaven and earth, past and present, to find out who dealt the blow.  Once you see it happen, you're like, "That's it?"<br /><br />On the plus side, Daniel Craig is out of this world and looks, in the madhouse scenes, just like the middle-aged Jack Kerouac.  Mackenzie Phillips is great.  Kelly Lynch looks super, they should have added her to the cast of BASIC INSTINCT II.<br /><br />What about Brad Renfro, poor thing?  Was he supposed to be in the movie longer?  Maybe in the original script Brody would track him  down and find out what really happened in the car with that cop.  But maybe working with Renfro wasn't as much fun as the filmmakers thought it would be.<br /><br />It was great having Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, in such a prominent supporting role, and then, as the credits play, you hear David Arnold's treatment of one of the great Bond theme songs, "We Have All The Time in the World," as sung by Iggy Pop!  Coincidence?  Or time travel?</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I rented this movie last night and I was expecting a very good movie. That's exactly what I got, but it was different than I had expected. If you watched the theatrical trailer (there's one on the DVD), this movie looks like it's going to be highly freaky and maybe even a horror movie. But the movie actually is a drama with suspensful moments. Adrien Brody gives an amazing perfromance as Jack Starks, a man that had a highly awful life besides the times where he was with the beautiful Jackie played by Keira Knightley. The movie opens with Starks getting shot in the head while in Iraq. Afterwards, he fixes the car of a drunk mother named Jane and her adorable daughter named Jackie. Jack leaves and gives his dogtags to Jackie. Following this, he's picked up by a driver as it's freezing out (winter). But, then, he finds himself in a mental institution. What happened was that the driver shot a cop and Jack and left the gun next to Jack's body before leaving. Jack though says that he already died in Iraq which lands himself in a mental institution. There, he's shoved in a straight jacket and put in a "drawer" where they leave him for a very long time. The doctors also drug him. When Jack is there, the movie is the most interesting, as you see his fear. He screams, cries, and sees scenes from the past. But, then, he basically time travels to the future while inside the straight jacket and inside the drawer. There, he is in the year 2007 where he is picked up by a lady named Jackie who's troubled, depressed, smokes, and drinks. While at her house, he finds his dogtags, and freaks out. He tells her that he's Jack Starks, and that she was the little girl for whom he had fixed her mom's car but she also freaks and tells him that Jack Starks died in 1993. She then tells him to leave. Jack then goes back to the present where he realizes that he must go back in that jacket to prevent his death, with Jackie's help. The movie itself is brilliantly ade, from the times where Jack's in the institution, to the times where he's in the future. The movie is depressing and disturbing because what is done to Jack is horrid. It made me very mad and sad to see such things done to a human being. This movie also has a beautiful ending which I really liked. (It wasn't your ordinary ending that you see in most movies) If you think that you'll be scared after watching the preview, you won't because it isn't scary, but the straight jacket thing probably will make you mad and sad. If you're hoping to watch lots of action, there barely is any. The movie is very well made and you'll probably think about the ending and certain points in the movie. It's really neat to see Jack in the future, seeing doctors and friends from the present, even though they're 15 years older, while he's still at the same age. Well, enough said, and by now I hope that I have encouraged everyone to see this remarquable masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A38N7SFDOB3MR3.html">A38N7SFDOB3MR3</a><br/><p>I found The Jacket to be very entertaining, and worth watching a second time.

Anyway i didnt like this movie.<br /><br />Most will like the movie i mean its an ok movie but just reminds me to much of a movie made from taking ideas from other great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Here lately, the best way to find the boldest, darkest, most intellectually challenging films is to follow Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Having watched The Machinist and The Jacket back to back, I feel a whole lot better about the future of motion pictures than I used to.  There are actually scriptwriters and directors out there that are almost as dark and twisted as I am.  Of course, The Jacket is primarily a showpiece for Adrien Brody, who gives a marvelous, haunting performance as Jack Starks, an ill-fated man who comes to know the past through the future - it's rather complicated (but it all makes sense in the end).<br /><br />Starks' problems begin when a little Iraqi kid plugs him in the head as his unit is trying to control a crowd during a combat mission in the Gulf War.  He is left for dead and may in fact have died (but I don't want to get into a tricky metaphysical discussion on this point).  Then, it's a year later and we see Jack walk down a wintry road and help a woman and daughter get their car started - a seemingly innocuous event but one of great importance in this story.  Then Jack bums a ride with a stranger, the car gets pulled over by a policeman, and the next thing Jack knows, he's on trial for killing a cop.  No one believes his story, much of which he doesn't remember anyway, and there's no denying the fact that he suffered a serious head injury in the war, so he ends up being confined in a mental institution for the criminally insane.  There are definitely some insane people at the institution - unfortunately, some of them are on the staff.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out who told Kris Kristofferson he could act, but he shows up here as Dr. Mengel- uh, I mean Dr. Becker.  His idea of treatment is shooting Jack up with some kind of hallucinatory drug, confining him in a straight jacket (you didn't think the title referred to a Members Only jacket, did you?), and shutting him up in a morgue drawer for hours on end.  As a claustrophobic, that gives me all kinds of heebie jeebies, let me tell you.  The thing is, though, that Jack starts seeing things while he's stuck in there - fragmented memories come at him a mile a minute, and in time he begins to see the future.  He meets up with the little girl (Jackie) he helped earlier in the film (who grew up quite nicely into Keira Knightley) - only it's 2007, which is fifteen years in Jack's future.  Actually, you can't really say it's Jack's future because he finds out that he died (or will die) on New Year's Day of 1993.  Finding out you're dead is a bit of a shock, of course, so he tries to find out exactly how he died - his only hope to learn the truth is his link to 2007 and Jackie - and he can only see that future world while he is in the jacket and in that dark place.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a less evil doctor in the institution who comes to share a special bond with Jack (one she is reluctant to accept at first).  Hey, it's not easy for a guy in a mental institution to convince one of his doctors that he is seeing the future.<br /><br />Things get rather complicated, as you might imagine, but the movie handles the time issue wonderfully, and the whole movie really does make perfect sense.  Maybe they stretch things a tad at the very end, but it's not a problem.  The Jacket isn't for everyone; it's too dark and mysterious to satisfy those looking for pure entertainment.  For the serious-minded viewer who loves dark sojourns into the depths of human thought and possibilities, however, The Jacket is a movie you'll be telling all of your like-minded friends about.</p></br><a href="../users/A35YWA2V4QHOJ3.html">A35YWA2V4QHOJ3</a><br/><p>Here is a rather horrifying thought:  how would you like it if someone put you in a straight jacket, bound your feet, then put you in the drawer of a morgue and left you there for hours?  What's that you, you say?  You'd rather not sample that particular adventure?  Neither would I.  However, it's the basic premise of this movie.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the movie actually turns out to be rather upbeat in spite of this fact.  Of course, it's upbeat in a rather twisted, bizarre sort of way.  It is kind of a cross between a ghost story and a time travel movie.  And, yes, the movie is as weird as that sounds, although weird doesn't make it not worth seeing.<br /><br />Of course, the biggest feature of this film is Keira Knightley.  She adds a great deal of flavor to a movie that looks for all the world like it's going to be a real downer.<br /><br />If you're into movies that are not afraid to be classified as "experimental," you may well want to check this one out. If you're not claustrophobic, you will be perfect for viewing this film!!</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Despite it's somewhat flawed visual style, the Jacket is for the most part a surprisingly good atmospheric thriller in the vein of Jacob's Ladder.  Adrien Brody stars as mentally scarred Gulf War veteran Jack Starks, who finds himself being experimented on by a mysterious doctor (Kris Kristofferson) who binds him in a strait jacket and locks him up.  During his time inside, Jack realizes he's traveling back and forth through time, and while he's doing this he has a chance encounter with a self-destructive, chain smoking waitress (Keira Knightley) and tries to figure out just how it is he will die.  The film goes along more smoothly than the summary you've just read, with Brody and Knightley in particular giving memorable turns.  The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Brad Renfro, Kelly Lynch, and new James Bond Daniel Craig, are solid as well.  All in all, the Jacket doesn't have the smarts that it aspires to be, but for the most part, you won't do much better in terms of mainstream mind bending cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>Jack Starks (Adrian Brody) is a veteran of the 1st Gulf War who has recently returned to the States after surviving a gunshot to the head. Suffering from bouts of amnesia, Jack drifts aimlessly around the country trying to find meaning for his recent experiences and his very existence.  After helping a young woman and her precocious daughter repair their stalled vehicle, Jack hitches a ride with a small-town good-ol'-boy.  Soon after--or at least as far as Jack's concerned it is soon after--Jack wakes up to find himself accused of murdering a police officer, an event for which he has absolutely no recollection.<br /><br />Jack is tried for the crime but declared innocent by reason of insanity, and the presiding judge subsequently sentences Jack to a mental hospital for the criminally insane.  It is there that resident shrink Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) subjects Jack to a highly experimental treatment that involves the use of a mind-bending drug, a straightjacket, and a makeshift sensory-deprivation chamber (actually a cadaver drawer in the hospital morgue).  However, something unusual about Jack's mental configuration--the script is never explicit, but it is implied that Jack's war wound has altered his brain chemistry--causes him to time travel whenever he undergoes Dr. Becker's medical voodoo, and he always arrives in 2007 in the vicinity of a particular individual from his past.<br /><br />Each time he visits the future, Jack learns important information about the "present" that will help him to ultimately improve the lives of some of his acquaintances, as well as unravel the truth behind Dr. Becker's unorthodox treatments and thereby initiate the shrink's well-deserved downfall.<br /><br />Mystery and mind-bending puzzles abound in THE JACKET, and the film is one of those dark psychological thrillers that requires the audience to use its grey matter.  (Perhaps that is one reason it didn't fare so well at the box office?)  Yes, it does sometimes confuse and baffle, and the question of the reality (or lack thereof) of Jack's time-traveling trips isn't really answered until the final scene (or is it?).<br /><br />Director John Maybury and screenwriter Massy Tadjedin have together created a film that really defies categorization.  Cinema buffs will most certainly see elements and influences from such film greats as SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE (1972), ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975), and TWELVE MONKEYS (1995), and it's not hard to discern the similarities to TV shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE, THE OUTER LIMITS, and THE X-FILES. But it is still impossible to pigeon-hole THE JACKET.  Is it a science fiction flick? A drama?  An action thriller or a love story?  In truth, it is all these combined, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />THE JACKET is replete with great visuals and has an interesting narrative style.  Best of all, it is populated with numerous interesting and accomplished actors.  Adrian Brody delivers a very affecting performance as the confused and angst-ridden protagonist Jack Starks.  He is able to relay intense emotion with facial expressions every bit as much as he can through dialogue, and this is important in a movie such as this.  Portraying the young woman who is the locus of Starks' trips into the future, Keira Knightley gives one of her very best performances to date, and the young Brit's American accent is dead on.  In supporting roles, Kris Kristofferson covers his Dr. Becker with a slimy patina that no other actor could as effectively create, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, as always, melts completely into her role and is quite convincing as the sympathetic and caring Dr. Lorenson.<br /><br />The DVD from Warner Home Video offers a crisp, clean digital transfer of THE JACKET in anamorphic widescreen at the film's original aspect ratio with very good Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  Bonus features include a Project History featurette that includes deleted and restored shortened scenes, the original trailer, and a featurette that focuses on the special FX and visual design of the film.  All in all, this DVD is well worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I did buy this for someone else, but because the story intrigued me, I wanted to watch it too! I'd never got around to seeing it when it was released, so I thought I'd give it a go, although I was ready to dig my claws into Keira's performance.<br /><br />The story is about Adrien Brody, who plays a guy who gets shot in the head in Vietnam, and returns home. He then hitches a lift, but gets knocked out, and finds himself in court for killing a police officer. He then gets sent to a mental institution (which was actually Bangour Village Hospital in Scotland, not too far from where I live). There, he meets a sadistic doctor, who locks him in a morgue drawer on a regular basis.<br /><br />From here, the film gets complicated (but not as much as I expected) as Adrien's character travels forward in time into the future, where he meets Keira Knightley's character, and knows her from somewhere.<br /><br />I won't reveal too much more about the story, as you really have to watch it for yourself. But it's definitely an intriguing story, and very out there.<br /><br />I thought Adrien did a brilliant job the way he portrayed his confused character. There's quite a few crying scenes, which made me nearly start crying myself! There's also loads of closeup shots of eyes and stuff, which makes the viewer notice emotions more.<br /><br />I was surprised at Keira, she's mostly known for her period drama roles, and the press about her weight, nearly always overshadows what film role she's doing. The Jacket shows she can do something other than wear a corset, and play an interesting character at the same time. (Even if she does appear topless in the bath, a scene which is completely unnecessary to the film.) Plus, it's the best she's looked in a film yet. She looked stunning in most of the scenes, despite she was playing a reasonably awful looking character.<br /><br />The supporting cast are also excellent. Jennifer Jason Leigh was good, although her role could have been extended and the glasses just didn't work. The late Brad Renfro also appears. And also, Daniel Craig appears, and I spent the entire film insisting that was NOT Daniel Craig. (How wrong I was.) The past couple of years, we've been used to seeing him as suave and sophisticated Mr Bond, who can make the women weak at the knees. But in this, his image is completely different, to the point where I actually didn't recognise him. Oh my god, I still can't actually believe it's him.<br /><br />The Jacket is a film to be added to any film collection, it's really enjoyable, and will also get the brain working - I need it! Adrien Brody was absolutely brilliant, he made the film in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>There is a certain untreated condition going around nowadays, and for some reason it often seems to attack contemporary filmgoers, as some of the negative reviews of this fine film will attest.  This condition is called Limited Imagination.  What once made Americans such avid fans of television shows like The Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, and Thriller appears to have faded a bit with time.  We can only hope that a few thousand bad apples (or stale apples, to put it more aptly), cannot ruin the entire bunch.<br /><br />That said, "The Jacket" is weird cinema at it's finest; while there may be some stereotypical themes in it (a strange man lacking memory) and oft used plot twists (time reversal), it transcends "The Butterfly Effect", "Memento", and a good deal of what passes for loopy film nowadays.<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives a powerhouse performance as Jack Starks, a Gulf War Veteran wrongly accused of murdering a sherrif while trekking his way back home, recovering from a near fatal headshot in the war.  What I think helps make "Jacket" more than your typical exercise in Hamster Wheel Sci-Fi is the thorough characterization of Starks.  Chiefly a victim of horrid cirumstance, he is also a resilient, basically kind man with an uncanny awareness that closely matches his quite uncanny circumstances.<br /><br />He is convicted of murder but escapes prison by reason of his fragile mental condition;Kris Kristofferson (who I initially mistook for William Hurt) plays the corrupt Dr. Becker, who runs an asylum for the criminally insane and violent.  Starks obviously does not belong there, and Becker seems to know this, but is too disdainful of his "clients" to care.  "The Jacket" is a reference to the questionable method Becker employs to induce hallucinations in his patients (it is never fully explained why he wants to do this, which is the only serious flaw in the complex plot.)  Starks is strapped down, injected with some sort of psychotropic hallucinogen, and essentially shut into a drawer which looks exactly like a morgue slab.<br /><br />Enduring terrible flashbacks to his war experience, the eeriest scenes in the movie take place here.  We come to know Starks as a human being, over and apart from his horrendous lot in life; and something else develops--a relationship with a miserable young alcholic (attractive, of course) who Starks encountered as a child on his ill-fated journey home.  Yes, this is very complex.<br /><br />Each viewer should find out for themselves precisely what Starks is, and should know halfway through that he is neither delusional nor insane but possessing an unnatural lucidity which ultimately leads to his triumph over the paradox of his tragic life.  The reason this film is lost on so many who normally enjoy movies of this ilk is because it has a moral.  We do not find out that Starks is merely a madman or anything of the sort, as our nihilistic postmodern viewers would have it.  Deserving of more than one viewing, "The Jacket" is, well, fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Not saying that "The Jacket" is poorly written or directed; it would still be a good film on its own, no doubt...but it would be cliched, surely.  However, the acting--which, from my experience, is the most obvious and most important part of a movie--is superb, carrying this film above it's twisted genre, and into a movie that critics and viewers both will enjoy.<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) was shot in the head in the Gulf War.  Fortunately, he lived; unfortunately, it left him confused as to who he is.  Back from the war, set free from the hospitals, he finds himself wandering a deserted country road, where he gets caught up in a crime--and is blamed for it.<br /><br />Unsure of anything, he is sent to a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, where he is treated by the somewhat sadistic Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson), whose specialty is solitary confinement in a small, dark chamber.  While in the chamber, Jack "travels" to an alternate reality, where he meets up with a down-trodden young women (Keira Knightley) whom he falls in love with.  But Jack is determined to find out who he is, and which reality is the one he belongs in...and his time is running out.<br /><br />It seems too confusing to summarize...I probably shouldn't have tried, for it comes out sounding like a lame science-fiction flick.  But it isn't.  It's a drama about identity...with some character study and mystery thrown in for good measure.  The great thing about "The Jacket" is that it's not too cliched (as movies in this genre tend to be).  Kristofferson's character, the sadistic doctor, defies stereotypes; even Brody's protagonist features a few surprises.  "The Jacket" is a well-written, fast-paced drama; but most importantly, it is superbly acted.  That is what makes this film so watchable; that's what will make you want to watch it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Jack (Adrien Brody) is a Gulf war veteran, who while on tour of duty, is shot in the head by a young Arab boy. The head wound should have been fatal but he miraculously survives, after 12 months of convalescence, he is discharged, however experiences bouts of amnesia. Now we see him walking along a cold snowy road somewhere in the northeastern United States, stopping to help a mother and daughter experiencing car trouble. The woman is obviously a drunk, vomiting in the ditch beside the road while Jack attempts to fix their truck. The little girl, Jackie, and Jack make a connection, and she asks him if she can have his dog tags, which he gives her. He fixes the truck, the woman shouting obscenities and drunkenly drives away. Later, a man who seems to be normal, gives Jack a lift, when they're pulled over by the police. Something happens, the police officer is shot dead, Jack cannot remember what occurred, and he is later convicted of murder. He is judged to be criminally insane and sent to an institution. It is here that the film begins to get very strange.<br /><br />We now see Jack in his cell, given medication on a continual basis, and as time moves on, he seems to becoming more and more docile, when in the middle of the night, he is violently whisked away and taken to the basement, where he is injected with a drug, strapped in a tortuous-looking jacket to keep him from moving, and put in a morgue locker- draw designed for corpses, and left there screaming bloody murder. Anyone with the slightest bit of claustrophobia, would feel discomfort watching this scene. While trapped in the morgue locker, he begins to experience severe hallucinations, that are simply too real. Three hours later the attendants open the locker and return him to his cell.<br /><br />We discover that the head doctor, (Kris Kristofferson) is performing drastic experimental therapy on Jack, in an attempt to cure him of his criminally violent behaviour. The doctor is obviously a quack, other doctors have an idea what he is doing,(Jennifer Jason Leigh) but turn a blind eye. Through the course of this therapy, Jack's "hallucinations" reveal that he has travelled into the future and discovers the exact day of his death. Is he hallucinating from the therapy or has he actually travelled in time? The "flash forwards" are just too real, as he meets a grown-up Jacky, (Keira Knightley) and finds his dog tags in her house. It is at this stage that he behaves radically in the institution in order to continue the therapy because he wants to return to the future and find the answers to the mystery.<br /><br />This type of film can either be a complete failure or can be done in such a way that the filmmakers pull it off - the filmmakers, in this case, pulled it off, because it is a riveting film, well acted and well-written, keeping the audience enthralled from start to finish.<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives a believable performance, he is a subtle actor, bringing to the character the right amount of pathos without over doing it. In fact all of the performances are above average making the film credible and worthwhile viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Jack Starks is in the Gulf War when he receives a serious head wound from a gunshot. Initially presumed dead, a nurse suddenly realizes he's still alive when he blinks. His body is saved, but his mind is still severely traumatized. Rocked with distortions of time and events, Jack struggles to become a normal member of Amercian society upon release from the military hospital.<br /><br />But things quickly go strangely awry for Jack. While hitchhiking across the U.S. he runs into a mother and daughter sitting alongside the road next to their broken down truck. The daughter, a sweet young girl, helps Jack fix the truck while the girl's drugged-out mother pukes in the bushes nearby. After the truck is started, the mother pushes past Jack, inserts her daughter into the truck, and abruptly and rudely leaves.<br /><br />Then Jack gets picked up by a young man in a station wagon who ends up killing a cop while Jack is traveling with him, and since Jack can't remember a lot of things (remember, he's got some brain damage from the gunshot wound to his head), he's arrested and sent to an asylum for the criminally insane run by actor Kris Kristofferson.<br /><br />During all of this there are fragments of Jack's mind that seep onto the screen in very surreal ways (punctuations of color, blast pieces of the war, etc.), and Jack's not all that sure WHEN he is. Is it 1992?<br /><br />In a brutal method to try and "help" Jack, Kristofferson's character drugs him and places him in a straight jacket then into a morgue box for isolation. During these "sessions", Jack seems to travel into the future. To 2007 to be exact. But why? Apparently this time holds some significance and the audience is slowly let in on it as the film progresses. In 2007, he meets up with the same young girl turned young woman that he'd met alongside the road years before and helped get their truck started. A race to save those that he loves in the past soon takes place from what he learns in the future. But is it all real, or is it just another fracture in his mind?<br /><br />******************************************************************************<br /><br />This film has been SERIOUSLY MISLABELED as a thriller. It is not a thriller or even a horror-stylized film. If you had to categorize it, I'd say it's a Sci Fi Drama. Even the insipid tagline for the film, "Terror has a new name," is horribly misleading.<br /><br />In the vein of MOMENTO and THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, this film has a lot going for it, even above those two other movies (which I also enjoyed by the way). But where THE JACKET succeeds is in coherency, while MOMENTO and THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT kind of left me wanting.<br /><br />The acting was also stellar. Keira Knightley (PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN and BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM) plays the young woman who Jack meets in 2007 and begins to believe that he may very well be time-traveling. I never thought Knightley could perform in such a starkly different role than the upbeat films I've seen her in, but she does so very admirably here. Adrian Brody (THE PIANIST) plays the lead role of Jack Starks and does so with understated grace. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kris Kristofferson, and Brad Renfro all pull in strong supporting roles, too.<br /><br />So if you're not a big thriller fan, don't worry about it. Pick up this film and enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IY9M330NKBW6.html">A2IY9M330NKBW6</a><br/><p>Seems funny to be writing a review on this now. It's been out a while and there are already quite a few reviews written here, but after now seeing it for a third time, I'm still impressed with it and how well it's holding up.<br /><br />This is a movie in the 'rubber reality' vein where Adrien Brody plays a soldier in Iraq in 1992 where he takes a bullet in the head. He's thought dead but comes around only to later get into trouble (mistakenly) with the law and ends up in a mental institution. This is where the rubber comes in. He's 'experimented' on by a doctor (played well by Kris Kristofferson) and starts slipping through time or reality or both. Another doctor (played by one of my faves Jennifer Jason Leigh) tries to help him through it all.<br /><br />This is just a way cool movie. I'll say up front that I AM predisposed toward this type of flick. "The Machinist", "Jacob's Ladder" and "Stay" are up near the top of my favorite movies list. This sits comfortably alongside those. Even at the third viewing I find myself intrigued at how the story unfolds. I like how subtle hints and happenings fold over one another. How they almost fit to form a whole but how the viewer sees that something is definitely not right. But the "how it's not right' is what lingers and keeps you drawn in.<br /><br />The cast is great. It looks good and is directed well. I can't recall much of the music so it must have melted deep into things. I guess what I like most is the adroit handling of the story. These can been tricky and difficult films to make. The viewers disbelief must be suspended throughout. If not, it crumbles right away and loses its audience. Like a good mystery, I found myself struggling to pull together all the clues and make sense of it all. At the end it does, I suppose, all fall apart but by that time I couldn't really care much. I'd already been on a wild, fabulous ride and it was well worth it.<br /><br />If you're at all predisposed toward this sort of thing, or are just a fan of the genre, this should keep you enthralled.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>Again, I stumble on a film I've never heard of, and am completely engrossed by it.

As such, it is a relatively low keyed one, and reminded me of episodes of television shows like "The Twilight Zone," "Quantum Leap," and even "Early Edition," for various reasons that should be apparent once you watch this 2005 film from director John Maybury ("Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon").<br /><br />Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is in the army during the first Gulf War when he takes a bullet to the brain.  Jack should be dead, but he survives, although he has severe memory problems.  Consequently, when he is charged with a murder he did not commit he ends up being sent to a mental hospital.  There he becomes the patient of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who has an unusual way of treating Jack.  He puts Jack into a straight jacket, shoots him full of drugs, and shoves him in a cabinet in the morgue.  Becker thinks that this would be a good thing, but with a Nurse Ratchet type named Harding (Mackenzie Phillips) helping him, we have our doubts.  However, whatever Becker was thinking would happen to Jack, having his patient travel in time fifteen years into the future was certainly not on the list.<br /><br />At this point, when you want to roll your eyes over this proposed method of time travel, I want to point out that since time travel is impossible that there never can be a method that will truly pass mustard in this respect.  But if we are talking really stupid nothing beats "Somewhere in Time" where Christopher Reeves's character "thinks" himself back to the past.  More importantly, that particular film proved that it is not what time travel theory you come up with but what you do with the story and your characters once you pull something out of your hat.  Especially since that becomes the strength of "The Jacket."<br /><br />Before his life went from bad to worst, Jack had a chance encounter with a young girl and her mother.  They might not be able to provide an alibi for the crime, but they would at least prove that he actually remembered something real.  In the future, Jack encounters the little girl, Jackie (Keira Knightley), now a young woman.  He tells her who he is and she tells him that he is dead and the date on which he died.  It turns out that is less than a week away in Jack's "present."  With each visit to the morgue drawer, and to the future, Jack is able to find out more information that he can use.  Becker is not to be trusted, but Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is sympathetic, even if she does not believe he is traveling in time.  As he learns about his limited future from Jackie he also learns what happens to her in the future, and that becomes part of the calculus as he tries to avoid dying a second time.<br /><br />In retrospect I seem to like more intimate time travel stories than those that try to rewrite history in a way that would change everything in the world in which we live.  In that regard "The Jacket" is not great, but it is still pretty good and once you accept the premise ends up being a lot more satisfactory than a lot of films in this genre I have seen recently.  It is ironic that Knightley did the movie to avoid being stuck in corsets for the next two decades while Brody is starting to find himself in a niche as the most mournful face on the big screen since, oh, I do not know, let us say Stan Laurel (How is that for a reach?).  On this DVD you will find that the project history and deleted scenes featurette is pretty interesting, and includes a different cut of the film's love scene that is an excellent example of montage (suggesting rather than seeing is a good thing in such instances).</p></br><a href="../users/A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ.html">A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ</a><br/><p>1.What IF you knew when you were going to die?<br /><br />2.What IF you could look ahead into the sordid lives of people  you had only briefly encountered or known?<br /><br />3.What IF- before you died- you were able to travel back and make profound impact on those lives?<br /><br />So is the dilemma of John Maybury's "The Jacket"; a sharp and intriguing look at time-travel and moral consciousness.<br /><br />I have never been a real fan of serious movies depicting any sort of time-travel, as I usually find the jumping around of scenes and plot to be more confusing than entertaining. However, "The Jacket" proves to be an intoxicating standout of the emerging genre.<br /><br />1991. Gulf war veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) has had it pretty rough lately. While in Iraq, Sgt. Jack Starks experienced himself quite a dandy head injury. After being shipped back to the states with some sort of shock related head trauma, we come to find Jack wandering a snowy cold highway. He comes across a car, apparently broken down, with a mother and a young daughter seemingly stranded by the side of the road. Mommas not looking to good, and she hardly acknowledges Jacks presence. Jack does meet daughter Jackie, and offers to help fix the car while Jackie tends to Mommy, who's now puking in the bushes. After repairing the car and giving cute little Jackie his dog tags, Momma flies into an outburst and hurriedly drives away with daughter in tow.<br /><br />Jack is able to hitch a ride from another fellow, but that is the last thing he remembers before facing trial for the murder of a state trooper. Due to his head trauma and experience in the Gulf War, Jack is declared "insane" and sent to a state psychiatric hospital. There is he is subjected to an experimental process by Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson), who pumps him full of psychiatropic drugs, straps him in a full body straight jacket, and slides him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. During these sessions, Jack is forced to live through a series of hallucinations, realities, and events- some of which have not taken place just quite yet.<br /><br />2007. As the audience, we get to see what happens years later, as Jack is reunited (coincidence?) with a now adult Jackie. Seems Jackie (a fantastic Keira Knightley) has become quite the shadow of her own mother. She's a chain smoking, boozing, angry and depressed young woman with the demons of her past haunting her each day. Through a series of encounters the two begin to grow fond of each other & begin to unravel what exactly has happened to Jack between 1991 - 2007, which he has no recollection of -for  the most part.<br /><br />"The Jacket" is quite a compelling film. Brody and Knightley shine through the darkness that they are surrounded in. A nice subplot with Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the institutions doctors helps the film come full circle.<br /><br />"The Jacket" will leave you moved and satisfied by the time it wraps up.<br />Sad but touching, the movie goes not exactly where you expect it to- but instead right where you hoped it would.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>What happened to this movie when it first came out? I remember seeing the theatrical trailer some time ago, but after that I totally forgot that this movie existed until it came out on DVD recently, and I'm sure that's the case with most people, which is a shame because this is one of the better movies that 2005 has produced.<br /><br />Adrien Brody leads an all star cast in this gripping and intense story of a Gulf War veteran named Jack Starks who has been found guilty for reason of insanity for killing a police officer. He is then committed to an asylum for his insanity. There, his doctor, Dr. Becker (played by Kris Kristoffersen) performs an odd and extreme form of treatment by putting Jack in a straight-jacket and making him lay for hours inside a body drawer that morticians use to store bodies in. There he travels into a kind of time paradox where unlocks secrets to his not too distant future as he has reason to believe he will die in just four days, which leaves the viewer in question, is this a self-fulfilling prophecy about to happen, or is Jack Starks truly an insane and troubled person?<br /><br />What I really liked about The Jacket was that not only at first, it was a twisted, claustrophobic mind boggling psychological thriller that was reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder in a way, but by the end of the film there was a powerful and dramatic message behind it that was very moving. Almost like two movies in one. And it was just very well shot and the overall direction was great. And it was superbly acted by some very fine actors. I just could not think of any reason why this film would deserve anything less than 5 out 5.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE JACKET is a tough film to categorize much less to get your mind around.  It is as though writers Tom Bleeker and Marc Rocco had a wealth of thoughts for a story that includes near-death experiences, mind manipulation, time travel, and messianic ideals and tried to weld them all together in a script for John Maybury to manipulate and direct.  The result is a weird mishmash of a film that has some terrific moments sparkling in the meandering mess of a plot.  The film would be a loss were it not for the inestimable talents of Adrien Brody who somehow makes it all fit together!<br /><br />Jack Starks (Brody) is first seen in 1991 in the Gulf War where he approaches a small boy who shoots him in the head.  Mistakenly taken for dead, Starks shows a bit of life in the triage facility and is shipped back to Vermont to recover.  After release from the hospital Starks is walking the roads in the snow, befriends a child Jackie (Laura Marano) who stands by her stalled car while her mother Jean (Kelly Preston) sits on the roadside vomiting from wither pill or alcohol abuse.  Starks gets the car started, tends to Jean who reacts violently and tells him to get out.  Starks continues to hitchhike, is picked up by a stranger (Brad Renfro) and when the car is stopped by a highway patrol, the stranger kills the policeman and Starks ends up being arrested for the crime.<br /><br />In court he is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane, falls into the hands of a strange Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who attempts mind control experiments on him, placing him in a straight jacket then sliding him into a morgue slot for unconscionable isolation. The attempts to alter Starks 'perverse sense of violence' result in hours of isolation when flashbacks occur; these flashbacks ultimately result in flash forwards.  Without meaningful editing we see Starks unchanged in the year 2007 where he encounters the mature Jackie (Keira Knightley), a drunk whose mother Jean is dead from burning from falling asleep with a lighted cigarette.  With some manipulation Starks gradually convinces Jackie he is the one who saved her in 1993 and the two try to figure out (along with us, the viewers!) just what happened.<br /><br />At this point we have few clues as to the difference between 1993 and 2007 except those provided by the good Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and by some input from one of the more talkative patients in the mental hospital - Rudy Mackenzie (Daniel Craig).  The tale becomes more intricately twisted until at last we see the point of all the threads tie together as Starks is able to share his futuristic visions with Jackie in order to prevent occurrences less than desirable.<br /><br />If you can follow that synopsis (probably just one version as seen by one viewer!) then you have an idea how much you have to work to make this film come together.  Why there are so many big name stars (Leigh, Craig, Kristofferson, Renfro, Lynch, etc) in throwaway cameos is puzzling.  But even with heavy handed special effects, wild camera work, and insecure direction, Adrien Brody makes the film worth watching. He continues to take on roles that are challenging and on the edge - and he does them very well!  An interesting diversion of a film for those fans of Brody who also have adequate patience.

It is all about interpretation and nothing about preconception.<br /><br />Wounded in 1991 during the first Gulf War, and then finding himself convicted of a murder he cannot remember a year later, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is committed to a prison hospital where he begins to slowly waste away. When an ambitious doctor (Kris Kristofferson) decides to use Jack as a guinea pig for his medical experiments, he shoots Jack up with toxins, straps him into a straight jacket, and locks him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. In this confined space, Jack's mind begins to violently explore his memories, ultimately giving him the ability to travel forward to the year 2007, and attempt to change his present situation with his knowledge of the future, assisted by a young girl he once met in passing (Keira Knightley).  "The Jacket" is passionate about its premise, which goes a long way to creating a film of slight entertainment value. As long as you don't stop to think, which the movie seems to be asking that you do, it provides a decent enough tale of time travel, love, and revenge.<br /><br />Adrian Brody was incredible and I thought it was directed almost flawlessly. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>How you guys have such great taste in movies!!

I hope this isn't a trend.  Fortunately The Jacket is a much better movie, elevated by some fine acting from Adrian Brody (not to mention a great supporting cast). That's not to say the movie doesn't have problems, but I'm not sure if this is a weakness -- or just the story itself. Fragmented telling in film is always a high-wire act. On the page, it may read well, but in a film if you don't do it right, you lose the audience pretty quickly. That doesn't happen in The Jacket, since Brody's performance is the glue that holds the (past and present) pieces together. So much so that the feel-good ending, which runs the risk of selling out, actually works. If you liked the Sixth Sense (though I wouldn't call The Jacket a supernatural film) , you should like The Jacket.  Not a great movie, but certainly not a bad one.</p></br><a href="../users/A32AK8FOAZEPE2.html">A32AK8FOAZEPE2</a><br/><p>brody has proved himself a multi-talented actor and could always interpretate a role in a deeper appearance. this movie is so dark but also gives a second-coming like hope of re-incarnation. a man with a heart could always transcend himself thru time and space and end up in a better time frame. the jacket could never jail a person's vision and heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>The trailers for this movie has certainly been a bit misleading.  It almost looks like a horror movie or some sort of "serial killer" kinda thing.<br /><br />What THE JACKET really is is a mystery/thriller/romance, with Adrien Brody trying to solve the mystery...of his own death.  And he's solving the mystery by being in the future 15 years AFTER his death.  Sounds kinda cool, doesn't it.  It's a low-budget time travel movie...with one man trying to unravel his fate, and make a connection with another human being.<br /><br />Adrien Brody is the lead.  He's a vet of the first Iraq War and his back home after surviving a serious head-wound...one where he was actually "dead" for awhile.  He's a bit of a drifter, but a nice guy.  He accepts a ride from the wrong guy, and next thing he knows, he's on trial for murder and is put in an insane asylum, because he can't remember anything about what  happened.  (It's a big of a stretch that he is committed...but you've got to accept it.)  There, a doctor, played by Kris Kristofferson, conducts experiments on his patients by strapping them into a grimy straightjacket and sliding them for hours on end into a drawer in a morgue.  There Brody appears to go into a state that allows him to leap forward in time.<br /><br />I won't say too much more.  It's the kind of film that has a lot of layers to peel back before we get to the "truth."  And of course, it hedges its bets on what the truth is a little anyway, so if you're the type of person who just  HAS to know "what happened" in a neat, tidy package when you leave the theater, stay away.  It doesn't give you totally clear answers...but they were clear enough, I think, to spark conversation.<br /><br />Brody embarks on a tentative relationship with Keira Knightley, and their scenes, though perhaps a bit hard to swallow in the early going, have a certain sweetness to them.  Both of these people have some serious emotional scarring to deal with, and they both draw strength from being able to help each other.  It's not a smoldering relationship, but if feels fairly convincing.  I thought both of them were pretty good in the film.<br /><br />Kristofferson was cast, I imagine, simply because his face is so lined and care-worn...he is seediness incarnate.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, long absent (at least from films I've seen), has a bland and thankless role as another doctor, and although I'm sure she was directed to be a bit colorless, she should have done more with it.  Kelly Lynch is in a small role as Knightley's mother, and tries gamely to make an underwritten part work for her.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is intriguing.  It is nicely photographed...most of it takes place in winter and the movie just FEELS cold.  Brody and Knightly do just fine in their roles.  But I would say that all the other characters are sketchily written at best and the actors in those roles are only average at best.<br /><br />This movie won't win any awards or make any top 10 lists.  In fact, I've seen a lot of critics treat it somewhat  harshly.  But I believe if you're an intelligent filmgoer who likes a bit of suspense, a twisty plot and good atmosphere...you should like it fine.  I would give the film 3.5 stars, if we had that option.  NOT FOR KIDS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I just got back from seeing "The Jacket" and I was impressed with what I saw. The acting is very solid from Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley (yes guys...she does show some skin). Hopefully that statement alone will get some more people to see this film, because it won't stay in theaters too long. It moves at a slow yet interesting pace and for a film based on time-travel & insanity it makes a lot of sense when it's over. I like when films end leaving it up to your own interpretation and that is the case with this one. An impressive directing debut from John Maybury and it has earned a strong 4 out of 5 stars in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Jacket (John Maybury, 2005)<br /><br />For some reason, watching the trailers for this movie way back when, I'd gotten it into my head that this was a true story about psychological torture during the 1991 Iraq war. So you can imagine I was slightly thrown by this one. For the most part, it was a pleasant surprise. (Though I'm now wondering where on earth I got that idea in the first place.)<br /><br />Jack Starks (The Pianist's Adrien Brody) is a Gulf War veteran trying to get home. His first encounter on the road is with a mother and daughter whose car has broken down; his second is with a hyped-up kid. Sometime during the second encounter, he loses consciousness, and we see a disjointed account of the next batch of time; it ends up with Starks confined to a hospital for the criminally insane, where Thomas Becker (Blade's Kris Kristofferson) is trying a radical new treatment on dangerous patients involving a straitjacket, a cocktail of psychoactive drugs, and a morgue drawer. Starks' reaction to the treatment is, to say the least, different; if you haven't heard anything about it, I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />The Jacket's opening half hour reminded me, in all the wrong ways, of the opening half-hour of Pitch Black; it's confusing, disjointed, and looks like a first film. Maybury has even less of an excuse than Twohy, having been directing for well over a decade at this point. Once we actually get into the story, however, and some of the confusing things about Starks' treatment regimen are made clear, the movie improves tremendously (again, like Pitch Black). Even the acting gets better: Brody transforms from a guy who was obviously hired because of his ability to whine, which has been on display in far too many films, to the guy who won an Oscar for The Pianist. Keira Knightley gets a role she can sink her teeth into, and does it quite well. The rest of the cast, which is no small potatoes (Road to Perdition's Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh, an all too brief appearance by MacKenzie Phillips, Brad Renfro, etc.), also perform up to standard.<br /><br />The one thing you're liable to get your teeth into, if you're a nitpicker, is that the movie flaunts all conventions of time. And there's certainly an argument to be made that Massy Tadjedin's screenplay is cavalier (to say the least) on the subject. That said, if you're willing to overlook the inconsistencies as unimportant to the plot device, you're likely to enjoy the movie a whole lot more. In fact, if you can convince yourself that Tadjedin is proposing a whole new theory of time, you're likely to enjoy it quite a bit. If you strip out the odder aspects of the film, it's a nicely-done mystery flick with a number of good performances. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody (Best Actor, The Pianist) stars in "The Jacket" and I think this is his best performance.<br /><br />The Jacket isn't a horror film although everything from the previews, the case, and the menu try to bill it as one, but is more of a psychological thriller. Today there's rarely any films like this, instead you have cliched horror films like "The Grudge". Anyway, The Jacket is essentially about Jack Starks (Brody) a Gulf War veteran who feels that he died once after taking a bullet to the head. He survived and while walking through Vermont spots a young girl and her mother standing next to their broke down car. He fixes the car, accepts a ride from a hitchhiker and then he's in court being tried for the murder of a policeman. He's sentenced to be placed in an asylum for the criminally insane and when he arrives there he is subjected to a bizarre treatment in which he is put in a straightjacket and then put inside a morgue drawer. The second time this happens he is suddenly in the year 2007, where he discovers he died in 1993.<br /><br />He knows this because of Jackie (the beautiful Keira Knightley), the adult version of the young girl he met on the side of the road. He finds out that he will die in four days, but he does not find out how. So, then we have Jack trying to find out how he dies before it actually happens and etcetera. The film has great visuals, the director did a great job. Kris Kristofferson is great as Dr. Becker, the doctor subjecting Jack to the bizarre treatments.

A moment of complete stillness arrive while darkness settles, as the eye cannot transfer the stimuli received through the retina into the Occipital Lobe.  This is the moment so many dread, a fear generated from tales told through myths and religious authorities.  When the moment of bodily silence comes to an individual the person is declared dead.  However, there have been occasions with complete heart failure and breathing has halted, and yet the person's vital signs have come back delivering the person from death. In the light of death, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) informs the audience in the beginning of The Jacket with the statement, "I was 27 years old the first time I died."<br /><br />Greenish light from night vision cameras open the film with several scenes from the first Gulf War in the beginning of the 1990s.  The scenes are taken from a targeting system that displays the elimination of targets such as buildings, machines, and humans.  Interjectionally, voices over radios frequently fade away within a static hiss, yet it is possible to make out what the pertinent information suggests while the sound of a soothing piano plays in the background.  A number of greenish combat scenes eventually lead the audience to Jack who is dressed in full combat gear while trying to help a little boy in the middle of the gunfire.  However, the boy has another plan, a plan that is about to bring death to Jack.<br /><br />Jack recovers, and he is being discharged in 1992 due to his injury, as he is simply dropped off into civilized reality where people do not shoot each other.  He wanders along a road, a scene that brings back memories from First Blood (1982), where he encounters Jackie, young girl, and her heavily intoxicated mother.  Their car has broken down and Jack helps to get the car started again while Jackie asks him about his dog tags, which he gives to her.  But Jackie's mother, in her alcoholic haze, thinks that he is trying to touch her daughter inappropriately and drives off leaving him out in the middle of the wintry nowhere.  Soon after Jackie and her mother have driven off Jack hitches a ride with another person, which brings Jack on a confusing journey of amnesia and a police murder.<br /><br />The authorities decide with the help of the military that Jack's damaged mind cannot be blamed and they sentence him to psychiatric care.  At the mental institution, Jack learns that he supposedly is delusional, yet somehow he knows that he is innocent.  Nonetheless, Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) enters Jack into his own experimental care where he treats him by applying certain drugs and a straitjacket while placing him into a small drawer in the morgue.  If the viewer did not have claustrophobia, this first scene will likely produce claustrophobic tendency within the viewer, and if the viewer is claustrophobic this scene might be very tough.<br /><br />The treatments with the straitjacket and the darkness of the morgue drawer bring to mind the notion of rigor mortis, which after a few hours enters the body following death.  Rigor mortis generates stiffness throughout the body that locks the joints in an immobile state that lasts for about three days.  Jack seems to be living through a fabricated death in complete darkness while only having his shocking memories flash by unpredictably.  After a couple of treatments, Jack finds himself in the middle of the winter standing outside a diner, unaware that it is the year 2007, where he encounters a grown up Jackie (Keira Knightley).<br /><br />The camera work and the editing display exceptional talent, which enhances the element of darkness and the unknown.  Several scenes also have beautiful framing that together with the lighting capture the essence of a cold and sinister atmosphere at the mental institution.  The film displays great possibility, but something prevents the story from blooming.  There are parts of the film where it seems to go in one direction, but to suddenly change in mid stride. This generates a feeling of intentional deception, as if the filmmakers could not get the initial story going.  Instead the film must make a fresh start half way into the film.  For some this might be ok while others might feel cheated from the initial build up of the story, and then find that they are going in a different direction.  Despite what the audience considers, the story redeems itself in the end with a thoughtful and compassionate notion, but maybe not what horror film enthusiasts desire.  Overall, the Jacket offers an interesting cinematic experience, but it does not deliver a conclusive point or notion.  On the other side of the conclusive concept, the film does not leave one with much of an open-ended notion either, which ultimately keeps the film hanging in a cinematic twilight still waiting to be finished.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>For all the familiar premises of quasi-time traveling and `what if' scenario, and its (intentionally) confusing conclusion, `The Jacket' still is worth your time simply because it has Adrian Brody. If the film falls short of more skillful narrative of other mind-boggling thrillers like, say, `Memento,' Adrian Brody shines as the tormented hero of the film, whose body (or mind) travels back and forth between the two years - 1992 and 2007.<br /><br />Arian Brody plays Jack Starks, a veteran solider who just returned from the Gulf War after receiving a near fatal injury in the head. Actually, he was once thought dead, but he miraculously comes back to life. As if his `first death' (so he calls) is not enough, however, Jack experiences another terrible incident after meeting a little girl and her mother (Kelly Lynch) on the snowy road, and a young car driver (Brad Renfro) who picks him up.<br /><br />Arrested for the death of a police officer, Jack, who denies the charge, is sent to a mental institute, where Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) gives him a very radical treatment. Put in a straitjacket, Jack is locked in a small drawer in a morgue-like basement room.<br /><br />And a strange thing happens. Jack finds he is in the year 2007, and after meeting a lonely and beautiful woman Jackie (Keira Knightley), he knows that he - I mean, Jack -- died on January 1st, 1993 - only a week after he was first put in the drawer. How did (or will) he die? And how can he save the lives of those who had died during the lost 15 years?<br /><br />Jennifer Jason Leigh appears as doctor who gives Jack a help, and Daniel Craig as one of the inmates in the institute.<br /><br />[CONFUSING, BUT GETS BETTER AS IT UNFOLDS] So, did you get the story? I'm afraid not, but keep watching. The film's earlier part is rather confusing and unnecessarily repetitious, and it lacks enough explanation to engage the viewers' attention. `The Jacket' takes too much time to set up its rules, and the rules themselves are not particularly original. The film attempts to include as many potentially intriguing themes as possible in less than 2 hours, but fails to fully utilize its ideas. Consequently, some behavior of the characters looks unreasonable, especially when Jack tries to explain his identity and motives to the people in 2007. And its obligatory love scene is very disappointing.<br /><br />[ADRIAN BRODY'S FILM] `The Jacket' is a showcase for the talent of Adrian Brody, who can so easily and effortlessly embody the central character's tragic life. One strange thing is the film is directed by John Maybury, British director whose films I thought are art-house films. I don't know whether or not he is the first choice of Steven Soderbergh, one of the 19 producers of the film (including George Clooney), but I am not sure that Maybury is the right director to handle the material even though obviously his name had attracted such names as Keira Knightly and Daniel Craig, the latter being seen in the same director's "Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon."<br /><br />`The Jacket' is not a fast roller-coaster ride of `Butterfly Effect.' It aims for something slower, and perhaps more intelligent, without losing its value as entertainment. The result is a curious mixture of `Twilight Zone' and love romance. Though it is not a great success as either of them, it is more interesting than other films with similar topics.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A69DJ2KPU4CH.html">A1A69DJ2KPU4CH</a><br/><p>This is a movie that requires full attention. It is not the typical fast food Hollywood garbage that requires no thought because lots of things go boom and make loud explosions! There is a time and a place for movies with loud explosions and lots of special effects but not when they are used to cover up a bad film, as they do with so many science fiction movies. This is the thinking man's science fiction. It's beautifully acted, well written, and very thought provoking. I remember the first time I saw it, I just sat on the couch when it was over, turned off the tv and did nothing but ruminate over what I had just seen. Very, very rare a movie does that to me.<br /><br />While a plot consisting of a man who uses time travel to change the past sounds extremely basic, it's all in the execution. This time travel based movie is done extremely well. I have shared this movie with a few friends over the years and most did not like it. But admittedly most of them have short attention spans and don't like to think when they see a movie, they would rather see the "things go boom" type of movie. Thus the title for my review. I really don't think there is any in between with The Jacket, I think either you will get it and love it, or it will make no sense to you and you'll hate it. Serious, if you have a short attention span, like a fast paced movie with lots of special effects, limited dialog, and maybe even some gratuitous nudity thrown in for good measure, stay far away from the Jacket.<br /><br />I also want to add the music is beautiful and haunting, a perfect compliment to the film and composed by the great Brian Eno.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>THE JACKET is sort of an interesting blend of JACOB'S LADDER, BUTTERFLY EFFECT, and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, w/ just a pinch of THE UGLY and 12 MONKEYS tossed in for seasoning. After being mortally wounded in the gulf war, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) finds himself in a mental institution at the mercy of Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson). Starks has been accused of a murder he didn't commit and found to be insane. Becker uses a banned technique in order to "break" Starks. This method is actually a form of drug-induced torture that somehow allows Jack to travel forward in time. This leads him on a terrible journey of discovery where life, death, and reality are twisted and intersected. Brody is very convincing in his role, as are Keira Knightley (The Hole), Daniel Craig (Invasion), and Jennifer Jason-Liegh (The Hitcher, Single White Female). THE JACKET is a nice little mind-melter...</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>Adrien Brody is the kind of actor that can pull off something like "The Jacket", a film way out of the mainstream that is more cerebral than emotional, more visual than literal, more reliant on its script that the beauty of its stars, and more difficult to follow than any other Brody film I've seen.<br /><br />Brody plays a Gulf War veteran going through a sequence of psychiatric rehabilitation where he enters a couple new worlds -- one in the past and one in the future. He used these visits to put together his own life story and that of the person that eventually becomes his significant other.<br /><br />After about an hour I figured out the ending, although I did not imagine the precise event our star would go through to get there. But this predictability was quite obvious and was played out at the end of the film with a bit of a twist.<br /><br />Brody is one of the most compelling film presences in today's cinema and he uses his ability and charisma to maintain interest in this movie, which can be hard to follow and episodic. He looks even thinner here than he did in his role as "The PIanist", where he lost 30 pounds to play the role. He has virtually no meat on him, a stark contrast to his romantic bad boy role in "Love The Hard Way".<br /><br />So rent, buy or borrow this to see one of the world's great actors in his newest role. This movie is far from maintstream Hollywood so beware viewers that like nice little movie packages. It has a nice ending, if that matters to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>One of my favorite movie songs of all time (We Have All the Time in the World, originally from the James Bond movie ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) is used in the end credits of this unusual, but engrossing, film.  Oscar winner Adrien Brody gives a strong performance as a Gulf War veteran who is accused of murdering a patrolman and sentenced to an asylum for the criminally insane, where he is subjected to unorthodox therapy from a good intentioned, if somewhat, psychotic doctor.  The script never clarifies how much of what we view is reality and how much could be the delusions of a sick man.  However, an element of time travel is introduced, and it is this device that forms the crux of this well made, if somewhat dissatisfying excursion into the real and unreal.  Brody is given good support from Keira Knightley as his love interest; Daniel Craig as a fellow patient; Jennifer Jason Leigh as a sympathetic doctor with her own agenda; Kris Kristofferson as the man behind the experiments, Kelly Lynch as the spaced out wife Brody rescues; and even Mackenzie Phillips in a small role as a brutish nurse.  THE JACKET, directed by John Maybury, may be an example of style over substance, but it does hold your interest.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>I knew this movie wouldn't be a horror/gore fest when I rented it. Right from the first time they ever previewed the movie on TV I could tell it was going to be a psychological drama/thriller.  Some people on here said this wasn't a horror movie. However, if you're severely claustrophobic then this would be as horrifying as it gets!  Anyway, very good movie. As others have mentioned, it is sort of like a twilight zone episode meets the butterfly effect. I love complex movies and movie that make you think. I also like a well wrote plot. The acting was good, the dream sequences were good, and the movie holds your attention from beginning to end. For that I gave it a high rating. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next (when he would go back for additional treatment). Only VERY MINOR complaints: The DVD sound could have been better (you will notice your tv volume is way louder than the DVD volume, it could have had some better production in that department). Also, by the looks of the other reviews, I think I might be the only one here who liked the butterfly effect a little better. Not to belittle this movie by any means, because this movie was great and its probably not getting enough recognition! My final VERY MINOR complaint is that I was hoping by the end of the movie that the main character would have resolved an event that happened in his past and he didn't. He actually was able to ID someone and didn't use it to his advantage. I wont get into too many details, I wont spoil it for those who haven't seen it.</p></br></body></html>

Sometimes weird, FUNNY and macabre.<br /><br />And "Corpse Bride" has all three qualities, mixing in the bizarre and wacky with a bittersweet love story. It also has the sort of goofy ickiness that really expert haunted houses have -- you're enjoying the ghouls and skeletons too much to care who it's aimed at. This is an "underground" film in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />Victor (Johnny Depp) is at the rehearsal for his arranged wedding, when he forgets his vows. Not a good omen. He runs out and rehearses it by himself, and ends up slipping the ring on the finger of a dead girl, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). But Emily, who died tragically, falls in love with Victor and considers herself married to him.<br /><br />Now Victor is trapped in the underworld, which is a surprisingly cheery, upbeat place when you consider everyone is dead. He tries to find his way back to the world of the living, but soon finds himself more drawn to the tragic Emily. Now he must make the ultimate choice: Will he return (for as long as he lives) to his arranged bride, or stay in the underworld with the Corpse Bride?<br /><br />You'd think a movie about dead people would be depressing. At the very least, dark. But surprisingly "Corpse Bride" is neither -- instead, Burton has crafted a sweet, enchanting little love story where one of the people happens to be dead, and which is set in the underworld. There's nothing frightening about it. If anything, it's enchanting.<br /><br />Is the plot original? Heck no -- boil it down, and you have a boy-meets-girl-while-engaged-to-another-girl story. But it's the delivery that's charming, from the funny dialogue ("Play dead!") to the colorful inhabitants of the underworld (like the pirate, or the intimidating minister). The macabre humour and song-and-dance numbers add to the charm of this world, where the dead are more alive than the living.<br /><br />And the voice actors seal the deal; what could have been merely funny becomes touching, in their hands.Johnny Depp brings the timid, tremulous Victor to life, and makes his dilemma believable, while Carter makes us look past protruding bones and bluish skin, to the sweet romantic Emily was. The only problem is that moronic maggot -- it's an annoying distraction.<br /><br />It's not quite on the level of cult classic "The Nightmare Before Christmas," but "Corpse Bride" is still a hilarious, bittersweet little story with a macabre twist. Delightful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>Tim Burton really has a great talent coming up with all the visual eye candy for these films, he does however lack sometimes in getting his story flowing quickly and smoothly. This is a very good film and if you love NMBC, you should like this one too.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>A splendid home video rendition of Tim Burton's latest underworld fun fest.<br /><br />The best bonus feature is a 13-minute production gallery that turns out to be, well, a Tim Burton movie. Rough sketches, animation tests and disembodied characters whiz by, accompanied by hip funereal music.<br /><br />The DVD featurettes don't dig into the gory details -- none last more than 7 minutes. "Lord of the Universe," a Tim Burton profile, celebrates his "black and beautiful humor." "It's a very particular place for an actor to dwell, in Tim Burton's imagination," says Emily Watson, who plays the film's flesh-and-blood heroine. Helena Bonham Carter appears here as well, as the bone-yard bride.<br /><br />Two of the shorts cover how the puppets were built (some had mechanical faces, "like Swiss watches") and how they performed. "I think Victor is a much better actor than I am," says voice star Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Danny Elfman gets a few minutes to talk up the music. "In the land of the dead, it's pretty jazzy," he says, explaining the Cab Calloway-meets-Tom Waits number he performs. (Burton agrees: "The world of the living is actually much more dead than the world of the dead.")<br /><br />Video and audio are terrific, borderline reference quality. Warner has released the film in its original widescreen format (1.85:1) and in kid-friendly full-screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of wealthy fishmongers and he's had an arranged marriage set up for him. His wife to be, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) is the daughter of Victorian-style royalty who are having financial difficulties. Marrying Victoria off is seen solely as a "plan (score music here)" to pull her parents out of their money-rut.<br /><br />All seems to be going well until Victor fouls up his vows during the wedding rehearsal and runs off into the nearby forest. He continues to practice the vows as he stumbles through the trees, finally getting the words right and then ceremoniously placing the ring on a nearby twig ...at least that's what he thought it was. The twig turns out to be the dead finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). She and Victor are now husband and wife, and she emerges from the grave to tell him so. Running away from her and plowing into a tree, Victor falls unconscious, only to awaken in the underworld of the dead.<br /><br />Confusion reigns as Victor tries to tell the Corpse Bride that they cannot be married ...because he is still alive and she is dead. Well, there certainly is an easy way to fix that. But what of his living bride-to-be, Victoria? How will she take the news?<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Corpse Bride has a lot going for it, but also a few issues. The positives far outweigh the negatives, however. Most enjoyable (from my perspective) were the miniatures and the way the "claymation" flowed. The clay characters were smooth and outlandishly featured; Victoria's mother (Joanna Lumley) has hair that looks like two large breasts pinned high above her head, the Corpse Bride is disturbingly sexy, and the pastor (a perfect Christopher Lee) appears as an evil Vicar.<br /><br />Similar to WALLACE AND GROMIT IN THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, the claymation is smooth and even. Although Wallace and Gromit has a more children's feel to it, Corpse Bride makes no such claim. Necrophilia, frightening death sequences, bodily decay, and several other possibly unappetizing ideas pop-up during the film. But they are usually infused with sprinklings of comedy, which made these items less morbid.<br /><br />The biggest "hole" in the movie was its script. Clocking in at just 75 minutes, there's very little time to get acquainted with the characters and even less time spent on making sense of the movie's ending (I'll only comment that when the Corpse Bride said, "You have set me free." I said, "Huh?").<br /><br />But the claymation, beautifully crafted caricatures, and mini-sets can't be denied. Nor can most of the musical numbers that added a certain garish quality to it (although some of the songs seemed forced to me, while several others were spot-on).<br /><br />I wouldn't let a child under 12 years old watch it, though. Adults will laugh at the humor thrown down at death's door, but the youngsters might not get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Tim Burton returns to the kind of darkly comical gothic material that helped establish his career and reputation with Corpse Bride. He's also gone back to the same kind of stop motion animation that he utilized so memorably in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The director has even re-teamed with long-time collaborators Johnny Depp, Michael Gough, composer Danny Elfman and screenwriter Caroline Thompson.<br /><br />While the land of the living has a cold, almost monochrome colour scheme, the Underworld is a colourful place filled with all sorts of outrageous characters. There's a pub where a disembodied head is the head waiter, skeletons play pool in the background while others break into rousing musical numbers. This world is dominated by vibrant green and purple lighting with the pale (yet somewhat luminous) blue skin of the Bride. Like the Underworld in Beetlejuice, it is an infinitely more fun and interesting place to be than the land of the living.<br /><br />"Inside the Two Worlds." The filmmakers talk about the differences between the living world and the Underworld - mainly they were separated in terms of colour and tone.<br /><br />"Danny Elfman Interprets the Two Worlds." The veteran composer talks about the songs he wrote and his intentions behind them. He talks about the inspirations behind some of the songs, for example, Bojangles' tune was influenced by 1930s jazz music.<br /><br />"The Animators: The Breath of Life" examines the stop motion animation process done on this film. Mike Johnson did the day-to-day directorial duties while Burton acted more as a supervisor, guiding the entire project.<br /><br />"Tim Burton: Dark vs. Light." Cast and crew praise Burton's unique vision and it was his influence that allowed the film to be made utilizing stop motion animation, considered by many to be a dying art form.<br /><br />"Voices from the Underworld" focuses on the cast of voice actors assembled for the movie. It was very important to get the right voice for the right character. We see some of the cast in action, recording their parts.<br /><br />"Making Puppets Tick" examines how the film's puppets were assembled, the way they were sculpted and then painted. Burton would do the initial sketches and had the vision for what he wanted them to look like and then Carlos Grangel would design them.<br /><br />"The Voices Behind the Voice" allows us to watch a few scenes from the movie with footage of the various voice actors speaking their lines. It is interesting to see how much they get into the spirit of their roles.<br /><br />"The Corpse Bride: Pre-Production Galleries" is a montage of how various characters from the movie were assembled, including tests for movement and so on.<br /><br />Also included is a "Music-Only Track" that allows you to watch the movie with only Elfman's excellent score playing.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>"Corpse Bride" isn't quite up to the level of "Nightmare Before Christmas," but it's an entertaining and engaging little movie. (I say "little" because the running time, excluding credits, is only 73 minutes.) The visuals are marvelous, and the performances by the actors providing the characters' voices are all more than adequate. There are numerous "in jokes" scattered throughout the movie. These are mostly visual, although some are not;  the voice of the worm in Emily's eye socket is clearly patterned on Peter Lorre.  The movie's one weakness, if it has one, is a fairly trite plot. There's not much here that you couldn't guess after the first 15 minutes, but the storyline never drags.<br /><br />There are numerous extras on the DVD, and unlike the filler on many discs, they're all pretty interesting. You get to see what was involved in producing many of the special effects, and learn about the philosophy underlying the production.  Overall, this DVD is a winner; I'd rate it 4.5 stars if that were possible. I gave it five stars to bring the average up a bit.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Hey, give me a listen<br />Your corpses of cheer<br />At least those of you<br />Who still got an ear<br />I'll tell you a story<br />Make a skeleton cry<br />Of our own jubiliciously<br />Lovely Corpse Bride"<br /><br />"Tim Burtons' Corpse Bride" is a film that may well suffer from heightened expectations, given the place that "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" has in popular culture and the long period we had to wait for a second hauntingly animated film done with similarly distinctive characters.  But this 2005 film, which has just been nominated for the Best Animated Feature Academy Award in time for its DVD release, has its own charm and will win its own cadre of devotees that will want a figure of the lovely Corpse Bride on their nightstand.  After all, there is something poignant in the question: can a heart still break once it has stopped beating?<br /><br />Directed by both Burton and Mike Johnson (who animated "James and the Giant Peach"), this is the story of the unlikely love triangle in which Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) finds himself involved.  A marriage has been arranged between Victor and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson).  His parents, who sell fish, want the prestige of being associated with the Everglots, while her parents, who are secretly broke, want the neuvo riche money of the Van Dorts.  The prospect of marrying a woman he has just met is rather daunting to Victor and after botching the rehearsal he goes off into the woods to practice his vows, which is how he comes to accidentally marry the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter).  She brings Victor home to meet her friends and he ends up taking her to the land of the living to meet his parents.  He tries to explain that he never wanted to marry a corpse (who does?), but his character is such that he does not want to hurt her with the truth and he is touched by her wedding gift and the fact she had a real name (Emily) and a tragic story (apparently murdered by her fianc?e for the family jewels).<br /><br />There are additional complications in that Victor still has feeling for Victoria, whose parents quickly find another groom, Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), as news spreads that Victor has eloped with a charming corpse.  If Victoria is going to get married, then perhaps Victor should make sure he and Emily get a proper wedding as well ("Dearly beloved and departed," intones the skeleton presiding over the ceremony).  Meanwhile, Burton and Johnson are filling the frame with macabre character details in the tradition of wall-to-wall visual delights within the frame that is the hallmark of contemporary animation, whether it is computer generated, stop motion, or the truly old school method of painting images on cels.<br /><br />If "The Nightmare Before Christmas" took great pleasure in having the creatures of Halloween take over the symbols of Yuletide, then "Corpse Bride" is content to turn the worlds of the living and the dead upside down.  The living are done in the washed out browns of a daguerreotype while the dead are shown in brighter colors favoring a blue palette.  For the most part the living are dreary, hateful, and ultimately boring people, while the dead all seem to be jumping around a lot more than they probably did when they were alive.  Their songs are perkier too (i.e., "Remains of the Day"), or at least more revealing (i.e., "Tears to Shed"), than those sung by the living (i.e., "According to Plan").  Plus, I like any fight scene where I can yell, "Look out! He has a fork!"<br /><br />I ended up rounding up on "Corpse Bride" for several reasons.  First, the title character has a compelling beauty with her large eyes and lovely blue skin, especially as she glides around in her billowing wedding dress.  Second, I just like this style of animation, pretty much regardless of what is happening in the story but especially since it always strikes me as being in the spirit of Chas. Addams (Morticia and Emily have to be related on some level, right?).  Third, given that both Emily and Victoria are sympathetic characters, I could not see how "Corpse Bridge" was going to come up with anything approaching an actual happy ending, so I was pleasantly surprised (even though Johnson and Burton foreshadow Emily's fate before the movie's title pops up on the screen).  There is also the nice touch when the film underscores the fact that social class distinctions do not matter when you are dead, even if you are not gone as well as the final irony that it is death that sets the lovers free to be happy at last.<br /><br />"Die, die, we all pass away<br />But don't wear a frown<br />Because it's really okay<br />You might try and hide<br />And you might try to pray<br />But we all end up<br />The remains of the day"</p></br><a href="../users/A28WJUJF6D2ULA.html">A28WJUJF6D2ULA</a><br/><p>I am a big fan of Tim Burton's work, especially his other stop motion animation masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas, so naturally I was expecting to fall in love with Corpse Bride, but the fact is it didn't "grab" me as much as I thought it would. It even took me two tries to get through it, beautiful though some of it was, as well as grandly atmospheric and visually-appealing, and I think the reason this tale of a living man and his undead would-be bride failed to take hold of me related to its characters, who just didn't seem as interesting as those in The Nightmare Before Christmas. I hope Tim Burton continues to make animated films, in fact I wish he made them more often than he has, but Corpse Bride simply isn't among my favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I have been looking forward to seeing "Corpse Bride" ever since I learned that it was in production. I was not disappointed...Tim Burton always makes amazing films, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />The animated tale revolves around Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young and somewhat jumpy young man who is betrothed to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson), a girl he's never even met before. The parents of the newlyweds-to-be are both hoping that the union of their children will better their own reputations and ease their financial burdens. Victor and Victoria finally meet and are pleasantly surprised to discover that they actually like each other. When Victor botches the wedding rehearsal, he rushes out into the woods to practice his wedding vows. He places Victoria's wedding ring on a tree branch, which suddenly grips his hand and emerges from the earth attached to a corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter). She takes the unwilling Victor to her home, the land of the undead, which exists beneath the surface of the earth. Victor struggles with his new bride while poor Victoria must cope with the evil man her parents have found to fill in for Victor at the wedding ceremony.<br /><br />The animation in "Corpse Bride" is phenomenal...if this movie doesn't win the Best Animated Feature category at the Academy Awards, I'll be furious! But the animation isn't the only amazing thing about this movie. The storyline is fun (and perhaps slightly predictable, but what can you do?) and the characters are extremely well-developed. There are several musical numbers in this film, all of which are very enjoyable. (I especially enjoyed the skeleton jazz band!) I guess the only complaint I have is that I wish it was a slightly darker film. Burton is famous for his extreme creepiness...I was basically expecting to see an animated version of "Sleepy Hollow," but this is much more along the lines of "The Nightmare Before Christmas," which was an amazing Burton movie but is still geared toward children. There's nothing wrong with that, of course...it's just that I'm an adult and I prefer Burton when he's at his most macabre. :)<br /><br />Overall, "Corpse Bride" is a wonderful film. It's a great movie to take the kids to see before Halloween, but adults who are fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will enjoy it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>Tim Burton comes through again with "Corpse Bride". The animation was absolutely fantastic and the acting was equally well done. Johnny Depp has real talent, his voice acting really is amazing! It doesn't even sound like Depp talking for Victor, very well done. All of the actors were great and it had some big names and Burton regulars in the film. Christopher Lee was great as the town pastor. The story had characters that had a lot of emotion and you feel a lot of emotion for. A movie can have amazing animation and acting, but if the story isn't good, the movie fails and is a flop. Luckily, that is not the case here.<br /><br />The musical scores of the film, while not up to parr with the memorable songs from "Nightmare", are still quite good. Would I say that this is as good as "Nightmare Before Christmas"? No, but that is not in the least saying that this film is bad. This movie is excellent! It is extremely far away from being terrible, but "Nightmare" was just a ground breaking film that I didn't expect this would top. If you are a Burton fan and a fan of the original "Nightmare Before Christmas", get this movie now! The story tear jerking, the acting is excellent and the animation is amazing! Truly one of the greatest movies of the decade.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>Tim Burton returns to stop motion animation in "The Corpse Bride", a tale about the world of the deathly dull living and the lively dead, set in Vicorian era England.<br /><br />Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) is arranged to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson), so that his family may gain a title from hers and that Victoria's family may gain some money from Victor's, as they're broke. Being Victorian era England, corsets are tight, colours are drab and life is very strict. Everything for the upcoming wedding must be perfect. The local church pastor (Christopher Lee) has special vows for the couple to recite, and he, as well as their parents, are determined they get them exactly right. After humiliating himself at the marriage rehearsal, Victor wanders out of town into the dark forest to learn his vows properly. Role playing with the trees and twigs, Victor masters these vows, and confidently slides the ring onto what he believes to be a dead branch. But it is not a dead branch he has given his vows and ring to, it is a corpse of a bride named Emily (Helena Bonham-Carter), and she has taken his rehearsal very seriously indeed. As far as she is concerned, they are now married, and she whisks poor Victor away to the land of the dead, a world full of singing, dancing skeletons, spiders, green maggots, and blue faced corpses. Meanwhile, in the land of the living, a mysterious Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) has arrived on the scene, and wants Victoria to be HIS bride. Will Victor escape the world of the dead, and if he does, which bride will he marry?<br /><br />For stop motion animation, the film is incredibly slick. Every movement flows, and there are no jerky movements, which is usually a characteristic of stop motion (of the earlier stuff anyway). The look and Danny Elfman's score for the piece are typically Burton. I found Elfman's songs a little easier to digest than his ones for "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", which was nice.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the casting of the film. There's Joanna Lumley (from British sitcom "Absolutely Fabulous") who plays Victoria's mother. There's Michael Gough (Alfred from the Burton "Batman" movies, and the Celestial Toymaker from "Doctor Who") as the skeleton Elder Gutknecht. Deep Roy (from "Big Fish" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory") sneaks in too, as the Napoleon-esque skelton. But my favourite of the bunch is British character actor Paul Whitehouse (from "The Fast Show") who plays several roles: Victor's father, Mayhew and the "Head" Waiter. He's also in "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" as Sir Cadogan, if you want to keep an eye out. I really hope he does some more films, he's a very funny guy.<br /><br />Special features include a selection of making of featurettes, which contain not only Tim Burton's words on the film, but some behind the scenes footage and the words of several of the actors and crew, as well as Danny Elfman, who did the music and songs. There's no interview with Paul Whitehouse though, which was a shame, but you do get to see him in the "Voices Behind the Voice Featurette", where you get to watch selected scenes of the film and the actors voicing them in the studio simultaneously on the screen. Its interesting to watch, because sometimes a single line of script is edited from several takes (particularly Johnny Depp's, I noticed), and the footage of the actor in the booth jumps about.<br /><br />There's also an original theatre trailer, a production gallery (that is, a montage of stop motion tests for the characters, among other things), and a music only track for the film.<br /><br />Recommended for lovers of Tim Burton and of animation. To "The Corpse Bride" you'll soon say "I do... like this movie".</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Tim Burton makes some of the richest and most detailed films today - perhaps his only competitor is Baz Luhrmann of "Moulin Rouge" and "Romeo + Juliet" fame.  Burton loves to dabble in the corners, creating mood and invariably a lot of humor with his deft touch.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation serves as the ideal tool for the detail-oriented filmmaker -- this type of filmmaking takes tremendous patience, but it rewards the creative filmmaker with countless opportunities to find room for additional notes in a complex score.  Not for nothing are Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach" such popular DVDs -- adults and kids (over a certain age) can watch them numerous times and never get tired.<br /><br />"The Corpse Bride" allows Burton's gallows humor to run wild.  I'll spare you the plot details, which you can get in many of the other reviews.  I merely recommend that you look out for the little details that make the movie so rich, such as a reunited husband and wife blowing smokehearts instead of smokerings after they get reunited, or the clever use of different color schemes to separate the land of the living from the land of the dead . . . and not in the way you'd expect.<br /><br />Burton once again works with Danny Elfman, whose musical tastes are as refined and twisted as Burton's sensibility.  Elfman's music fits the movie perfectly, but if I have a quibble with "Corpse Bride," it's the same one that I had with "The Nightmare Before Christmas" -- some of the lyrics are so garbled that I can't understand them.  Maybe it's my shoddy TV, but there you go.  It's too bad, 'cause I could hear the majority of the lyrics, and they were fine.<br /><br />If you are exhausted by kiddie fare of a PC Disney nature, you must check this movie out.  It's probably a little dark for some kids, so be careful.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>No matter what one might say about the types of movies that Tim Burton directs and makes, one cannot deny that even after 20 years of being a big time Hollywood director, Burton still remains as one of the most imaginative directors making movies. Sure often his films are quite bizarre, gothic, and quite a bit quirky. At times they can be a mit morbid and he tends to rely on visuals rather than plot or a huge amount of character development. Nevertheless, Burton's films remain as some of the most imaginative movies being made.<br /><br />Take for instance his latest picture, THE CORPSE BRIDE.  Even though the film took around 5 years to be made, it has been released just a few months after Burton's fairly successful CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (the studios wanted to ride the coat tails of CHARLIE's hype). The movie is a stop-motion animated film and is based off an old Ukrainian folk tale. In the story, we have young Victor.  Victor is the son of a wealthy and up and coming fish marketer.  His father and mother were impoverished people, but through hard work and free enterprise have become wealthy. Wealthy enough, in fact, that one of the town's most established families wants to have their daughter, Victoria married to Victor.  Victor and Victoria have never met; it is an arranged marriage.  Upon meeting each other the couple connects and they realize very much that they want to be married to each other. However, Victor is a nervous person and can't seem to remember his lines at the wedding rehearsal.  The rehearsal is characterized as a disaster and Victor seeks shelter in the forest so that he might practice his lines.<br /><br />Practice he does. Until finally he has them down pat. Place the wedding ring for Victoria upon a limb of what he assumes is a dead branch, he says his lines perfectly. Except, the branch really wasn't a branch but was the finger of the Corpse Bride:  a young woman named Emily who was murdered on the spot while awaiting for her beloved to take her away. Victor is chased, faints, and visits the underworld.  Meanwhile the plot thickens above ground as Victoria's parents arrange for her to be married to a sly, older newcomer who has devilish plans of his own.  Victor is presented with the challenge of trying to get back to Victoria, yet not hurt Emily while remaining true to his ideals and sense of honor.  The Corpse Bride on the other hand has to decide if she is willing to have love ever after, but at the sake of hurting another in the same way that she was.<br /><br />THE CORPSE BRIDE isn't a movie for young children. However, it is an entertaining film that those over the age of 11 on up can enjoy.  I enjoyed watching this film.  There were a few moments that were quite funny, e.g. the skeleton band and some that were a little frightening, e.g. when the dead all rise and march to church for a wedding.  However, there really isn't anything in the movie that is gross, sick, or graphic. I highly recommended the movie for any Buron fan, fans of stop-animation, and anyone who has an interest in the macarbe or Eastern European folktales.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>Tim Burton one of my favorite directors truly outdoes himself with this movie called Corpse Bride Starting Deep and Carter who do lot of Burton films.  The whole story line is deep, dark, at times freaky.  But if you love Tim Burton films then pick this movie up and enjoy the voice over work of Deep and Carter.  I look forward to all Tim Burton films and his creativeness might be twisted and deep dark in his own mind but he makes killer movies time and time again.  If you want a different kind of till death do you part then pick this movie up and enjoy a very good movie for the ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>This is a great love story for kids.

This week I watched this film and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN694K">Alice in Wonderland</a>.  Though the general darkness of the film is not an environment I typically seek out, I learned that Burton uses the overall darkness and dreariness in his films' imagery to build his story to its unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />The stop-motion animation (at least that is what it looks like) was well done.  The scenery and trees, etc., are classic Burton.  I actually felt for both of the brides and the groom in this twisted tale of wishes, dreams, and love lost and love found.<br /><br />I won't spill the beans, but if you are like me, you will greatly enjoy the exciting conclusion to this dark tale.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to viewers probably aged 10+.  Younger children may have nightmares, though the movie is not particularly scary over all.<br /><br />All in all I'd say that I liked this film a lot, but did not "love it."<br /><br />A solid 4-star offering for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A8X8D4BUY5DFU.html">A8X8D4BUY5DFU</a><br/><p>Great theme, plot, twists.

Combining the macabre and childish elements with stop motion animation techniques, Burton gives life to a fantastic story, just as he did in 1993 with the superb Nightmare before Christmas.<br /><br />The store serves the director as an excuse to build yet another visual fantasy, supported by the voices of several of his favorite actors: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee.<br /><br />The ironic and funny style of Burton portraying death repeats itself, forming and obscure and complex world. The principal characters are no other but a dead bride, a colorful number of skeletons, some monsters and a shy and repressed young man.<br /><br />The plot of The Corpse's Bride is based on a traditional Ukrainian tale about a girl murdered on her weeding day and waiting since then for her true love.<br /><br />In a Victorian England village lives Victor van Dort, a melancholic young man pressed by his wealthy but uneducated family to engage to a broken but aristocrat young woman named Victoria Everglot, whose parents despise the Van Dorts but want to solve their economical problems with this convenience marriage.<br /><br />During a wedding rehearsal at the Everglot's house, Victor goes out to practice his vows, and accidentally says the words on a dead bride's tomb, who has been expecting since her dead for her true love to say the words that magically will free her to be happily ever after.<br /><br />From that point, Victor goes on a journey in the land of the dead with his new bride. Down there everything seems more fun and colorful that "up there", where the world of the living is, on the contrary, almost colorless, with and aesthetic close to whites and blacks, keeping the stiffness and conservative style of the Victorian Ages.<br /><br />Although the title suggests otherwise, The Corpse's Bride is a sweet and sour love story with a poetic capacity very suggestive and dreamy. True to his provoking spirit, Burton bets on surprising us, letting his usual black humor to disperse over an oppressive atmosphere while the emotional theme of the film, the loss of love, is told like a musical comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A26O0T192IBKY1.html">A26O0T192IBKY1</a><br/><p>Tim Burton returned to his stop-motion greatness is this great romantic fantasy. Once again teaming up with animator Mike Johnson who he worked with on The Nightmare Before Christmas, the brought Burton's idea for a short story invoving necrophilia into an enjoyable family feature.<br /><br />Taking place in Victorian era England, the worried young Victor is engaged to the very ladylike a Victoria(a joke on Victor/Victoria), but is having trouble remembering his vows. After dropping his engagement ring in the woods, he unintentionally resurrects Emily, the corpse of a bride who was killed on her wedding night. She takes him to the underworld where he learns her sad tale. Victor manages to talk her into taking him topside by a magic potion, and tells Victoria what happened, but Emily spitefully returns him to back to the land of the dead. Meanwhile, Victoria's parents believe Victor has ditched her, so they promise her hand to the aristocratic Lord Barkis, who really intends to kill and take her fortune, although he's unaware that Victoria's family was really marrying her to Victor for his family's money. Victor himself hears of Victoria's new fiance via one of his old coachmen who recently died of a bad cough. This causes Victor to consent to marrying Emily, but they decide to take their wedding upstairs to the land of the living. After an initial shock by most of the townspeople who think that's its a typical zombie holocaust, they realize that the dead are just there for the wedding. Victoria makes her way to the chapel, and Emily notices her just before Victor is willingly going to drink poison to join Emily in holy matrimony. Emily decides to let Victor marry Victoria instead, but Lord Barkis shows up and Emily recognizes him as the man who killed her. He unwittingly drinks the poison though, and the dead guests drag him back to the underworld. Emily then drifts peacefully off into the afterlife, leaving Victor and Victoria to live happily ever after.<br /><br />When this movie first came out, I liked it but quickly forgot about it because of how much more entertaining I found the Wallace & Gromit movie(another stop-motion movie)at the time which came out a few weeks later. It wasn't until I rented it again a few years later that I grew to appreciate it more. It's got a bittersweet story to it done to gothic background. There's some fine humor in it, along with a few slightly unecessary but still welcome musical numbers. I especially loved the outlandish character designs and dark backgrounds, and how much more livelier they made the world of the dead seem from the world of the living. I highly recommend this as a movie to show at either Halloween or Valentines, an definately one for your video library.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>A friend loaned this to me. I avoided seeing it, though I was curious because of it's Oscar nomination. This is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen in years. The dead people are fun and energetic; the "live" people are as boring as mud (as depicted). There are totally believable (voiced) performances from good guys Depp, Bonham Carter & Watson, and the great Michael Gough. What made this different, and special from Burton's other animated films, is Danny Elfman's wonderful score, and especially the tribute to Gilbert & Sullivan. So clever, so intelligent. So unusual...it was the dead singing of their happiness. Let's just hope that little kids don't think it's "cool" to be dead. It's really a wonderful and sweet story, and, if kids listen, it's better to be alive. Making fun of the English, it's a tough call to say if "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" deserved that award. I loved both films. I'm sorry I put this one on the back-burner. I'd hate to think I'm a snob...</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>It's odd that Tim Burton's Corpse Bride should be released the same year as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CZ0PT4">Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a>. Perhaps it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the two films, both are stop-motion animation, came out during the same time. Both films are great and award-worthy (W&G won the "Best Animated Feature" Oscar). Too bad this film wasn't held back until 2006 when it almost would've been guaranteed the award.<br /><br />Johnny Depp voices the prim and proper Victor who is to be married to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson). Their scheming parents who hope to exploit each other's fortunes, both of which are already spent, arrange the marriage. But on the day of the wedding Victor loses the wedding ring. He finds it in a dark foreboding forest... on the finger of a corpse. Now he must marry the Corpse Bride who is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. Meanwhile Victoria is being courted by the wealthy (or is he?) yet morally bankrupt Lord Barkis. Soon Victor and the Corpse Bride go to the Land of the Dead to find out how to end their engagement but things become even more complicated when she develops feelings for him. All of this leads to a climactic confrontation between the living and the deceased.<br /><br />The voice cast also includes Tracey Ullman in two roles, Joanna Lumley as Maudeline Everglot, Albert Finney as Finis Everglot, Christopher Lee as Pastor Galswells and Danny Elfman as Bone Jangles. Although not quite the masterpiece that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AIRUOU">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a> is, Corpse Bride is a cult classic in its own right. It utilizes Tim Burton's gothic sensibilities and his love of macabre humor. It's a stop-motion world of wonder and horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Humorous, romantic, quirky, melodic: Tim Burton and Co. push this right buttons again in this feel ghoulish romp thru both sides of life.

Beetle Juice gave us a good-humored descent into the underworld while Edward Scissorhands profiled a poignant monster far kinder than the nice suburban folk he encountered. Sleepy Hollow was dark, lush, and painterly. Mars Attacks! - bright and cheery - unleashed some of the nastiest cartoon characters ever drawn. Burton's celebrated stop-motion animation efforts; The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Corpse Bride showcase his uniquely graphic approach to film, to say nothing of his obsession with the macabre.<br /><br />Maybe the problem is that Burton is starting to behave like a musician who only knows one song and wanders nocturnal landscapes in search of new ways to play it. Where The Nightmare Before Christmas seemed long on visuals and short on story, Corpse Bride feels positively content-less. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I thought to myself, "You know, this would have made a much better book," something along the lines of Polar Express - huge format, gorgeous drawings, brief captions. Clocking in at an anemic 1:18, and padded out with some regrettable Danny Elfman musical numbers, Corpse Bride suffers from "less there than meets the eye" syndrome.<br /><br />The humor here rests on a slender reed indeed; the living world is dark, foreboding, and cruel while the afterlife is a regular chuckle-fest. The film's most memorable scene is a piano duet between the living Victor and the dead, and cranky, Emily - necrophilia never sounded so good! Indeed, Emily, who has retained a splendid, even opulent, figure despite being dead, seems like a better choice than the living Victoria. Of course Emily does have that chatty and annoying maggot living behind her eye that, for some reason, sounds like Peter Lorre. Because it's a cartoon, voices are important, and Helena Bonham-Carter is perfect, as always. Johnny Depp, by contrast, is unfortunately cast and struggles through his English accent unconvincingly - are all English actors currently employed?<br /><br />Wonderful eye-candy but just not enough meat on the bones.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>This is yet another fantastic cartoon spawned from the creativity and imagination of Tim Burton.The story is really cute,its great for both kids of all ages and adults.The kids will really like the songs,Danny Elfman again pours his genius into anther fantastic film.Is there nothing these guys can't do?I don't want to give this film away,but it s both visually and auditorily appealing.The ammount of art and skill put into the detail of everything you see on screen is astonishing,you won't believe your eyes.Now for you FX tech junkies out there like myself,these are amongst the most expensive and complicated stop-motion puppets ever created for a stop-motion film to date.The cost of the puppets however aren't as important or impressive however as the engineering that went into them.Just think of all the gears,levers,cables and other mechanisims made for a clock tower but miniaturized into the size of wrist/pocket watch&multiply the number of parts 10 times over.Yeah...that's pretty incredible.This film is as great an accomplishment technology wise as it is in story telling.Truely a gem for all to enjoy for years and years.This is the kind of originality and creativeity that is missing from most all other Hollywood films,and you don't have to be a Tim Burton,or Danny Elfman fan to appreciate it.Rent it to see for yourself,but well worth owning.Don't let this one get away.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>It is a touching story that follows in the tradition of Nightmare Before christmas. And that is saying something! I couldn't believe that Tim Burton would top himself! But he did. This movie has a voice all it's own and deserves to be seen.

Sadly, the title character, Emily (the Corpse Bride), does not have herself a happy ending and her tale of her eminent demise (by murder for her money) is not the typical happy-ever-after associated in most animated films; still, the movie maintains an aura of whimsicality and jubilee despite its horror film-like antics.  Entertaining but somewhat sad film, but long overdue.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>I managed to get a special  edition copy of this that included a Holo-gram  cover, and a special story booklet in the package.<br /><br />This is another masterwork by the fertile mind of Tim Burton.<br /><br />The casting is genius. Truly superb voice work by all of the cast, and animation beyond compare. It really is so wonderful that an artist like Burton will invest in a stop motion work of genius, when past-masters like Disney are bailing out to save money( read, make money).<br /><br />The Film alone is worth the price, and the extras give an insight into the film making process, as well as the mind of Tim Burton.<br /><br />Personally I Like Helena Bonham Carter's Character. And her role in this romantic drama, full of emotion, supernatural wonder, and true wonder, is just magical.<br /><br />Well worth a place in any good film collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Only the wickedly devilish mind of Tim Burton could concoct such a whimsical and unusual tale.  This Oscar-nominated animated film despite its rather ghoulish scenario is quite fun for the whole family.  The story deals with the prearranged wedding of Victor and Victoria, a winsome young couple who have no idea of what to expect; each family thinks the marriage will solve their financial woes; little do they realize they're both destitute.  Bumbling Victor, unable to remember his wedding vows at the rehearsal wanders into the forest and unwittingly marries Emily, the corpse bride.  Should Victor stay in this strange underworld of the dead, or should he try and get back to the living and prevent the marriage of Victoria to a scheming count?<br /><br />Burton deftly uses a dark image of the living world that is abruptly the opposite of the colorful world of the dead.  Danny Elfman's songs and score are perfect and Burton utilizes a talented voice cast including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Albert Finney.  There are some dazzling images and the "go action" animation is quite inventive.  All in all, while not a classic film, CORPSE BRIDE is an entertaining 77 minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Now I should get this out of the way: I LOVE Nightmare Before Christmas. I still love the songs, characters and everything. So when they make the spiritual sequel, you're going to inevitably love it, unless they do something stupid. Well Corpse Bride isn't a failure, it's a bit "resting on laurels" feel. It's of course a visually striking movie but it doesn't feel as innovative as Nightmare was.<br /><br />Victor is having an arranged marriage with Victoria, which'll bring up the family's money of course. Completely blowing his vow rehearsal, he goes off to the woods to practice and places his ring on a skinny branch. Only it's not a branch but the finger of the Corpse Bride. Taken into the world of the dead, he must deal with not only his new bride's devotion but his intended fiance being married off to a slimy guy(as usual).<br /><br />Now for you parents out there who are very apprehensive about letting kids watch this kind of stuff, I'd say watch it with them rather than letting it be a babysitter. It can get creepy for kids and there's even morbid things such as a dead resident who literally separates himself. Of course it's animated and there's enough fairy tale qualities to keep it from being disturbing.<br /><br />Where the film shines is its animation and voice acting. More fluid and striking than Nightmare, it's obvious close to 15 years will improve the artform. And of course we have the upcoming Wallace and Gromit movie which shows we don't need fancy computers to tell stories. In the 5th collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp has that perfect shy guy voice and is very likable but we also have Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />Now the comparisons between this and Nightmare are obvious and very unwarranted although sometimes there's similarities. Victor goes into the woods where he's introduced to a new world, such as Jack finding the holiday trees. The bride falls apart literally at times just like Sally and Victor has a dead dog only this one isn't a flying ghost but rather a skeletal puppy. But that's like saying Sleepy Hollow is similar in look to Batman Returns. It's the same filmmaker so it's bound to have similar ideas.<br /><br />It's no Nightmare that's for sure but it's sure a great film overall.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's second film this year is Corpse Bride. His first film this year was his whacky version on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in which Johnny Depp (upcoming The Libertine, Secret Window) also starred as a the insanely Willy Wonka. In Corpse Bride, Burton and his crew bring back the feel that The Nightmare Before Christmas gave and Corpse Bride hits the bullseye dead on target, enjoyble story with funny moments and some pretty decent songs. Depp voices Victor Von Dort, who is getting married to Victoria (Emily Watson, Red Dragon, Gosford Park) but here's the thing, Victoria's parents are grouchos and at the rehearsle, Victor kinda gets a little nervous, screws it up, so he takes a stroll in the woods and accidently places the ring for Victoria on a finger of a corpse...the corpse girl rises from the ground and she winds up taking Victor underground where there is other dead people. Victor must be dreaming, he wants this not to be real but he isnt imagining this, he actually proposed to his newly Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, Big Fish, Fight Club), who died years ago waiting for the one she was going to marry to come along but he never so, so she waited for him and she wound up a corpse. So, after hearing that Victoria is marrying someone else, Victor decides he should marry Emily but in order for him to do so, he has to drink poison and die himself. So, the ghastly skeletons and deadites walk among the living for the marriage between The Corpse Bride and Victor. Anyway, that's all I'm going to tell you...I dont want to give away the whole movie but for what it was worth, Corpse Bride is bound to be another Tim Burton classic. Also starring the voices of<br /><br />Richard E. Grant (The Serpent's Kiss, Gosford Park), Albert Finney (Big Fish, Erin Brokovich), Michael Gough (Sleepy Hollow,Batman movies (except Batman Begins) and of couse the lengendary Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy)</p></br><a href="../users/AXFI7TAWD6H6X.html">AXFI7TAWD6H6X</a><br/><p>I have been a fan of Tim Burton's work for sometime now. His last foray into stop-animation was with the classic "The Nightmare Before Christmas". I loved the unique animation and the delightful storyline. I was hoping that Tim would capture that same magic again. I was not disappointed with his latest foray into animation "Corpse Bride".<br /><br />Tim Burton brings together a dazzling cast of actors some of which he has worked with in the past like Johnny Depp ("Edward Scissorhands", "Sleepy Hollow", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"), Helena Bonham Carter ("Big Fish"), and Albert Finney ("Big Fish"). Johnny is the voice over for the protagonist of the film Victor Van Dort. His parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) had set Victor up to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson), the daughter of the high society couple Everglots who are now penniless. On the day of the wedding rehearsal, Victor is so nervous that he cannot recite his vows correctly and is sent away by the pastor. Victor ends up in a forest and unwittingly says his vows correctly and winds up being the husband of a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). During his absence a mysterious man named Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) makes a play for Victoria.<br /><br />What first attracted me to this film is the animation. I loved the shape of the characters' facial features and their pasty white skin. I especially liked the color of Emily's blue hair. I also loved the design of the skeletonal characters. The deep rich dark hues of the settings was visually pleasing to this viewer's eyes.<br /><br />I personally like the storyline very engaging. This film turned out that it isn't scary. It is very whimsical. The few flaws to this film is: a) too many musical numbers. Some worked, some didn't. I found a few quite annoying and to be a big detriment to the film. What worked the best was the simple piano score that had the most impact on me. And b)the attempts at humor were half-hearted at best. It is either going to be a comedy or isn't. For all its flaws, "Corpse Bride" was whimsical escape for me from reality. To put it simply, I loved it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>Corpse Bride is magical and simplistic. Burton has invented another dark and humerous world, filmed with song and dance. The figurines are well made and beautiful. The set design is magnificent, and the story is enjoyable. An awesome group of actors provide their voices in this fun movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>Recently we went to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. It's a stop-motion animation flick, similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas.<br /><br />It's thoroughly entertaining, great family fare. The only knocks I have against it are its length--it is short--and it has a pretty linear and predictable plot. The voice actors turn in good performances. Danny Elfman does a great job, as always, with the music. The movie features a great colour scheme, evoking a grey, Victorian style in the land of the living, and a more colourful land of the dead.<br /><br />It's a great family film, as I said. However, it could be scary for very young kids. Kids under 5 shouldn't be at the movies anyways.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My wife is a big fan of Johnny Depp and The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I knew we were going to see this movie as soon as it came out.  When she described the plot to me, I said, "sounds like a Russian fairytale." To which she replied, "you're scary."  Corpse Bride is indeed loosely based on a Russian fairytale.<br /><br />The reason the plot made me think of Russian fairytales is because the concept of death and ghosts in Russian myth is more akin to fairies and fairyland than traditional European purgatory. Ghosts can lead a rich existence in the afterlife, including marriage.  This concept might be a bit difficult to grasp for American audiences, but Corpse Bride mixes belief systems anyway so it's not that critical to the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Basically, Victor Van Dort (Depp) is to be married to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson).  Victor is the son of a successful fishmonger, and thus has plenty of money but no status.  The upcoming bourgeois class, so to speak. Conversely, Victoria comes from an impoverished noble class.  The marriage is one of necessity, and yet the two find they love each other anyway.<br /><br />It's all very quaint.  Into this mess steps two sinister characters: the Corpse Bride herself (Helena Bonham Carter) who is rather lusciously sculpted, and Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), a male black widow of sorts who marries women for their dowries.  Barkis is apparently a complete idiot, as he can't seem to recognize that the Everglots are dirt poor, even though the family bemoans this situation at every corner.  And oh yeah, their mansion is a dirty mess.<br /><br />After a disastrous wedding rehearsal (with Christopher Lee lending his deep baritone of disapproval to Pastor Galswells), Victor wanders off into the forest to rehearse his lines.  He rehearses them on what he thinks is a tree, only to accidentally propose to the Corpse Bride herself.  In no time, she whisks him away to the Neitherworld-oh wait, sorry, wrong movie-to the underworld.  Or somewhere that dead people go.<br /><br />One might be led to believe that this is the place where ghosts go, but it doesn't seem like it.  If anything, the dead seem to have a much more enjoyable time than the living.  It has a very Mexican Day of the Dead feel to it, with a lot more color than the black and grays that color the living world. Everyone in this strange underworld is a walking punch line (the chef is just a head...the head chef. Get it?!). After much wrangling, Victor convinces his new bride to visit the living to meet his parents.  This takes a good ten minutes of dialogue and preparation.<br /><br />After his return, Victor resigns himself to marrying the Corpse Bride.  But there's a catch: he has to really be dead to marry her.  So Victor decides to give up the ghost, so to speak.  The dead then march off to the living world and hilarity ensues.  Which is strange, since it was so difficult the first time to get Victor and his Corpse Bride up to the surface the first time around.<br /><br />Corpse Bride is a lot like that.  It sets up a rule and then gets bored with it.  The conclusion is satisfying, although a little trite.  Without giving the rest of the plot away, the question of whether the dead are undead...or just dead and loving it, is never really answered.  In typical Burton fashion, the movie blithely moves along without worrying too much about logic.<br /><br />In that regard Corpse Bride is a lot of fun.  The characters are perfect parodies of Victorian-era archetypes.  The living world has the feel of a Gormenghast novel, which is undeniably depressing, claustrophobic, and very, very British.  There aren't enough musical sequences, but the ones that do pop up are amusing.  Unfortunately, some of the musical themes recur throughout the film (specifically, "according to plan"), but the characters sing so infrequently that you forget what they're referencing.<br /><br />There are horror homages too.  With Burton, there always are: the Corpse Bride has a maggot (Enn Reitel) in her head that sounds like Peter Lorre.  It gets old fast.  The piano is a Harryhausen, named after the famous stop-motion animator, Ray Harryhausen.<br /><br />It's also not nearly as charming as The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The animation is superb, but that doesn't mean much in a world of CGI and well, Burton's other films.  You won't be humming any of the tunes afterwards and the characters aren't fleshed out enough to care all that much.  Heck, the villain doesn't even have a good theme song!<br /><br />If your kids want to see something Halloween-ish, this is just the movie for them.  While Corpse Bride is cute, it is not necessarily for young children.  There are a lot of dismembered organs moving about (most gruesomely, a fellow who splits himself in two, pulsing organs and all), along with a lot of dead bodies.  Adults might be a bit bored, as the plot is fairly linear.<br /><br />Ultimately, Burton can't top The Nightmare Before Christmas, which has now attained a form of cult status.  The Corpse Bride fairytale can be told in a couple of paragraphs, and it doesn't translate as well onto film the way, say, Beauty and the Beast did.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Victor Van Dort (depp) is arranged to be married to Victoria Everglott (Watson), a woman he has never met.

Fortunately, when Victor and Victoria meet, it is love at first sight.  Unfortunately, the wedding rehearsal goes poorly, with Victor forgetting his lines.  While practicing his vows later in the forest, he accidentally places the ring on the skeletal finger of Emily (Carter), the Corpse Bride.  She brings him to the underworld to meet her parents and friends.  Meanwhile, in Victor's absence, Victoria's parents plot to marry her off to Barkis Bittern (Grant).<br /><br />"Corpse Bride" looks amazing.  Stop-motion animation comes seamlessly to life and makes the characters alive.  Tim Burton's "regulars" voice all the characters and all do a good job.  The main problem, for me, was that the movie felt too long, even at only 78 minutes.  While the animation is neat to see at first, it loses something after a while and ceases to be a novelty.  "Corpse Bride" is definately for fans of Tim Burton or this kind of animation.

This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed housepet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not as interesting as those in Burton's other animated film, "The Nightmare Before Christmas". In short, even though all of the characters in "The Nightmare Before Christmas" are dead, they just seem more alive and motivated than the characters in this film. Also, this movie is darker than "Nightmare" and not as funny, so kids under 10 might find it too intense and probably not as interesting. Thus, although it is worthwhile viewing, I'm just afraid that Tim Burton set the bar too high with his previous animated film.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I watched this film recently&the timing went by truly quickly.now Tim Burton's film takes elements from his past works.I think he hit his peak back in the day.the soundtrack sounds like the usual ones for Burton's films.Danny Elfman's scores still sound the same.it was a interesting wedding.fast paced film.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I went to see this on saturday.

He lives with his Victoria (which BTW is my sis's name). One day he ruins a rehearsal for the wedding, so he runs out into the forest and accedentaly puts the ring on the finger of a young corpse named Emily, which he thinks is a twig.

And his new stop-animated masterpiece "Corpse Bride," a host of bizarre characters and a bittersweet love triangle, has all three qualities.<br /><br />This is an "underground" film in the best sense of the word. It gives you the sort of feeling that really expert haunted houses do -- you're enjoying the ghouls and skeletons too much to care who it's aimed at.<br /><br />Victor (Johnny Depp) is at the rehearsal for his arranged wedding, when he forgets his vows. Not a good omen. He runs out and rehearses it by himself, and ends up slipping the ring on the finger of a dead girl, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). But Emily, who died tragically, falls in love with Victor and considers herself married to him.<br /><br />Now Victor is trapped in the underworld, which is a surprisingly cheery, upbeat place when you consider everyone is dead. He tries to find his way back to the world of the living, but soon finds himself more drawn to the tragic Emily. Now he must make the ultimate choice: Will he return (for as long as he lives) to his arranged bride, or stay in the underworld with the Corpse Bride?<br /><br />You'd think a movie about dead people would be depressing. At the very least, dark. But surprisingly "Corpse Bride" is neither -- instead, Burton has crafted a sweet, enchanting little love story where one of the people happens to be dead, and which is set in the underworld. There's nothing frightening about it. If anything, it's enchanting.<br /><br />Is the plot original? Heck no -- boil it down, and you have a boy-meets-girl story. But it's the delivery that's charming, from the funny dialogue ("Play dead!") to the colorful inhabitants of the underworld (like the pirate, or the intimidating minister). The macabre humour and song-and-dance numbers add to the charm of this world, where the dead are more alive than the living.<br /><br />And the voice actors seal the deal; what could have been merely funny becomes touching, in their hands.Johnny Depp brings the timid, tremulous Victor to life, and makes his dilemma believable, while Carter makes us look past protruding bones and bluish skin, to the sweet romantic Emily was. The only problem is that moronic maggot -- it's an annoying distraction.<br /><br />Coming up with a suitable follow-up for cult classic "Nightmare Before Christmas" couldn't have been easy. But Burton does so in rare style, creating a story both hilarious and bittersweet. Enchanting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's second film this year is Corpse Bride. His first film this year was his whacky version on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in which Johnny Depp (upcoming The Libertine, Secret Window) also starred as a the insanely Willy Wonka. In Corpse Bride, Burton and his crew bring back the feel that The Nightmare Before Christmas gave and Corpse Bride hits the bullseye dead on target, enjoyble story with funny moments and some pretty decent songs. Depp voices Victor Von Dort, who is getting married to Victoria (Emily Watson, Red Dragon, Gosford Park) but here's the thing, Victoria's parents are grouchos and at the rehearsle, Victor kinda gets a little nervous, screws it up, so he takes a stroll in the woods and accidently places the ring for Victoria on a finger of a corpse...the corpse girl rises from the ground and she winds up taking Victor underground where there is other dead people. Victor must be dreaming, he wants this not to be real but he isnt imagining this, he actually proposed to his newly Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, Big Fish, Fight Club), who died years ago waiting for the one she was going to marry to come along but he never so, so she waited for him and  she wound up a corpse. So, after hearing that Victoria is marrying someone else, Victor decides he should marry Emily but in order for him to do so, he has to drink poison and die himself. So, the ghastly skeletons and deadites walk among the living for the marriage between The Corpse Bride and Victor. Anyway, that's all I'm going to tell you...I dont want to give away the whole movie but for what it was worth, Corpse Bride is bound to be another Tim Burton classic. Also starring the voices of<br /><br />Richard E. Grant (The Serpent's Kiss, Gosford Park), Albert Finney (Big Fish, Erin Brokovich), Michael Gough (Sleepy Hollow,Batman movies (except Batman Begins) and of couse the lengendary Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy)</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas".<br /><br />So, it did not surprise me that I enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Music not as good as Nightmare.<br /><br />In the 12 years between the 2 films the film looked great.  I was really impressed with the look & style of the film.  In other words, it had a gorgeous look to it.<br /><br />The extra on the DVD were good as well.  Other film makers can learn from this DVD package.  A lot of recent DVD releases have LITTLE TO NO EXTRAS AT ALL.  This package has multiple extras.  A plus to me in a DVD package.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Victor van Dort, son of wealthy but title-less fishmongers, is to marry Victoria Everglot, daughter of a titled but impoverished family.  Victor stumbles through his wedding lines during rehearsal, and wanders off into the woods to practice.  Unfortunately, Victor finally gets the lines right and awakens the corpse bride, a girl who died on her wedding day and has been waiting for her husband to return.  The corpse bride, Emily, rises from the earth in front of Victor and accepts his vows.<br /><br />Emily takes Victor "downstairs" to her world, the world of the dead, while his true love Victoria awaits him in the land of the living.  When Victor shows up in the living world only to confess he has married a corpse, the Everglot's arrange for Victoria to marry someone else, a pompous devil who believes the Everglot's have money, Barkis Bittern.<br /><br />Will Victor be forced into honoring the vows he spoke to Emily, or will he be set free to marry the live and innocent Victoria before she falls victim to Barkis?<br /><br />In my opinion, the problems with this film outweighed the attractions.  It seemed to straddle the fence between its appeal to a children's audience and an adult audience, making it flavorless in both arenas.  It's a little too gruesome, in spite of its "cuteness", for small children, yet the songs and the shallowness left it too insipid for adults.<br /><br />The vocal talents gathered are among the best; Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Joanna Lumley (I LOVE Absolutely Fabulous, sweetie-darling), the remarkable Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, and Christopher Lee, but without a decent script their talents were stifled.  The animation was fun, but stiff in places, such as where Emily's gown was supposed to float in the wind and wound out looking like a piece of cardboard.  And the songs were awful, the movie would have been better without attempting to be a musical.<br /><br />Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A12IDQSS4OW33B.html">A12IDQSS4OW33B</a><br/><p>Victor {Johnny Depp} is about to get married when he is in the woods and sees a stick on the ground.

Technically it is a marvel.  As I watched it, every so often I was simply struck anew by how much work went into it.  Each movement carefully executed by hand, so that the little "stick figures" spring to life.  The attention and craftsmanship is staggering...not a word I use very often.<br /><br />There are many lovely, artistic images as well.  My favorite was a scene near the end when the Corpse Bride stands in a doorway, and her long gown slowly turns into a cloud of butterflies.  It was a delicate and lovely moment...showing a true flight of imaginative fancy.<br /><br />But there are too many things not to like.  The story is pedestrian.  None of the characters are very engaging.  And even at around 80 minutes, the film was too long.  The plot is too slight, and it is padded by some mediocre (and poorly sound-edited) Danny Elfman tunes.  Elfman is trying yet again to evoke the Teutonic bombast of  Kurt Weill (Threepenny Opera, "Mack the Knife") but his music sounds the same from movie to movie.  I like that Tim Burton has his group of collaborators (like Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter), but it's time to dump Elfman.  His best stuff is still Oingo Boingo and the theme to The Simpsons.  After Batman, I think he stopped actually writing anything original.<br /><br />I see at least 100 movies per year in the theaters, and another 100 or so on DVD / television.  About once every two years or so, a movie literally makes me doze off.  THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES did that to me.  And now, shockingly, THE CORPSE BRIDE has done it.  I lost about 5 minutes due to a little nap I took.<br /><br />My problem with many Burton movies is that they lack a heart.  Not that he doesn't want the movies to have heart, but somehow he seems to direct away from honest emotion.  Either the story is too boring to generate interest (as here) [and yes, I know he didn't technically direct this film, but let's face it...the product is his], or the plot becomes too muddled with messages to drive home an emotional climax (BIG FISH) or the film is simply too sloppy for any real emotional impact (BATMAN RETURNS).  His best movies generate real feeling from the audience DESPITE Burton, usually because his performers give him the heart he can't seem to find...he's too busy dazzling us with his visual virtuosity to simply stay put and let us OBSERVE humans in action.  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and even WILLY WONKA makes us care because their lead performers are either subtle enough (Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore) or childlike enough (Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens) to draw a response from the audience.  Other movies, like ED WOOD, are a treat because Burton obviously has an affection for the odd and strange in people, and ED WOOD is truly populated by the odd and strange.  But again, to me CORPSE BRIDE left me quite cold (no pun intended).<br /><br />Based on the reaction of the kids who were in the audience with me, this movie doesn't have enough slapstick and mischief to engage the little ones.  It doesn't have emotional impact enough to engage adults.  And teens, who love Johnny Depp, soon realize that his voice alone does not a Johnny Depp film make!<br /><br />Because of the lovely artisanship, I can't totally condemn the film.  And it does have a terrific voice cast.  But I cannot recommend it either.  A big disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KL7NXOAGKD3U.html">A3KL7NXOAGKD3U</a><br/><p>We all have to say that Tim Burton is one of those actors who is really out there...but I have to say, that this film, Corpse Bride, was really cute.  The story was funny, heartful, and just a great story all around....this is a movie that you can actually watch with the kids...there are what I would call some scary images, that I am sure some kids may have  problem with, but it is just in one part, and it is over quick...the music is great as well...yes, I would consider buying the CD....check this one out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>This movie is not a really bad film but it's not a good film.

The bad parts are the story it's very short only 77 min, there is no point to the story and it's very lacluster, the voices are also very dull and have no life to them.

And for a very simple reason. It's math:<br /><br />Art Direction: 5 Stars<br /><br />Story: 3 stars<br /><br />Execution of Story: 2 Stars<br /><br />Hence, 3 stars. Calling it Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an injustice. Because Tim Burton is most of what is WRONG with this film. As was the case with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he has abandoned the 5,000-year-old tradition of placing characters and plot at the center of a story and has decided to damn the torpedoes and just lard his films with visuals.<br /><br />That, unfortunately, is all that Corpse Bride really has, and old Timmy didn't make hardly a frame of it. The story, what little of it there is, has it all wrong. Do not make the "Corpse Bride" the most interesting character and then focus the story on the two main dullards. Who is she? Where does she live? What are her emotions? All touched on, none explored.<br /><br />At a little over an hour in length, this is less of a film than an afterschool special. Kind of like the best thing you would have seen on Pee-Wee's playhouse or something.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>"Corpse Bride" is a gruesome addition to the macabre oeuvre of Tim Burton. It tells the story, in stop-motion animation, of Victor and Victoria, a lonely boy and girl who are being forced to wed by their money-grubbing parents. But a chance encounter in graveyard brings back from the dead Emily, the reanimated corpse of a spurned bride. When Victor accidentally slips a ring onto her bony finger, she resolves to wed Victor and bring him back with her to the world of the dead.<br /><br />The sets are terrific, Victorian ghoulishness at it creepy finest. The dead live underground, in a fast-paced society that mirrors the past, complete with bars and dancehalls. The dead themselves are partly and mostly-decayed skeletons that would probably scare the bejesus out of younger kids. Emily is a case in point. One leg and one arm are decayed to bone. Her ribs are visible on one side through her tattered wedding dress. Instead of rouge, one cheek is rotted to black and the other has lost enough flesh to reveal a toothy jaw line. That Burton's puppet master manage to make her look sexy shows their mastery of the genre. There is wonderful macabre humor is well. At French headwaiter is just that -- the waiter's guillotined head, made mobile by an skittering army of corpse-eating bugs.<br /><br />The film is wonderful in all respects but plotting. The puppets are masterfully rendered in shades of brown (for the loving) and blue (for the dead). The animation is silky and smooth. But a number of plot lines don't make sense -- do not read on if you wish to be surprised! In spite of Emily's forced marriage to another character, there's no real reason that Victor must marry Emily. And there is no reason that Emily should decide to forgo her marriage to Victor when she sees Victoria in the church. And why a certain evil character would choose to drink a death-dealing potion is a mystery. Except that he plot required that he do so.<br /><br />Still, there are many, many wonderful touches to The Corpse Bride. A scene of a character dissolving into butterflies was unexpected, touching and stylistically stunning. The stop motion technique did not prevent the artists from giving the characters expression and life. The story's unique touches (like a boy reunited with his long dead dog) were clever and original and fit the plot perfectly.<br /><br />Almost lifelike, The Corpse Bride's plot could have used just a touch of the mortician's brush to render it restful and at peace.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is a classic. I think we can all agree on that. Directed by Henry Selick, who would also work with Burton on "James and the Giant Peach", "Nightmare" is a delightful mix of stop-motion animation, comedy, songs and Tim Burton's warped view of the world and holidays in particular.<br /><br />It took twelve years, but Tim Burton's newest stop-motion animated film has just been released. "Corpse Bride" shares many things with its predecessor, but it lacks two key ingredients to help the film become a classic.<br /><br />Victor's (Johnny Depp) parents, the Van Dorts (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are newly rich fishmongers, living in Victorian England, a dark and gray place, both in aesthetic and mood. In an effort to establish themselves in society, they have arranged for Victor to marry Victoria (Emily Watson), the daughter of the Everglots (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), society people who are now broke. Therefore, the marriage will benefit both families. Victor and Victoria meet for the first time shortly before the wedding rehearsal with Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee). Galswells quickly loses his patience with Victor, who, very nervous, can't remember his lines. The pastor sends Victor away to practice. Walking around, practicing, Victor unwittingly says his vows correctly and marries the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). Soon, Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) arrives and makes a play for Victoria as Victor struggles to make everything right.<br /><br />The stop motion animation used in "Bride" has clearly developed significantly in the last twelve years. The movements and facial expressions are more fluid and lifelike adding to the look of the film. Reportedly, they were able to build armatures into the puppets to change their facial expressions. In "Nightmare", they had to change the heads to reflect a new expression. All of these advances help to make the figures move as though they were hand- or computer-animated.<br /><br />The production design is rich in detail. The characters are one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Victor and Victoria are both very skinny with pasty white skin from underexposure to the sun. Their clothes are tight and formfitting, all adding to an authentic, if stylized, take on the period. Victor's mother is a robust, big framed woman and Victoria's father is short and round, both examples of people with more money and food than activity.<br /><br />Set in Victorian England, the production design seems heavily influenced by Charles Addams' cartoons. The interior of the Everglot Mansion has been painted in shades of gray and black, but this is an effect of few and small windows throughout the house, another good period detail. What light is able to penetrate is gray as a London fog.<br /><br />All of the voice actors are very good, providing the right amount of serious intonation for the characters. This brings us to one of the problems with the film. "Bride" is much more serious than its predecessor. The story is much closer to one of the Grimm's Fairy Tales, with no Tim Burton-esque moments added. The story is very dark and fable-like, which is interesting and works, but it isn't funny. It seems odd that they would take what is basically a dramatic story and animate it. Perhaps they are trying to challenge the parameters of animation with this film. If this is the case, why did they add a few moments of attempted humor? If you are going to tell a drama, tell a drama. If you want people to laugh, make it funny. Do one or the other the best you can. Don't try to do both half heartedly.<br /><br />Shortly after Victor proposes to the Corpse Bride, she takes him "downstairs" to her world, where all of the ghosts and skeletons live and play. This sequence features a song by Mr. Bonejangles (Danny Elfman) explaining what happened to the Corpse Bride. It is an amusing sequence but it is entirely out of place in this film. In addition to the previously mentioned thematic inconsistencies, the sequence doesn't match the rest of the film in style. The sequence is filled with Mexican Day of the Dead characters and illustrations, an interesting design, very cute, very charming. But how does that fit with the Victorian England design of the rest of the film?<br /><br />There are a few songs throughout and they work, to a certain degree. In all of the songs, there becomes a point when the characters start to break into choruses and the choruses are difficult to hear and understand. This may be attributed to the crappy theater I saw the film in, but I am not completely sure of that. Because we can't understand what they are saying, the songs fail to help move the story along, as necessary, and end up slowing the film down.<br /><br />Note to Warner Bros: If you release a film in "Limited Release", don't use the Cineplex Broadway Cinemas in Santa Monica as one of two venues in Los Angeles for your film. This theater is crap and doesn't do your films justice.<br /><br />What "Corpse Bride" needed was Henry Selick. Selick was too busy working on "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" and doing pre-production on his new film (hopefully, not "Monkeybone 2") to become involved. Because he directed "Nightmare" and didn't direct this film, it is fairly clear that his involvement would have improved the film dramatically.<br /><br />"Corpse Bride" has a terrific production design, very good voice acting and a dramatic story. Too bad they felt it necessary to try to make it funny and a musical.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>Time Burton's "Corpse Bride" is a nice film, but just doesn't come quite together for the audience.  I brought my daughter of four years to check this flick out.  I didn't mind doing this since I've enjoyed almost all of Burton's films.  The story, though somewhat garish, is a simple case of mistaken intentions.  Johnny Depp's character, Victor, is so nervous to get married to a young woman named Victoria (Emily Watson) that he fumbles his lines during the rehearsal.  Embarrassed after a clumsy series of events, he runs out into the forest to practice his lines.  While going through the motions, he inadvertantly awakens a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).  She thinks he is intending to marry her and takes him as her husband.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn that Victor does have feelings for Victoria AND he feels sorry for poor Emily.  We also learn that there is a dark villain with alterior motives using Victor's misfortune in his favor.<br /><br />The characters are all quite wonderful, especially since they are voiced by the likes of Christopher Lee, Joanne Lumley, Richard E. Grant and Tracey Ullman.  The humans, in typical Burton fashion, live in a dull world of greys and blacks while the dead are having a vibrant and colorful party down below.  The addition of Scraps the dog was also fun, especially for the children.<br /><br />The set design was brilliant.  I have no complaint there.  The stop-motion animation was perfect and at its quirky best.  Notice the name of the piano manufacturer on the front of the piano when Victor and Victoria first meet.  It reminds everyone where all of this stop-motion animation began.  Burton definitely knows who deserves credit and he makes it clear on the piano.<br /><br />My only real complaints are that the songs in the film felt uninspired and the story seems torn between being a children's folktale and a comedy.  There were times during the film that I caught myself checking my watch.  There were also times when my daughter got a little antsy in her seat and wanted to explore the theater.  It seems like it would have been a wonderful children's tale, but it takes the storyline almost too seriously for children to really enjoy it.  Even the scenes with the dancing skeletons became quite ho-hum after awhile.  As far as adults are concerned, once you adjust to the wonderful, stylized look of the film, you're left wondering when this film will get funny or at least a little silly.  In short, Burton seemed to interested in making this BOTH an adult and children's flick.  Plenty of other films make this work, like "The Incredibles" and "Sky High."  Unfortunately, Burton tried just a little too hard.<br /><br />In closing I have to say that this isn't a bad film, it just gets a wee bit boring for the kiddies and the oldies while it attempts to attract both at the same time.  Brilliant scenery, full of atmosphere, but a dull storyline make "Corpse Bride" worthy of three stars.  I'd rent it or check it out at the discount theater (like I did) before buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K.html">A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K</a><br/><p>Yet another Burton project crippled by Oingo Boingo man, Burton needs to lose Elfman once and for all. A couple of the piano pieces weren't bad but the songs are so lame and tacky and dampen the films. He's done a couple of sound tracks that are decent, but all his Burton film scores just suck.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Before all the big films for Christmas come out (the new Harry Potter, the Narnia films, and of course, the sequel to Transporter 2 - yeh!), there's always a slow period, where there's not much on worth watching at the cinema. But because of a friend's birthday, we had to go see something, and we made the mistake of choosing Corpse Bride. I have to admit I like Johnny Depp, but he put on a posh accent in this, which wasn't cool. I've never seen Nightmare Before Christmas either.<br /><br />What I hated about this film, is how unrealistic the characters were. I hate this about animation. The heads are huge, the eyes are bulging, and then the body is unrealistic, and stick thin. The legs could have easily snapped by the slightest wind, and I just didn't like it. Why can't animators make this kinda stuff more realistic? What's the matter of making a character look realistic instead of stupid?<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like about this, was the fact was the characters burst into stupid songs (done by Danny Elfman) at the worst possible moment. I will admit I love stuff like Grease & Sound Of Music, but it seemed out of place during this.<br /><br />There was only a handful of people in the cinema seeing this, despite the fact we thought it would be mobbed due to the kids being off school. This has got quite good reviews, but I just don't see it I'm afraid. And as soon as I said to my boyfriend I was going to see this, he instantly said "awww, why?!" or something to that effect.<br /><br />I haven't seen a single bad review about this yet, and I fear I'm going to be the only one, and get lots of negative votes. (Bring them on!) Unless I can possibly get my boyfriend to do a negative review, just so I'm not too alone :( but he doesn't seem keen. Not that I'm recommending it that is!<br /><br />Tim boy, stick to having Johnny's lovely face in your films, and stop asking the mother of your child to actually audition for the film!!! (Helena Bonham Carter admitted that in an interview.) This film is not worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>I LOVED "Nightmare Before Christmas" so when I heard that  Tim Burton was making "The Corpse Bride" I did not hesitate to go to see the movie in theaters... I left the theater absolutely amazed at how bad one movie could possibly be. What was Mr. Burton thinking?<br /><br />The characters in this film have no endearing qualities, are rather boring and un-responsive. The music is simply dredful and the acting horrible. How did Mr. Burton get associated with such mindless, pointless dribble is my only question?<br /><br />The movie takes place in the Victorian age when two people married to enhance the family wealth. A shy geeky looking Johnny Depp must marry a woman he hardly knows. Unable to accept the path that has been choosen he wanders off into a nearby woods praticing his vows and suddenly a corpse appears in a wedding gown. Unknownly he was just wedded to a corpse and is transported underground to deal with the wife that has magets that talk through her eyes and the typical ghosts and goblins. The corpse apparently had been murdered by a man who said he loved her but, really wanted the family money- this betrayal causing her to wait in her wedding dress for someone who would actually love her...<br /><br />The movie plays out as a melodramatic, clay matic horror come to life. The story is boring and unimiganitive. Possibly one of the worst movies I seen made and made me want to strach my eyes out... this movie was not enjoyed by the kids I saw it with...<br /><br />But, what I found mainly annoying about the movie was the horrible songs- all animate features have songs but, this one could have gone well without... the songs are horribly written and even veteren stage actor Albert Finney's voice seemed to be irritating. The songs in other words are just about as good as watching a Mary Kate & Ashley sing-along.<br /><br />This movie is hardly entertaining for the kids or the adults to see... In other words don't rent, don't buy this movie.

This movie is pointless and a waste of time and money.....</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>This is the 6th time that director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp worked togther on a movie that started all the way back in 1990, with Edward Scissorhands, and then Ed Wood, and then 2 movies last year inclduing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and now this movie, thodse are the only ones that I know of that they worked on in 15 years. Now for a note for parents that this is a pretty dark PG movie, that it might not be best to leave your kids to watch by themsevles. Some where along the way there is mild lanuage. Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is getting married, or maybe like forced into marriage into the broke Evergot family. But of coruse he has cold feet, even if he doesn't hide it very well. His bride is to be Victoria (Emily Watson, who parents jsut well are parents and they are Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) and Finis Everglot (Albert Finney). He also have parents but they are as snobs as hers are. He keeps messing up on his vows, and run away to a dark forest, and while he is practicing his vows, he ends up putting his ring of which he thinks is a branch of a tree, but a skelton fingers of Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). And let's not get itno her story of way she is a corpse bride. And somehow Victor finds himself married to her, and she brings him to her world, which is home of the dead, where he learns her tale. Victor ends up going missing, comes back with her to "meet" his parents, overhears a conveirson by her parents (Victoria's) and has to sneak in, but she catchs him with the another girl, and brings him back to the land of the dead, and pretty soon, she has to end up marrying Count Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), who is a strngaer to her, and she doesn't live him. Now this was the 3rd film that was noiminated for best animated feature film, so you can add this on a film, to see if you want to see them, or even just movies that either won or noimated for best animated feature film.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Visually stunning and curiously endearing 'Corpse Bride' is another proof that traditional stop-motion animations, if given good amount of originality, can be as imaginatie and entertaining as Pixar animations.  (I said 'another' because there is Aardman and its Wallace & Gromit.)  I don't say 'Corpse Bride' is better than 'Nightmare Before Christmas' of which visual and musical innovation is still to be surpassed.  But the fact doesn't change that I enjoyed thoroughly watching 'Corpse Bride' its wry graveyard humor included.<br /><br />[IT'S A LOVE STORY] Incredible you might think, but 'Corpse Bride' is a love story, which involves three characters -- Victor, Victoria, and "Corpse Bride."  Victor is to marry Victoria he never met because his parents want status, and her parents need money.  This is a typically melodramatic situation, but a clever twist is given.  It turns out that Victoria is a nice girl, with whom Victor fell in love at first sight.<br /><br />But because of the ill-judged rehearsal of his wedding vow, Victor gives his ring to a wrong woman, who is actually dead and buried in the dark forest.  She is the Corpse Bride, who gleefully brings the bridegroom to her hometown in the land of the dead, where the dead people are leading much, much joyful life.  And a dead dog too.<br /><br />Few people can think of such an idea, and fewer people are talented enough to realize this macbre idea.  Tim Burton and Mike Johnson did this job brilliantly, with so much visual delight and occasional wry humor.  Voice cast is also perfect, including Johnny Depp (as Victor who uncannily resembles Depp), Helena Bonham Carter (as Corpse Bride), Emily Watson (as Victoria).  You can hear the voice of Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Jane Horrocks, and of course, Danny Elfman who also provided the score for the film.  And Burton's favorite actors legendary Christopher Lee and Michael Gough are also to be heard.  What a cast!<br /><br />I do not say 'Corpse Bride' is perfect.  You might disagree with me, but Danny Elfman's music is not as impressive as that of 'Nightmare' and some part of the film is CGI-processed, which might have lessened the charms of the traditional stop-motion animation.  CGIs often make everything too smooth for me, and usually, much beloved Ray Harryhausen animation is not associated with too smooth movement.  That's why we use this self-contradictory phrase, stop-motion.<br /><br />Probably this is part of Tim Burton's vast world of imagination when he was a boy, which later produced 'Frankenweenie.'  It was 21 years ago, and Burton has got older since then, but 'Corpse Bride' shows that he has not lost his imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>Tim Burton, gothic mastermind behind Frankenweenie, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow, once again brings his dark, deliciously twisted sense of humor to the screen, this time in a retelling of a Russian Jewish folk tale.  I had the chance to see a prescreening of the film on campus before it was released, and greatly enjoyed the film.<br /><br />The Corpse Bride is a tale based partly on reality - reality that in centuries past, anti-Semitic Russians would ambush Jewish wedding parties, murder the bride, and bury her in her dress, where she is found by a groom-to-be, who jokingly places the ring on her bony finger, thus binding her to him as a corpse bride.<br /><br />Burton has moved the tale from Russia to Victorian England. Victor, voiced by the ever-charming Johnny Depp, is clumsy and nervous, and can't seem to get his wedding vows straight to Victoria at the rehearsal. After a series of disastrous encounters with his in-laws (including nearly torching his mother-in-law with a wedding candle), he flees in desperation to the nighttime woods, where he practices until he learns his vows, culminating in his placing the ring on a gnarled tree branch, which in reality is the ring finger of the Corpse Bride.<br /><br />Victor is sucked down into her dark underworld, populated by cannonball-riddled generals, Peter Lorre-like maggots, a Ray Charles skeletal impersonator, and Victorian skeleton children in sailor suits and dresses, and must devise a plan to return to "up there" and rescue his love Victoria from her evil parents and the slimy Lord Barkis. I won't ruin the ending for you; you'll have to see this one for yourself.<br /><br />Danny Elfman, frequent Burton collaborator (Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow), is at the musical helm here, with typical Elfman embellishments of chimes, bells, and vocals. Part of the problem was the speakers used at our screening; the voices sounded fine, but the musical numbers were very distorted and I couldn't make out the lyrics.<br /><br />The stop-motion puppets and sets are absolutely gorgeous and stunning in their level of detail. It speaks favorably of Tim's determination to use an old-fashioned special effects technique rather than animating the film in 3D, which doubtless would have been easier, but after his previous success with Nightmare Before Christmas, I can understand why he'd want to return to the medium.<br /><br />This one might be too scary and macabre for young children; it is not as child-friendly (!) as the Nightmare Before Christmas. Although it will likely be a Halloween hit (I honestly can't see the film doing well at a release at any other time than Halloween, as its appeal is strictly Halloween/ horror-oriented), this will not appeal to many "traditional" moviegoers. Although it does not contain sex, nudity, or profanity, it is full of Burton's graphic images of death (skeletons, internal organs, maggots, decaying corpses), talking skeletons, and dead-bodily humor.<br /><br />A haunting flick sure to entertain this ghostly Halloween, and fans of Burton's earlier work won't want to miss the Corpse Bride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>Well people, there are plenty of reviews here to let you know what this is all about; the story, the feel, the emotion, etc., etc.  However, most only make a passing remark concerning the "Claymation".  Though I have not read all of the reviews here, I have not found one that really makes it clear what an artistic achievement this film really is.  "Oh it's a kid's film that's too scary for kids"; is a fairly common criticism.  Complaints of its brevity have come from lovers and haters alike.  Some criticize the music's lack of "hook".  But I have not read the review that exclaims what brilliant art this really is (I apologize to those reviews I may have missed).  So, I'm adding one here to ensure that it is not beyond reach so late in the game (300 reviews can be daunting).  Let's get on with it...<br /><br />-TECHNICAL ACHEIVMENT<br />Many people have made mention of the "making of" featurettes on this DVD.  They may have told you what they saw but never explained its significance (or really understood it).  In simple terms, this is digital animation.  With off-the-shelf software, a good digital camera (still camera) and a decent posable doll, you could do the same thing in your basement.  However, what was done hear technically rivals anything done before it.  Not even Ray Harryhausen, THE visual FX master that influenced generations of those in the art ever achieved anything of such explicit detail and subtlety.  We can marvel at the technical complexity and brilliance of the "puppets" but totally miss why they are complex; expressive motion.<br /><br />-WHAT MAKES GREAT ANIMATION?<br />Some mistakenly assume that if the animation is smooth and fluid, then it is good animation; particularly when it comes to stop motion animation.  Well, that's partially true.  Making something move smoothly certainly helps convince us that it has life.  Yet, organic life isn't always smooth or regular; we bounce and stumble and jerk and shake.  We have weight and we create momentum and everything else physics brings to bear.  The animators in Corpse Bride understood this as much as any Disney animator ever did.  I think Ray H. understood this too but never had the technology and backing to ever get this level of detail with Stop Motion Animation.  Stop Motion fans adore and appreciate What Ray Harryhausen accomplished, but surely should recognize what's been achieved here.  These characters bounce and wiggle and exhibit weight and emotion.  Facial ticks and expressiveness only dreamed of in the past are taken for granted in this film simply because it is completely unobtrusive and natural.  Yet, we may never see this level of art in stop motion ever again.<br /><br />-IS SIMPLE BAD?<br />I think a film that can turn the concept of a man accidentally marrying a corps into a 75 minute story is commendable.  This film never seams too short for me.  Some stories are as long as they need to be.  There is nothing complex about this film other than the emotions of the characters.  It's all too clear; the mundane existence of the everyday life is drowned in a sepia grey tints and superficial existence.  The enlightened existence of the pain free underworld is lavished in color, friendship and merriment.  Despite and because of this, true love will blossom; nothing wrong with that.  Simple can be bad if you don't like the concept to begin with.  I like dark stories that teach us something about ourselves and this does that in spades.<br /><br />-"EMOTIONLESS, SHALLOW CHARACTERS."????<br />Sorry, I read that somewhere here at amazon.com.  Well, I obviously could not disagree more.  To be fair you can't watch this film once and know all the characters; it's not that easy.  Some of the characters are emotionless and shallow by design, so I have to give a sideways nod to that statement, but I don't think the criticisms were aimed at those characters.  The first time I saw this at the theater I was very conflicted.  I criticized many of the same things others did.  I didn't get the characters.  It had a strange mood to it.  The music was completely unexpected.  But a good film proves itself in repeat viewings. After a couple of viewings, I felt that I knew all the characters personally.  I thought all the voice actors proved perfect.  I actually enjoy the songs now.  Perhaps this film isn't as simple as people say?<br /><br />-MY RECOMMENDATION<br />  This is a fairly simple concept which is complex in its subtlties and may not satisfy everyone.  The music takes getting used to but can grow on you.  If you don't like dark fables told in animated films you should avoid this.  If you don't give a care for animation one way or the other then you probably won't think much of this.  If you are a fan of Stop Motion Animation then you really need to see this; if for no other reason than to appreciate the artistic and technical achievement, it will have been worth it.  The DVD has ample extras and a beautiful picture.  This film is one that grows in depth and enjoyment every time I watch it. As a fan of Stop Motion Animation I now revel in it.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>I truly enjoyed this well made film.

At the insistence of their families, he was betrothed to "Victoria" {read Ed Wood's 'Victor/Victoria'}, yet their oppressive natures sets him to seek solace in the nearby wilderness where he rehearses for the ceremony.<br /><br />By the by, he feels himself growing fond of this corpse bride who takes him down to meet the denizens of her world, where he becomes acquainted with all sorts of interesting characters therein, consisting of a collection of free-spirited rogues, including a dancing skeleton named "Mr. Bonejangles" {Elfman; an obvious take on Sammy Davis Jr. complete with an eyeball which moves independently from one socket to another}, Paul the head waiter {a literal head with a French accent who goes about on spindles protruding from the neck}, a worm-like maggot with the certain features and personality modeled after Peter Lorre, a rather cute black widow spider, and a dog named Scraps who could very well be the skeleton of Zero.<br /><br />Barkis Bittem is a black widower and a generally right rotten bastard who acquires his wealth on the deaths of previous wives, including Emily. With the mystical help of Elder Gutknecht, Victor, Emily along with her dead friends, walk the earth with the living to gather in a church for their marriage, despite the protests of Pastor Galswels {Lee}, where Barkis makes an appearance, who meets a proper demise. A surprising turn of events ensues with a beautifully bittersweet ending.<br /><br />The worlds of the erstwhile dead and the living are juxtaposed between the colorful underworld, and the dismal mortal world above, where 'the dead' seem liberated from perfidious constraints. The visuals are superb in that splendidly gothic ambiance with a glorious soundtrack to match. No CGI, just the wonderful implementation of this past orthodoxy, preserving this magnificent theatrical art.<br /><br />Corpse Bride is yet another marvel to be added to one's collection of cinematic favorites.</p></br><a href="../users/A319Y83RT0MRVR.html">A319Y83RT0MRVR</a><br/><p>With an amazing artistry and wonderfully vivid storytelling, this clay animation takes the Burton/Depp collaboration to whole new heights.

There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.<br /><br />The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.<br /><br />As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, an inventive film and fun to watch once you get past the slow first part.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>I had no desire to see this movie when it was released in the theater. despite my love of all thing Depp.  So I have no idea what possessed me to watch it now.

It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of living...<br /><br />With the running time only 76 minutes, "Corpse Bride" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer. I also noticed the use of the elegant cutout-style animation with the hypnotizing backgrounds very much in the style of "Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed" (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger, which is the oldest surviving animated feature film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>If you are a Burton fun you should not miss this one.

It is a great movie to test your new systems and appreciate the sound and image quality.<br /><br />The story itself is sweet and the interchange of colors that Burton uses between the two worlds is not very clever but it reverses the roles (I won't elaborate  so not to ruin it for the people that have not seen it).<br /><br />Enjoy it</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Do not try to disentangle and find out all the allusions this film contains. You will always miss most of them, even Hamlet. Just enjoy the animation  that is superbly creative and the situation that is so full of humor, black and white and in colors, that you may end up losing your marbles and loosening your jaws. The music is definitely marvelous and mysterious. A Danse Macabre in high noble society and a wedding march in the cemetery. An accidental marriage crossing the life and death divide that has to be repaired to satisfy the true right love marriage that could not take place due to some infernal elopement or kidnaping of the bridegroom. The characters are superb marionnettes and cartoons so nimble and yet stiff at the same time that they seem to be dancing cripples in wheelchairs. It's true though the dog is the best of them all. This film is a caricature, a satire of any commonplace trite established statement and of any attempt at being creative and escaping this preprogramed and overdigested world of ours. You will think of many other films and you will be right, though you will miss most of them. At times it is a direct allusion like an echo and at times it is an indirect allusion like a photographic negative. And the best of it all is that it is neither gross nor frightening, but deeply romantic, with maybe a touch of slavonic nostalgia and sadness.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>In this era of Hollywood Obsessed Computer Animation made by geeks  who could  never get a date in High School it is a true delight and wondrous  experience to watch this stop motion film made with puppets.Tim Burton weaves a simple tale about a guy named Victor in Not So Merrye Olde Englad who finds himself married to a corpse bride (although she still looks pretty to me).This movie is enhanced by Helena Bonham Carter's vocalizing which makes her character funny, sweet, vulnerable and sexy all at the same time. This movie gets beter every time I watch it and I continually find nuances such as the masterful play betweween light , darkness  and shadow which Mr. Burton excells at time and time again.This movie is low budget but has a stellar cast which includes Johnny Depp as Victor, Albert Finney, Richard E.

And that is how we love him. Corpse Bride, his latest release, is a worthy, if minor, addition to his catalog.<br /><br />Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of a nouveau riche family, who plan to marry him to destitute nobility in order to increase their status in the world. While he's not terribly fond of the idea, that changes when he meets Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his prospective bride. His in-laws aren't much to write home about, but it doesn't matter; he's smitten. During the rehearsal, he is nervous, clumsy, consistently flubbing his lines and movements, and he flees into the forest to contemplate his cold feet. While practicing, he uses a convenient branch to practice slipping the ring onto Victoria's finger. The problem is, it's actually the skeletal and of the nameless titular character (Helena Bonham-Carter), who rises from the grave and claims that, since he said the vows, the two of them are now married. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Victor's prospective in-laws are fuming over his disappearance, while the mysterious wedding guest Lord Bittern (Gosford Park's Richard E. Grant) has his designs on marrying the lovely Victoria for himself.<br /><br />Despite the above, this is actually a simple, straightforward film. The voice acting is quite nicely done, the songs are enjoyable, the pace moves right along. Remind you any of The Nightmare Before Christmas? It should. Burton isn't trying anything new here; he's taken a new story and stuck it into the proven structure. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's good. Not great, but good. *** &#65533;</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>Wouldn't it have been great to have been buddies with Tim Burton as a child?  He must have been the coolest cat around, a genius with an imaginatively poetic attraction to the darker side of things.  As a filmmaker, Burton's sort of an enigma to me.  Just look at Corpse Bride.  Apart from weird folks like myself, I don't see much of a target audience for this film.  Children may well find the start of the film a little tedious, since nothing big happens for a while, and both the story and music seem to play more for adults.  Sure, kids will find their fair share of laughs in the film and will surely enjoy the uniquely odd representations of Burton's characters, but issues of love, marriage, and death aren't exactly popular topics among the younger generation - and, truth be told, there's an element of sadness in the whole story, especially the ending.  Yet Corpse Bride is an animated film, and animated films aren't known, as a general rule, for packing in adult crowds at the movie theater.  Despite the absence of any obvious target audience, though, the film garnered many favorable reviews and more than paid for itself at the box office alone.  I don't think there's another filmmaker out there that could do what Tim Burton does and be so extraordinarily successful at it.<br /><br />I'm not sure it will be the very first word, but "unique" should certainly appear somewhere on Burton's future tombstone.  While many a filmmaker never develops a style of his/her own, Burton is all but bursting with style.  I love the Gothic, decidedly odd-shaped inhabitants of this fictional world - and I find it very interesting that he imparts color and life only to the world below, juxtaposing this with the dreary, colorless greys of life among the living.  The wonders of stop-motion animation apparently know no bounds, and it's great to see a famous filmmaker not only continuing in the grand tradition but raising the bar for future efforts of a similar kind.<br /><br />Boy meets girl.  Boy accidentally marries a corpse, etc.  Not your typical story, is it?  Poor shy, clumsy Victor (Johnny Depp); one day, he could probably count the number of women he's spoken to on one hand, then the next day, he's fallen in love with one girl - Victoria (Emily Watson), the girl his parents arranged for him to marry - and found himself betrothed to another, one who happens to be quite dead.  Really, though, I thought everyone knew better than to place a wedding ring on any inanimate object - that's just asking for trouble.  Victor does it while he's practicing his wedding vows, never realizing that he is speaking to and placing the ring on the finger of a corpse bride rather than a dead branch.  Poor Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), who was murdered right before her own wedding, has waited years for her true love to come and rescue her from her final resting place in the woods.  Suddenly finding her dream come true, she pops up and immediately absconds with her new "husband" to her own home in the lower world.  Naturally, Victor is more than anxious to leave the company of the lively but obviously very dead inhabitants of Emily's world and return to the world above - and to Victoria.  The viewer is necessarily torn by everything that happens from here on out.  On the one hand, there's sweet Victoria yearning for Victor to return and marry her; on the other hand, there's Emily, who loves Victor and truly deserves to be happy after her truly sad travails before death.  It's a harder choice than you might think, especially since Emily is - dare I say it - pretty hot for a corpse.<br /><br />Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is, to me, a rather sad movie.  It will make you laugh, but it won't leave you laughing.  In any lovers' triangle, one of the three parties necessarily ends up the loser, and you will find no exception to this rule here.  The story plays out quite well indeed, but there's no getting away from the sense of melancholy inherent in the ending.  The only issue I have with this rather remarkably impressive film, though, is its running time.  Not counting the credits, you're looking at about 71 minutes - and it felt even shorter than that.  I would gladly have spent much more time in this literally jaw-dropping (watch for it), surreal, visually incredible world of Burton's imagination.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>A marital alliance between a classless family of wealth and a wealthless family of class is thwarted when young Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) flees his wedding rehearsal.  Practicing his vows in a cemetery, he inadvertently places the wedding ring on the finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) and is whisked away to be her lawfully wedded (according to the laws of the afterlife) husband.<br /><br />This is a visually arresting and touching tale from Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.  In their conception, the world of the living is rather dreary and gloomy while the afterlife is full of color, song, and dance.  The Bride herself is a figure of sympathy rather than horror, having lost her own chance for wedded bliss because of her murder on her wedding night.  Since then, all she has wanted is a true love with whom to spend her "life."  Victor is torn-he truly loves the woman to whom he is betrothed (Emily Watson) but also feels great sympathy and growing affection for the Bride.  The way this melancholy triangle plays out is charming, as is the manner in which the filmmakers constantly subvert the notion that the dead must be frightening.  It provides a valuable object lesson for young audiences that our differences need not make us hate and fear each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>In the murkiest night the darkness wraps its shadowy blanket over all that is exposed.  Such a night is a fitting moment for the glum tale of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, which has its roots in Russian-Jewish folklore.  The actual tale called The Finger received a loose adaptation by the three screenwriters John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson, as they made some changes while preserving the strongest themes of the 19th century folktale.  Yet, the screenwriters delicately maintain the ominous atmosphere, which the two directors magically brought to life through groundbreaking stop-motion photography using, for the first time ever, a digital camera.  Despite the story's morose and macabre content, it is an event for young and old, as it allows the audience to experience a dark, yet wonderfully poignant tale of love.<br /><br />The audience finds Corpse Bride situated in a time when rigid Victorian morality governs the upper class through strict control of emotions and low tolerance for any kind of overt behavior.  In many aspects, these strict societal rules almost prevent a person to live life, as the only proper thing was to completely suffocate the inner feelings such as love.  Strong Christian values govern the people and if over-stepping the social norms the consequences could be social rejection, which people of high status feared most of all.  However, there is also a double standard emerging in the film, as greed leads people on to seek fortune and status by all means necessary.<br /><br />In the opening scene Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp's voice) draws a live butterfly and then releases it into the open through the window.  Secretively, it shows the Victor values feelings and the moments of blissful joy, as the camera follows the butterfly through a montage displaying people's obsessions in life.  The first thing that comes into view is a number of clocks, all being exactly on time, as a man stands sweeping in unison with time.  It lets the mind ponder the monotony of life that many might suffer when becoming fixated with time.  Next we get to see people chopping the heads of fishes, which presents an interesting analogy to the Victorian time.  Fish is a symbol for life and fertility while here it is being completely decapitated.  In addition, the fishmongers do not seem to enjoy what they are doing, as they mechanically toss fish up in the cutting board, which again supports the notion of meaningless existence.  The opening montage sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is dark, ominous, and almost ill.<br /><br />Swiftly the story hurries along, as the opening montage introduces all the main characters.  Soon the audience learns that there is to be an arranged marriage between the rich fishmonger family Van Dort and the soon-to-be destitute aristocrat family Everglot (family name sounds like a word play with gluttony.)  Victor is extremely nervous to meet his bride to be Victoria (Emily Watson's voice), as both are concerned whether they will love each other.  However, both sets of parents brush the notion of love away, as both families see an opportunity to gain either fortune, or social prestige of a title.<br /><br />When Victor and Victoria meet each other for the first time all thoughts of worry in regards to whether they will love one another disappear, as Cupid's arrows simultaneously burrow itself into their chests.  Yet, the strong societal rules forbid them to express their emotions for each other.  Instead, Victor displays his newly acquired emotions for Victoria by stumbling on the words when rehearsing the wedding ceremony.  His clumsiness becomes paramount to the level that the priest suspends the wedding until Victor can remember the wedding vows.  In despair, Victor stumbles out Everglot's mansion of the repeating, stumbling, and stuttering the vows, until he finally gets them right and places the ring on what looks like a twig.  However, it is the bony remains of a corpse who awakens when Victor places the ring on her finger.  The voice of Helena Bonham Carter presents the corpse bride that Victor married by mistake.  Meanwhile, the malevolently sly Lord Barkis (Richard E. Grant's voice) sees an opportunity to seize Victoria, as his own bride.<br /><br />It is a mesmerizing journey to follow Victor and his predicament of having married a dead woman while also trying to get back to the land of the living.  During Victor's stay in the Underworld an interesting notion emerges that one should cherish the moments of love and warm feelings while alive.  However, the strict moral codes by which the people live prohibits the people from fully discovering the true wonders of life such a love.  The Corpse Bride is not Burton's best, but it is a remarkable tale with an important message that will both entertain and keep the audience contemplating several issues including the importance of love.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AYN3IIUNQCIA.html">A1AYN3IIUNQCIA</a><br/><p>tim burton is one of my fav directors, i have loved his work since nightmare before christmas and once again he delivers with corpse bride. a witty, dark, and very nicley done stop motion film. the film is set in 19th century england were victor van dort and victoria everglot are due to be married though they never before met. see, the van dorts are rich but have no social class. the everglots have social class but are broke. so what do you do to make sure each family gets what they want? marry of there kids and get the stuff they dont have. victor is incredibly nervous and after a horrible wedding rehersal victor heads of to gather himself but in a turn of events he finds himself married to the corpse bride, a blue faced woman who's husband left her. now he has to go through the land of the dead and get back to victoria. a imaginitve, often funny, and visually good film it quickly lights its way in a brisk 77 minutes, just long enought to not wear out its welcome. very excellent, definent for nightmare before christmas fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>If you want to enter a parallel universe between living and dead, then this is your film.  A disappointed young man, in a fault of circumstance, becomes wedded to a living corpse, who draws him in and loves him.  He wonders which way to choose, with many characters and strange interactions with both the living and the dead.  It is believable, funny, and has its own magic.  This is a solid and good film.

The animation was unique, and rather stylized. The characters were captivating, up to a point. Other than that, there wasn't that much more to the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZHH7AK83JB5G.html">A2ZHH7AK83JB5G</a><br/><p>CORPSE BRIDE has a lot to recommend it.  The animation is unique and well done as Tim Burton does a superb job of creating the bleak upstairs world of the living and the colorful much more jolly downstairs of the well - not living.  The storyline actually has some important universal themes which is not surprising when you consider that this is based on an old folk tale.  The movie is often darkly funny and the Danny Elfman music is perfect as always.  While this is probably not appropriate for most kids under ten or so it is great choice for the tween age crowd. I think I might like Burton's other dark tinged animated film THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS a bit better but this is also a very worthy effort.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is a brilliant film but Burton/Elfman/Depp. The animation is astounding, the music is catchy and riveting, and the overall atmosphere is creepy and beautiful. The only problem I had with this was that it was a bit too short: just less than 80 minutes. It could've been a bit better if there were 15 more minutes of film. But anyway, "Corpse Bride" is another dazzling accomplishment by Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Danny Elfman. A definite must-see. A-</p></br></body></html>

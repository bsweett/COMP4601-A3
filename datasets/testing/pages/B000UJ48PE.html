It is a fair blood and guts movie, but it was a little too much been there, done that kind of watch.  Yes there are some cringe worthy moments, but it didn't match the original.  The only real difference between this movie and the first is that the 3 protagonists are women rather than men.  Also the whole revenge type ending was cut very short in this film so it wasn't quite as satisfying.  The thing that made the first film so dark is that you had no idea the guys were being set up, and when they were being dragged into the torture chamber you didn't know what was going to happen.  This one you see everything coming so you really don't have that sense of creepy unknown.  I think this one can wait for the unrated dvd release in 4 months.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FPDWTD9AENVK.html">A2FPDWTD9AENVK</a><br/><p>Another three students that are traveling abroad decide to make a detour to Slovakia for a week of fun and partying, but this group of girls will soon become the next victims of an underground hunting organization that specializes in human torture! Conceptually, HOSTEL: PART 2 was the perfect direction for Eli Roth to take the series, since it fully exposes the inner workings of the Elite Hunting Group by bringing the audience up close and personal with two of its members. While this portion of the film is pulled off to some degree, the half involving the girls and their struggle to survive falls completely flat. Unlike the guys in the original, Lauren German and Bijou Phillips are emotionally distant from their roles, and their acting is far more apparent. It feels every bit like a rushed production that falls back on repetitive storytelling techniques with less interesting characters. Even the worn and washed out appearance looks like it was shot on cut-rate film stock. The biggest disappointments come as the plainly obvious twists in the end that are repeatedly alluded to throughout the entire picture. With HOSTEL: PART 2, it seems as though Roth was forced to sequelize against his will, and it shows. One can only hope that the series ends here before the idea is beaten to a pulp like in the SAW franchise.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Stupid fun, not as bad as some of the reviews have made it out to be.

Forget the misunderstood variety, like Frankenstein's monster, forget the Atomic bomb causing bugs to grow to enormous size and forget the relentless slashing madmen, like Michael Myers! Today, new horror fans have a new terror, it's the rich self absorbed A-Hole who is bored with his life and wants to torture and kill innocent people....why?... because he can!<br /><br />Hostel II has been labeled one of the goriest films ever made, but it's really a self parody that is pretty entertaining. Oh there is some gore for sure, but nothing like I imagined there would be. I probably would hate both of these 'Hostel' films, but between all the nasty stuff there is a keen sense of wit that flows through both films.<br /><br />The subject matter alone in a shocking setting and there in always tension in the air because you don't know when something really messed up in about to happen. I don't think we need a part 3 in this franchise, but this one is worth a look......if you like this sort of thing! The unrated DVD has an excellent transfer and some interesting extras. It also sports one of the most shocking(and funny) endings I've ever seen!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>When you have seen the extras in the original, hostel 2 has less impact.<br />Sure the tale continues, and the movie was 'nt that bad....but all this<br />graphic horror has no ceiling...im afraid that we shall see more and more<br />of these types of movies with people getting murdered in different ways.<br />I dont want to watch rich people get their ways anymore...<br />Was good for a while, but now there is a avalance of these types of movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W3HLHIA9UP4D.html">A2W3HLHIA9UP4D</a><br/><p>To begin with, I had mixed feelings about the first Hostel film. That film had its moments, but overall, I wasn't so sure that it was all that great. So I really didn't know how well I would receive this sequel. And overall, I  have lukewarm feelings about this one as well. The movie picks up exactly where the last one left off, and the first minutes of the film are good, but after that, the basic story is really the same as the first movie, except this one involves 3 females, rather than males. Three American girls who are studying abroad, are persuaded by a newly acquainted girl to go on a spa vacation in Slovakia. And though there is a little more back story about this "torture club", and how it works and who runs it, there's still not many new twists from that of the first Hostel. Like I said, the first few minutes of the film, in which Jay Hernandez reprises his role as the only survivor of the first film, are quite good. But after that sequence ends, the film returns to a slow pace, and really nothing much happens until the last half of the movie. I think that this film lacks some of the suspense and mystery that the first Hostel had, simply because the viewer knows what's going on. In the first film, the audience wasn't sure what was happening, who the bad guys were, or why they were torturing innocent people. Now, with all these questions pretty much being answered, the viewer mostly knows what's gonna happen. Yes, there are a few little twists, one of which I don't fully buy in to. I won't spoil it for the ones that haven't seen the film, but there is an almost complete "role reversal' between two characters, which I thought was way too quick, and it seems too contrived in an attempt to be clever. The ending of the film would have been good, if not for the very stupid "soccer" game that breaks out between the kids at the last minute! And speaking of kids, I have to tip my hat to this film for at least not holding back. Yes, there is a death of a child shown in this film, and I have to give credit to any film that has the balls to do something like that. As far as other death scenes and the blood/gore content, its pretty good. There's an excellent (if who can use this word to describe things like this!) and a quite realistic castration scene which I thought was pretty graphic. However, I feel there was less torture in this film than the first Hostel, and the killings came to quick most of the time. All in all, I think this film isn't as good as the first one. It pretty much uses the same blueprint as the first film, where it doesn't start getting really good until the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. Only this time, you already know what's going on. For this reason, I don't feel this sequel is as good as the first film. However, as a stand alone movie, its still pretty good. But I wouldn't buy it brand new unless its got a cheap price tag to go along with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>The most obvious difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of three fellows facing off against the Slovakian "hunting club," we now have three gals:  the wealthy Beth (Lauren German), the socially stunted Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and slutty Whitney (Bijou Phillips, or as I like to call her, The Forehead).<br /><br />Hostel wasn't just a sweaty-palmed gore-fest with an aura of believability to its sadism.  It was also a rather clever (if not heavy-handed) jab at the whole idea of exploitation.  Three backpackers roll like over-fed sows in the cultural trough of an ethically lax and economically crippled Europe, getting wasted and trying to score hot foreign chicks.  When that fails, they buy their hot foreign chicks at the Red Light District.  Irony of ironies, they find out that their flesh is also for sale.<br /><br />That sort of grim self-reflection is missing in the sequel, which has less to do with courage, redemption, and missing limbs than it does with backstory.  Most of this installment explains the workings of The Organization, giving the audience a closer look at the men (and women) who pay for the right to kill, and the steps (fiduciary as well as mental) that they must go through to get that priveledge.  It's an interesting take on an interesting idea, but it collapses as soon as the movie realizes that very few people want to actually sympathize with people who have this much blood on the brain.<br /><br />Speaking of which.  Even gore-hungry viewers who couldn't care less about ironic meanings and subtle symbols will not be sated by this go-around, either.  Forget suspense, tension, or creative carnage.  With the exception of one obscenely graphic moment that will make every man in the theater cross his legs and cringe, this installment falls far short of its big brother in the blood and guts department.<br /><br />Perhaps Roth was playing to the minds and the pockets that made the first "Hostel" such a success, relying on his already-established mythos to provide the token eeriness and appeal.  In some ways, this is admirable -- two rich American businessmen get a good look at their own hearts when they are offered the chance to rip out someone else's.  (As one of them, actor Richard Burgi plays the moment with perfectly precise and horrific grace (even if, for most of the movie, I kept picturing him in his role as the "breathtaking" doctor from Seinfeld.)  In other ways, it's repetitive and boring (soooooo many chase scenes).<br /><br />What consolations the movie does offer are far too fine and fleeting, especially for a film that has such a meaty reputation to live up to.  Most of the expected elements are here -- ultra dark comedy, the Bubblegum Kids, gratuitous nudity, people screaming -- but the movie is missing perhaps the most important element of all: guts.<br /><br />In every definition of the word.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>I'm gonna go out on a limb here and disagree with some of the other viewers on this movie. This is an opinion of course, but there was nothing impressive about the first Hostel. It was balls to the wall blood and gore. It was filled with so much back to back disgusting images that made you cringe, but it lacked any real storyline or substance. It was like lukewarm water. I think the second installment has more of a storyline. Of course, it's predictable because we have seen this the first time around. I think they wanted to show you more about the organization. They wanted to show you that these were regular everyday people with families and normal jobs. On the other side, they also have a thirst for blood, a need to commit murder, and it's something that they are willing to pay very well to do. I found it amazing at how they were auctioning off the right to slaughter human beings like they were bidding on some concert tickets on Ebay. In my own opinion, I think the torture scenes were done with more finesse this time around (I don't know if people will quite get what I mean by that). Personally, I thought the scene with the naked woman slicing away at this innocent girl who's strung up like a chicken while bathing in her blood was meant to be sick, yet sensual, and somewhat erotic. I liked it! I also loved it when Bijou Phillips took the saw to the skull...beautiful! I also liked the ending where the hunted became the hunter, and ultimately turned the tables on this sick individual. That just goes to show money talks no matter what. Let's not forget the casteration scene...OMG CLASSIC! I know there isn't a woman alive that hasn't wanted to do that to an @ssh)le or two in their day. BRAVO! That part was..SIMPLY BRILLIANT! Lauren German has made a new fan out of me just based on that one scene alone. Not to mention, that made it worth the price of admission. I think ultimately what makes this movie work is the fact that it has so much more going for it than the first Hostel. Then again, I guess it just a matter of taste, and the first film left a bad taste in my mouth. Needless to say that since I was so overjoyed about the casteration scene my husband thinks I need help...I'm starting to agree.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>When the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a> was released, I was surprised at the manner in which Eli Roth (with a little help from his pal Quentin Tarantino) upended the horror template with a political allegory. In the original, all the victims were male, putzes, and essentially unlikable. You had to almost force yourself to root for Paxton even though you thought he was a first class A-hole. Add the relatively spooky plot and you had a better than average scare flick. Naturally, Hostel's success all but mandated a sequel.<br /><br />And just as naturally, Hostel II blows chunks of body parts. Having used up all the original ideas in version one, Roth resorts to cliches for version two. The all-female victims are a central-casting clutch of American Students studying art abroad. You have the uber-nerd, uber-beyocth and uber-rich all lured to the infamous factory, where one by one, they get chased, trapped and captured for their trips to the chamber of horrors. The attempt at altering the obvious is done by giving us a glimpse at the manner of attracting clients to the factory, which is given a semi-funny montage. You also get to meet the brains behind the "Elite Hunting" organization, which removes some of the suspense...he's just another wealthy European aristocrat.<br /><br />Eventually the three girls are brought in for their torture-kills. While "Hostel 2" does up the gore from volume one, the shock value is wasted. It's just mindless killing for the sake of titillation (although the too-short power cord was good for a nervous release chuckle), and Roth seemed more interested in seeing how many taboos he could cram into 90 minutes. Kill a kid? Check. Rape? Check. Cannibalism? Check. Gross-outs involving animals? Check check and triple check. It all adds up to a mind-numbing montage of excess without substance.<br /><br />About the only place where "Hostel 2" outdoes its predecessor is the final twist. When it's time for the obligatory final victim to escape, the manner in which she does so did manage to throw me. It was the only thing about this movie that was unexpected, saving it from a single star rating. But given the generally weak reception this received at the Box Office (and the general slippage in the 'torture-porn' genre box-office all around - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4UH0I">Captivity</a> anyone?), my guess is we'll all be spared the indignity of Hostel 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Hostel II is a decent horror flick, but can't quite hold up to its predecessor, the first Hostel movie.  In Hostel we followed male college students, in Hostel II we follow some female students who are led astray by female model, promising them the vacation of their lives.  After a strange run in on a train, they are invited to a big party where one of their numbers immediately goes missing.  Searching for their missing companion, the rest fall into terrible peril at the hands of the men who have paid to kill them in any way they wish to do.<br /><br />I think what makes Hostel II weak is the fact that they chose to delve into the personalities and identities of the men (and women) who are the clients, the ones who pay to do the killing.  It seemed more sinister when the clients were left as a mystery.  Hostel II showed their weaknesses and not the nature of them that leads them to sign up for something so sinister as a trouble free murder.  The plot is much thinner than in the first movie.<br /><br />The ending to Hostel II is its strong point, but I can't give away too much of that.  Suffice to say it has a good feeling, though again it doesn't compare to the ending of the first Hostel movie.  Overall, I would rate the first Hostel as a purchase and Hostel II as a rental, if you're interested.  There is some gore and a few tense scenes, but it seemed more "forced" than the first movie.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>I don't know how else to say this, but Hostel II was even worse than the first.

Hostel: Part II takes the promising set up of his first film and just runs it into the ground with predictability and inaneness.  The film picks up with survivor Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and what he's been up to since the events of the first film, and eventually leads to a trio of girls (Lauren German, Heather Matazarro, and Bijou Philips) that run afoul of the same crew of sadists from the first film.  This time around however, Roth shows us the inside of the organization that preys upon people and uses them as torture victims (one of which, played with excellent creepiness by veteran TV actor Richard Burgi), and this is where Hostel II fails the most.  Roth makes a shallow attempt to get into their heads and ultimately fails, and fails even more so as we get to know the three female leads.  We don't care one bit for the characters or what happens to them, where as at least we did a little bit the first time around when Paxton and his friends ran into trouble.  It is also worth noting that the gore effects are especially grisly and this will be the only reason to check out the Unrated version of the film (if you saw the film in theaters, you were probably wondering just what couldn't make it into the R-rated cut).  Eli Roth has so much potential in becoming one of the next, best directors of the horror genre, but his talent gets wasted here, and hopefully he'll realize that it's time to go a different approach than the new age exploitation route.  You're going to check it out regardless, but don't say I didn't tell you that you're time wasn't better off being used somewhere else.</p></br><a href="../users/A20568D9GRC08W.html">A20568D9GRC08W</a><br/><p>I have never seen such a disturbing pile of donkey crap in my life.

I will have to disagree.  Hostel 2 has a similar scenario, with 3 college age girls (instead of 2 boys) spending some time in Europe, partying and such, getting a bit too close to the wrong people, and ending up in the torture scene.  However, that is only part of the story this time.  There is a whole another tale that is told, and that is the background about the people and organization that do the torturing.  The three girls are not the only main characters in Hostel 2, but we also follow 2 guys who get themselves involved with the dirty side of things.<br /><br />Overall, Hostel II loses the creepy horror appeal the first Hostel had.  Since we get to know a little more about the organization, that feeling of suspense and the unknown is now gone.  The only thing left to see are new and inventive scenes of torture, which don't get much more inventive than the few shown here.  Although the scenes of torture were even pushed further this time, I felt like it was more for show than for horror.  It felt like less time was spent in the factory this time too, again loosing some of that dark, suspense feeling that the first Hostel built up on.<br /><br />One surprise was the beginning of the film, which actually follows up directly after the ending of the first Hostel, with Jay Hernandez reprising his role for the first 5 minutes.  After that, the new story gets rolling, though mostly focusing on the three girls and their journey around Europe.  It takes some time for the real horror to begin, and in the meantime the story gets a bit slow.  The real interest was following the two men.  Though it takes away form the horror, we get to see that these are just ordinary men who live out natural lives with families.  Both are friends, and one always semed far more anxious than the other to go through with the torturing to come.  When they finally get to the scenes of torture, its very interesting how each guy handles there situation.  I found it to be an interesting viewpoint on how different and erratic human behavior can turn in extremely hightened situations.<br /><br />Overall, this is a satisfying sequal.  Though not nearly as creepy as the first Hostel, the pleasure here is actually some light shed on the mystery and a viewpoint from a variety of angles.  I wouldn't expect to watch this for pure entertainment, so with that said, there is a little more to get out of it.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 4<br />Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>this movie was simple horror movie to me! the plot was easy to recongnize and easy to figure out! if you have already seen the first hostel.......this one really wouldn't amaze you, except the(ending)!</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>The first Hostel had some mystery to it, until the last half hour, you were wondering what exactly was going on. Once you realize what this place was all about, then the terror sets in. For those who have travelled outside the US as much as I have, you know this movie has believability. Hostel II has no such mystery, after you have seen part one, you know what the Hunter's Club is all about. So with no mystery, where can you go? Deeper into the organization of course. Instead of three men, this time it is three women who are the hunted victims. To me, this just makes the film more interesting. Also, we discover the fate of our 'hero' in part one. His head is on display in a secret closet.<br /><br />As soon as you see the European woman make her appearance and ask "Did someone lose this iPod?", you figure she's in on it, when she takes the three Americans to the Hostel, there is no question. In this movie we now see what the creepy dude behind the counter does with those passports. He scans them and sends photos out to Hunting Club members, where they bid on them like a human eBay.<br /><br />My favorite scene is the killer who fancies herself to be Elizabeth Bathory, who kills the first American victim. The scene was as erotic as it was terrifying.<br /><br />In this movie we also follow the tracks of two American businessmen who travel to Slovakia for the kill. One is a gung-ho, cocaine snorting, big shot who is all for it, the other is a meek, nerdy guy who doesn't seem to be into it. But the tables turn and true colors show when the men are alone with their victims. Cokehead is all into it before he accidently cuts the head of the hot blond with a circular saw. He then realizes that he wants no part of this and attempts to leave. He is very nicely torn apart by killer dogs in the elevator. The nerd turns out to be the real psycho. He wants to kill someone because he cannot kill his wife. Unfortunately he is also incredibly stupid. The tables turn once again as the rich girl is now in control and nerd boy gets to have his penis cut off with a pair of scissors and watches it being eaten by a dog.<br /><br />Eurogirl gets hers in the end Marie Antoinette style when the Little Rascals from Hell set her up for rich girl's revenge.<br /><br />Like I said there is no mystery here, but for those who enjoyed the first movie, you will enjoy this one on a different label because you see who is in charge of the slaughter house and just how many people are invilved.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Hostal is one of these gore films who start with a promise and stranded in the middle of nowhere.

The problem is that while it's enjoyable (assuming you like that sort of thing), this is a movie that could have been so very, very much more than it was.<br /><br />After a quick, and morbidly amusing, stop in to see Paxton (Jay Hernandez), the sole survivor of the first film, we immediately get back to teenagers in peril. This time it's a trio of American girls, Beth (A Walk to Remember's Lauren German), Whitney (Bijou Phillips, recently of Havoc), and Lorna (Welcome to the Dollhouse's Heather Matarazzo). You know what's coming. An alternating storyline also focuses on Todd (Richard Burgi), who buys one of the girls as a present for his friend Stuart (Roger Bart; both guys normally do time on Desperate Housewives). And that's where the germs of brilliance that could have grown into a full-blown virus lie in this movie-- the idea of taking the same scenario from the original and turning it on its head, giving us the dirt from the perspective of the killers. And we do get some of that, but it's not the focus of the film. That would have been genius.<br /><br />The strongest point of the movie is that Roth dropped the softcore angle and went for the straight gore-- which has the effect, of course, of heightening the ugliness of scenes where sexuality does play a role. The greatest of these is truly brilliant, and displaces the infamous leg-shaving scene in Cabin Fever as the best single scene Roth has yet committed to film; you'll know it when you get to it, and it would be worth the price of admission alone. It is a profoundly discomfiting piece of filmmaking, and shows that Roth, when he brings his A game, is truly capable of being on the level of the guys he idolizes (another one of whom turns up for a brief cameo in this movie; I was floored, but no one else in the audience recognized him. Don't look at the cast list before you go, and see if you catch the cameo before the end credits).<br /><br />All that said, the movie is rife with inconsistencies and plot holes, but that may be by design; from the opening scene, it's obvious that Roth intended this movie as a rather vicious parody of the horror film sequel formula; if you can look at the odd lapses as satire-- and Roth's own body of work, which is usually tight as a drum, lends credence to such an interpretation-- they're forgivable. The movie also contains a surprising amount of grim humor; it's a rare thing when an otherwise straight horror film has the audience walking out of the theater laughing hysterically. If the original Hostel was Roth's take on Takashi Miike's Visitor Q, this one is Ichi the Killer. with a dose of Flower of Flesh and Blood thrown in for good measure. Roth continues his one-man quest to drag Hollywood into the same space Asian horror filmmakers have been inhabiting since the late eighties, and he's turned in a movie in service of that goal that, while not living up to its potential, remains the most fun I've had seeing a horror film on the big screen in a whole lot of years. *** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>I don't know which is worse. Wanting to see this because I thought Hostel really touched on some ideas which had rich subplots to them, which could be carried on into other films of this genre perhaps, or wondering if Eli Roth, as self centered and ego driven as he is, was hoping that perhaps he would find a bit of charisma, chemistry, cohesion, character or hmmm, I don't know, perhaps something tangible in all of this, and we are left with nothing but a purposeless redundant look at a really horrific script with dry humor that bordered on revolting and cliched nuances that deeply moved me to actually think about turning it off, which I have never done since walking out of Spaced Invaders. I didn't care one iota about the girls in the movie, in fact I was hoping they would be killed.<br /><br />Eli Roth said this in an interview: "Yeah man, I'm f***ing psyched. I honestly think that no matter what other movie comes out this summer -- no matter what their budget is -- nothing will even come close to the kind of ending we have in Hostel 2. I think it's one of the most shocking endings people have ever seen in a mainstream horror film. I think this is the movie where people are going to come out of it going, 'I can't even believe someone just did that."<br /><br />I can't believe it was so bad. The ending was juvenile, pompous and actually funny. If you are into gore, lots of it, (well at least in one scene which personally I turned from the screen which was a first in my movie loving life), and like movies with no depth and equally no brain, then I can see why this would be right up your alley. Eli has talent and this was no shining example of what his potential is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Short and to the point, Hostel II is creepy.  Those who have seen the first movie know the basic plot: Gullible kids, mostly Americans, allow themselves to be tricked into vulnerable situations where they are kidnapped.  Soon thereafter a rich person pays to torture and kill the helpless kid.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a> turned heads for its shock factor, with realistic gore, torture, and close ups of some really brazen death scenes.  Eli Roth provides it all for the sake of pure horror.  There are no ambiguities or false pretenses; people are going to be graphically tortured and murdered.  If you don't like it, don't watch.  Hostel II is no different in this respect; however, it is different in the build up.<br /><br />Picking up where the first one left off, a few bits of unfinished business take place.  Whereas the first movie didn't really suck me in, or make me like the characters at all, a better job was done this time to create viewer empathy (except for Heather Matarazzo, who I hate as an actress).  Apathy, or possibly ambivalence, ruled the initial movie, but genuine terror oozes out of this session of tensely persuasive torture porn, especially during a depraved bathroom scene with a scythe that provides enough blood to make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416524304">Carrie</a> jealous.<br /><br />With a subtle, contemporary tribute to the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430451513">The Most Dangerous Game</a>, it's a sickeningly sadistic look at morality, or the lack thereof in our culture.  If not for the somewhat campy ending, there would have been a sustained uneasiness from beginning to end, and it would be a five-star horror flick.</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>I saw the first movie and it was very terrifying. I was hoping to get the same effect from the second one and I was very disappointed. The writer was tied too much up into the stories of both parties, the victim and the buyer. I did watch the deleted scenes and there the director stated that he cut them because "it made the pace slow". Sorry, it didn't slow the pace, it explained the "dragging on of the story" that he was trying to accomplish. I don't want to make this a whine fest, but I also have some other complaints about the sequel. I don't have a problem with nudity. In fact I enjoy seeing nudity because it makes the characters more real, but the nudity should be equal between both sexes. In the deleted scenes the director stated that his "female hostel fans" protested to so much female nudity in the orginal. Yes, I do agree with them with this one. What should have happened is the director would have put in more male nudity. In the opening scene there is a male nude model for the art students. This was shown for about 2 seconds then the teachers head was put over the pelvic area of the models when she is walking. Then the director cut the scene of what the artist had painted. How lame is that? It most certainly looked like the director failed at what he was trying to do and "equalized" nothing. At least in the first movie there was more shots of men without shirts than this one. What I did like about the movie is that there were some "imaginative" ways that the "victims" were killed. There were also some very good twists in the story. I do recommend this movie to the "avid Hostel fans" but hopefully in the next one the director doesn't get "tied up in quickening the pace", make some of the "story" victims both male and female and leave out the "stories of the buyers".</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I liked the first "Hostel" movie. It was gratuitous, to be sure, but it also had a political subtext to it, where the young men who go off to Europe in order to exploit the culture end up being the ones exploited.<br /><br />Although "Hostel part II" picks up right where the last one left off, any political subtext is gone from this film, and it really plays more like another sequel in the "Saw" franchise, where gory stunts take the place of real suspense. Even the characters seem to be borrowed from better films ... Heather Matarazzo basically plays a grown up version of the tragic outcast she played in the groundbreaking "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and Bijou Phillips plays the same cautionary party girl she played in Larry Clark's excellent "Bully". The whole thing just feels really redundant.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Romero's Dawn of the Dead symbolized American's consumerism turning us into zombies and here Roth uses consumerism and our e bay addicted society to turn us into monsters.  The cool part about George A. Romero's great classic is that it's poking fun at our society and were not actually going to turn into zombies.  Hostel Part II goes right for the jugular, or some other private area in the most brutal and realistic castration scene since Cannibal Holocaust.  The film asks the question could this really happen?  In the age of the internet where everything is available at our fingertips and perhaps what shocks you today you'll be far to desensitized to be effected by in time.  Basically Hostel II is a brutal horror film wrapped in that same message a classic like Dawn of the Dead had without using satire or subtly it reflects the ugly side of mankind where as the Wu Tang Clan said C.R.E.A.M (cash rules everything around me).<br />As I said the film is far superior to the original and takes off literally where the first one left off.  This time we have three female college students, who are led astray by another girl they meet and end up at a spa in Slovakia.  As soon as they arrive at the Hostel the online bidding begins all over the globe to see who gets each girl.  There are twists and turns and it is not your typical torture porn.  There is a plot, we have effective character development; meaning we actually like some of the girls and care if something happens, and there are actually no kills for the first forty minutes.  The villains in this movie look like me and you.  As they make there descent down the elevator to do their horrible deeds they act as if they are gladiators and it angers us because gladiators did battle in an arena and didn't kill someone that was tied up.<br />A lot of criticism for this film will come for the simple fact that it's a new movie and doesn't have the benefit of other films now considered classics that were probably hated upon in their initial release as well.<br />The mere hatred for the film reflects America's hypocrisies as well that people are so angry about entertainment yet if you turned on the news it's far worse then Hostel I or II combined; are the same people writing letters and participating in sit ins?<br />The dvd quality was great and rivaled some Hd dvds I've seen and the soundtrack was equally amazing I had to keep my receiver about 6-8 decibles lower than usual for the same effect.<br />I wasn't a big fan of Hostel I although I didn't hate it and if you read any of my lists to see my tastes I'm really not into the goriest horror.  A lot of my favorites include Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Kwaidan, Nosferatu (1922), The Exorcist, Wolfen, The Shining, Misery, Don't Look Now, Night of The Hunter, Halloween, Fall of the House of Usher (epstein), To name serveral, to give you an idea of my likes.<br />I don't think we live in a dreadful society with no hope, however this is a horror film and does reflect mans ugly side and if you look at the news we do have an ugly side.  Hostel II is one of the best horror films in 2007 and deserves a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>"Hostel Part 2" picks up the thread where the original left off. After this effective opening chapter, director Eli Roth starts telling the horrifying tales again, about three American college students in Slovakia. For the sequel Roth changes the gender of the students to female (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo and Bijou Phillips) and also includes the sub-plots of "buyers" or sadistic tormentors played by Roger Bart and Richard Burgi.<br /><br />Not much can be said about the thin plot originally inspired by urban legends. "Hostel Part 2" like its predecessor takes it granted that legends are true. As a consequence all we have to do is to wait for the tortures to begin, and end. The sequel provides the gruesome tortures and slow deaths and is full of blood and screams. The extremely graphic film, however, is hardly called scary because it has no nuance or subtlety suggesting the horrors that are to arrive.<br /><br />In fact the film does not attempt to hide the fact that terrible fates await the characters. There is no sense of suspense; what we don't know is the way how these unsuspecting students are tortured. But maybe two "Hostel" films are supposed to be like that. Roth is quite good at making the bloody torture scenes and the dark interior sets are impressive. The photography showing the countryside is also very good, beautiful and creepy at the same time.<br /><br />There is another thing Eli Roth is good at and that is the casting. The main cast is very good (and they are all talented), but here I'm talking about the cameos. Ruggero Deodato, director of "Cannibal Holocaust" briefly appears, doing something I shouldn't mention. Milan Knazko (who was really Minister for Culture of the Slovak Republic) appears as "Sacha." To watch cameos and references to other films would be pretty amusing to me because they are virtually the list of the people Roth idolizes. Was there Quentin Tarantino? Yes, watch the TV closely.<br /><br />However, I couldn't like the film very much despite (or because of) these "merits." From at certain point "Hostel Part 2" starts being too self-conscious. Should we take seriously the middle-aged lady taking a shower of blood, apparent reference to Elizabeth B&aacute;thory? Should we laugh when Roger Bart's character refers to one Disney animation character he played? The third act of the film almost becomes slapstick with gores.<br /><br />"Hostel Part 2" with the structure that has been getting more and more repetitious since the original has surprisingly less scares than you expect, being emotionally detached from the viewers, almost cynical in its tone in describing the characters (good or bad, killing or killed) and their behaviors. The film is content with doing what it does, often disregarding the audiences who want to be scared or (if I may use the word) entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I went to go see "Hostel: Part II" in the theater because I was interested in seeing what it would be like to watch one of these torture/horror films in a situation where you cannot push the pause or stop button on your remote.  I had only seen "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHRVP6">Hostel</a>," "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTVU2">Wolf Creek</a>," and other examples of this particularly grizzly little splatter flick genre at home and I do not think the experience is ever as intense.  The only horror films I have seen in theaters in recent years have been the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a>" trilogy, and as bloody and gory as those get they are really not the same genre as what you have with this film.  However, it turns out my little experiment was doomed to failure because Eli Roth's sequel is certainly not "worse" than the original in terms of the scenes of torture and killing, which should be a major disappointment to fans of the first because there is nothing here to rival it.<br /><br />This perception is colored somewhat by the fact that in addition to things being more gruesome in the original there was the underlying question of what the hell was going on that added to the horror.  That element is removed in the sequel because we know immediately when the "recruiter" for the hostel shows up to lure the victims to their respective fates.  This time instead of three guys it is three gals: Beth (Lauren German, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018D42W">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>") is the good girl, Whiteny (Bijou Phillips, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBOUUE">Havoc</a>") is the bad girl, and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767827740">Welcome to the Dollhouse</a>" is the weird girl.  They start off in Rome but quickly make their way to Slovakia.  Of course the second time around we know what is going on, so this time Roth shows us the other half of the story, with rich people bidding on the girls to win the right to the kill and laying out the key elements of the all-important contract that the winners have to sign before they get to have their fun.  The focus is on a pair of Americans, the over excited Todd (Richard Burgi) and his more reticent friend Stuart (Roger Bart).  We also get to meet the man who is running the whole operation.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I have had to rethink what happened in the first one because it now appears clear that Roth is more interested in the twists that the terror, because I now consider that to be the biggest common denominator between the two films.  Again, if you come for the blood and gore, you are probably going to be quite disappointed, because Roth is more interested in surprising you with what is really going on than getting you to consider losing your popcorn.  I caught Roth in a television interview where the talking head asking the questions literally gave away the final scene of the movie, and the writer-director was talking about the political sub-text of this film as having to do with why the rest of the world hates Americans.  After all, the Americans are boring and unimaginative amateurs compared to the Europeans who clearly have developed a taste for these blood baths.  The victims are not required to be much more than victims, somewhat culpable in their own deaths, but that does not strike me as being primarily because they are American girls.<br /><br />I did like the "twist" at the end, because it appeals to both my sense of justice and my love of irony.  However, the set up was not really elegant and the element of complete surprise, so important to the original, ends up getting lost.  I mean, come on, when you get a hold of passports to copy the photos and send them around the world to your potential clients how hard is it to do a quick check to make sure you are not causing yourself problems?  Plus there have to be easier ways to get the girls to the factory.  Then there is the cinematic commonplace of the bad guys talking rather than shooting at the critical moment and how quickly the movie gets to the end credits once the twist is revealed.  Also, it seems to me that the bidding for these victims was rather low, but then clearly I place a higher value on human life than the characters in this film (hard not to).<br /><br />Actually, the scariest thing when I saw this film in the theater were the guys behind me who declared the heroine to be a "bitch" because she would not let her friend go off with some strange guy when she was falling down drunk.  I worry about guys who would think that was the most upsetting part of the movie, especially since buying some six packs or spiking a girl's drink with Rohypnol to get "lucky" happens in the real world even if paying thousands of dollars to torture and kill them for fun is only something that happens in movies and their less than satisfying sequels.  I suppose the urge to turn this into a trilogy will be irresistible, but I will not make the same mistake twice.  Instead I will find a whole bunch of new mistakes to make and will wait to see the next one on DVD, which is how you should see this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Horror sequels usually fail do add anything interesting to the film(s) that came before simply because studios insist on the mere delivering of the same. It is like if they could isolate the things that worked and started reproducing it over and over. That's nothing new with that and any FRIDAY THE 13TH fan (like me) knows about that.<br /><br />But Hostel 2 did a better job than most sequels usually do and it's a pity the film did not perform at the box office as expected... because this film actually very good.<br /><br />After a brief intro starting exactly where the first film ended (where we see what happens with the guy who survived after he comes back home) there we go again to Europe where we meet three new will-be-victims (this time girls) as they fall into the same scheme.<br /><br />Until then, nothing new.<br /><br />But then... the narrative splits and we start to follow a secondary set of characters: the clients who paid for them. That is a very interesting change. And that is just the start of a great horror screenplay with a couple of really genuine well written twists. In products like this film, that level of quality is rare.<br /><br />Now... I found it as violent as the first film. Meaning that the make-up and prosthetics are (as usual) made to shock. All other elements are equally fine.<br /><br />This is one of the best sequels out there.<br />And it is worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>For some reason this movie picks up where the last one leaves off. Then all of a sudden we have all new characters, as if the first movie didn't matter. In the first feature we had a slow build up to the torture scene with plenty of gratuitous nudity. We actually got to know the characters and didn't know exactly what was going to happen. In part 2, we know what is going to happen and who is going to get it and we also know everyone is in on it.<br /><br />Edwige Fenech as the art class teacher was a classic addition. She is infamous for her European school teacher movies. The movie has a twist, but that really doesn't help it. It certainly doesn't nearly live up to the first feature.<br /><br />F-bomb, nudity (Vera Jordanova, Heather Matarazzo,)</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>HOSTEL 2 picks up where the first one left off, w/ the survivor from HOSTEL living a terrified, paranoid existence.

Of course, as in the first film, the set up is half the fun. This time, we even get to see what it's like to be one of the zillionaire clients who pay big bucks to be merciless murderers. We also get a peek into the bidding process that decides which rich sadist will get to live out his / her particular fantasy.

They aboard a train from Italy to Slovokia where they stay for a while at a local hostel that has a unique hot springs spa where it seems like a harmless vacation, it later turns into a nightmare of unrelentless horror when they are kidnapped by criminals that torture and murder people for profit but can they escape the horror of it all?<br /><br />While the original movie was a good if flawed effort into torture horror, i believe this is a very slight improvement over the original movie. Writer-Director Eli Roth and producer Quention Tarantino really delivers a sequel with more thrills and chills plus more gore such as the cringe-inducing castration sequence that is quite realistic, a young boy being shot, saw-blade to the skull etc. and decent acting. There is some darkly humorous moments especially the ending which i can't reveal but has to be seen to believe, legendary Italian horror director Ruggero Deoato (director of "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Jungle Holocaust") makes an amusing cameo appearence as a cannibal doctor.<br /><br />This DVD contains the uncut unrated version with footage not shown in the theatrical cut and has some goodies like three audio commentaries, radio interview with Eli Roth, deleted scenes, Gag Reel, International Televison Special on the film's making, and four featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>I guess you really have to be drawn to the storyline of Hostel, to be at all fascinated with the subject matter, and deal with the "lack of gore", which alot of reviewers are complaining about.  It's a sign of the times, considering how jaded everyone is with all the onslaught of killings and violence in so many movies.  The "Saw" movies seem to be quite popular, they take violence to the extreme, over-do it like they weren't hugged enough by their mothers, and rely on a so-so storyline that's rehash, yet people love it, to each his own.  "Hostel 2" manages to continue the story without being predictable and unleashing more insight about the heart of the story, the murder club and the people involved.  Part 2 is filmed more artsy, the killings more poetic and not as torturous as the shocking first one.  By this time I was more acclamated to the deceiving first steps in capturing the victims, so I wasn't as shocked as I was when viewing the first Hostel.  One thing Eli Roth does extremley well is flip the script because it's hard to surprise me.  Like I was surprised that he killed off the nice n' nerdy girl first, I thought she was going to be the one running all alone in the woods at the end.  Humanity doesn't mean a thing in the Hostel movies, there is no compassion and no heart at all, and that is what makes these films as sick and disturbing as they are.  I do agree however that Mr. Roth would have pushed the gore to the next level, bump it up a notch or two maybe next time around.  I hope they continue the Hostel story for at least 2-3 more, and it has to be under the realm and threshhold of Quintin Tarantino, it can be done no other way.  I hope they can continue with a fresh take and keep it original.  Eli Roth is a master at character development and chooses the right actors with the right energy, so good job for him.  Well made horror movie, the best in horror for these times.</p></br><a href="../users/A6DOCZ10B7JAJ.html">A6DOCZ10B7JAJ</a><br/><p>This is THE most gruesome, terrifying, savage depiction of extreme horror that I have ever seen!!!!!

The fact that this was released mainstream is totally beyond my comprehension.  If you hated the original Hostel, why would you even bother with this one?<br />Okay, I'm sure you know the story.  I won't go into any details of any of the horrendous torture scenes.  Just be prepared.<br />There were other scenes that were totally frightening as well.  Like when one of the girls is being chased through the woods barefoot in her bathrobe.  Or when a girl is chained-up and suspended naked in mid-air, the long blade of a schythe is dragged along her back, not initially breaking the skin.  Just pure fright factor.  Or one of the most jolting non-violent scenes happens early on--pictures and descriptions of the 3 girls are sent to various clients on their blackberries.  Then the auction begins, each girls fate sold to the highest bidder.  [...] Heather Matarazzo(the nerdy schoolgirl from Welcome to the Dollhouse)gives an especially incredible performance.  Bijou Phillips(from Bully)doesn't try to tone down her sex appeal.  Lauren German is also stupendous.<br />This is one brutal movie!

There are several nice surprises, and Roth is a very skilled director who just gets better w/each picture. The consumerism thread will be lost on some, but that's okay. Roth has created a tense, great looking horror film; And while it's not quite as good as part 1, it's def. a worthy follow-up. It takes the premise of part 1 and expands it into other areas; There is one really horrific sequence in here I could have done without(the first torture sequence, literally a bloodbath...), but this sort of stuff just comes with the territory nowadays.

So, it's only natural that a sequel would follow it up, and with the brilliant Eli Roth back at the helm, "Hostel" is back in business just a little over a year later. The difference this time? Instead of three fun loving dudes, we are following three very different ladies around Europe as they study abroad, unaware of the fact that they may never be coming home. The original "Hostel" was effective because it took time to build the characters. About two thirds of that movie were dedicated solely to exposition. Then, when everything went wrong, it really went wrong. I will admit, however, upon my first viewing of "Hostel," I found myself a bit bored, expecting much more carnage than was delivered (not the movie's fault) and wanting a little more action. This is where the second movie ups the ante. "Hostel II," for better or for worse, is a crowd pleaser.<br /><br />In typical Eli Roth fashion, his love for the horror genre oozes through in nearly every scene. Nothing can capture this better than the fact that "Hostel II" is standard, by the books sequel material. The deaths are much more intricate and involved, the story moves much faster and there is far more explanation than before worked into the story. In the process, however, the movie tends to feel at times like a remake of the original, with the first half feeling somewhat stale and predictable. It isn't until the first death scene where we stop slouching and start paying attention. And from there, the movie puts us through a complete headspin. Despite the fact that you can pretty much assume who's going to die and who's going to survive in this movie, it's still engaging when things go down, because they don't happen in ways you would expect. I'd hate to beat around the bush here, but suffice it to say, even if you think you know where this movie is going, you're probably wrong.<br /><br />The trio of girls are quite an odd mix. We have the relatively-unknown Lauren German playing the obvious heroine, with Bijou Phillips playing the stereotypically obnoxious party girl, and the underrated Heather Matarazzo as the mousy nerd of the bunch. Watching these characters onscreen makes one wonder why they would ever be involved with each other, and the actresses themselves ironically fail to shine until their death scenes arrive. One of the best and most intriguing scenes in the movie is one in which we see the clients actually bidding online for their victims. This gives the movie more of a human feel, and makes the torture scenes all the more nauseating, giving you the impression that even the average joe sitting next to you on a bus could possibly have the desire to kill you for sport. Where this movie really differs from the first is that we get to know two of the clients, the timid Stuart, played by Roger Bart, and the arrogant and abrasive Todd played by Richard Burgi. As far as I'm concerned, these two are the most interesting part of the movie, as both actors effectively play their parts, while delivering characters that are flawed, human, and unpredictable. Each character makes decisions at the turn of a dime that you may not have seen coming, but probably should have.<br /><br />Overall, it's hard to find fault with "Hostel II." Despite the critics ripping it apart, it is a fun movie. Nothing was worth the ticket price more than to hear the theater erupt during a scene involving hedge-clippers and two hungry dogs. It may not be the blockbuster, popcorn flick you go for in June, but it's definitely a movie you'll walk away from, talking about for hours. Sure, it suffers from a case of sequelitis, and sure, it ends all too abruptly and on a bizarre note (ala "Cabin Fever") but it's good, it's original, and it's a horror movie. Three things which don't seem to come together much these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>whoo, talk about taking gore to the next level. hostel II is right up there with the first hostel. this one was horribly good. i mean this one took you beyond the torture. it took you to meet the creator, you were introduced to the home of all this, and made you watch a live human auction take place. all that was missing in the first they gave it to you in the second. now instead of the boys, they brought in the girls. shows you that no one is safe. women being more vunerable, are placed in the same situation, but they too can kick azz as well as anybody else when the time arises. hostel II made you look even when you wanted to turn away. some of the killin scenes were very intense. you knew what was coming, but with every passing second the fear grew and grew. it makes you think which is worse...the torture of waiting for the unknown or the torture itself. we all know what's going to happen, but we don't know to who, or when. who will escape, will any of them, and will they bring down this whole horrific ring of torture. three american girls are targeted as the next victims for the infamous torture factory. unknown to them, they have already reserved a seat for death. all they want to do is explore, have fun, be girls. then they meet a model from around the area, she's the bait, and lures them in. one by one they disappear. what fate awaits them? you get a better look at how things work, a more in depth look at the torture, and you are left in awe at the way these people are treated like cattle. no feelings are involved on behalf of the people that are hustling these victims. very cold hearted. the end is a good one. unexpected really, but just shows when on the line of life and death you fight and you do what you have to. kind of makes you think and ask does money really make the world go round. the actors all did very well. the chics were pretty good. one shy, heather matarazzo, good actress. one party girl, bijou phillips, played it well, and the star lauren german, plays beth, the stable one, brings out her character and really tries to fight back. she should really be on the rise. this is why you don't go to places where you don't know what the deal is. nothing better than what you know. pure success in this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FUBUJAIGM87T.html">A3FUBUJAIGM87T</a><br/><p>Devoid of any real horror other than your typical modern day shock value styled horror, Eli Roth and company follow up the dubious success of the original "Hostel" with "Hostel II".  To the credit of Roth and others, they did attempt something different in their sequel.  However, with that being said, the problem remains from the first movie and that simply is that "Hostel II", like the original, simply is not scary at all.  Unfortunately, like the original, "Hostel II" relies upon the audience's shock and other emotions stemming from the extreme violence that is put on film.  "Hostel II" represents blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore with a very uncompelling storyline.  The fact that they did do a pretty good job with the blood and gore in this movie is something that the makers of this movie should be commended for, but the lack of atmosphere and scares are glaring in this so-called horror movie.  Of course, this is part and parcel of where the horror genre is heading these days, and that is a shame.  This new age horror is really a dime a dozen.  Granted, Roth and company go to extremes to put disturbing pieces of violence on film relying on its shock value rather than a compelling storyline.<br /><br />The concept behind the movie, while unique, fails to instill terror in the audience.  Instead, the viewer develops a feeling of disdain for most of the characters in this movie except for maybe Beth to a certain extent--although I did not think she was that good of a protagonist.  Moreover, the movie's incessant reliance on gore, which is basically what the movie is all about, overshadows plot and character development as well as the story itself.  I know I have said this before, but you can have all the blood and gore you want times ten, but if it signifies nothing but blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore, you are not going to produce a good horror movie.  I mean let's face it: there's nothing scary about "Hostel II", simply nothing.  "Hostel II" is really about the dark sickos in this world who are sadistic and take pleasure in the torture of other human beings.  It is scary that there are people like this in the world, e.g. Ted Bundy, Henry Lee Lucas, Pee Wee Gaskins, etc., but the movie, in and of itself, is completely devoid of any sense of imaginative and stylized horror other than the shock and disturbing value it does produce with its graphic depictions of violence.<br /><br />For my money, I just do not think this is enough to create a good horror movie, and it is only further evidence of what Eli Roth is all about as a director.  Actually, I liked the original better than the sequel because it's more entertaining (that is certainly not saying much), but I did not think either was a good horror movie.  In short, these "Hostel" movies and movies like them are nothing more than unimaginative movies about torture and extreme violence designed for shock value and nothing more while completely lacking in story, suspense, style, substance and atmosphere, all of which, at least in my opinion, are essential ingredients to any good horror movie.  With that being said, all of you gorehounds out there, and you know who you are, will probably enjoy this flick as it does contain some serious blood and gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>Horror sequels usually fail do add anything interesting to the film(s) that came before simply because studios insist on the mere delivering of the same. It is like if they could isolate the things that worked and started reproducing it over and over. That's nothing new with that and any FRIDAY THE 13TH fan (like me) knows about that.<br /><br />But Hostel 2 did a better job than most sequels usually do and it's a pity the film did not perform at the box office as expected... because this film actually very good.<br /><br />After a brief intro starting exactly where the first film ended (where we see what happens with the guy who survived after he comes back home) there we go again to Europe where we meet three new will-be-victims (this time girls) as they fall into the same scheme.<br /><br />Until then, nothing new.<br /><br />But then... the narrative splits and we start to follow a secondary set of characters: the clients who paid for them. That is a very interesting change. And that is just the start of a great horror screenplay with a couple of really genuine well written twists. In products like this film, that level of quality is rare.<br /><br />Now... I found it as violent as the first film. Meaning that the make-up and prosthetics are (as usual) made to shock. All other elements are equally fine.<br /><br />This is one of the best sequels out there.<br />And it is worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UOTG037037XY.html">A1UOTG037037XY</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of horror movies and they're not respected in the American film industry either otherwise Heather Matarazzo would have been rewarded with an Oscar for her performance.  I loved the numerous filmmaking commentaries included with this dvd.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Now going into this film I expected to be grossed out and to simply be enraptured by how far Eli Roth could take the gore in this movie to try and surpass the previous installment. Aside from the "Gorno" aspect of this movie, this has a very frightening message to it. This shows how a persons mental psychi is different from how they may express it towards others. I wont say much more as it will give away the whole premise of the movie and that's something I don't want to do as this has a bit more of a story to it compared to the previous film.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) who was the only survivor of the torture of the last film. It shows how he is coping with the trauma of watching his friends be tortured and killed and then himself experiencing such torment. The bosses of the Hostel catch up to Paxton and finally take him out to cancel the risk that he may reveal the sickening secret of the wealthy underworld.<br /><br />This film does have more of a structure to it when compared to the first one. Three girls are backpacking across Europe and they become friends with Axelle (Vera Jordanova) who we learn is affiliated with the boss of the Hostel. Axelle is simply leading these girls into a trap which would eventually end their lives. On another side of the movie we are introduced to two business men who bid on being the men who killed these women. One of them wants to do the killing to fullfill what he feels as a darkness inside him that will make him feared by his peers. The other is a man who is pushed into the act for the same reason to instill a sub-conscious fear within his fellow colleagues.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the Hostel movies and are curious about them, then be warned. This film is extremely graphic with its no holds barred approach to blood and guts. It is a very entertaining film however and something that really makes you think and in a sense wonder if there are actually places like this in the world.<br /><br />A good film that I would really only recommend to those who are familiar with this genre of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>For some reason this movie picks up where the last one leaves off. Then all of a sudden we have all new characters, as if the first movie didn't matter. In the first feature we had a slow build up to the torture scene with plenty of gratuitous nudity. We actually got to know the characters and didn't know exactly what was going to happen. In part 2, we know what is going to happen and who is going to get it and we also know everyone is in on it.<br /><br />Edwige Fenech as the art class teacher was a classic addition. She is infamous for her European school teacher movies. The movie has a twist, but that really doesn't help it. It certainly doesn't nearly live up to the first feature.<br /><br />F-bomb, nudity (Vera Jordanova, Heather Matarazzo,)</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I watched this right after the first Hostel, and my goodness! I was sad to see that the guy who escaped the first Hostel did not last long in this one, and this movie is different because the trio of protagonists in this movie are girls, not guys, so a different technique had to be used to lure them to the Hostel.<br /><br />I almost fell out of my seat when I recognized two actors from 'Desperate Housewives'. This movie is very gory like the first one, though there was also a bit more in-depth examination (showing the Hostel as a business, and the people in charge, etc) I applauded the 'heroine' when she figured out a way to get out of the Hostel alive, that was rather creative on her part. And like the guy from the last Hostel movie, she figured out how to get vengeance on at least one person. I actually liked the plot more than the torture part, because honestly, the torture was SICK. 2.5/5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C0PHJN6AUZT6.html">A1C0PHJN6AUZT6</a><br/><p>I liked this movie almost as much as the first one. The first Hostel left me wondering about this business, how it really works, what kinds of people would pay for this. The sequel shows us the behind the scenes working, from the moment the girls check in, until the newest member is branded. I personaly like all of the girls, except Axelle, obviously. I liked adventuros Whitney, sweet but depressed Lorna, and rich but not at all snobbish, Beth. The movie did make me wonder if Beth was a lesbian, but the fact that it wasn't answered was okay. I did think the kids playing ball at the end was a little too much, but it did make me laugh. If Hostel 3 is released, I'll see it!</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Ya know horror fans...for me, the sad thing about HOSTEL 2 is that it's not as good as part 1, yet part 1 wasn't great neither. So you have a horror film here that doesn't even live up to it's not so great predecessor. Don't get me wrong! These are fun horror films. Lot's of blood, good death sequences an such...but for me there's just something about the Hostel films that leave me unfulfilled. I know what I didn't like about the original. 3/4ths the way through part 1 I was loving it and then it hit a brick wall with a big sign hanging off of it that read "UNREALISTIC" so yes, to me it fell short. Part 2 on the other hand again was pretty good stuff up until the last quarter of the movie unraveled itself, but this time it went beyond unrealistic and began to spiral violently into the "all over the place" catagory. Hopefully I just need to give these 2 films a couple more viewings and maybe the'll grow on me, but...</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>You know how sequels usually suck as compared to the original movie.  Well, with Hostel 2, you not sure if the sequel is as good or better than the first one.  If you've seen Hostel, then you know you're in for more blood and gory scenes in this sequel.<br /><br />This time, we see 3 girls lured to Slovakia by a model to the same hostel that was the last stop for some traveling foreigners.  During this time, there is a pagan festival.  One by one, these girls are lured away from each other and to their respective torture chambers.<br /><br />At the same time, we see 2 American men who are excited about their first kill in this covert killing organization.  Of course, one has second thoughts about it but the other is there to get them both pent up for their one-of-a-kind experience.<br /><br />All I can say is that this movie doesn't lack gore.  The storyline isn't too bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Hostel II continues the story of the underground torture ring where rich businesspeople pay large sums of money in order to kill someone.<br /><br />The film starts out with Paxton (Jay Hernandez) recovering from his wounds inflicted in the first movie.  He is also suffering terrible flashbacks.  Soon, his girlfriend kicks him out of their house.<br /><br />In this installment, three young girls; Beth (Lauren German), Lorna (Heather Matarazzo), and Whitney (Bijou Phillips) decide to take a break from their studies in Italy and go to Slovakia for a vacation.  While on their way, they meet another girl, Axelle (Vera Jordanova).  Axelle convinces the others to change their plans and instead go to a relaxing outdoor spa.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two American businessmen; Todd (Richard Burgi) and Stuart (Roger Bart) have heard about the Elite Hunting Club.  Todd has "bought" his friend Stuart a girl to kill.  Soon, the two guys are flying to the torture chamber.<br /><br />Unknown to the girls, Axelle is working for the Elite Hunting Club, and soon, Beth, Lorna, and Whitney are captured and placed in the chamber.  However, Stuart is having second thoughts about his involvement with Todd.  Will anyone survive this time around?<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie more than the first one.  There is less sex in this one.  Instead, director Eli Roth has focused more on the blood and terror, which he accomplishes perfectly.  There are some truly memorable scenes, such as the scene where Lorna is suspended, nude, above another woman, who systematically cuts and slices her, while bathing in Lorna's blood. But, the ending is the best, and male viewers will most definitely want to cross their legs.<br /><br />I recommend this scary and terror-filled film.  If you liked part one, then you'll enjoy part II much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>Very well done, amazing follow up to Hostel.  Pick's up right where the Hostel left off, ties up some loose ends and pits the viewer in a whole new twisted adventure into the killing floors.  Great series bring on part 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A37OOQQLMMKYR8.html">A37OOQQLMMKYR8</a><br/><p>For me, the biggest problem with Hostel: Part II is the movie is just too clich&eacute;d. From the characters to the concept it suffers from having been there, done that. It's tough sometimes making a sequel. You wanna try and offer something different, but cannot stray too much from the formula and risk losing the fan base. Though I will say is Eli Roth does manage to do more than just rehash the original, granted I just said before it suffers from the, been there, done that, but Roth is able to add a little bit more.<br /><br />The thing about Eli Roth is he is able to develop characters. A lot of people knock him for his characters and say they lack depth. That couldn't be further from the truth. Just because you didn't like them doesn't mean they lacked depth. In both Hostel movies it takes at least 40-minutes before anything really big happens. Everything before that is all about the characters.<br /><br />This time around Roth again sets up the characters and develops them, but the problem here is they are too clich&eacute;d. We have the nerdy girl, the slutty girl and the nice girl with a little bit of an edge. The characters in Hostel: Part II is the typical characters we have seen millions of times before. Due to that it can be tough to really feel for them. Though to Roth's credit they don't come across as fake; they are real people maybe even like someone you know. So due to that you might feel for them a bit when these bad things begin to happen to them.<br /><br />Hostel: Part II also focuses a bit on the people involved with Elite Hunting, from those who run it and the people that pay to do these terrible things to others. That was an interesting concept, but does take away from the mystery of it. So it's sort of that double edged sword. And like the would be victims the characters who pay to do these terrible things are also a bit clich&eacute;d, one guy who's excited, but afterwards can't handle it and the weak guy who suddenly steps up and goes psycho.<br /><br />Eli Roth's script wasn't bad, the characters have depth despite being clich&eacute;d, but something just wasn't fully working. While not a bad script it didn't have the moments the original had. Like I said the characters have depth and you do get to know them a bit, but when all is said and done the clich&eacute; is what hurts. But the script wasn't bad, and it did have its fair share of creative moments.<br /><br />Like the original, Roth takes his time getting into things, but this time around it doesn't work quite as well. The comedy here doesn't work as well and it does hurt the pacing of the movie at times and the nudity is very much toned down this time around. Eli Roth is able to put together some solid scenes, but the pacing does drag at times. The party scene really does start to drag and it seems like it goes on forever. A couple of minutes could have easily been trimmed on that scene.<br /><br />Once the action kicks in Hostel II does pick up. Though it does lack compared to the original, but it still works rather well for the most part. Even in the 2nd half there are slight pacing problems. Hostel: Part II would have greatly benefited from a few minutes being cut out. There isn't that sense of dread and tension the original had. While Hostel II does have it's moments like that it does lack compared to the original. But there are some solid moments with a great feel of dread and looming danger. The scene with one of the characters hung upside down and being sliced was probably my favorite scene, it was sick and twisted and had this great sense of tension. The character is totally helpless and it does add to the tension.<br /><br />The gore level is about the same as the original. In some ways it's gorier, but also has less gore. Despite the reputation of Hostel the torture scenes weren't that bloody. There was gore, but not the way people make it out to be. A lot of the gore comes from shots of mutilated bodies. This time around the torture scenes do feature a lot more gore. I can't help, but think Roth added more for all the people that complained about the first Hostel being gory. It's like he was saying you really wanna see some gore? Well here you go.<br /><br />Lauren German gives a fantastic performance as Beth, she was the nice girl with a bit of an edge, while her character may not be the most original she isn't the little goodie two shoes most heroines are in these kinda movies. The rest of the performances are pretty good as well. Roger Bart does a solid job and Richard Burgi nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Overall Hostel: Part II is a pretty good sequel. While it does suffer from some clich&eacute;s and really doesn't have the dread and tension of the original there are many solid scenes. What they lack in tension, they make up for in gore. The pacing was just a bit off and like I said Hostel II would have greatly benefited from some editing.<br /><br />The highlights of Hostel: Part II are the cameos by 70s cult Icon Edwige Fenech as the Art Class Professor and Ruggero Deodato director of Cannibal Holocaust playing none other than a cannibal. And I must say as I write this review Edwige Fenech is almost 60-years old and is still as beautiful now as she was back in the 70s.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>I have to say I am not the biggest fan of horror and gore films, but Hostel just has that special something that makes you love it so so dearly. Hostel 2 is the exact same premise as the first, but this time it gives you alot more than what you expect. This time you are taken behind the scenes of the opperation its self. You get to see who is involved in the 'hunting' process and who is sick enough to pay top dollar to fulfill their most gruesome of fantasies. Once again Eli Roth pushes the bar with the torturing of 3 young women who get lured into this sick world. Again in a short amount of time he really develops the characters so you actually connect with them. This time you see both sides of the coin, through the eyes of a trouble torturer who is wondering if it's something he really wants to do. There are so many things that you will see that either make you cover your eyes or even stand up and cheer. Hostel pt. 2 is a well done continueation of the origional and it will surley leave an impression on you in a sick and twist way that only Roth and producer Quinten Tarentio can bring you.</p></br></body></html>

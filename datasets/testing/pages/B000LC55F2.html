Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.<br /><br />I recently read "Saving Leonardo" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. The Prestige fits clearly into the Enlightenment setting. There is a rational explanation for everything.<br /><br />The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. There is no clear cut hero or villain here. Both main characters have elements that draw your interest and sympathy and both have character flaws that most would disapprove of.<br /><br />The reality is that the illusionist trade is the backdrop for the movie. Nolan is conveying a message that our senses deceive us, both in the setting with the illusionists and the view that people aren't always what they appear to be either.<br /><br />I personally consider this to be both more realistic than "The Illusionist" and a better made movie. That said, I enjoyed "The Illusionist" more than this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>All act of magic has three moments. Two brilliant magicians face to face, one each another trying to show the world who's the best. Each own has his secrets and this growing rivalry will lead to unsuspected levels of tension and suspense.<br /><br />This formidable movie presents to Christian Bale (Alfred Bordem) (an actor who has gained gradual status) and Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) are the contenders. Scarlet Johanson is a smart device among them and Michael Caine like the smart engineer conform a team hard to improve in this extraordinary and original film who will engage you from start to finish.<br /><br />Because at the end of the projection this portrait is also the magic of cinema.  You and me love to be cheated.  The special effects are just illusion; part of the pledge and the transformation.<br /><br />Watch it carefully!</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>100 years ago, there were two fledgling magicians.  Both Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the plants in an audience who help a magician with his final act.  But one night things turn deadly, leaving Robert a widower and breaking apart the two men.<br /><br />Over the years, they keep tabs on each other and try to hurt each other.  That's how Robert knows when Alfred premiers his most phenomenal trick, the transported man.  In this trick, Alfred moves from one box to another across the stage in one second flat.  Robert becomes obsessed with learning how his rival does the trick, an obsession he takes to unhealthy levels.  Who is the ultimate magician?  Will Robert learn the secret of the transported man?  What lengths will he go to attempting to get the secret?<br /><br />Frankly, that summary does the movie an injustice.  It is more a character study of the two men than anything else.  The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks, yet once I got the characters established in my mind, it was very easy to follow.<br /><br />This isn't my normal light film.  In fact, it is very dark at times.  But the story is so engrossing.  I was lost in the world unsure who to root for to win.  In fact, I gave up trying to predict the outcome, and it's a good thing I did because I never would have guessed how it ended.<br /><br />The acting from every single member of the cast is great.  I can't single anyone out, that's how good it is.<br /><br />And this is definitely a movie to own.  There are so many scenes that appear to mean one thing but really mean something else that you need to watch it again.<br /><br />I am sorry I am just now watching this excellent film.  If you've missed it, go out and see it today.  I can't recommend this film highly enough.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then a few weeks ago on Blu-Ray (which looks super) - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.<br /><br />It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.<br /><br />Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.<br /><br />This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!</p></br><a href="../users/A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L.html">A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L</a><br/><p>Nolan's Prestige, like many of his films, is a dark, somber exploration of human emotions, ambitions and failings. It features many of Nolan's artistic touches, including his trademark out-of-sequence narrative, so those of you who hate this format will be irritated by the progression of this film.<br /><br />The Prestige chronicles the intense rivalry between two ambitious young magicians struggling to make it big in turn of the century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) actually begin as colleauges, both working as magician's assistants on an act engineered by Cutter (Caine). A tragic accident during one of the performances transforms a mutual professional jealousy into a bitter and lifelong feud that will cost each man dearly.<br /><br />Angier and Borden are the embodiment of two diametrically opposed philosophies and it is this collision of ideals that lies at the very heart of the film. Angier is more concerned with showmanship and accolades than with the magic itself, while for Borden the craft is what consumes him, audience be damned. The lengths each will go to in order to achieve their ideal, and simultaneously outshine the other, provides the key to the mystery that ties the whole story together. This film has not one, but two twists to its ending. You might guess the one halfway through, but the second is very cleverly concealed by Noland's deft direction.<br /><br />The film competed against "The Illusionist", which had been released to critical acclaim a few months earlier. Among the two I prefer the The Prestige, which I find is deeper and handled more maturely. Many people disagree, preferring the lighter, more conspicuously 'magical' Illusionist. This is reflected in the ratings here on Amazon as well (The Illusionist averages half a star better).<br /><br />The Prestige is certainly a darker, somewhat less straight-forward film, and while some might resent the sci-fi spin added in the last act, it provides the basis for the moral abyss into which Angier must fall. Both Angier and Borden are developed to a much greater extent than any character in The Illusionist; they simply feel more human. In fact, it is their very humanity, their frailties, that warp their passion into obsession, and finally into hatred and revenge.<br /><br />Featuring Scarlett Johansson as the love interest and David Bowie in a great turn as Nikola Tesla. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region-A / BVHE-Touchstone<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />MPEG-4 AVC BD-50<br />Running time: 2:10:29<br />Movie size: 33,01 GB<br />Disc size: 37,69 GB<br />Average Video Bit Rate: 23.04 Mbps<br />LPCM 5.1 6.9Mbps 24-bit English<br />DD AC3 5.1  640Kbps English / Spanish / French<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Spanish / French<br /><br />#The Director's Notebook: The Cinematic Sleight of Hand of Christopher Nolan<br />#Conjuring the Past<br />#The Visual Maze<br />#Metaphors of Deception<br />#Tesla: The Man Who Invented the Twentieth Century<br />#Resonances<br />#The Art of the Prestige</p></br><a href="../users/A4F8CJ1L4348V.html">A4F8CJ1L4348V</a><br/><p>Since this movie was released, I wanted to see it and now I finally did. I am very happy that I was this movie because of the plot and all of the twists. I will say that I do love this era and time period. The competition of the magicians are what really makes this movie and the illusions that are presented. It did take a "dramatic" turn near the end and it is the ending that you do not expect.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, The Prestige is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>I can see where THE PRESTIGE, a very cunning piece of work, is going to require future viewings for me to fully grasp the story which is so intricate that reviewing it is more difficult than usual.<br /><br />For the sake of brevity, let me say that it's all about illusions in the dark world of magic in the 18th Century theater world. The period atmosphere is captured completely so that London of that era is beautifully rendered in low key lighting effects. The performances are all of the highest caliber, including the principal jobs by HUGH JACKMAN and CHRISTIAN BALE as magicians jealous of each other's talent.<br /><br />All the other roles are played well but it's MICHAEL CAINE in a peripheral part that stands out the most.<br /><br />There's an absorbing mystery at the heart of the tale and a plot twist that some may have guessed long before it happens, but it's the kind of film you can enjoy on a different level the second or third time.<br /><br />Summing up: Definitely worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is a very good movie and a good meystery. Jackman & Bale are awsome in this movie. I really acn't say more that it was an awesome movie. oh, you have to pat attention to this film or you'll get lost.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>To explain precisely what I like about The Prestige would necessarily ruin the film for you, because it's the narrative structure that impresses me the most.  In many ways, the movie is about filmmaking, about telling a story, about suspending an audience's disbelief.  Because the story happens to be about magic and magicians, I watched the film more closely than I normally would.  I purposely distrusted everything, and so I saw the ending far before the credits rolled.  I still enjoyed the final reveal.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film is overly obvious.  On the contrary, it's quite magnificent in its resistance to being a period piece.  It's clear that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted to interpret the Victorian Age for a modern audience.  I think we tend to look at the nineteenth century as a dirty, repressive era that erupted into the War to End All Wars.  There's likely some truth to that, but there was also majesty of invention and vibrancy of ideas.  This is the era directly before television, and all of the science that would later be concentrated as entertainment was still in the raw, and it captivated and motivated many famous minds.  Scientists of the Victorian Age approached science with much greater rashness and risk of physical harm than scientists do today.  Political correctness, frivolous lawsuits, restrictive grant procedures, and a beaten down sense of adventure have all conspired to stifle much of the passion and magic of scientific discovery.  Interestingly enough, much of what most of us know as science comes to us in the form of entertainment, a la Mythbusters and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  The Prestige reveals the birth of modern entertainment as the meeting of magic and science.<br /><br />The movie captures something else about the Victorian Age.  When you see a Victorian machine or tool, you see the labor and intellect that must have gone into its production.  When you look at your television or your dishwasher, there's nothing to see.  All of the humanity of invention is gone.<br /><br />The Prestige is not a perfect film.  When it turns its final few tricks, and the story becomes clear, you might review the film in your head and question Christian Bale's performance.  It seems like Nolan was too afraid to let Bale give any clues for fear of giving everything away.  At first, I was annoyed with the choppy storytelling, because it seemed like a cheap way to create suspense.  In the end, I still think it was cheap, but it works because the film, as I mention above, is on some level about filmmaking and the production of entertainment.<br /><br />My experience with the sound of the DVD was not favorable.  The dialogue is too quiet and muffled at times.  Nolan brings a lot of people (not only actors, but much of the crew) from Batman Begins, and the result is a movie that looks very similar.  David Bowie is a pleasant surprise as Tesla, one of the greatest scientists in history.<br /><br />Memento remains Nolan's masterpiece, but The Prestige will satisfy a much larger crowd.  I feel like Nolan had one important thing to film, which he announces in Following and finishes in Memento.  His post-Memento films seem to me to require much more work on his part, because he's trying to satisfy his Memento fans as well as appeal to a general audience.  The Prestige accomplishes this dual task quite well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>There are many reviews here that have so eloquently explained why this film is a must-see, but I have to share my enthusiasm nevertheless.  The Prestige is a dark and intense gothic thriller set during the turn of the twentieth century and it tells the story of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two struggling magicians who turn against each other after a magic trick goes wrong, costing the life of Angier's wife.  Angry, Angier tries every way to outdo Borden in magic tricks and fame.  His motive is revenge at first, but then it takes a life of its own when discovering Borden's secrets and tricks become an obsession.  There are many twists throughout the film, which include some rather flooring scenes.<br /><br />I loved this film and its dark tone from beginning to end.  It isn't the typical thriller by any means, for it's got substance mostly brought on by the excellent direction of Christopher Nolan and the magnificent performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine.  Christian Bale is by far the best in this film.  He brings Borden's many complexities to life and he does leave you puzzled with his behavioral changes and hard-to-figure-out personality.  His performance floored me.  I've never seen this actor in a film before, and in addition to his good looks and gorgeous Welsh accent, I enjoyed his delivery and I look forward to watching him in other films.  Jackman surprised me here.  I'd seen him in romantic comedies and in those Van Helsing and X-Men movies and thought that was all he was capable of doing, but his stellar performance here has proven me wrong.  Plus, he looks gorgeous.  I cannot resist a tall, dark and handsome man in a cravat.  There are other fine performances here, one of them by David Bowie, who plays the legendary Victorian scientist Nikola Tesla.  The weakest link, acting-wise, is Scarlett Johansson, who uses one of the worst imitations of an English accent I've ever heard.  As for other aspects, the characterization Angier, Borden and the others is flawless.  The majority of the characters, namely the protagonists, are not meant to be sympathetic.  In fact, they are flawed, unlikeable people who are selfish and sinister in more ways than one.  (Though I admit I felt bad for Angier because he was so tortured and corrupted with obsession that I truly felt for the character.) That is what makes this film dark in a rather unique way. I love the cinematography, the late 19th Century England setting, and the overall dark plot.  This, as I and others have already said, is a must-see.  I watched this on iTunes and bought the DVD afterwards because I couldn't get enough and because this is the sort of movie you have to watch a few times in order to fully understand it.  I've watched it twice already and discovered things I hadn't noticed at first.  I wish I had read the book this film is based on before watching the movie.  Ah, well.  Anyway, this is highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>THE PRESTIGE is the year's best film. Not!! Yet,it is definitely the most intelligent film I have seen in 2006 - a year where a dozen great films came out.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman did 4 films this year and this one is without the blossom of a doubt, his best performance till date. I "didn't" think too highly of him (Considering he's done a film called Van Helsing; Scoop was a three star grade film; The Fountain rocked while everyone knows XMEN insults my age,really, I'm 22 you see) but he gave a very realistic portrayal of his character. What truly makes Hugh Jackman stand out is not quite his height/poise or dialogue delivery. The real charm lies in the manner in which the actor uses his arms, legs, speech, movements, reactions, etc. to actually make a point to an unsuspecting crowd.<br /><br />While watching The Prestige, I wondered to myself who the second actor was. You see, I had never seen a Christian Bale film (Surprise!) I, personally, think he was as good as Hugh Jackman was. The direction is immaculate and will make the hair on your back stand.<br /><br />It's quite humorous that Amazon forget to include Scarlett Johansson's name on the main page (film cast) She did a good job, her role was limited but it is always good to see someone so beautiful perform in a film as good as The Prestige. In all likeliness, Prestige will restore your faith in films even if it wasn't really lost. There is a great "unpredictability" about the whole plot but the execution is better than the plot itself. A lot of us including me guessed the twist towards the end but that still was only a part of the bigger twist altogether.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Where Prestige actually stands out is in the film's ability to shock you. The best scenes in the film include the following - When Hugh Jackman is outsmarted by Christian Bale and is left hanging by a rope like a character in a kindergarten show; the scene in which the hats are displayed, the first scene of the film, the rivalry scenes between the two young magicians, Hugh Jackman and his presentation skills as a magician, David Bowie's great cameo, the innumerable twists and many more.<br /><br />Overall, I'd like to say that this film as good as it is, is because it is the kind of film you want to see do good and it does just that. Masterfully. Many comparisons have been made with "The Illusionist" Now I'm a bit of a Ed Norton fan but realistically speaking THE PRESTIGE spanks ILLUSIONIST on the head three times over without even trying. Not only is it a better, more creative, more captivating film but it's also a bigger film on the whole. If you compare the endings of the two films, you would know what I mean. Nonetheless, both films are definitely worth watching a few times over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>THE PRESTIGE is a sumptuous, atmospheric, if ultimately empty tale of deception and misdirection.  MEMENTO's Christopher Nelson uses his typical enigmatic writing and directing style to weave an interesting if sometimes confusing tale of magical revenge.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale competently portray the two competitive magicians constantly trying to outdo the other, particularly Jackman who holds Bale responsible for the tragic death of his magician wife.  The ineffable Michael Caine plays Jackman's mentor who tries to help him best his competitor but also give him good advice not to go too far.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining, but wasn't completely satisfied with its protracted resolution.</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>Wow, I was blown away by this movie.  It was all it was billed to be and more.  Jackman and Bale are great, they have amazing chemistry, you can feel the loathing and admiration between the two of them, the hate each other, yet are drawn together by their love of magic and one uping and humilating the other.  This movie is good from start to finish and the twist at the end is fantastic, im not sure the best man won, but you can judge for yourself.  Highly recommended: great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>I've seen this movie a couple of times now and really enjoy it.  This cast does a great job and gives excellent performances, but what really makes this movie for me is how it's constructed.<br /><br />The story is told from overlapping points of view, one inside of another, an obsession within an obsession until the end.  The beginning from the end, a rough and sorry journey that is well thought out, and delivered in a manner that gives homage to the immortal world as it unfolded from from the pages of Bram Stoker's classic tale.  This gives this movie its real punch and makes it stand out from contemporary storytelling.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>"It is inhuman to be so cold", says one of the film's characters, and that's what "The Prestige" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as "Memento" meets "Rash?mon" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer "The Illusionist" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>The world of illusion is one that has entertained audiences worldwide for years and years, and now you will be taken behind the scenes to witness how some of these tricks are created, but also just how obsessive and dark this world can be.  The man responsible for showing you this side of magic, is none other than director Christopher Nolan, who has become one of Hollywood's most successful director's in recent years, with his films ranging from the confusing, sleeper hit "Memento", to the detective thriller "Insomnia", to DC Comics' caped crusader in "Batman Begins", and has managed to intrigue audiences every step of the way.  This latest effort "The Prestige", starring Hugh Jackman (`X-Men' trilogy) and Christian Bale ("Batman Begins"), proves to be no exception.<br /><br />"The Prestige" tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who once upon a time had worked together to perform illusions, but after one fateful night tore these two friends apart, they are now the bitterest of enemies.  Desperately trying to learn each other's secrets, these two one-time friends will stop at nothing to defeat the other.  As their obsession grows more dangerous, sabotage and deceit become everyday affairs on their quest to be the greatest illusionist of their time.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is one of those movies where you can't miss a second or else you may find yourself completely confused as to what's going on in the film.  There are several major twists within the story, with many minor ones thrown in along the way that will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will be coming at you next.  In some movies too many surprises or twists can bring about a movies eventual downfall.  For instance if there are too many twists that it appears the writers themselves lost track of where they were intending to go, and the movie suffers by becoming confusing and convoluted.  "The Prestige" avoids this pitfall, thanks to the excellent writing of director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan.  Together they have managed to successfully craft a thoroughly engaging revenge movie that is unique, in that there is no clear cut hero in the movie.  Along with the revenge arc of the story, there are huge amounts of detail shown as to what went on behind the scenes of many of these magic tricks in the old days, which was really interesting, and surprising in some instances as to how far all of these magicians would go just to create an illusion for an audience.  This exploration into the somewhat darker side of magic is so intriguing because it's a part of that world that you haven't seen before.  Of course, the secrets revealed in this movie, may not have been all that secret of late, and are probably not even close to being how the magicians of today would create the same illusion, but it was still interesting to watch and showed me things I didn't know about.<br /><br />Throughout this story the two lead characters, brilliantly portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale respectively, do so many underhanded things to one another that neither one is without a share in the blame for the destructive paths their lives have taken.  This makes the movie interesting to watch because you can't completely side with either character as the hero for the movie, which allows the audience to not choose sides and therefore see both sides to the movie more clearly.  The two main supporting characters are excellently played by Scarlett Johansson, whose character is hardly without her own moral shortcomings, and Michael Caine, who plays the one character that could probably be described as the moral center for the film.  The acting in this movie is truly excellent, and allows "The Prestige" to become another successful film for director Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />By now, you have no doubt concluded that I really enjoyed this movie, and therefore highly recommend people to watch it.  However, this is not a movie for everyone, as it is a much darker movie than even I anticipated.  So, if you're thinking that this is going to be a magical, special effects extravaganza, then you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are looking for a very well-acted, dramatic, and intense movie-going experience, then "The Prestige" is definitely one movie to watch, and if you're like me you'll want to see it again once it's over.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is rated PG-13 for violence.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>You're read the synopsis in the rest of the reviews.  The film's great for eye-candy, the cast is gorgeous and the illusions are good.  What bogs the story down are endless plot complications that just bog the story down.<br /><br />Loved the one piece of history regarding Tesla and Colorado Springs--that is semi-true and would make a film in and of itself.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>After the release of the astoundingly good BATMAN BEGINS in 2005, it seemed clear that director Christopher Nolan's next project would be the sequel, so naturally it came as a surprise when he announced that his next project would be something else: an adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel THE PRESTIGE.  Nolan has a history of following up good projects with extraordinary projects (FOLLOWING with MEMENTO, INSOMNIA with BATMAN BEGINS).  As BATMAN BEGINS was an extraordinary project, Nolan was due for a good project.  That's what I was expecting when I saw THE PRESTIGE: a good film.  What I received was far greater than what I expected, because as it turns out, THE PRESTIGE is one of the finest films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Trying to summarize the film would be a futile effort; the plot thickens immensely with each moment.  The plot in its simplest form is as follows: in London at the end of the 19th century, two young rival magicians (played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) compete to become the finest magicians alive.  Bale seems to accomplish this after performing the ultimate magic trick; Jackman becomes obsessed with finding out Bale's secret and besting him.  By the film's end, its beginning is a distant memory, and one may wonder how we, the viewers, arrived at its end at all.<br /><br />That's not to say that watching the film is strenuous, though.  Not at all.  Watching THE PRESTIGE is a thoroughly captivating and ultimately haunting experience.  What I am saying is that with a storyline of such depth, the film could fail miserably in the hands of a lesser director.  Fortunately, Christopher Nolan is an immensely talented director, one who is nearly cemented in my mind as one of the finest directors alive today.  He is a young master of filmmaking.  Every shot, every scene, every performance, every moment in THE PRESTIGE is flawless, and that's thanks in no small part to Nolan.<br /><br />Then there's the sensational cast, headed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, two very talented actors who here are at the top of their form.  The on-screen rivalry between the two is delicious, and each character is just flawed enough so you never side with either of them for long.  The excellent supporting cast includes the consistently lovable Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Peter Jackson favorite Andy Serkis, and an unrecognizable David Bowie, as well as Piper Perabo, who has very little screentime.  Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson feels almost as though she's wasted and possibly being typecast in the role of "flaming temptress" (see also MATCH POINT).<br /><br />David Julyan's score is very subtle, but its subtlety actually works extremely well, especially when combined with Wally Pfister's typically murky cinematography.  Lee Smith, who also edited BATMAN BEGINS, has done a similarly fast-paced editing job.  The pace could, at times, throw people off.  At the beginning of the film, I was virtually clueless about what was happening.  Advice to those planning on seeing the film: sit it through and enjoy the ride.  It'll all sort itself out by the end.<br /><br />A film like THE PRESTIGE could wind up like a failed magic trick: interesting, perhaps, but ultimately silly and a waste of time.  THE PRESTIGE, however, is every bit as astounding as the "ultimate magic trick" performed within the film.  It's a stellar effort from everyone involved.  The film itself is the most delightful of cinematic magic tricks, the rare film that not only surpasses your expectations, but leaves you speechless.  Personally, I'm surprised that the film hasn't received overwhelmingly positive reviews; in fact, many have even been rather negative.  Maybe with all the cliched dramas and horror remakes that have emerged recently, film audiences are losing their ability to handle a well-made film, even if it is as complex as THE PRESTIGE.  Don't let its complexity put you off from seeing it, though: THE PRESTIGE is not only one of the finest films of the year, it's very probably one of the finest films I've ever seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>There were many surprises at this year's Academy Awards.  One of the biggest was the absence of nominations for several films, most noticeably this one.  Containing no sex, no nudity, no bad language, no gore, no grand action scenes, minimal comedy, a non-descript sountrack, and only several seconds of violence, this movie has none of the hallmarks of a top movie.  But a top movie it is; it sat atop the box office charts for a month and everyone who has seen it comes away impressed.  This is one of those movies that stands out for its inventiveness, its innovative mode of storytelling, its twists and turns at many points of the plot, and ability to make the viewer empathize with all the main characters.  Great movies have themes, and this movie has multiple.  First is obsession, not necessarily of revenge, but also of winning, of being the best, and of having what others have and more.  Second is rivalry.  Many movies have tried to show how a friendship evolves into a deadly rivalry.  Examples include Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Gods and Generals and Cleopatra.  None of these does the job as good as this movie.  Neither character, Alfred or Angiers, is good, and neither are bad.  Both are professionals trying to reach the top of their professions, and if this means backstabbing each other, so be it.  Third is sacrifice; everyone sacrifices more than necessary to achieve their ends, and the result all around is lost loves and lost lives.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of this movie is its mode of storytelling.  In the early 1990's, Pulp Fiction came out and introduced the circular method of showing a movie.  Then came the Sixth Sense in the late 1990's and the method of a flashback at the end that redefined the entire movie from the get-go.  Then there are the Star Wars movies; sequels first then the prequels later.  Now we have the Prestige; three different storylines spliced together to create a play on time.<br /><br />The movie was great, and the DVD was good.  No extra or deleted scenes, just the interviews, explanations of special effects, and poster art.  Overall, a great watching experience</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>It is amazing to me that director Christopher Nolan, fresh from directing stars Christian Bale and Michael Caine in the incredible movie "Batman Begins," is able to turn the quest for a magic trick into a two-hour movie.  Even more amazing is that even in the slow spots this movie pulls you into the complexity of the relationship between two rival magicians.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are magicians working together, until a terrible tragedy on stage drives the two men apart and into rivalry.  Angier is the better showman.  Borden is the better magician.  Each magician attempts to alternately outperform and sabotage the other.  Each magician routinely finds ways to steal the other's tricks.  Borden particularly becomes adept at humiliating Angier.  Borden's ultimate trick, the Transporting Man, is particularly clever and makes Borden a lasting success.<br /><br />Angier tries, unsuccessfully, to learn how Borden does the Transporting Man.  Angier then travels to meet electricity wizard Nikola Tesla (singer and actor David Bowie) in Colorado.  Angier believes that Tesla has the technology it takes to make the Transporting Man work, for real.  It is at this point that the science fiction nature of this movie appears.  As an aside, Tesla's lab did not burn as shown in the movie.  Debt collectors dismantled and sold Tesla's Colorado Springs lab to pay his debts.<br /><br />Angier's return to London is phenomenally successful, sparking the rivalry with Borden anew.  However, the rivalry has acquired a sinister element, one that will bode no good for either man.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts movies of this type because they are so difficult to pull off successfully.  Neither Angier nor Borden is particularly sympathetic.  In fact, the movie only works because Angier and Borden are continually fighting with each other in some form.  Rather than taking the easy way out, director Nolan uses the steady, deliberate pace of this movie to establish the mood and style of the story.  There is some action in this movie, but that is not the point of the story; atmosphere and slowly revealed horror are.<br /><br />In an era where movies vie for attention with non-stop special effects and action, "The Prestige" makes effective use of lighting and sets to give this movie a moody Victorian feel.  The special effects that are used evoke Jules Verne or H.G. Wells.  The equipment we see in this movie was very similar to that built and demonstrated by Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a nicely directed and produced movie that combines proven movie-making techniques with modern special effects.  The result is a unique movie that will appeal to viewers that appreciate story and characters over action and special effects.  The final science fiction twist provides a disturbing chill even to those who had a suspicion as to how the movie ends.<br /><br />The generally unlikable principal characters, the slow pace, the lack of action, should have spelled box office doom for this movie.  However, viewers got the point and made this well-executed movie a success.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan gained much praise for his work in the twist-filled Memento but gained even more recognition when he successfully kickstarted the battered Batman franchise in Batman Begins. As a roadstop in-between the Batman sequel, he did this film focusing on magicians and the mystery of illusion. Maybe because of this, the film didn't get much attention; trading box-office success for critical praise. Too bad cause this was ultimately one of the year's best films that at times takes too many sleight of hands but in the end is masterful in its story unfolding.<br /><br />Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) are 2 fellow magicians who become rivals when tragedy strikes. Borden is the most talented magician but the one with the least charisma. Angier is a true showman and performer but not the know-how on tricks and thinking to pull off magic feats. Both want to one-up the other; thinking of bigger illusions and even sabatoging the other's performance. To spoil any more would be a crime and you'll see how far one can go in the name of being "the best".<br /><br />One of the problems when you have a film like this, especially one about magic is not only not revealing anything that will spoil the film but also letting the film outsmart watchers who dissect everything. "Was that an important plot point?" "Is that part of the twist?" Some guessed the film's twist but I honestly didn't even know simply because there was no reason to dwell on that particular thing. The fault the film does though is get too twist-y. It at times felt like "I fooled you! no wait you fooled me, now I'm gonna fool you back!" It piles on a story element after another until your hurt head hurts.<br /><br />Acting-wise though this is perfect across the board. Bale and Jackman play great rivals and characters while we also have Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and Scarlett Johansson with even Ziggy himself, David Bowie showing up in a impressive role since he isn't bad in the role. The one weak link although it's a needed character is Johansson. Remember Chris Rock's joke about Jude Law and what movies he wasn't in? Maybe it's just Johansson overkill but she just stands out since we just seen her in too much it seemed.<br /><br />My guess is that we're going to get double-dipped. Since this wasn't a Best Picture contender, there's no reason why the extras are so slight but all we get is a brief and surface-skimming making-of and an art gallery. This should've got way more extras although the one that people look forward to, a director commentary, is not as anticipated since Nolan isn't the most engaging commentator but still, we should've got more than this.<br /><br />Definately go and watch this and experience something that should've had more attention when it started.</p></br><a href="../users/A2L7WYA5OENV03.html">A2L7WYA5OENV03</a><br/><p>The Prestige<br /><br />I thought this was great the first time around, but the second time only deepened my appreciation for it.  This is a phenomenal piece of cinema.  Christopher Nolan and Dody Dorn improve upon many of the startling editing, structural, and narration techniques they solidified for Memento, but here serving the story rather than the other way around.  The character arcs, call-backs, and use of dialog are thrilling.  Magic, and all the concepts surrounding it, including the double meaning of "the prestige", are intertwined intrinsically.  This may have come from the novel, but it's a feat to translate anything so complicated with such purity when adapting forms.  I found this film to mesh organically into itself with nary a self-conscious or contrived air to be found.  While there were a few times I wished there was a tad more fire, spark, or intensity to the delivery in key scenes, the tone was always dead-on from the talent and I never found it unbelievable.  David Bowie and Christian Bale, in particular, give remarkably nuanced performances...right down to one of the final whispers.  I was also impressed with Hugh Jackman's final scene in the film, and how earlier he made such a perfect showman.  The cinematography & lighting no doubt had a lot to do with it, but I'll give him credit for really filling out the role.  Make sure to see this before it leaves the theaters, in an auditorium with good, loud sound, tight fine focus, and a bright lamp.  You'll regret it later if the first time you see it is at a cineplex run by incompetents or, god forbid, on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"The Prestige" is excellent! This is one of the year's best! This isn't better than "The Illusionist" (2006), but, however, it establishes its own pace and is different than "The Illusionist". The directing by Christopher Nolan (who is directing the upcoming Batman movie "The Dark Knight" (2008) and also wrote the story, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay to "The Prestige" with his brother Jonathan, which is based on the novel by Christopher Priest. Nolan has also done "Batman Begins" (2005), which he co-wrote the screenplay and directed, which in fact is the prequel to "The Dark Knight", he has also done the American remake of "Insomnia" (2002), and the impressive psychological thriller "Memento" (2000), which he, again, also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan and both were nominated for an Oscar for their screenplay and he also wrote and directed his debut film "Following" (1998) is excellent! Nolan is one of the best directors of our generation! The performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, & Michael Caine (both Bale and Caine worked with Nolan on "Batman Begins" and are currently working with him again on "The Dark Knight) are excellent! The music by David Julyan (who also did the music to Nolan's "Following", "Memento", & "Insomnia", he also did the music to "The Descent" (2006) is excellent! The cinematography by Wally Pfister (who also nominated for an Oscar for his work on Nolan's "Batman Begins", he also done Nolan's "Memento", "Insomnia" & the upcoming "The Dark Knight") is excellent! The film editing by Lee Smith (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on "Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World" (2003), he has done Nolan's "Batman Begins" & the upcoming "The Dark Knight") is excellent! The casting by John Papsidera (who also done the casting to Nolan's "Memento" & "Batman Begins", he has also done the casting to "Final Destination 3" (2006) is excellent! The production design by Nathan Crowley (who also done the production design to Nolan's "Insomnia", "Batman Begins", & the upcoming "The Dark Knight", he has also done the production design to "The Lake House" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Kevin Kavanaugh (who also did the art direction to "The Lake House") is excellent! The set decoration by Julie Ochipinti (who was also an assistant art director on Nolan's "Batman Begins") is excellent! The costume design by Joan Bergin is excellent! This is another one of Nolan's films that has put him in the place of master filmmakers. This is a visually, brilliant looking movie and it is also an impressive, smart, and excellent film that makes you think and keeps you guessing and makes you want more answers and questions. It is at times, confusing, but, it didn't affect me at all, because it is different than any movie out there right now, just like "The Illusionist" was before it or is, in some terms.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I was completely hooked into this film right from the start.  The plot twists and turns kept me glued to me seat and the screen.  The acting was top-notch by all involved (especially David Bowie's supporting role), the writing was incredibly clever, and the direction was smooth and sure-footed.  The unfolding of the "trick" or "tricks" is revealed a la M. Night Shylaman style (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TQRB">The Sixth Sense</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064LJVE">The Village</a>) and one can feel rather stupid at the end for not seeing the tricks all along, hence the catch phrase, "Are you watching?"<br /><br />It is hard to find much very redeeming about either competing magician, although one might be more on the side of the one who lost his wife, played by Jackman, due to the other magician's mistake during an act, played by Bale.  It is sad to see Jackman's character not recover from this loss and to fall into obssessive revenge.  Bale's character is tender in his family scenes and that actually is disturbing as we don't see him truly hurt or sorry for his part in his partner's wife's death.  You would think as a family man he would be more sensitive to his partner's loss.  In the end, we care little for these men and that is the saddest commentary of all.  By the way, I'm not spoiling anything here as this is all revealed within the first 15 minutes of the film.  It simply sets the stage, no pun intended, for the revenge plot portion of the film.<br /><br />This is a film not be missed.  It is truly one of the best films of 2006 and should have been honored with a Best Picture nod.  This film may not be to everyone's liking, but I loved it and highly recommend it along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist</a> and equally well done film about magic that went kind of unnoticed as "The Prestige" was a more splashy film at the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>I have to admit to being disturbed by The Prestigeon some basic levels. Chief among them is that nowhere in the trailer was there any mention of going beyond real world physics. Nor did we get an accurate view of the characters because some really important details were left out.<br /><br />When the trailer first started playing in the theaters, I was really looking forward to it.  I saw Edward Norton's The Illusionist first and really enjoyed it, though it too had a bit of a meandering problem due to the nature of the conflict.  Both films are really small in some ways, microcosms in the world that depend largely on interior story and suffering on part of the characters.  Those are good aspects of story, but these were magicians.  I simply wanted more and bigger magic.  I really wanted more explanation of the tricks period magicians did at the time in The Prestige.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book by Christopher Priest.  Priest is a horror/SF novelist and comic book writer.  He turned in one of the most impressive comic book runs ever when he was writing Black Panther.<br /><br />I have to admit to being pretty much pulled along by the story and the dark natures of the characters as well as the rivalry they followed until the final frames of the movie. Unfortunately, I'd figured most of them out and generally ended up asking myself, why?<br /><br />When Angier's wife was dropped into the water tank, I knew things were going to end badly.  Even prepared for it, though, the gritty realism of the scene was hard to take.<br /><br />Jackman, Bale, Caine, and Johansson delivered standup work in their roles, but they were empty of some real resolution to a degree. Overall, the characters were paper-thin in the finished product and lacked enough flesh and bones to make me care about them much.  I was more concerned with how the illusion was being done and what Angier was doing in Colorado trying to talk to Nikolai Tesla.  Once I had that figured out, I was done with the film to a large extent.  Without true character development, all that was left to see was the trick.<br /><br />The sets and the period piece work were all extremely well done. I felt like I was in Victorian England and in Colorado Springs during those parts of the movie.  I watched the movie on Blu-ray and the scenes were gorgeous.  They were so clear and vivid I felt like I was standing on the street corner or had a seat in the theater where the shows were playing.  The high-def format is absolutely the way to go for the discriminating home theater connoisseur.<br /><br />However, the three storylines that constantly looped and interwove were really much more effort than should have been required for the payoff I received as a viewer. I know that it was necessary to make all the surprises work, but they still made the story more convoluted than it should have been.<br /><br />The Prestige is a good movie. People who haven't seen anything like it will love it. Anyone who loves Christopher Nolan's films (Memento, Batman Begins) will enjoy this one. And there enough historical references to please the armchair historian. Definitely a good film to watch with a group that likes to puzzle things out as they watch a film in the privacy of their own home so they won't disturb other paying viewers who don't like ruminations while watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>"The Prestige" is moviemaking at its best - engrossing story, fine acting, beautiful production, and a lingering presence in your mind long after the movie is over.  I saw this in the theatre on New Year's Eve, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, it's a bit long. And constant twists and turns in the story line may leave some viewers baffled or irritated. But I found it fascinating on every level, from its portrayal of century-ago theatre to the philosophical questions it raises at the end. One of the best movies of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed The Prestige.  I enjoy period movies and books especially those around the turn of the (last) century, so I was drawn to this movie.  I was interested to read the reviews to find out how others related to the film.  The plot was fascinating and the acting was excellent.  The storyline was well done as well.  Not really one feel good moment in the film, so if you are interested in that, look elswhere.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to those with a bent towards period pieces and the accompanying accents and outifts.  For me, this was a very enjoyable 4 star film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RSXP7MB772E3.html">A1RSXP7MB772E3</a><br/><p>The prestige is a beautiful film, that draws you into the stage of magic, in a world on the verge of a technological change. Directed by Christopher Nolan, and filled with his usual plethora of fine actors; the Prestige is a mysterious movie, primarily about the three stages of any magic trick, and the human condition at its finest and worst. It feels like this film is under a dream-like look, that reminds me of films that present a look of warm memories, but here I think it helps to expose a period of time that people did many great things.<br /><br />Obsession is a young man's game, says a tired Michael Caine, and it takes no prisoners I say. Most of the drama is portrayed between the bitter conflict between veteran magician Robert Angier played by the very talented Hugh Jackman and the two-sided, mysterious magician Alfred Borden played convincingly by Christian Bale.<br /><br />From beginning to end, The Prestige is magical. Such pain is exposed in the relationship between the lovers Sarah and Alfred. You are presented with nuances that give hidden clues that make rewatching it even more enjoyable. The haunting loss for Robert is played with emotion and lorn by Jackman, and I give him high praise. Robert becomes unnaturally obsessed after discovering that Alfred, the man that has made him so miserable, has found a happy life. But Alfred has more than just revenge in mind. It is not just a matter of tit-for-tate here. Robert's loss has ruined his life forever, and his poets heart has been savagely punctured. His true, masterpiece, is to see Alfred's newest magic trick stolen. The magic trick, to the dismay of Robert, is an incredible act. He is convinced, that it is more than some cheap doppleganger trick. But what is it? How is it done, and what is the prestige?<br /><br />The Prestige is an amazing work, done by a gifted director. The acting is a real high point, and the story and material, as presented, was absorbing to begin with and required no mercy from the viewer to take charm. I was not thrilled by the description, but from the first gorgeous scene, and the story beginning with the end, is very interesting and thrilling. I recommend this well made film.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XK1ZCXM66OT.html">A32XK1ZCXM66OT</a><br/><p>Oh, this was a really good film. It starts with a professional rivalary between two magicians. Which seems normal enough at first. But when one of the magicians comes up with a trick called "The Teleported Man" and the trick becomes a hit. It forces the other magician into an obsessive quest to figure out how the trick is done. Which drives him to do some pretty dangerous and deadly things to destroy the other magician.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VIOCJZ22JZXT.html">A3VIOCJZ22JZXT</a><br/><p>There are numerous reviews posted on this excellent film but few of them mention the fatal flaws of the two talented young magicians that eventually leads to their separate painful downfalls.<br /><br />Two young talented men work together and are fascinated by the field of magic performance. One accidentally, and maybe subconsciously, ties a rope too tight and this results in the drowning death of the other young magician's wife. Now the story becomes one of revenge as Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman), the handsome widower, begins to plot revenge against Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale). Interestingly these two men would have been superb partners since Borden is the better technical illusionist whereas Alfred is the better showman. Michale Caine plays the role of a man who designs magic tricks and coaches magicians. He actually plays the conscious of Robert, the voice of morality and reason, that Robert sometimes hears and sometimes ignores. David Bowie plays the mysterious Dr. Testler in Colorado Springs, who has developed a machine that will reproduce anything put into its chamber. Testler is actually the devil, the force of evil that grants a man a superhuman gift so that the gift can bring about their downfall. This is the major character flaw of Robert. His grief and desire for revenge remain his motivation for living and even keeps him blind to the advantages of loving his lovely assistant, played by Scarlette Johansson. But Alfred Borden has his flaws too. Alfred has a twin and he keeps this secret even from his wife, which only acts to pull them apart and eventually result in her suicide.<br /><br />Revenge and secrecy from those we love are two character flaws that bring both men down in this morality play of the first order. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>The Prestige is the "other" film about magicians, which came out right around the time of The Illusionist.  Although on the surface the two films seem to be set in similar time periods about similar subjects, they couldn't be more different.<br /><br />The Prestige is about two magicians and their obsessive quest to one-up each other. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is a polished American magician who performs with his wife, fellow British magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and gizmo inventor Cutter (Michael Caine).  When Angier's wife drowns during a trick, he blames Borden for the deed.  Borden's unsatisfying response to which knot he tied is, "I don't know."<br /><br />That burning question ("How could he not know?") consumes Angier and sets the tone for the movie.  But this is esteemed director Christopher Nolan we're talking about, so nothing is that simple.  The movie has multiple layers.  It's broken into three parts (the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige).  But it's also a duel between the two magicians, consuming everything from their friends (Cutter) to their wives to their mistresses (Olivia Wenscombe, played by Scarlett Johansson) to their very children, retold through each of their respective diaries.  It's also a battle of magic vs. technology, illusion vs. reality, showmanship vs. stagecraft. Nolan poses the question: When does a single-minded quest for perfection become ruthless enough to commit murder?<br /><br />The twists and turns in the film aren't too hard to follow; astute viewers will pick up on the secrets behind both magicians' acts.  What's really terrifying is the little sins that magicians commit in performing their illusions.  What happens to all cute those bunnies and pigeons that disappear?  You don't want to know.<br /><br />If The Prestige has a flaw, it's that the movie takes so long to reveal the entirety of its performance and deception. Still, the gut-punch ending is worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Yep, this is one film that earned its rave reviews. Its a very deep, involving movie, full of twists and turns. The film is not perfect, it is a little slow in the middle, but the good far outwieghs the bad.<br /><br />The one thing that stands out is David Bowie's solid performance as Nikola Tesla, who was "spooky" smart in real life. I rarely see a film that is this well put together with such a great cast. Hugh Jackman's performance was great, starting off as the protagonist of the movie who let obsession turn him into a monster.  Christian Bale puts in another great performance as the rival illusionist.<br /><br />Also, After I watched this movie, I was curious about the scene with the cat. I think it was a clever reference to "Schrodinger's cat" - Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger's famous 1935 illustration of the principle in quantum theory of superposition. Any film that can fit that reference into its story deserves a look.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>A suspenseful, surprising twisting plot that was sometimes too fantastical for its own good.  The other problem was the lack of a real hero.  A better movie than its twin, The Illusionist, it was not.

It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible.  From star performances by Christian Bale, High Jackman and Michael Caine as well as titillating eye candy in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo, `The Prestige' enlists an all star cast to help tell the twisted story of two rival magicians bound together by a tragic event that haunts their every action.<br /><br />When Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) accidentally causes the death of Robert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife Julia (Piper Perabo) not only is their friendship instantly over but they are now rivals, in every aspect of their lives.  The film begins with the death of Robert Angier at the supposed hands of Alfred Bordon.  As we await the result of the trial we are given, in flashbacks, the events that preceded the murder.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of this movie away so I don't want to write too much.  This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please.  I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well.  There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea.

What happens when this duel gets personal... a slip in a knot leads to a death, then it is countered with the loss of part of a hand, then a leg, and then...?<br /><br />How far will it go?<br /><br />That is the premise behind The Prestige.  Good magicians never give up their tricks.  Ever.  So, as a member of the audience, watch closely, keep an open mind, and expect the unexpected.<br /><br />Because the unexpected will occur, and you will find yourself comprehending the action slower than you thought was possible.<br /><br />And it is this observation of your slow self-realization that you will find most haunting.<br /><br />Although the tales are quite different, I found myself reminded of V for Vendetta for the pace of the story, the direction, and the cinematography.

The term "The Prestige" is a term in magic that refers to the third phase in an illusion. Not only does something magical and wonderful happen (not so in the case of Huidini) but when all goes well the audience should sit stunned and flabbergasted at what they have just seen... or didn't see. Christian Bale, as always - and I mean always (Empire of the Sun, Batman Returns la-de-da-etc...)- and Michael Caine manages again to pull of his wise charm. Hugh Jackman is dark and sinister, as is almost everything and everyone in the film, and achieves one of his better roles. And then there is Scarlett Johansen... She's blatantly underused, but this is after-all a story about two men and their rivaly, and there is little time to develop other characters.<br /><br />It is quite refreshing to see David Bowie in a non Labyrinthian role. He pulls rabbits out of many many hats. Movie plug. I am ashamed. He is quite the wizard, in a modern scientific way. Amazingly enough none of these men are quite as sinister as the unseen Thomas Alvis Edison, whose henchmen always seem to be on the heels of every electrical marvel that might infringe on the copywrite that he seems to have on EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I liked the Prestige a lot, and yes that's a friggin overused term, but I did. Poof.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan approached this movie much like batman begins, with even a very similar cast as Batman (Michael Caine and Christian Bale).  With dark/downtrodden sets, many camera angles, and a whole lot of action, this movie keeps you in suspense.  With a pseudo-historical basis, this movie is set in old london, where 2 young magicians lives start off as friends, but by a "Knot it time" they are split apart and apposed to each other until the end.  It is a very original movie, I have not seen anyting based around a subject like this before, or at least recently.  Check this movie out if you like films like Batman Begins, American Psycho, The Machienist, ect...all of which starred Christian Bale.  Again, casting was excellent in this film with Bale, Jackman, Caine, Johansen, Hall, and Perabo.  Also the very improtant spot of Nikola Tesla was filled by DAVID BOWIE, which was a great role for him, and his dark, proper, and mysterious character.  Check this movie out, well worth the price of admission.</p></br><a href="../users/A27H9DOUGY9FOS.html">A27H9DOUGY9FOS</a><br/><p>Like many other reviewers, I came into Christopher Nolan's "The Prestige" with high expectations.  He, thus far, has a pretty good track record in my book.  "Batman Begins" ranks highly among adult comic book movies, but prior to that--he scored big with the sublime "Memento" and the underappreciated "Insomnia" (where, miraculously, he coaxed restrained performances from both Al Pacino and Robin Williams).  So teaming Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman in a dark and twisty tale of obsession and revenge seemed like movie nirvana.  And "The Prestige," while not a perfect film, certainly provides its leads with robust roles and delivers much to admire.<br /><br />Set in the world of magic, two practitioners (Bale and Jackman) start out together in an act devised by Michael Caine.  When a tragedy strikes, Jackman loses his wife and holds Bale accountable.  Though they go their separate ways, they never mentally disconnect.  Jackman plots revenge, Bale retaliates and their lives become a complex game of one-upmanship--as each strives to be the better illusionist, to boast the better trick.  The film is a sleek and nasty mechanism as rage and jealousy propel the action.  While this has left some people feeling cold--there is no one to particularly root for--I found it refreshingly mean spirited and believable.  Jackman and Bale both give great, passionate performances.  Whether or not you like the movie, I think it would be hard not to see that these are two undervalued performers getting a chance to do some "big" acting.  Caine is terrific, as always, and Scarlett Johansson is perfect as a woman caught between the feuding warriors.<br /><br />As you might expect from a Nolan film, there are some surprises--some tricks to be revealed in the film's prestige.  Now I have an eye for movie "surprises," I guess I'm too suspicious or analytical.  I figured out one of the primary surprises early on--but that didn't lessen my interest in the film, I was just as curious to see how it played out.  The film is built in a multilayered flashback structure that is interesting and rewarding.  It adds to the dramatic revelations of the final act.  But there is a science fiction element that is dropped in at the last moment.  And while I know that the film is actually based on a sci-fi work, this was the least compelling aspect of the film.  In fact, it might have ruined a lesser movie altogether.  After so much real emotion, such a fantastic setup, so much believability--this plot twist quickly brings what was a great film back to earth as a good one.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a satisfying and adult treat.  It boasts some of the best performances of the year, and is beautiful and fascinating to look at.  It's quality filmmaking, one that is recommended despite the shortcomings of the final payoff.  KGHarris, 12/06.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>2006 has been a quiet year for event films. The predicted blockbusters this past summer pretty much underperformed despite some being exactly as good as I thought they'd be. Other than Johnny Depp and the gang's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, every blockbuster didn't blow the industry out of the water. It's a very good thing that I had smaller films to tide me over. This year has been a very good ones for some independent-minded and smaller films which came out during the slow first couple months of the year and during the graveyard release months between the end of summer and the start of the late year holidays. I've already had the chance to see such very good films like Running Scared from Wayne Kramer and Hard Candy from David Slade to The Proposition from John Hillcoat. I am glad to say that Christopher Nolan's film adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel, The Prestige is another non-blockbuster that excites, entertains and, in the end, keeps the audience mystified but not confused.<br /><br />I've read Christopher Priest's novel about dueling late 19th-century London magicians. It's a novel written in epistolary format with each chapter and section written as entries into the journal of one of the main characters in the story. The novel itself is pretty straightforward as it tells the story in near chronological order. I was hesistant to embrace this film adaptation when I first heard about it since alot of the mystery of of the story wouldn't translate so well in film if they followed the strict order of how the story was told in the novel. For Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, to just adapt the novel straight-out would've made for a dull and boring mystery-thriller. I was glad that the Nolan brothers were inventive enough to borrow abit from Christopher Nolan's first feature film, Memento. Their film adaptation of The Prestige doesn't go backwards in its narrative, but it does mixes up the chronological order of the story somewhat, but not to the point that Tarantino does in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. The two Nolans fudges abit with the timeline to add some backstory filler to help give the characters that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman portrays with the reason for their pathological obsession with each other.<br /><br />Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for The Prestige was able to keep the mystery of the story intact, but it also keeps the amount of red herrings in such films to a minimum. Michael Caine's character, Harry Cutter, opens up the film explaining just exactly what constitutes a magic trick on stage. How it's divided into three parts. First, there's "The Pledge" wherein the magician shows the audience something ordinary he or she will use in the trick. Soon, the magician will follow this up with "The Turn" where the abovementioned ordinary object does something extraordinary in front of the audience. The pay-off of the magician's trick is "The Prestige" where the audience's astonishment occurs as they fail to deconstruct and figure out the means of the trick. That's pretty much the film in a nutshell. It's one big magic trick. The clues are there for the audience to see, gather and extrapolate their answer to the mystery that is the story. The screenplay doesn't treat the audience as if they need to be hand-held throughout the film. In fact, anyone who pays attention will be able to solve one-half of the mystery by the first hour. I won't say exactly whose half of the mystery it will be but people will be kicking themselves afterwards if they don't figure it out right away.<br /><br />This magic trick of a film does have its many underlying layers of themes to add some complexity, drama and tension to the characters of Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). I've already mentioned that throughout the film their mutual obsession about each other is due to a backstory detailing their past. A past where they were initially friends --- rivals even --- and apprentices to the magician Harry Cutter (excellently played by Michael Caine as the only voice of reason throughout the film). Borden and Angier's obsession is not just in ruining and sabotaging each other's magic tricks and lives, but also trying to find out each other's secrets as they both learn magic tricks which amaze and thrill the gentry of London's stage. From the beginning of the film these two characters begin a journey towards a path of destructive behavior which puts not just each other's lives at risk, but those who they care about. All of it in the name of humiliating and upstaging the other due to a tragic incident early in their mutual careers. These two individuals were not sympathetic characters and I applaud Christopher Nolan and his brother for not softening up their hard edges.<br /><br />Most adaptors will try to make a story's characters more sympathetic and likable. They went the opposite in The Prestige. But even these two dark characters continue to exude the charisma and strong personalities that the audience will root for one or the other. Should they root for the charismatic and born shownman that Hugh Jackman's Angier character plays or go for the perfectionist Borden character Christian Bale plays. A perfectionist whose technical skills surpasses that of Angier's but whose introverted and brooding personality makes him little or no stage presence.<br /><br />Both Jackman and Bale play their characters well. The film wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for the work of these two actors. It helps that they're surrounded by quality supporting character like Michael Caine as the seasoned, veteran mentor to the dueling magicians. Even Scarlett Johansson does very well with the part she's given. It's a part that many sees as more of a throwaway character. A piece of very good-looking distraction for both the story and the audience. But she gamely plays the role of pawn for both Angier and Borden. Unlike Michael Caine's character who remains the singular voice of sanity in the film, even Johansson's character of Olivia gets pulled into the obsessions and betrayals that's plagued both Angier and Borden. But in the end, she's just part of the process of "The Turn" and if people have been watching the film closely right from the beginning then she's also a clue as to the secret of one of the amazing magic tricks shown by the two magicians.<br /><br />The Prestige also has a distinct look about it. The 19th-century London just before the start of the new millenium gives it a certain sense of Victorian-era familiarity. Production designer Nathan Crowley shows a London at the height of its Gilded Age, but soon gives way to a certain steampunk look as inventor Nikola Tesla makes an appearance during an integral part of the story. David Bowie portrays Tesla as an eccentric genius whose search for the secrets of the universe will lead to the discovery of what many of that era would consider magic. It's the ingenius looking technology created for the Tesla sequence which finally gives The Prestige it's root in fantasy and science-fiction. The film doesn't dwell on this new development but from that part of the story and until the end, the film takes on a look and feel of a steampunk mystery-thriller. There's not enough films that tries to mine this new subgenre and I, for one, am glad that Christopher Nolan added this new dimension to the film's overall look.<br /><br />In the end, The Prestige really needs to be seen to be appreciated and for people to make up their minds about the film. Some will see it as a thriller with twists and turns that doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience. Some may see the film as just one large gimmick from start to end. Those people will probably be correct as well. The film at its most basic level is one long magic trick with all three acts. It has "The Pledge" which is then followed up by "The Turn" and then ends with "The Prestige". It will be up to each individual who sees the film to make the final decision as to whether they've bought into all three acts of the magic trick that is The Prestige, or come away having felt like they've wasted their time. I've not come across many who felt like the latter, even those whose own feelings about the film don't reach the same level of praise as I have for Christopher Nolan's latest offering. All I know is that this is a film that delivers on its premise to confound and amaze. It also continues to validate my views that Bruce Wayne and Batman are in very good hands with Christopher Nolan at the wheel. The Prestige is easily one of the best film of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UL0A8GJB4318.html">A2UL0A8GJB4318</a><br/><p>Proof positive that director Christopher Nolan, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are among the finest, richest talents in Hollywood, "The Prestige" is a wickedly clever and riveting tale of all consuming obsession.  Don't be fooled by the magic angle.  This is a classic tale that simply uses rival magicians and the tricks of their trade to illustrate what all-too driven individuals are willing to unleash on one another in the name of one-upsmanship and superiority.  Bale and Jackman are terrific as the pair of rival magic men who try to destroy each other, their destructive animosity etched on their faces.  And its a showcase for the considerable talents of Christopher Nolan, who (along with his screenwriter kin Johnathon Nolan) executes one the most impressively acrobatic balancing acts in cinematic storytelling with the ease of a born illusionist.  Set in turn of the century England, magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman) toil to ascend to the upper echelons of the London entertainment circuit, under the tutelage of Cutter (the always superb Michael Caine), an experienced magician's aide.  Borden's and Angier's relationship turns poisionous after a tragic accident during a routine show, and both attempt to sabotage to other's attempt to rebuild their stiymied careers until Borden unveils a mind-boggling trick called the "Transported Man," and Angier is driven nearly insane trying to discover Borden's methods that may (or may not) involve revolutionary new electrical technology developed by Nikola Tesla (a suprisingly restrained and haunting David Bowie).  The Nolan brothers take this story and send through the gauntlet, using flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks keep their audience just a little off guard and totally unprepared for the final twists that come furiously flying in the film's film's minutes while never losing sight of the slowly deteriorating psyches of their characters.  In other words, they tell their story just as any good magician would perform his trick.  But stick with them.  The film, although sometimes a grueling task to follow, steadily coalesces and amply rewards the careful observer.  Besides, Wally Pfister's cinematography, which finds the right balance of elegance and grittiness, and Lee Smith's rhythmic editing practically draw the audience in.  If "The Prestige" somehow passed you by in theaters, do not let it slip by now.  Watch closely at the on the best films waiting to be discovered.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Never has the world of illusion been as cleverly portrayed as it is in Christopher Nolan's "The Prestige." Much like a real magic show, it's filled with enough twists and turns to render even the most astute observer completely powerless. It's almost as if the film is daring the audience to guess the outcome, knowing full well that they won't even come close. It's manipulation to the extreme, and it makes the film's main question, "Are you watching closely?" all the more absorbing. How interesting that I allowed myself to fall for such trickery, especially since I usually don't like to be tricked. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed being this manipulated by a story; even the well-crafted "The Illusionist" didn't lure me in as deeply.<br /><br />Maybe that's because "The Prestige" takes the illusory aspects one step further, first by telling the story out of sequence, second by including an intense rivalry. Taking place in London between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the plot concerns two magicians: the sly Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and the consumed American Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). They follow a three-act formula used by all magicians. As described by the illusion technician Cutter (Michael Caine), they are as follows: act one is The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two.<br /><br />The problem is that they follow this formula even when they're offstage, with one relying on his showmanship skills to outdo the other. As the film progresses, their antics get increasingly ugly, especially in Angier's case. How did such hostility come into being? It directly relates to Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo), who died as the result of a failed magic trick. Both Angier and Borden were initially employed as audience plants for a magic show, one that included Julia as the magician's assistant. The finale involved her being dropped into a locked water tank with her wrists and ankles tied. The tank was then covered for a short length of time. When the illusion was working successfully, she could slip out of the ropes and free herself. For the audience's perspective, it looked as if she magically transported out of the tank.<br /><br />Her safety depended on the rope itself; in order to escape, a special knot had to be tied, one that would allow for easy loosening. After a while, Borden found that tying the same knot was too predictable; he wanted to tie a knot that looked more complex, as if to say to the crowd that she wouldn't be able to escape as easily. Only he and Julia thought the idea was worth a try, and because of that, we don't know for sure whether or not it was actually attempted. All we do know is that one night something went horribly wrong, and ultimately, Julia drowned in the tank. Even Cutter--who always waited offstage with an axe in case of such an emergency--was too late to save her (too bad CPR didn't exist in those days; there might have been a chance for her).<br /><br />After the accident, the two men go their separate ways and star in their own magic shows. But for Angier, this doesn't mean that he's gotten over the whole mess; from his point of view, Borden is directly responsible for Julia's death. What's worse, Borden has a wife named Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and a daughter named Jess (Samantha Mahurin). Why does he deserve the family that Angier will never have? This ignites a vindictiveness Angier had never known before, a seething, white-hot vindictiveness that drives him into obsession. He's determined to ruin Borden's reputation, first by discovering the secrets to his greatest illusions, then by making them better. The trouble is that Borden refuses to give any of his secrets away; being a magician, he's committed to preserving the mysterious nature of an illusion. This goes double for The Prestige, which is always the most impressive act of a magic show.<br /><br />A series of payback attempts are set into motion, most of which involve one man disguising as a spectator and volunteering during the other man's show. Several tricks are ruined, some people get hurt, and everyone comes away feeling humiliated. Cutter involves himself purely as an effects wizard and manager, rigging Angier up with the latest and greatest magic-making gizmos. But when he appoints a new assistant for Angier--Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson)--the stakes are raised even higher. After an initially harmonious relationship, Angier shows his true nature by ordering her to become Borden's assistant; hopefully, earning the enemy's trust will give her access to valuable information. But it soon becomes clear that she has her own agenda, specifically when it comes to her affair with Borden.<br /><br />And this brings to light a fairly intricate subplot. While Sarah has yet to discover the truth of her husband's infidelity, she's known right from the start that he often behaves differently, despite his constant professions of love. "There are days when you mean it," she says, insinuating that on other days, he's more in love with his magic tricks. It seems that with Borden, it's one evasion after another, with any attempt at personal discussion met with silence and vagueness. "Secrets are my life," he says simply; it's a line that initially seems forgettable but ultimately takes on a wealth of significance. By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand just how important this subplot is.<br /><br />They will also come to understand how deep a hole Angier is digging himself into. He's become aware a new illusion called The Transported Man; the magician enters a door on one side of the stage and immediately exits through another door on the other side of the stage. Borden has been praised for performing this trick, and because of that, Angier just has to learn the secret. And it seems as if he will; Because of Olivia, he now has possession of Borden's coded diary, one that can only be deciphered with a specific keyword (incidentally, Angier is also keeping a diary). This keyword leads Angier back to America, specifically to Colorado. In a remote mountain area, he meets the reclusive Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant, Alley (Andy Serkis), both of whom are working on a top-secret electric device.<br /><br />This device may be the key to upstaging Borden and his Transported Man trick. I'm afraid I can't say how. I'm also afraid I can't say what the device actually does. I can say this: watching it work is both awesome and frightening. A central metal sphere shoots lightening bolts in all directions, all of which gain in intensity when an object is placed in the machine's center. It's both respected and feared, like all new inventions are. But the role it ultimately plays is too important for me to describe, especially since it's part of a trial subplot that's woven throughout the film.<br /><br />How does it all come together? What of Angier, Borden, and Cutter? I shouldn't even be hinting at these questions, for I fear that I've already said too much. Like a live magic show, "The Prestige" depends on secrecy in order to be completely effective. It also depends on your willingness to be fooled; many times I thought I had things figured out, and many times I was proven wrong. Almost every plot point in this film is turned on its head, and they go in directions I never expected them to go in. Maybe the loose structure is partially responsible; if the story does in fact follow the magician's three-act formula, then each act is probably not where it should be. The Prestige may be at the beginning. Then again, it may not be. Are you watching closely?</p></br><a href="../users/AGVWTYW0ULXHT.html">AGVWTYW0ULXHT</a><br/><p>The Prestige works on many levels, as a character study and a depiction of rivalry and revenge, as a period piece that illuminates the ingenuity and sacrifice and risk required to carry off the trickery and deception of stage magic.  It is a very entertaining film, that captivated my attention throughout, was very well acted (especially by Christian Bale) and very well paced.  It is, moreover, a film that does not commit the usual crime of Hollywood films of dumbing things down for its audience.  Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who obviously respects his audience, expects them to be capable of piecing things together, and doesn't lay everything out.  (A recent film that is guilty of this sin is "Lucky Number Slevin" which was very entertaining but would have been much more interesting if the directors didn't feel the need to explain everything that anyone who had been paying attention would have already gotten, in great detail in the concluding scenes).  Most interesting, I think, is the ending of the film, an ending many other reviewers take to have been a kind of fraud or cop out.  As I read the film, the director uses this ending very deliberately to call attention to his own manipulation of audience expectations in the preceding parts of the film.  While the methods of the "magic" in the end evoke horror and disgust, they in fact serve only as a grotesque mirror of the sacrifice required by the trickery that is depicted throughout.  In hindsight, the ending can be seen to be prefigured by a very early scene in which we see how a bird is made to disappear and reappear.  We accept and admire the skill and sacrifice and risk of the artists to a point -- but only when we have the security that in the end none of it is real.  We want to suspend disbelief, but would be horrified if we truly believed.  At some level, I think this functions as an intriguing reflection on what audiences want in film: we tend to want what we see to be as realistic as possible without crossing a line to make us believe it is really real -- brutal and bloody depictions of gratuitous violence are okay, and the more lifelike the better, but images of actual violence drawn from contemporary wars generate outrage.  A film that can simultaneously do the job of being slick and entertaining, and at the same time raise intriguing and profound questions about the nature of entertainment, and of audience expectations, and of the relation between image and reality is definitely worth a look.  I know I'll be seeing it again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I have seen about 50 or more movies this year and I have to say I enjoyed The Prestige the most.

It also features a climax in which it changes from one type of movie to another. Whether this type of cross-genre transformation is a good thing seems to be very much a matter of personal opinion; some like it, some don't.<br /><br />The film is set in late Victorian England and is appropriately gloomy (I wonder if everything really was as monotone as it is always portrayed in stories about that era?). Two illusionists are battling each other to be acclaimed as the best magicians of their time. The story follows the efforts of each to outdo the other. The rivalry is not only heightened but becomes bitter when personal tragedy intervenes. One develops a trick that the other simply can't match, until.......<br /><br />And here's where the story shifts. I'm not going to give it away, but suffice it to say that the battle is won and lost by unconventional means. Does the story work? Yes, it does. Is the transformation fair? That depends on your point of view. On the whole, I tend to think it's cheating, but then stage magic is cheating anyway, because it isn't really magic.<br /><br />Watch for yourself and make up your mind.

"The Prestige", firmly ensconced on my "Top Five Favorite Films of All-Time" list, is one of those film experiences.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "The Prestige" sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act.  Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness.  Gorgeous assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) & stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) are also involved with both magicians.<br /><br />This film is an all-time great primarily because of its tremendous plot.  I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject--magic--with which to tell this incredible story.  In terms of overall storytelling, this may just be one of the greatest ever told.<br /><br />The acting is also superb, with Bale & Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Johansson stunning in her role as well.  Caine provides a moral character to the show, while also doing a voice-over that rivals even the great Morgan Freeman.  Even all the auxiliary roles in this one are perfectly cast.<br /><br />Basically, "The Prestige" is a movie that simply needs to be watched by all.

They sabotage each other's performances, steal secrets, ping pong the beautiful assistant Olivia between them as a lover-spy, and contrive every and any advantage over the other. They intend to destroy one another, and one of them succeeds. The film gets its name from the third part of every magic trick. After the "pledge" to do something outrageous and the "turn" of events, the "prestige" is "the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."

Michael Caine does his usual splendid job of subtly stealing every scene that he's in from the two leads and David Bowie makes a beautifully underplayed cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>A feud between between two magicians and the aid of the magician's assistants seem to light up to a Tesla spark.<br />If you like historical drama with an element of horror and drama,<br />you might like this film.<br />It has a sci fi twist involving Tesla's wireless power transmission scheme<br />that was passed on  at the beginning of the last century.<br />I enjoyed the movie, but think that it made too much of magic trick secrets.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OS2HX2CWQIC7.html">A1OS2HX2CWQIC7</a><br/><p>I've not much to type of Christoper Nolan's finest accomplishment that hasn't been stated before. At this juncture, it wouldn't be unfair for the Nolans to abandon non-linear plotting; they've exploited the conceit so thoroughly here in conjunction with numerous interrelated visual metaphors in order to fully explore a variety of Victorian themes: the thrill of technology-driven entrepreneurship during the onset of modernity, science as magic explained and the nature of dualistic identity, among others.<br /><br />This DVD's menu design - typeface, colors, animation, etc. - assumes a distinctly Victorian style. The main menu features a spinning picture that frames one of four sets of images based on the most prominent magic tricks in the film; the displayed picture can be selected from a set of icons beneath the menu options.<br /><br />I saw The Prestige once in theater, though I would have gladly attended another screening or two, had I an opportunity to do so. The theatrical soundtrack irked me for the same reasons why this disc's 5.1 Dolby Digital track does: certain sound effects and swells in passages of the score are deafeningly loud, while much of the narrative dialogue is nearly inaudible. Some difficulty is suffered to tweak EQ in order to facilitate this mix. French and Spanish dubbed dialogue tracks are quite good here, as are English, French and Spanish subtitles. As I expected, the picture is impeccable; anything less would be an offensive treatment of Wally Pfister's beautiful photography.<br /><br />The disc's picture gallery contains images of photos shot on set during and between takes, many of which focus on the production's lavish costumes and sets. Other selections include publicity shots and the painted advertisement posters seen in the movie.<br /><br />Nolan opted not to record a commentary track for The Prestige, concerned that such a feature might diminish the mystique of its proceedings. Instead, a nineteen-minute documentary featurette is included here, consisting of interviews with the principal cast and crew in addition to quite a lot of behind-the-scenes footage.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>I saw "The Prestige" last night, having already read the book. Although, I already knew the details of the plot, that it was the story of two rival magicians in 19th Century London, and the secrets of each of their magic tricks, I still found this film to be well worth watching. In fact, I found the film to be an improvement on the book, as the film leaves the main plot twists to the final scene, whereas the book reveals them earlier.<br /><br />Although, I am not a big fan of Christopher Nolan (I hated what he did to "Insomnia"), I think he did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. It is well paced and although Nolan reveals enough to solve the riddles of the film, nothing is blatently obvious. As usual, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Cain also turn in excellent performances (when I read the book, I wondered if Nolan had been correct to cast Bale as Bowden and Jackman as Angier - I thought it might have been better the other way around - but after seeing the film, I think he got it right).<br /><br />This movie is well worth watching, and if you haven't read the book, it is probably worth watching twice, just to see what you missed the first time around.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.5 stars.<br /><br />Looks good, full of solid acting, interesting story, but it gets a little convoluted, and the plot becomes somewhat oblique.<br />Caine has been ubiquitous for so many years now, but you've gotta hand it to him, he's still pretty good.<br />Worth watching if you like period pieces/mysteries.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan just seems to go from strength to strength. The Prestige may have inexplicably missed out on a screen writing nomination at the Oscars, but it's one of the best screen adaptations in years, its excellent and ingenious script displaying confidence both in its potentially outrageous material and its audiences' intelligence, hiding all the answers in plain sight from the very first shot. Even the dialogue pulls off the triple feat of being rich with double meanings which repay repeat viewing, right for each scene it appears in and, far from being clever just for the sake of it, naturally furthering the plot and the characters in entertaining and intriguing ways. But then, half the trick is making it look effortless (although in an inversion of that, both the film's on screen magicians are so accomplished they have to make their illusions look harder than they are to get the audience's approval).<br /><br />Either deceptively elaborate or deceptively simple (either definition applies, and each in their most positive sense), Christopher Nolan's tale of duelling magicians manages to be both highly entertaining and surprisingly dark: this isn't a war of words, but one where people get hurt, fingers get lost, people die. The film is full of mirroring and doubling, so it's not surprising that the magicians' feud mirrored by Nikola Tesla's equally dangerous feud with Thomas Edison over the electricity that may or may not be the key to the mystery - if there even is a mystery.<br /><br />Magic is the perfect metaphor for both storytelling and movie-making - in a way the film could almost be an allegory about why movie buffs usually make the worst movies. Each protagonist is an incomplete man in every sense of the word. Bale has the genius but not the ability to sell his illusions to an audience. Jackman has the showmanship but not the originality to create a truly great trick. In the middle is Michael Caine's ingeneur, the backstage genius with the surprisingly unconvincing cockney accent (too many years of high living, Michael?), caught somewhere between director and ghost writer in the scheme of things.<br /><br />Not that it's without flaws. It is perhaps too easy to guess Bale's big personal secret simply by the manner Nolan chooses to shoot certain shots, although there are more than enough twists not for it to matter too much if you don't get them all. And, in another part that shows up Scarlet Johannson's weaknesses as an actress, the nominal leading lady is effortlessly outshone by Rebecca Hall and, yes, Piper Perabo in smaller roles. Still, Nolan does manage to pull off the amazing feat of getting an excellent performance out of David Bowie, through the obvious-now-you-think-about-it technique of focussing on the singer's voice as much as his natural presence.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a film that could be about everything or about absolutely nothing, one that is either led entirely by plot contrivances or one where the themes and storytelling dictate the characters' actions far more than credibility, and where the biggest trick is that ultimately there is no trick. All interpretations seem equally valid, which is part of the fun. And best of all, it's a delight to watch.<br /><br />The DVD extras are, for once on a Nolan film, disappointingly mundane, but it's worth picking up for the film itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>In 2006, so many duplicate movies came out. Two war movies, two film-noir movies, a virtual remake of a 2005 biopic, and two magician movies. The first was "The Illusionist" a great looking film, with some good stars and a hypnotic lead played by Edward Norton. It also had an actress, Jessica Biel, who isn't respected by many as an actress but ended up delivering a great performance. "The Prestige" also looks great, has a talent-laden cast, a very talented director,<br /><br />great set design and special effects, and an actress named Scarlett Johansson, who gives a very good performance despite being dissed every time she shows up in a movie. Also, both films have twist endings that a lot of people say are implausible but are never bothered me. "The Prestige" is directed by Christopher Nolan, the talented director behind Memento, Batman Begins, and Insomnia. It's co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the story that inspired Christopher's script for "Memento." The movie stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Johansson, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie, all of whom are talented and underrated actors with the exception of Caine (who is very talented and not underrated at all). Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. As the film opens, Angier is performing a very dangerous trick. Borden, hiding incognito in the audience, manages to sneak backstage and watches as Angier falls through a trap door into a tank filled with water and drowns. Borden is accused of putting the tank there and is convicted of Angier's murder. As Borden sits in jail awaiting his hanging, he begins reading Angier's diary. Angier and Borden had begun as friends and partners in a magic show. Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) was also in the show as the girl who has her wrists tied is dipped into a tank of water as a curtain falls over it. When the curtain is removed, the girl is free. Problem is, Borden ties a faulty knot which results in her death. Now Angier and Borden are bitter enemies, who will stop at nothing to learn each other's secrets and top each other in everything. Then one night Angier catches one of Borden's shows and sees the greatest trick he has ever seen. Desperate to find out the secret, Angier sends his assistant (Johansson) to spy on him. And later, he seeks the help of a scientist (Bowie) to help him design a similar trick that will top Borden's. Caine plays mentors and friends both the men. Both Jackman and Bale are so great in their performances and are really fascinating to watch. Caine, Bowie, and Serkis (as Bowie's assistant) turn in great supporting performances. Johansson and Perabo aren't really considered fine actresses, but both are really good here. Although if I had a nickel for every time I've heard someone criticize Johansson's English accent, I'd be a rich man. A lot of people also criticize the ending, many say it's implausible. Not implausible, just not very likely. But this is a fictional film that frequently reminds you to pay attention. Watching the movie the 2nd time, it makes a lot more sense. "The Prestige" is one of the best films of 2006 in the sense that it's one of the best-produced films of the year. It's incredibly entertaining, great to look at, and is more likely to appeal to a broader audience than the typical "best film of the year" selection. I'm not sure how many people will like it as much as me, but I'm sure, at least, that you won't regret watching it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>The Prestige is an interesting film, buoyed more by the stars than the script.  I really enjoyed it; have viewed it several times, but I come away from the movie feeling like I've experienced a slight of hand, just like the magic they perform.  The wonderful, enduring Michael Caine - always a favourite who could lure me into watching him read a phone book -- gives a strong performance, as usual, as the magical engineer behind Hugh Jackman's Rufus Angier.  Jackman's beautiful, wonderful, so the movie's success rest heavily on his performance, and he does well in the lead.  Christian Bale as his rival is rather flat, but that could be the script more than his acting as Alfred Borden (but then, I always think this about his performances!).  And the White Lord Ziggy, David Bowie, puts in a guest spot that is interesting, but again a bit of waste of his talent.  Even a cameo from Daniel Davis.<br /><br />The movie centres around Jackman's Angier and Bale's Border.  Angier is the master showman.  He has the beauty and grace to set up a trick, which is more than half of it's success.  Border is more the thinking man's magician.  He can figure out his own tricks, but is lousy at presenting them, until rivalry pushes both men into obsession.  They were once friends, but after the death of Jackman's wife in the water tank trick, they became enemies, each trying to out do the other, and taking it way past a rivalry, unto nothing else really matters to them.  They lose friends, lovers, and ultimately rush to destruction - of themselves and each other.<br /><br />Very interesting film, one worth watching again.  But I still fill like the whole film is one big trick, just like the magic they perform.  Misdirection - great cast, beautifully filmed, but covering up what they don't want you too see, that it's a bit more flash than substance.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>This is a movie about revenge.  Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are two magicians who work together.  When one of them loses a loved one during a performance, the other pursues a lifetime of vengeance.  Back and forth it goes, with the only suspense being who is going to get the last word (or revenge) and destroy the other.  This unrelenting process takes up most of the movie and is really overdone in my estimation.  The  movie is dark, (both the theme and the cinematography) and is pretty despresssing.  My husband and I both enjoyed "The Illusionist" much more that this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A19OQ7LWE2YJL3.html">A19OQ7LWE2YJL3</a><br/><p>A unique movie worth watching twice.<br /><br />You do need to pay attention, especially in the beginning to understand what's going on.

I saw The Illusionist in the theater and totally loved it.  I just saw The Prestige now, having borrowed it from the public library.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.<br /><br />The cast is first rate.  Any film that features Michael Caine and David Bowie is probably worth seeing.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both very good.  The performances kept me watching.<br /><br />The inclusion of Nichola Tesla and his battle with Thomas Edison was interesting and one could say that their rivalry mirrored that of the two magicians here.  What bothered me most was the ending.  It was a cheap trick and it spoiled the whole movie for me.  What a contrast with the inspired ending of The Illusionist.<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Prestige is about hate; The Illusionist is about love!</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>The Prestige is a movie in which my review cannot do justice.  The movie advertises itself as one with twist after twist and one at the end you will not believe.  Christopher Nolan directed this movie, Batman Begins and also Memento, one of the best "twist" movies ever.<br /><br />The Prestige has a great cast:  Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johnassen and Michael Caine.  All do exceptional work in this movie set in the early 1900s.  Jackman and Bale are both magicians and bitter rivals.  The two spend the movie trying to find the secrets to the other's tricks, deceiving each other professionally and personally.<br /><br />This movie is enjoyable because of its great cast, beautiful scenery, and exciting riveting plot.  On the downside, there are no good guys.  Moments after the film, I found myself questioning why I rooted for the character I did.  Was the good guy really good?  Was the bad guy really bad?  While this movie gives you a lot to ponder, I didn't feel a huge stake in the outcome and thus wasn't blown away by the conclusion.  This is still a movie you must see and one of the better movies out right now.<br /><br />I suggest you stop reading reviews now and try not to read anything about this movie to prevent you learning its secrets.  I believe that after you see the movie once, you'll want to see it again.  There are so many scenes that can be viewed differently once you know the truth.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>With Christopher Nolan directing, the acting skills of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, David Bowie (yes, the singer), and the lovely Scarlett Johansson, you can't go wrong. Even Gollum (Andy Serkis) himself shows up. Not to mention the outstanding sets, costumes, plot, and dialogue throughout the picture. While I did like The Illusionist, The Prestige has it beat in every category but the musical score. The whole theater I saw it with seemed very happy when the movie was over. They didn't stop saying "WOW" every couple of minutes towards the end of the film. The twists keep coming. If you haven't seen this film yet, get going as soon as you finish this sentence.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>If you are a fan of Steam Punk (Verne-Wells Victorian Sci-Fi, "The Wild, Wild, West"), or love the edgier episodes of "The Twilight Zone," then you will love the movie.<br /><br />It is essentially a psychodrama about a rivalry and obsession that goes out of control.  The distinct difference is that this is a Steam Punk Victorian Era, which is only revealed at the end of the movie, and various Christophers associated with this project (writer, director) used the rivalry of magicians as the friction-point.<br /><br />About one-third of the way through, my heart was broken because I could tell there were no heroes in the move. This is a credit to all involved, since it illustrates the point that obsession, rivalry, and revenge are like an oil slick: everyone is left greasy and dirty.  Even the mentors who should have known better are dingy.<br /><br />Additionally, the non-linear flashback/flash forward added to the theme.  What we see is one odd lump of humanity. Again, this lumpiness reminds us of the sad results of obsession, rivalry, and revenge.<br /><br />I do have one criticism.  Tesla was portrayed as being cautious toward science.  This is inaccurate.  Even at this stage in his life, he still had a burning passion for science. His autobiography begins with these words, "The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements."<br /><br />Read "Tesla: Man Out Of Time" for a more accurate description of the Wizard of Colorado Springs.<br /><br />Note: The ending almost left with a feeling of deus ex machine, but after reviewing this film--it is shuffled like "Citizen Kane"--I realized there were enough clues and proper set up for the semi-surprise ending.<br /><br />PS--and yes, seeing Wolverine, Batman, Gollum, and Ziggy Stardust in one film makes it worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>This is high quality film that will keep you guessing right to the very last few minutes. The Prestige is a reference to the 3rd part of a magicians trick. I.e. having made the bird and cage disappear (the 2nd part) the bird then reappears.<br /><br />Two magicians are close friends but because of a tragedy become bitter enemies. Unlike a previous reviewer I thought Christian Bales cockney accent was very convincing and Hugh Jackman without his Wolverine makeup is only just recognisable. Both lead actors are excellent and the supporting cast are good as well. David Bowie has an important cameo role in the film, on which the main plot hinges.<br /><br />The plot is quite complicated to follow in places, so you do have to concentrate, as various sequences move backward or forward in time. OK you can't take it seriously, but there is an edgy atmosphere to the whole thing that kept me rivited to the screen. You shouldn't be to surprised at this though as the director is Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento) whose films, have to date proved to be of a consistently high standard.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>The Prestige is a period piece fantasy made into something resembling reality.  At its heart it relies on a device from science fiction, a machine that transports people and objects by replicating them.  How such a device might work is beside the intent of the movie.  And that's okay.  Movie goers accept premises and then follow the action without any need to examine the premise further.  However I think that director Christopher Nolan might have looked more closely at the consequences of his premise.  Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far-fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination.  But what to do with the replications?  Nolan's solution: kill them off.  In fact kill off the original and keep the replication.<br /><br />Now if you are magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) and you know that you are about to die, and in fact in a most unpleasant way by drowning, I think you might be a little hesitant to perform the trick, even though a replication of you will come to life and live on.  Note that both the replication and the original Angier would want to live and prefer that the other be the one to die.<br /><br />Nolan thought about this and that is why one is forced to die.  Nolan probably would have himself preferred to keep the original and do away with the duplicate, but then the trick wouldn't work properly since the original would still be in place and not moved at all.<br /><br />This is an old theme in science fiction and Nolan does not attempt to improve on it.  And again that's okay.  But another problem with the way the premise is handled is that, although surely Angier would want to go one up on his nemesis, fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and dazzle the world with this amazing trick, he might have at some point just replicated some pound notes or some bullion.  If Borden had gotten hold of the machine, maybe he could have replicated Scarlett Johansson so that he and Fallon could have one each for themselves.  (And one for me would be nice as well.)  Or he could have replicated his beloved daughter.<br /><br />What I am pointing to is the irony in the way the machine was used as a vehicle for a magic trick.  The trick as performed is so much less amazing than the real magic that could have been displayed, that of replicating enormously complex objects like human beings.  Nobody in the film seems to realize this.  This is perhaps the major--shall we say--plot cheesiness.  Another, as pointed out elsewhere, is that the question Angier asks of Borden, "Which knot did you use?" The question is bogus as is his answer, "I don't know," since Julia was still tied and the knot could be seen.  Also there is the question of what to do with all those bodies being created?  We see them near the end of the film in the water boxes.  Seems a bit of a stretch to make all those new boxes and just leave the bodies there.  Somebody might call the bobbies, don't you think?<br /><br />For these reasons I am beginning to wonder if Nolan is getting a little careless or if he has been corrupted by success to the point where he no longer cares about logical consistency and artistic rigor.  Perhaps we'll see in his next opus.  However scheduled for release next year is The Dark Knight another Batman caper starring Christian Bale.<br /><br />Putting all this aside, the movie is entertaining and thought provoking.  Nolan's time-stirred delineation of the plot is done well and kept this viewer interested.  I also liked the razor sharp  psychological tension created between Borden and Angier as they compete against each other.  And the many surprising plot twists and turns--something that Nolan does very well--were nice.<br /><br />And the cast was excellent.  Michael Caine who plays the old magician and front man Cutter was perfect, and the glimpse or two we get of Scarlett Johansson was more than agreeable.  Bale and Jackson were very good as well.  But I especially liked Rebecca Hall who played Borden's wife Sarah.  I thought she was outstanding.<br /><br />Now that Christopher Nolan has had back to back commercial successes with Batman Begins (2005), and The Prestige (2006), maybe it's time to think about where his career is going.  Is he going to become a film maker known for his artistry like Stanley Kubrick or a film maker who knows how to appeal to the marketplace like Steven Spielberg?  On the one hand there are Nolan's artistic films, Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002) and on the other hand there are his big screen commercial successes, this film and Batman Begins.  Knowing the constraints placed on film makers by the need to get funding and to turn a profit, it may be that he is trying to be both.  In fact perhaps the best way to look at The Prestige and Batman Begins is to recognize that they are artistic films made within industry constraints that require mass market appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>NOTE: If you're wondering whether the Blu Ray purchase is a worthy one over the DVD, it is.  The picture quality is consistenly completely smooth with a wonderful sense of depth that really shines through.  The audio, meanwhile, is subdued but wonderfully so.  The uncompressed surround is terrific.  Now that the tech specs are out of the way, onto the bulk:<br /><br />Ever since Christopher Nolan's little seen movie entitled Following, I knew we had a director worth keeping an eye on.  Following that up with Memento was perfection and then there was the oft overlooked Insomnia.  Then, he reinvented the Batman saga.  However, scrunched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was this little movie about magic, named The Prestige.  Actually, it wasn't really about magic.  It's about obsession, misdirection and mysterious plot twists...pretty much par for the course.<br /><br />Nolan has crafted a fine story that runs like a trainwreck.  From the first death in the film, you know that things can't end happily.  At every corner, each magician tries to top the other, but neither is strong enough to know when to stop.  And what happens when someone has a trick that is utterly impossible to pull off?  How do you top it?  By doing the unimaginable.<br /><br />And it's the unimaginable that will either make you love or loathe this film.<br /><br />When I saw The Prestige in the theatres back in 2006, I left feeling a little bit cheated.  After a pitch perfect first two acts, in which Jackman's Angier and Bale's Borden continued to try and upstage/get back at each other, Christopher Nolan (and brother Jonathan) threw an utter curveball that seemd to not only stretch my belief in what I was watching but completely seemed out of place.  I thought about the movie for a long time and decided that I ultimately didn't like it.<br /><br />The other day, it was playing on a movie channel and I managed to catch it just as the opening credits were running.  "I'll just watch a little bit of it," I thought and ended up staying for the entire runtime.  I bring this up because what I find so thrilling and interesting about The Nolans is just how well-constructed (to a fault) their movies are.  The continual moving back and forth in time is nothing new to them (Following, Memento), but the way it's constructed, perfectly, as the three acts of a magic trick is pure...well, magic.<br /><br />And watching through it a second time illuminated just how early they set up the events.  The twisting third act no longer seemed utterly incredulous (only just semi-incredulous).  The other not-so-out-there twist seemed incredily "duh!" but what was perfectly appropriate was simply how well a fairly obvious answer is hidden in plain sight and yet, not seen.<br /><br />In the end, the final lines speak volumes:  "Now you're looking for the secret. But you wont find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be...fooled."</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale), along with Rupert's wife, Julia (Perabo), are assistants to a magician at the turn of the twentieth century.  Alfred causes a trick to go wrong, and Julia dies.  Rupert blames Alfred, and the friends become enemies.  They not only attempt to out-do each other on stage, but also attempt to actively sabotage and hurt each other.  Soon, Rupert is off to Colorado Springs to meet with Nikola Tesla (Bowie).  Tesla has created an integral part of Alfred's show, and Rupert is determined to get a similar device and top Alfred once again.<br /><br />The story is told with three storylines, alternating between the three.  Parts of one storyline that make no sense at first become clear as the other storylines progress.  Even the murder at the very beginning is not what it seems.  Christopher Nolan has once again constructed a fascinating tale, this time of obsession and the price that people pay for their obsessions.  The cast is solid all around.  Bale and Jackman, as the leads, own their roles and breathe life into their respective characters.  Michael Caine, as their assistant, steals just about every scene he is in.  Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as the love interests both do credible jobs.  And finally, David Bowie makes Tesla into a memorable character.  This is a great, entertaining movie.  Christopher Nolan has quickly proved himself to be a great director.  "The Prestige" helps to solidify that.  I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be "dark" and "twisted." Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.<br /><br />Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.<br /><br />Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.<br /><br />The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails "getting one's hands dirty." Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.<br /><br />Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.<br /><br />The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.<br /><br />Many may be able to figure out "the big secret" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>We watched the movie last night and had problems from the beginning understanding the dialogue. The surround ambient noise level was high enough that it was difficult to impossible to hear what they were saying. Words are important in this movie and if they're that hard to understand then the movie is missing the mark. From what we could determine it seemed to have an interesting story and the acting we were able to hear and see seemed good.<br /><br />My system and its speakers are balanced to within 1/2 decibel so I can say the problem was not with my system; that means to me the audio mix was out of balance making it difficult to understand what was being said. It's hard to imagine something like that happening but our inability to hear the words suggested the problem was indeed a real one.<br /><br />In addition the movie seemed choppy, jumping around from scene to scene in a rather abrupt manner and making it difficult to follow the story. The combination of just those two elements made the movie simply not worth watching and we stopped watching it about half way through.<br /><br />I see many favorable reviews and truly wished we could have enjoyed it too. I suggest you rent this one before you buy and see how it plays out on your system first.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>The Prestige (2006)<br />Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 130 minutes<br />Directed by Christopher Nolan<br />Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie<br /><br />Christopher Nolan takes chances in an industry which usually plays it safe. The Dark Knight was so much more than a comic book adaptation and Inception was not a typical blockbuster. These stories had mass appeal, but Nolan treated his audiences with respect. Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.<br /><br />If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).<br /><br />The whole film plays out like a magic trick.<br /><br />The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.<br /><br />The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.<br /><br />Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.<br /><br />In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.<br /><br />I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.<br /><br />Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Good film for those with patience, twists and turns and then a curveball ,The movie is never lacking in suspense.

I disagree. The Prestige may have more 'meat' on it, but The Ilusionist was far more enjoyable and had a better flow. However, The Prestige is also a far darker film. And the actors attached this this were all a great sight to behold. Hugh Jackman is a man obsessed. He is looking for the perfect trick and is insanely jealous that his former friend and partner has accomplished one. He becomes obsessed in discovering Christian Bale's secret. And the discovery, though intriguing, isn't really that surprising. However, it gets a whole lot confusing after Jackman's character discovers what he thinks is the perfect way to accomplish the ultimate trick of tricks. In fact, its borderline Sci-fi. There are no spoilers here, but I would certainly say that this movie needs to be watched more than once to be fully understood. But it is definitely worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EZHMGGWY74HY.html">A3EZHMGGWY74HY</a><br/><p>This movie is a must see. Acting was sensational...storyline interesting, quite different from what's out there now.  Held your attention and also threw some unpredicted things at you during the end...I like a movie that can do that...I like to be shocked.  I don't like to know exactly what's going on through the entire film.  Some films can be so predictable, but not this one.  If you are looking for an edge of your seat, intelligent movie, this one is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I don't know why my expectations for The Prestige were set for an average movie. Must've been something that I read. In contradiction to whatever it was that set my expectations low, I will set yours relatively high.<br /><br />Oh...wait....That's exactly how I started my review for The Illusionist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a> earlier this year. But the intro does indeed work with The Prestige too.<br /><br />My low expectations were because The Prestige and The Illusionist were released right around the same time, and I therefore at the time had a case of Magician-Movie-Overload. Regardless, I'm glad I opted to spend the time with both, because both were thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />A lot of the tricks in The Illusionist are movie magic...in fact most are movie magic and could only be done as so. But the tricks in The Prestige are much more feasibly tricks that could actually be pulled of by a turn of the century magician (with the exception of the machine that was being built by The Prestige's mad scientist David Bowie).<br /><br />Don't expect to go into The Prestige and be truly amazed by wizardry. The Prestige is more the story of rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale), and which one can deliver the ultimate trick before the rival interferes. But--make no mistake--the tricks are a very fun part of the movie, as are the diabolical ways in which each rival gets in the way of the other.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs. The Prestige is not quite the action-packed, super-hero adventure that Nolan's last outing was ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> ), but The Prestige delivers its monies worth.<br /><br />My recommendation is to see for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The "magic tricks" themselves featured in "The Prestige" may not impress you much - some of you can detect them before the ending, I think - but don't worry, because the real magic of "The Prestige" is the seamless storytelling of Christopher Nolan, who tells the engaging story of two rival magicians of the turn-of-the-century London, Borden and Angier, using Nolan's trademark, non-linear timeline. Supported by the wonderful cast from England and America, "The Prestige" is a dazzlingly entertaining film full of twists and turns.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are perfectly cast as Borden and Angier, formerly friends and assistants to a lesser-talented magician. But they become long-time rivals after a disastrous accident on the stage, and both illusionists are willing to sacrifice everything, one for craft, the other for showmanship.<br /><br />This is how I would describe the world of "The Prestige," but the simple truth is the film itself is magic, or illusion, of very entertaining kind, which makes us keep guessing "What next?" with a blend of real history and total fantasy. See the character of Nicola Tesla, real-life revolutionary inventor, played by delightfully eccentric David Bowie, and you know what I mean. On the opposite side of him lives a contraption inventor Cutter, played by Michael Caine, whose humanity makes a great contrast to two star magicians.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film is not perfect. Like "Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan still does not know how to create credible female characters in spite of the impressive cast. Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo appear as supports, but their roles are relegated to the second fiddle.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is not exactly about the magic itself; some part of it involves sci-fi elements that even David Copperfield cannot or wouldn't use. The film is more about the rivalry between two magicians, which result in passion and obsession hidden under the spectacular stage tricks. As such "The Prestige" is successful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>The story is an interesting one with a few twists. What we have is a mystery done in a story of two magicians having a petty argument. All the clues are there. The question is can you figure out all the answers?  I confess that I only found out part of it.<br /><br />The acting is good as is the filming.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>This movie has certainly captured the art of magic, its complexities and wonder. As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling. The characters are rich--they really have something to evoke every audience. They have great motive... and that's what the viewers need-- a reason to stay on the journey of the characters. This fact will put you to the edge until the cessation.<br /><br />What I really liked about the film is that it was presented as such a normal, ordinary plot, just like any other movie in a periodic setting. Furthermore, the director presented the theme-envy, obsession, and deceit, in the coolest way to present these things--subtle! This film exposes one of the best "rivalry" stories I have seen for some time. I'd have to give it a thousand claps and hands up! As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier. A real surprise for me was Hugh Jackman. I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought. Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.<br /><br />"The Prestige" tells nothing about benevolence. Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self-preservation. And yes, the director may have over-sensationalized the theme for some (But I think he presented it as subtle as he could). The thing here is that the decisions made by the director works for the advantage of the film. Why would I feel bad if there is not one character who conveyed a positive disposition? The nature of the characters reflects human nature--and as long as a character does that--it is REAL. We should not be looking for a benign protagonist here--besides, that's getting old. Films that project non contrast between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights. They are laying off the archetypes, the formulaic sense that's been going' on in the film industry for the past 10 years, which should be the case now in the 21st century film-making. At least this movie tried, and as far as I know, succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>What a treat it must have been for the ladies: two magicians, each trying to outdo the other, and both far too good looking and well built for their own good. Yes, a good time to be alive.<br /><br />Bale's and Goodman's characters (Borden and Angier, respectively) were not nice men. There was no one to root for in the film, and as good as it was, that might have been one of the reasons it didn't do as well at the box office as the filmmakers would have liked. But it made for a more realistic story, and for that, they get high marks.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it is a story of one-upmanship. Each magician is desperate to outdo the other, and will do whatever it takes. When Borden develops a trick unlike any other, The Transporting Man, Angier will stop at nothing to learn the secret.<br /><br />The plot meanders a bit, and the ending doesn't feel organic, but it still makes for excellent cinema. Just don't expect to have your villains laid out for you. You'll have to make those decisions yourself.<br /><br />It seems I'm saying this a lot these days... 4? rounded up to 5</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>`The Prestige' is an intriguing magician story that provides a spine-tingling movie experience as the film moves along.  Ably acted by key players and directed with finesse by `Memento' and `Batman Begins' director, Christopher Nolan, the film builds up a nasty rivalry amongst magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).  They start out as understudies for senior magician, Cutter (Michael Caine), and practice by being the staged volunteers for certain magic tricks.  Tragedy comes one day when Alfred works out an alternative knot to tie assistant, Julia Angier (Piper Perato), Robert's wife, for a Houdini-like trick, being tied inside a water tank for a staged escape.  It goes all wrong, and it is unclear if Alfred tied her in an inescapable knot.  He can't remember which knot he made, which provides a haunting cast of suspicion and doubt.  She dies, leaving Robert heartbroken, but her loss brings a constant trail of revenge and counter-revenge as both players play tricks on one another, breaking one another's secrets and limbs.  Robert and Alfred take their rivalry on stage where each tries to outdo one another.  Robert replaces his assistant and wife with a mistress, Olivia Wenscombe(Scarlett Johansson), who is not enough consolation, but her own bitterness provides a tie with his rival, Alfred, with results that seem sleight-of-hand.<br /><br />`The Prestige' becomes a taut and impressive display of tricks played on the stage and with the audience.  There is also a historical rivalry between the brilliant eccentric inventor, Tesla (David Bowie), and Thomas Edison that gives the whole affair more depth and meaning.  The suspense, as with any magic show, is impressive as is some of the delivery.  `The Prestige' is expert at making one guess what will happen next. With plenty of steps and a few missteps, `The Prestige' offers a dark, but delightful show, even if some of the magic is too unbelievable even when seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as two young late 1890's magicians vying for preeminence on the London stage in the superb period piece, "The Prestige".  Director Christopher Nolan skillfully directs his cast through a fascinating plot abounding with unpredictable twists which he and his brother Jonathan collaborated on.  The artfully designed sets accurately represented Victorian England.<br /><br />Bale playing Alfred Borden and Jackman playing Robert Angier were friends and associates working under a popular magician of the time and also working on their own routines.  A mishap during a water escape trick performed by Jackman's wife Julia played by Piper Perabo caused her unfortunate drowning.  Allegedly Bale had tied a knot around her wrists that she was unable to undo.  Jackman blamed Bale and would seek vengeance.<br /><br />As they launched their careers each man would attempt to sabotage the efforts of the other.  This culminated in the loss of two of Bale's fingers during a bullet catching trick hampered by Jackman.  Bale, however, the superior magician, persevered and found immense fame with his unprecedented trick "The Transported Man".  Jackman tried to copy the ruse but could never perform it as well.  He became obsessed with stealing Bale's diary which would reveal the details of the trick.  Using his alluring assistant Olivia played by Scarlett Johansson, he tried to pilfer Bale's secrets.  His plans were thwarted as Johansson and Bale became lovers.<br /><br />Jackman finally coerced Bale into revealing that eminent physicist Nikola Tesla played by an intense, fearsome looking David Bowie, had invented a machine which juxtaposed science and magic and was the key to "Ther Transporting Man" illusion.  Michael Caine playing Cutter, the architect of Jackman's illusions, had his doubts.  Jackman nonetheless made his way to Tesla's lab in Colorado Springs, no easy feat at that time travelling from Europe.<br /><br />Jackman investerd hoardes of money into Tesla's creation to top the efforts of Bale.  Their cutthroat competition caused hardship for both men as the film concludes in an incalculable finale that concudes the flick on a soaring high note.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>At the beginning of the movie we learn that magicians view their tricks as three act plays, The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.  This movie is also presented in this way.  We learn about two young apprentice magicians who are friends.  Both live in poor circumstances, but they have very different characters.  Christian Bale plays Alfred Bordon, who is the more talented of the two, but is hurt as a magician because of his misanthropic personality.  He is less charismatic and less able to connect with the audience than the more flamboyant Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman.<br /><br />The story is not told lienearly and doesn't explain much about when we are jumping forward and backwards.  It more or less unfolds in its own way and you pick up bits and pieces and try to add them to what you have been told.  The point being is that you are never sure if you have stuck this new bit of info in the right place or are even seeing it the right way.<br /><br />Something goes horribly wrong during one dangerous trick and this sets off a more than bitter rivalry between the two men.  Of course, as things escalate between the two there are bystanders taken into the vortex of their attempts at mutual professional (and physical) destruction.<br /><br />David Bowie does a very interesting turn as Nikola Tesla, who really did live in Colorado Springs at the time the movie is set, and did have a huge magnifying transmitter in his laboratory that is also shown in the movie.  A powerful visual image.  How he becomes involved in the lives of the protagonists, I will leave to the movie to explain to you.<br /><br />Even if you think you have figured out the main punch line of the movie, the actual Prestige of the final act is not likely be what you think it is.  In fact, it has multiple layers.<br /><br />Enjoy it.  Fine performances are given throughout, especially by the women drawn into their lives to their eventual sorrow.  They are Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Scarlett Johansson.  And of course, Michael Caine is the anchor of the whole thing and plays his role with perfection.<br /><br />I recommend it very much.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>This was a more than decent big budget Hollywood film.  The film struggled with a fundamental problem:  in a film about magicians, you know from the outset that it is going to be a succession of surprises and that nothing is going to turn out to be what it seems.  So, one would have to be a pretty inexperienced filmgoer not to anticipate most or all of the surprises at the end.  I actually figured out the Hugh Jackman side of the surprises pretty early in the film and the Christian Bale side just short of the very end.  So the film suffers from being a film that needs to surprise you to be completely successful, but telegraphing at least 50% of the surprises.<br /><br />What we are left with is a film about revenge and duplicity.  I won't go into the later since it leads to spoilers, but I will say that I rarely if ever enjoy revenge as a major theme in a film.  Two major period films dealing with magicians were released at approximately the same time:  THE PRESTIGE and THE ILLUSIONIST.  I personally enjoyed the latter more than THE PRESTIGE simply because while it also contained a revenge element, it also focused on the possibility of uniting separated lovers.  No such uplifting theme accompanies THE PRESTIGE.  In short, I found it to be something of a downer.  Albeit a highly entertaining downer.<br /><br />Despite these objections I am glad I saw the film.  There is a wonderful period feel to the entire thing and it looked great from beginning to end.  And you can't find a much stronger cast than this one.  Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were superb in their roles at the heart of the picture.  Jackman plays the less gifted magician of the two, but one far more gifted with stage flair and presentation than the rather wooden Bale character.  Michael Caine, who teamed with both Nolan and Bale in BATMAN BEGINS, is as welcome as always.  Scarlet Johansson is certainly a lovely woman, but I would prefer to have seen the highly underrated and under used Piper Perabo in her role (why is Ms. Perabo not a superstar?).  Still, it was nice to see Perabo in a decent role in a major film, playing Jackman's wife early in the film.  David Bowie was effective playing eccentric genius Tesla, though made up in a way to resemble Edward Fox.  Voice over artist Andy Serkis (Golum in the LORD OF THE RING series) plays Tesla's assistant.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the film and I imagine that those not so intent as I was to figure out what the future twists in the film might it enjoy it a lot more than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>obviously don't mix.

ALMOST too predictable.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>This wonderful tale of two battling magicians is too wonderfully complex to describe. The act of magic is described in its three parts - "the pledge," in which the audience is introduced to an object of interest; "the turn," in which the object is transformed, and "the prestige," in which the object is restored. The movie itself is probably built on these three concepts, though a single viewing is hardly enough to say for sure. But superb writing keeps the audience guessing through a maze of false appearances and hidden motivations. Like a real magic trick, the viewer wonders how it was done - how was perception manipulated so subtly so that what one thinks one sees is not what is there at all?<br /><br />Working class Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and aristocratic Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are the dueling early-20th century English prestidigitators. The stakes are high: the revelation of Borden's greatest trick - The Transported Man. The trick is a doozy, involving an impossible disappearance and reappearance. Borden - as great a magician as he is lousy a showman -- has perfected the trick - eerily so - and though Angier can duplicate it, he becomes obsessed with learning how Borden did it. Managing to obtain Borden's secret diary and compromise mistress, Angier travels to Colorado where he is led to ever-spooky electronics genius Nicola Tesla.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is itself one enormous illusion. There are so many twists and turns and reversals, that neither the characters nor the viewer can truly follow the action. This required a prodigious feat of intelligent writing, but it is pulled off admirably. The plot illusions, like their magical counterparts, are obvious when the viewer knows how they are done. One of the movie's special pleasures is to rewatch it knowing how the illusions are done. Amazingly, character motivations and actions that "read" one way the first time, read perfectly well in the opposite direction as well. Incredible.<br /><br />Michael Caine was a standout in the film - the old showman always concealing as much as he revealed. Jackman was passable - his sullen stage manner made one wonder how his character became so famous. Bale was alternately an emotional cipher and an engaging husband, father and magician. I would like to think that this was in keeping with the film's secret, of which you will not hear a word from me. And a surprise - David Bowie made the most amazing, low-key and proudly weird Tesla ever. He was mysterious, spookily intelligent and convincingly obsessed with his inventions.<br /><br />A most tightly-wrought and exquisitely-produced film.<br /><br />...and now you don't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ.html">A2RW7HXNEJ0QTQ</a><br/><p>The movie was very entertaining .. but I did expect the magic to be better...

Both have a turn of the century storyline and both deal with the trials and tribulations of their profession and the obsessive compulsive personalities that drive its practitioners to greater and greater heights of prestidigitation.<br /><br />While there are other similarities that could be made between the two films, they are also quite different and distinctive in their own right. What fascinated me about `The Prestige' is the inclusion of the real life visionary, scientist Nikola Tesla into the storyline. This clever addition added volumes of credibility and possibility to the tale and injected a much needed dose of depth and texture to the magical musings of the warring magicians.<br /><br /> As for the all important question, which is the superior film? They both receive 5 Stars in my opinion, so I leave you to decide for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OEECMCM2T4KQ.html">A3OEECMCM2T4KQ</a><br/><p>Following Nolan's career for sometime now, at least since his brilliant film, Memento, hit the screens as one of the most original stories to come out in years, my expectations were quite high, fuelled by his last project, Batman Begins. Although an interesting script, co-penned with Nolan's brother, John Nolan, (Whose short story inspired the film Memento) lacked in character development and is plot driven to the point that insignificant literary devices are used to justify motivation and therefore comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />Two 19th century magicians begin a deadly rivalry over an undisclosed span of time that becomes all-consuming for each of them. The reason for this rivalry is a revenge for the death of Hugh Jackman's characters wife who dies while performing a dangerous trick. Christian Bale's character mistakenly or not, ties the wrong knot around the woman's wrists, instigating her failure to escape from the water tank, resulting in her death. There is no motivation for the Bale character to intently kill her, as he cannot remember why he knotted the rope in a particular way. This "mistake" is enough to set the Jackman character on a life time obsession to kill or exact revenge on the other magician. The unintentional knot, to my mind, came across as a weak literary device to ensure the plot drives forward.<br /><br />The cast is certainly impressive from Jackman, Bail and a small part played by David Bowie.<br /><br />Art direction and cinematography in this film are excellent, as a period piece it was realistic down to the smallest detail.<br /><br />All the performances were first rate except for a few scenes that felt to be a little clunky, obviously needing more rehearsal time.<br /><br />Overall the film felt to be rushed, certain scenes unnecessary and others that should not have made the final cut.<br /><br />The ending of the film is surprising though leaned towards the absurd, suddenly turning a thriller into a Science Fiction piece.<br /><br />The Prestige is well worth a look at, one of those films that will appeal to a certain audience, while leaving others wondering what all the hype was about.<br /><br />3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3572FTYUQQW3P.html">A3572FTYUQQW3P</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film but came away rather unsatisfied.  It was a show about magicians, magic, competition, and obsession but never seemed to develop any charisma or real emotion. The initial accidental and predictable death never rang true as a motive for all of the death and destruction that followed.  Nevertheless, the film does keep your interest and keeps you guessing.  After all this is a film about deception, lies, and secrets so the plot twists are plausible at least right up until the end which is totally implausible and I think it is this implausibility that caused me to only give three stars.  I cannot fault the actors who did a fine job and Michael Caine is always a pleasure to watch, so I think it was the screen play that was weak, although this weakness only surfaced at the end.  I thought the film was worth seeing and it was entertaining, but unlike many of the other reviewers here I didn't think it was "one of the best movies of the year".  It certainly wasn't the quality of "The Departed" which is indeed one of the best movies of the year and academy quality.  "The Prestige" is entertaining but not a great film.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>Abrakadabra.  The Prestige is why I continue to enjoy going to the movies.

A story of two 19th Century magician's (nicely played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale) whose bitter rivalry is founded in a tragedy allows Christopher Nolan to do some movie prestidigitation as well, telling his tale cutting back and forth between the two men while moving forward and backward in time as well.<br /><br />The film offers nicely rendered period detail of London and Colorado Springs, combines a bit of lore (the magician's three acts of The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige), a bit of history (the rivalry of Thomas Edison and Nikolai Tesla) a bit of intrigue, a bit of mystery and more.  It is complex but comprehensible if you're paying attention.  In fact it demands your attention as any good illusion does.<br /><br />With this as it's frame, the Nolan brothers explore the meaning and nuances of indentity, technical competence versus showmanship and presentation (Bordin & Argien, Tesla & Edison), and the creative value of obsession and the price paid for indulging one's obsessions, and, of course, the fascination of magic, that most theatrical manipulation of truth and illusion.  A bit of movie magic here, I found The Prestige intriguing and mesmerizing, much like a first rate feat of legerdemain, clever and original.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ.html">A3R2YB0WTTB0IJ</a><br/><p>Outstanding movie by a director who will be considered as a reference in a few years. And I like the peculiar world of magicians.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>For reasons which other reviewers have already mentioned, it's hard to get very involved with these characters, and that's a problem.  However, the storyline is intriguing enough to keep you watching for the twist at the end.  I did enjoy David Bowie's understated performance as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />  If you want to care more about characters, however, try The Illusionist instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan's "The Prestige" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation -  a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.<br /><br />Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage.  Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.<br /><br />With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel.  The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core.  More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making.  The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.<br /><br />The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.<br /><br />On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along.  Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SU3TXON36T0X.html">A3SU3TXON36T0X</a><br/><p>_The Prestige_ (2006) is a movie based on a book by the same name featuring a rivalry between two stage magicians in late 19th century London.  The movie itself demonstrates the extremes to which many magicians of the period were willing to go in order to pull off their stunts.  The movie also explains many of these tricks, including such tricks as escaping from a locked box underwater with hands tied, the appearance of a fish bowl from under a cloth (practiced by a Chinese magician who was willing to go through life pretending to be a cripple in order to avoid his trick being found out), the infamous "bullet catch", the disappearance and reappearance of a bird, and ultimately the "teleported man".  The movie title is a fitting one, which can be understood once the movie has been watched.  It refers to the fact that there are three stages to a magical act (as explained by the older magician at the beginning of the movie).  These stages are as follows:  "the pledge" (in which the magician shows the audience something that appears ordinary), "the turn" (where the magician makes the ordinary act extraordinary, such as by disappearing), and "the prestige" (where the final effect of the illusion is produced, such as the reappearance of the object).  It is to the question of exactly how "the prestige" is played out in the so-called "teleported man" trick that the movie must address.  The movie features a dark atmosphere in Victorian London and shows the dangers of obsession.  The movie also features a cameo appearance by the eccentric scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla (whose bizarre inventions were far ahead of his time, and who is still believed by many to have discovered many secrets which remain uncovered at this time).  In this movie, Tesla does manage to develop something that is truly extraordinary (in his rivalry with Thomas Edison) and the true gruesome nature of this discovery as played out in the magical act of one of the magicians is not revealed until the end.<br /><br />To begin with the movie starts out with both magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier as assistants to Milton the magician.  In their effort to stretch the boundaries of their magical skills, the magicians concoct a stunt in which Angier's wife has her hands and legs tied and is then placed into a tank of water with a locked top.  During one of the performances, Borden may have tied a knot which Angier's wife could not escape from (though he cannot remember exactly which knot he tied) and this leads to the tragedy of Angier's wife drowning within the box before it can be broken open.  Angier blames Borden for his wife's death and thus begins the rivalry between the two magicians.  During one of his performances, Borden attempts to perform the notoriously dangerous "bullet catch"; however, Angier arrives in the crowd in disguise and volunteers to fire the gun at Borden.  Borden is injured because of Angier's tampering and thus loses two fingers.  Later in the movie, Borden performs a bizarre stunt called the "teleported man", in which he enters one door and reappears instantaneously at another door halfway across the stage.  (As will be discovered later in the movie, this "stunt" has a personal effect on him and involves great sacrifice.)  In an effort to one-up Borden, Angier (calling himself "The Great Danton") must resort to extreme measures.  Originally he uses a double to perform the same trick; however, this soon proves impossible as his double turns on him.  So he must visit Tesla who lives in Colorado in America at the time.  Tesla devises a special method for Angier to conduct his trick.  To see how the rest of the movie is resolved you must watch as it plays out.  However, the ending is particularly gruesome, as obsession becomes murderous.  Both men turn out to have taken extreme measures to perform this trick and the costs include human lives.  (Note:  The eerie foreshadowing in the magical trick involving the bird.  In which, the bird must be murdered in order for the trick to work.)<br /><br />This movie is a thoroughly enjoyable one and has been compared to another movie about stage magic which recently came out called _The Illusionist_.  Both movies are very good though they are quite different from each other.  This movie is certainly entertaining but ultimately very gruesome and not for the overly squeamish.  It is certainly worth watching however if you can appreciate being dazzled by the uncanny individuals who practice stage magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`The Prestige' has all the credentials to be an important film, including the usually misguidedly gushing blurb from Peter Travers of `Rolling Stone', who seems to hail all sorts of overreaching films. The most notable thing about the film is the cast, including an impressive list of both young talents, such as Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson, plus venerable older and more experienced names such as Michael Caine and the brilliantly elusive David Bowie. The director, as the filmmaker for the acclaimed `Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan, is also a talent not to be taken lightly. And yet, through all the dark twists and turns, the movie never seems to elicit any strong sympathies for the characters and the Byzantine byways of flashbacks and surprises.<br /><br />The keystone which holds the plot together is the use of the historical character of scientist and engineer, Nicoli Telsa, the inventor of alternating current and competitor with Thomas Edison, the proponent of direct current (Telsa's doctrines ultimately won; however, Edison gets most of the fame and fortune for introducing electrification to the world). Telsa, played with delightful mystery by Bowie, is contracted by one of the two principle character magicians, Robert Angier (played by Jackman), to build him an apparatus for a fabulous new trick. While the trick has lots of special on-stage effects from man-made static electrical charges, it may be seen as nothing more than the usual tired disappearing man trick. The two features which make it more entrancing are the fact that the disappearance is done without the aid of boxes or curtains, and the magician reappears almost instantly from the back of the audience. This trick, and its macabre little twist serve as the climax; however the main body of the story is driven by a highly improbable occurrence when one of the two magician team, Alfred Borden (played by Bale) makes a mistake in the setup for a trick, leading to the accidental death of Angier's wife when a trick goes bad and the woman cannot escape from submersion in a tank of water. The improbabilities are twofold. One, it is highly unlikely that an experienced magician would make that kind of mistake, then forget whether he made it or not. Second, it is improbable that the margin of error between the time the mistake is detected and emergency escape measures are taken would be so small, leading to the death of the magician's subject. And, this improbable event drives the entire plot of the story.<br /><br />These improbabilities are muted just a bit by the jigsaw nature of the movie's timeline. We seem to be jumping around so much between `present' and flashbacks that it's hard to be sure when and where we are at any given point in time. One thriller / surprise ending movie which comes to mind in evaluating this story is the original `The Manchurian Candidate', based on an improbable premise, but so well written, directed, and acted that we form great bonds of sympathy for the main characters, strengthened, at least at the time the movie was released, by a political climate which made the film far less improbable seeming than it actually was. And, the ending was in fact a great, unexpected surprise.<br /><br />The surprise ending of `The Prestige' is signaled by several different clues, some revealed relatively early in the film; however, to be honest, I didn't really put everything together until the end. The strength of the surprise ending is from both the revelation of `the facts of the case' plus the remarkably devious plan to which the physical circumstances are put to resolve the conflict set in motion by the death of the magician's wife.<br /><br />In the end, the premise driving the plot is not sufficiently believable, and we never really connect emotionally with the characters. Even Jackman's Wolverine character in the X-Men movies seems to elicit more sympathy than his far more realistic character here.<br /><br />This is better than many `special effects fests' such as `Van Helsing' and `The League of Remarkable Gentlemen', and it's twists and turns will probably deserve a second and third viewing to get everything straight, but this is very good second rate moviemaking, not worthy of exceptional praise.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>the prestige is a magic treat, a love for magic so deep they sacrifice everything and anything to be the best. this is a keeper, the cast is great, the acting, the story, very suprising in the end. to win it all you have to lose it all. the cast alone you knew you were in for a treat. hugh jackman is one of the best actors out there. so down to earth, but has the hero thing about him. i love all of his movies and in this film his gift is clearly seen. christian bale is wonderful. he has a load of good movies under his belt as well. his acting speaks for itself, and his accent is nice. scarlett johanssen played her part very well. these men are trying to outdo each other ever since a tragic accident. niether wants to loose and that becomes their obsession. nothing else around them matters. and in the end only the best will triumph. sad at times. all it was said to be and more theres so much beauty and talent throughout the whole movie you just want to watch it again and again. i hugely applaud it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>Although I wasn't completely satisfied by the ending (a bit too unbelievable, even for a thriller), I must say it was a good watch - very entertaining and edge-of-the-seat suspense.

Each trying to sabotage each other, outdo each other, and decode the secrets of each others tricks.  The twists and turns in this movie never seem to end.  The story even brings in Houdini's water closet escape trick as well as the great scientist Tesla.  The story does exaggerate a lot about Tesla but it seems to work in this film.<br /><br />The acting is first class and Michael Caine puts in another great supporting spot.  Scarlett Johannsan is not quite as good as Jessica Beals was in The Illusionist but she is acceptable a the magician's assistant and lover.<br /><br />I would have given the film 5 stars but I was a little disappointed with the ending which seemed too implausible.</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>The production value of this movie is excellent.  I felt transported back to a time in history when science and superstition were practically brothers in the minds of most men.  "The Prestige" bridges these two perspectives nicely to the point that one begins to think that magic really does exist where these two competing magicians are concerned.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry the film splendidly, even during the very slow moments, with Michael Caine and the lovely Scarlett Johansson pitching in occasionally to give the story added lift.  This is the second film that director Christopher Nolan has worked with Christian Bale, the first being "Batman Begins", and as in that film the photography in "The Prestige" is equally dark and evocative.  Christopher Nolan also directed two other deliberately paced films, "Memento" and "Insomnia".  "The Prestige" is appropriately draped in shadows, secrecy, and deceit.  I saw this movie in the theater and by the time it ended with a surprising plot twist I knew that I would have to see it again when it came out on DVD just to see what I missed the first time around.  The pace of "The Presitge" is slow going, but I found the film overall to be very satisfying.  Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This movie suffers from attention deficit disorder. There is hardly a scene in it that lasts more than 20 seconds. It's now here - now there - now somewhere else.<br /><br />Some of this technique may have been a purposeful attempt to present the viewer with a parallel to the magician's trick of now-you-see-it, now-you-don't - no, the coin isn't in my hand, it's behind your ear! But this movie goes too far with that sort of disjunction. It ends up like a jigsaw puzzle spilled out of the box onto the floor. There's no process or coherent character development here. So it's hard to get emotionally involved with the lives of the competing magicians.<br /><br />Admittedly, "The Prestige" has a lot of ground to cover. There are a lot of tricks and counter-tricks to present, a lot of deals and deles. To get all this material in and to retain some sense of the journey as well as the destination, the movie would have to have been much longer, something that many directors/producers presume current audiences won't tolerate.<br /><br />I had at least looked forward to seeing how the famous real-life wizard, Nikola Tesla, was portrayed here. However, I was somewhat disappointed on this score too. As fantastic as many of Tesla's experiments with electricity actually were, his results are carried to absurd extremes for the purposes of this plot. The movie veers off into sheer implausible science fiction when it comes to Tesla.<br /><br />Also, there is something a little jarring about Christian Bale in the role of one of the competing magicians. One expects a magician of that sort to be gaunt, angular, satanically shadowed - and Bale appears a little plump for this stereotype. Or maybe it is just that Bale had taken himself down to such extreme emaciation for his haunting portrayal in "The Machinist," that his fleshed-out appearance here clashed with expectation.<br /><br />But the movie does have an intricate plot with some challenging twists and turns.<br /><br />"The Illusionist," was a movie that came out at roughly the same time as this "Prestige" and had a similar theme of pre-modern magicians. "The Illusionist" had what was perhaps a slightly more predictable denouement. But it was more satisfying in that it took its time with texture and unfolding. If these two movies could have been combined somehow, with the cagey plot of "The Prestige," and the sipping amber loveliness of "The Illusionist," we would have had one magical movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Vengeance and magic becomes bound together when one magician blames another for the drowning death of his wife in a trick gone bad.

Where MEMENTO kept the audience tense and on the edge of the seat and of quizzical mind, THE PRESTIGE attempts to use the same techniques but ends up being an overly long, at times ponderous, and ultimately rather bland examination of illusion and magic and the need audiences have to believe in what they see as an exit route from the mundane lives they lead.<br /><br />The time is turn of the century England (with a foray into the United States) when Magic Shows were a popular form of entertainment (as they still are in Las Vegas).  Two friends - Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman) - are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks.  The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman.  Their rivalry is healthy until an unfortunate illusion/trick fails at the hands of Borden and the loss of the beloved assistant of Angier.  From this point the two friends become archenemies, each sworn to discover the secrets of the other, a journey which eventually leads to murder and the ultimate illusion of life over death.<br /><br />There are so many subplots that they defy summation. Suffice it to say that inventors (electricity scientist Nikola Telsa - David Bowie), magic machine creators (Cutter - Michael Caine), wives (Julia Angier - Piper Perabo and Sarah Borden - Rebecca Hall), lovers (Olivia - Scarlett Johansson) all weave in and out of the plot, at times illuminating the ideas and at times confusing them.  The ending is predictable: it is the only way to explain the Transported Man secret trick. Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast.  The production values are what really make the film work.  Worth an evening's viewing - a long evening...  Grady Harp, February 07</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>This film is as disappointing as "The Illusionist" is satisfying, surprising, and representative of imaginative movie-making at its best.  By contrast, "The Prestige" tries to acquire some literary cachet from Edgar Allen Poe and Joseph Conrad doppelganger stories while willfully disregarding the logic of physical reality and blatantly and continuously manipulating the spectator.  Made-for-TV jump-cutting clashes with the agonizing drawn-out final scene in what is a very confusing and confused mish-mash of a film--a betrayal of the unwritten rules that a master like Hitchock would never think of violating.<br /><br />The movie lectures us about the 3-part drama that comprises a master magician's illusion--the set-up, the act (making something disappear), the trick (or "Prestige"), which is the restoration of the disappearing body.  But the movie ignores the spectator's underlying requirement--viz. the trick must amaze because it occurs in spite of the material limits, or laws of finite existence, with which we are all too familiar.  When the trick passes this "reality test," the result is an amazed and delighted spectator who asks "how" did they do that?  But in the case of "The Prestige," which resorts to the "deus ex machina" principle, or to sheer fantastic "sci-fi" and "weird science" devices, the spectator is left asking, merely, "why" did they do that?  (We'll pass by the smaller questions--i.e. where are we?  what did he just say?--that this pretentious and botched patchwork of a film is bound to provoke. The movie's frantic editing and "Method"-like acting do little more than expose glaring deficiencies in both areas.)<br /><br />For those who can be content to play with the doppelganger and sacrifice themes (the disappearance requires that someone or something--a bird, for instance--gets snuffed), perhaps there's something to be taken away from the film other than a bad after-taste and greater respect for superior films like "The Illusionist" and Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks.  As Michael Caine says, "We want to be tricked, which requires believing in the illusion."  In this film we believe in everything up to the point of the illusion itself, at which point our suspension of disbelief is no longer possible.  You'd have to be the biggest fan of Roger Corman or, perhaps, Ed Wood to believe in this film's ill-conceived and clumsy manipulations.  It's an Illusion that, however temporarily "amazing," fails with a resounding thud, the director mistaking sensation for suspense and pretense for prestige.<br /><br />[For a point-by-point counter-argument to my position (I won't elevate the above response to an "argument"), see the first commentary (below) by OBrien, who works out the "logic" of the trick with persuasive if not compelling points--sufficient to suggest that "The Prestige" not merely rivals the sophistication of "The Illusionist" but exceeds it!  All the same, I dislike "The Prestige" (that is, I think I do--it's hard sometimes to know what one likes; one often likes what one comes to know).  I'll add another layer to Obrien's case (though it's his references to the journals that bring it to mind): the film's unusual (and clever) use of multiple narrators, thereby "privileging" different viewpoints of elusive "truth" at any given moment, along with written words, or the power of language.  Journals (words) enable any of us to defy the laws of physical reality (we constantly confront the presence of absence with language, restoring to the present the "thing" that is otherwise no longer physically present to us).<br /><br />So the film may be both ingenious and deeply philosophical (thereby refuting my position that it resorts to common deus ex machina, sci-fi, sensational devices).  But consider, again, the difference (aside from camera work, acting, sets, form) between the two similar films.  In "The Illusionist" two childhood friends/lovers are separated and the protagonist-magician ultimately realizes his "obsession" of bringing her back from the void.  He tells her he loves her and will bring her back into his life--and he pulls off this seemingly impossible "trick" (the viewer may, if he/she wishes, attribute all to the power of love, though everything is logically explained.  "The Prestige" is a beast of a different order.  The magician Borden tells his wife that he loves her and she answers: "Sometimes you say that and don't mean it, which is all right because it makes sweeter the times when you actually do mean it."  "Prestige" is a word that has little to do with love and everything to do with power and, more importantly, "pride" (or that deadly nemesis "hubris").  "The Prestige," in other words, is driven by the obsessive pride of two competing magicians who will go to all lengths to make the rival disappear, thereby realizing the not-so-magnificent obsession of either one.  I suspect I'm not alone in my preferred obsession: I'll reserve my 5-star rating for the magician who will put everything on the line to make his beloved reappear.]</p></br><a href="../users/AXQ8T2D9IT6UG.html">AXQ8T2D9IT6UG</a><br/><p>"The Prestige", based on a novel by Christopher Priest, is a movie that surprised me. I had heard that some people liked it, and that some people hated it, but I didn't expect "The Prestige"  to be the kind of film that makes you  want to watch it again immediately, just to be certain you didn't miss anything. And that is exactly what happened in this case...<br /><br />This film, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a drama set in late 19th century London that has some ingredients that can only be described as fantasy. All the same, the spectator won't be able to shake off the feeling that what he is watching is real, due to the excellent way in which the actors, the director and the scriptwriters managed to bring Priest's novel to life.<br /><br />The title of this movie has to do with one of the three acts of which every outstanding magic trick consists. The first act is "The Pledge", when the magician shows you something seemingly ordinary. The second act is "The Turn", when the thing that seemed ordinary is turned into something extraordinary. The last act is "The Prestige", the act that crowns the magic trick and makes it unique. Magicians live and die for "The Prestige", and that act is somehow at the center of this story.<br /><br />The main characters in this film are two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), that due to a tragedy go from friendly rivals to fierce enemies. The quest of each one of them is to best the other, no matter the cost, notwithstanding the means. Who is the best magician, who can really achieve "The Prestige"? And will he live to boast about it?<br /><br />On the whole, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and that I would gladly watch it a third time.

(If you have not, you really should see "Memento" which is told in five minute chunks - arranged in reverse order.)  In "The Prestige" he takes a first-rate cast and a lurid magic-noir story and ends with a result that had my family talking for an hour afterward.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Is it perfect? No.  There are plot twists aplenty. Not all of them are as surprising as the film wants them to be.  (Did you guess the "secret" of "The Sixth Sense"? Me neither.  At least one of the major "secrets" of this film lumbers along in front of your eyes for half the film, and when it is revealed I didn't get that sense of being deliciously tricked that I got from Sixth Sense.) The final "secret" required a little more suspension of disbelief than I was willing to give as a character-drive period drama ends with a science fiction device as unbelievable as time-travel.  It was a good plot device - for a different story.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman joins actors who have worked with Mr. Nolan before: Michael Caine and Christian Bale.  Hugh plays Angier while Bale plays Borden - rivals who escalate their professional rivalry into a deadly game of one-upmanship. Michael Caine's character builds the elaborate magical devices used onstage.  He serves as both supporting character and a one-man Greek Chorus of sorts as he introduces elements of the story. The non-linear narrative covers three distinct time periods.  In the earliest time period Angier and Borden are assistants to a magician who has great illusory skills, but not much showmanship.  In this period Piper Perabo is Mrs. Angier - the lovely female assistant to the older plodding magician.  Something happens to Piper that ratchets up the rivalry between the younger magicians to matching deadly obsessions.  In the "middle" timeline Angier leaves Victorian London to visit the mysterious Nikola Tesla and his electric laboratory in the snow-capped mountains of Colorado Springs.  Tesla is played by David Bowie in a surprisingly effective performance. Andy Sirkis steps out of the role of Gollum to finally arrive on-screen with his face shown.  The Colorado sequences are effective with the snow-covered setting and Bowie's performance - portraying Tesla as half mad-scientist, half philosophical sage.  Angier commissions Tesla to build the "ultimate" magic trick. In the latest storyline we are shown that Angier is killed during one of his performances by Borden in the most extreme expression of the rivalry between the two malevolent magicians.  But is Angier really dead?  If he is, was it Borden who really killed him?<br /><br />Rebecca Hall plays Borden's wife, Sarah, and Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia, who is first hired to be the pretty distraction assistant to Angier.  Angier sends her to spy on Borden and to this moment, I'm not certain who her loyalties were chiefly with, although I suspect both by the end.  I've read other reviews that say she is wasted or underused in this role, but a lesser actress would have had a more difficult time making us believe that Olivia could be torn between the two men - or as involved in the underhanded dealings that occur.<br /><br />Secret journals add to the twists and turns.  It took a good hour of talking after the film for all the members of my family (myself included) to have pieced together all the clues and surprises that had been unleashed - particularly in the final ten minutes.<br /><br />I have not read Christopher Priest's original novel, so I don't know how much the single quibble I have with the screenplay (the science fiction part) has to do with the original novel compared to the adaptation by Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan.  If I may offer my opinion - could not the story have been resolved without the use of a plot device that is simply scientifically impossible?</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>I heard of "The Prestige" when it came out on DVD, but I didn't know too much about it.  Saw some commercials for it here and there, but I wasn't sure if it was something that I had to see right away.  It wasn't until I went to a store and saw that this was directed by none other than the brilliant Christopher Nolan (who directed my all-time favorite movie, "Memento").  That's all it took for me to buy the DVD without even really knowing what the movie was about.  I didn't care.  It had Nolan's name on it, and that's all I needed.  I watched it the next day and couldn't believe how great this movie was.  Not only that, but I ended up watching it again only a few hours after my first viewing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are so many twists and turns in this wild ride that I'll have to be brief in describing what it's about so I don't end up giving away something crucial (yeah, it's one of those where you give away one little thing, and it could possibly ruin the movie for the other person).  As simplistic as I can put it the film concerns two magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  The two were quite the team and worked together splendidly until one night one of their well known tricks goes wrong and ends up costing Angier a loved one.  He blames Borden for his loss and becomes obsessed with finding any means to out-show him, learn his secrets and destroy him.<br /><br />I know, this sounds like a typical "thriller," but that's really only a small outline of the movie.  I had to keep it short and simple to avoid giving away too much.  "The Prestige" works more as a drama/thriller/mystery.  The entire theme of the movie is to "watch closely," and there's reason for that.  You're not entirely sure what is going on until the very end, and even then you feel like you have to watch it again right away to verify what you've just witnessed.  Nolan's great at playing head-games with you, and it's nice to see him dive intos that area of film again.  Even though you're always trying to piece together what's going on, none of that takes away the enjoyment of watching these characters and how they interact in the environment around them.  The look and feel of the film is very dark, but it looks so gorgeous.<br /><br />The performances from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine are perfect.  Bale never ceases to amaze me in the roles he takes, as he commits himself a hundred percent every time.  David Bowie even makes a small appearance in the film, and trust me when I say this, you do not see him as David Bowie on the screen.  You buy into his character completely.<br /><br />It must be said, even though this is a PG-13 movie, it gets pretty disturbing and the overall tone of the movie is dark and cold.  I wouldn't recommend it for children.  The DVD doesn't offer a whole lot of features, which is a shame because I have the suspicion that they will re-release it in a "fully-loaded" edition later on (which I will have to go and buy).<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a total success, and then some.  It's one of those movies that you have to watch more than once, and each time you see it (just like with "Memento"), chances are you're going to pick up on something that you didn't see the first time around.  If you're looking for something different and unique, I strongly suggest giving this a try.  It ranks up there as one of my top favorites of 2006.  Nice to see that Christopher Nolan has made another fantastic movie and has proven that he's not just a one-trick pony.  The movie may have a lot of twists and turns to keep you interested, but they never take away from the great story and characters.<br /><br />Are you watching closely?  -Michael Crane</p></br><a href="../users/A1F2EYORWOZ3G1.html">A1F2EYORWOZ3G1</a><br/><p>I've read the other reviews just to see what they said. I happen to think this was a great film.<br /><br />The story was strong and convincing as well as the acting. The sets and costumes were fantastic.<br /><br />The story here was not the sleight of hand or illusion, but the competition. How far would anyone go to seek revenge? And just how would that revenge effect the one seeking it?<br /><br />Truly an original story here filled with mystery, doubt, revenge and the illusions that surround us. All the players are in fine form here. Each one fleshes out their character quite well and play into the common theme dynamically.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery that is tense and driven, then this is the film for you. A rare trip as of late as most mysteries have to be gore or flesh driven. But not this one. All Hitchcock and DePalma fans will love this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`The Prestige' opens with the death of magician Robert Anglier.  His chief rival Alfred Borden is standing trial for his murder although it appears he's innocent.  As `The Prestige' unveils its many layers the audience is taken deep into the lives of these two men, into what made them who they are, what drove them apart and into rivalry and what ultimately will become of each man in the end.  At doing this `The Prestige' excels masterfully.  Director Christopher Nolan is building quite the reputation for himself.  He expertly crafts this film, layering each newfound discovery about these men so that the audience is completely entranced.  He uses his cast as they should be, allowing them to shine yet never overpower the brilliance of the film or give away too much of themselves too soon.  `The Prestige' is one of those near perfect films that comes along only once in a great while, a film that one can truly adore, stand behind and find fascinating with every viewing.  That's one of the greatest things about `The Prestige'.  With each and every viewing the audience is able to spot more pieces of the puzzle, things throughout the film they had never caught before but now know to look for.<br /><br />The storyline is engrossing as well, and that as we know is truly the most important facet to a film of this caliber.  The film follows the lives of two rival magicians as I mentioned, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.  Robert and Alfred at one time worked together as assistants to another well known magician.  Despite what some of the reviews would have you believe, they were not friends.  In fact it's quite obvious that Robert does not trust Alfred, not in the least.  When a mistake on the part of Alfred's costs Robert's wife Julia her life he vows to avenge her.  As the magicians go their separate ways Robert's obsession grows.  He sabotages Alfred's shows, and Alfred retaliates likewise.  Things truly take a turn for the worse though when Alfred incorporates an act in his show that cannot be understood or duplicated.  This drives Robert mad and he desperately works to uncover his secret.  In search for answers he develops a nifty trick of his own thanks in large part to a scientist named Tesla, and with his new trick firmly in tact he sets out to destroy Alfred once and for all.<br /><br />The climax of this film, which takes us back to the beginning almost and unveils the mystery behind Anglier's death, is utterly orgasmic, at least to me and everyone who has watched the film with me so far.  The film is slow paced yet entrancing and so when the ending creeps up on you after strongly built anticipation you'll be kicking yourself for not picking up on it.  The greatest thing about the conclusion is that after the credits start to roll you'll be trying to place all the pieces together and will desire to watch the film once more to see if you missed something, which most likely you have.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant as well, especially on the part of Christian Bale.  Bale has always been one of my favorite actors but he never seems to pick a movie that is as well crafted as his skill.  In films like `American Psycho' and `The Machinist' he proves to be the best part of the film and without him the movie kind of falls apart.  Here though he finally found a film worth his talent.  He is so commanding, so engrossing and just as intriguing as the film itself; most definitely best in show.  High Jackman is also quite impressive.  He had a great year in 2006, and while I preferred his performance in `The Fountain' I must say that I was blown away here as well.  Michael Caine, one of our finest working actors, a true legend, does not disappoint and delivers an outstanding supporting performance as Cutter, a mentor to either men at one time or another.  There are a few women in this film, and each of them hold there own.  Piper Perabo proves in her very limited screen time as Julia to be an actress we should see more of.  I don't know what happened to this girl but someone needs to book her as a lead and let her talent truly shine.  Scarlett Johansson is fantastic as always as Olivia, assistant to either men at one time or another.  She perfectly balances her own sexuality with a commanding aura.  She is, without question, one of our most talented working actresses.  It's Rebecca Hall though that really stands out for me.  As Sarah, Alfred loving wife, she perfectly shifts between infatuation and intolerance, between admiration and impatience and dire frustration.  Her performance is heartbreaking to say the least.<br /><br />In the end `The Prestige' comes very close to making my top five films of 2006 for there is not a moment within that I am bored, dissatisfied or lost.  It's one of those rare gems that just seems to fit in every possible way and soars high above the rest of the competition.  I have a feeling that we are soon to see some spectacular things from director Christopher Nolan, even more spectacular then the brilliance he's already dealt to his audience.</p></br><a href="../users/AUSATFDSU2INS.html">AUSATFDSU2INS</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan returns with The Prestige, a movie about revenge and the obsessive minds of two rival magicians. And what a magical experience this was.<br /><br />Based on Christopher Priest's novel, The Prestige examines the destructive nature of revenge, framed within the illusory and competitive world of magic. Using the deceptive concept of trickery, the genre goes almost to science fiction as it blurs the edges between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden are, as Borden says, "Two young men devoted to an illusion." Originally in good terms, the two become enemies when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife Julia, who drowns when a trick they are performing goes horribly wrong. Following the tragedy, Borden's personal life and career flourish. Meanwhile, Angier's life takes the opposite trajectory. And filled with pain and anger he embarks on a vengeful path that has deadly consequences. Their rivalry grows more vicious and desperate, with their magic skills used not only to wow audiences but wreak havoc on one another.<br /><br />But, as you'd expect in a film involving magicians, things are rarely as they appear.<br /><br />This movie has everything: excitement, thrills, twist and turns, romance, surprises. When The Prestige begins, nothing makes any sense. The story goes backwards and forwards through time. But before too much goes on, things start getting clearer. Bit by bit, everything comes into focus. But to get there, you'll have to earn it. You'll have to hate it before you like it. During it's running time The Prestige will make you irritated, confused, exasperated, frustrated but before it's over... you'll fall in love with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>Not terribly difficult to figure out the plot, but still intriguing.

However, it loses that extra point for creating the ridiculous doppleganger machine<br /><br />("Attention Checkov, this is the Captain, please beam us up!  zzzzoooolllluuuulllluuuuu").  Ok, that was a downer, totally ridiculous ending, but I was taken up in the story.  Jackman and Bale<br /><br />do good work, as of course does Sir Caine. SJ, meanwhile showed as much emotion as a lamp post and was awful.  Finnaly, David Bowie nailed Tesla, great work.  I'd like to see him on the stage again.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Ignore the star power in this movie, if you can. Michael Caine, David Bowie, Christian Bale, Piper Perabo, Hugh Jackman, and Scarlett Johansson are hard to ignore, but try anyway. Also, ignore the low-key action of the movie, until you can't any more. This is about aggression that goes way beyond any normal violence. Even without the supernatural, these people can't be stopped by mere murder - or suicide.<br /><br />I can't say much, because almost anything would be a spoiler. When you get to the last scene, all you'll want is to see the rest all over again. It really does build up, moment by moment, in an utterly logical progression that conceals its logic. There is one deus ex machina at work, but only one. The rest seems inevitable, but only when you look back from the very end.<br /><br />It's intense, and just scratches the surface of a rage that gentle people will not understand. It builds slowly - I almost walked out about an hour into it. It finishes hard and fast, though. It reminds me of "Realm of the Senses," not in its sensuality, but in its cold, hard drive for revenge.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>I saw Hugh Jackman on Jay Leno talking about The Prestige and the shocking ending, and after seeing a trailer for it, I was determined to see this Magical Mystery Tour myself.  I liked virtually everything about the movie, even when I had no idea where it was going...however, just knowing in advance that the ending was supposed to be a giant surprise, I was paying extra attention.  Now I am not sure whether or not it was because of this that I caught on to a few things that later helped me to deduce the eventual outcome of the story, but even so that is exactly what happened.<br /><br />The story flowed differently from what you may normally expect from a fairly large budgeted film.  Showing us clips out of sequence may sound confusing, but never fear, the Director, Christopher Nolan held the reigns close to keep you seeing exactly what he wanted you to see, and when you would see it.  After a tragic accident that causes the death of his wife, Hugh Jackman (I find it easier to refer to them this way) teeters dangerously over the edge of sane reasoning in his quest to see to it that Christian Bale suffers serious consequences for his negligence in tying a knot that was supposed to be easily undone behind the curtain.  This goes from outright attempts at murder, to trying to out-do him on stage.<br /><br />It is easy to see that Hugh's character is the more polished of the two, and yet it isn't enough.  Christian knows how to perform incredibly clever illusions which seem to dazzle way more than anything Hugh can come up with.  Thus the quest to *discover* Christian's secret ferments until it becomes a full-fledged obsession.  Stealing the trick isn't beneath him, either.  But even though he is able to *copy* Christian's trick of the Transported Man on stage, Hugh still feels 2nd rate because deep down he still has no real clue as to HOW it is done...and this is driving him quite mad.<br /><br />Hugh's obsession forces him to virtually abandon almost everything in order to make Christian pay for his wife's death.  Since the tragic accident, Christian has moved on, married and even had a child, while Hugh continues to seeth at the loss he should not have had to bear.  Revenge is a tricky thing, however.  It leads Hugh to do some nasty things in order to force Christian to divulge his Transported Man secret.  This leads him to Nikola Tesla in the mountains of Colorado.  His experiments with electricity has made him legendary, but also viewed as a bit of an eccentric as well.  Hugh will stop virtually nothing in his attempts to have Tesla create for him a way to scientifically counter the Transported Man, all the while creating his own legacy that will hopefully live forever after his death.<br /><br />Several *secrets* to how the story ends are revealed as a result of Hugh visiting Colorado.  Don't worry, I won't spoil anything here, but for those of you who pride yourself in figuring out complicated plots, especially when telegraphed rather early on, well you may not find the last frame of the movie to be a surprise at all.  However, if by any chance you miss some of these *clues* and they ARE there, the final second of this movie has the potential to shock you as much as the ending to the 6th Sense may have.  I am by NO means a plot-deciphering genius by ANY stretch of the imagination, however I was still able to make my own mind up a good 40 minutes before the movie ended about what the eventual outcome was going to be, and while I didn't get everything 100% the general shock that you are left with did NOT surprise me.  I sincerely wish it had, because I would have enjoyed the movie that much more.<br /><br />I also feel compelled to let those who see this movie know that the plot borders on the Supernatural and even skirts the realm of science fiction a tad...maybe because of these two factors I was able to make my deduction so easily (because I enjoy sci-fi, maybe it was easier to accept the outcome...maybe not).  All I know is that if you are NOT into the Supernatural or a shade of sci-fi, The Prestige just may not be for you.  I still enjoyed the acting, the pacing and it is always nice to see Michael Caine do what he does best -- even if his role reminded me of a dozen other characters he has played in the past.  Good luck, and hopefully the ending WILL surprise you more than it did me.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This is an interesting movie based around in london in 1900 when the age of magicians/magic show were taking of, of course culmonating with houdini in America.  A very interesting concept for the movie, and it really did keep me guessing.  I could write a long review like many of the other reviewers, but they do a good job at summerizing it. I can just say, Chritian Bale and Hugh Jackman do spectacular jobs at playing these roles and it was Cool Seeing David Bowie in a movie again, although I kept picturing him in that Darn Labarinth outfit as he played the role of Dr. Tesla. Well casted, great efects, and great plot. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>THE PRESTIGE (dir. Christopher Nolan, 2006) refers to the final climax of a magic trick/stage illusion, according to this film. Not being a magician but a real amateur fan of magic and magicians, I have to say I have never heard of such terminology. I recall Houdini referring to "illusions", "tricks" and he even called himself a fraud several times. However, no "prestige".<br /><br />In this film, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play warring stage illusionists with a mutual history. This involves the death of Jackamn's wife, which he naturally blames on Bale for good reason. What annoyed me about this film is something I believe no director has ever used properly: the reading-from-a-journal narrative.<br /><br />Both Bale and Jackman, at differing points in time, read each other's diaries, thus learning each other's secrets. The big one they each want is the other's 'disappearing act'. Jackman wants to know what Bale did to cause the accident, in fact, which he may or may not learn at the end. Of course, Bale only learns Jackman's secret at the end, and we ALL have to wait til the end. I admit, it is clever, though obvious.<br /><br />As I said, it's just plain annoying and not because of the wait. While I applaud this film in all its powerful efforts, including a brilliant-as-usual turn by David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, it is a bit long at two hours and sags with a huge yawn. This is mainly because we have to wait for the journal-reading narrative to play out; the disconcerting back-and-forth along this complex storyline is a pain. The only reason I saw this was to see Bowie as Tesla, one of my heroes! He, at least, does not disappoint. He even nailed the Serbian accent on the head.<br /><br />It is a good idea to compare Nolan's basic premise with the premises of other past films - films that are immortal, incomparable and are pillars of established film history.<br /><br />In Kurosawa's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEK8E2">Rashomon</a>, we have a crime that is shown to the viewer but we are also shown the perceptions of five separate witnesses; so, what actually happened? It is brilliant, confusing, metaphysically challenging. THIS is a magic trick the audience can never forget.<br /><br />In his lesser-known <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00180R072">High and Low (The Criterion Collection)</a>, we have a kidnapping gone awry: the wrong kid is taken, and we are shown that fact fairly soon. The trick here is whether the other child will live and be saved. Again, brilliant, clear and no tricks played on us but the tension in itself is a trick.<br /><br />In the fantastic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXZ4">Memento</a>, a crime is committed resulting in the victim developing an odd form of persistent amnesia. He can only remember things for 10 minutes, after which he suffers total amnesia. This is a real condition, and we watch as the film tracks backward through time to tell us how it all came to this. The entire film is like watching a marvelous stage illusion because that is what the plot and storyline really are.<br /><br />In the wonderful and underestimated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AF5UQS">Vantage Point</a>, which was inspired by the Zapruder Film of JFK's assassination, we see an assassination attempt, but we also miss a great deal. As the film progresses, we are shown things, little things we actually saw earlier but this time around, they are actually explained. It's as if the viewer is the detective, seeing the answers unfold in a proper narrative ... something we did not get to see at the start. That is the delight: the trick was we started out thinking we'd never get it. The payoff is that we finally do get it: hence "VANTAGE POINT".<br /><br />In the more recent sci-fi thriller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007N1JC8">Primer</a> (see my review), several young physicists create a time machine. Though it has limited capabilities to send people into the recent past, the scientists make a horrid mistake - then a horrible discovery as they travel back in time repeatedly. They discover that they are leaving "past" versions of themselves running free, and at one point consider killing them all. The viewer, who is watching an objective narrative, actually begins to wonder if it is all a trick or what.<br /><br />Compared to these, THE PRESTIGE utterly fails. You will note, each film I suggested to you above has its payoff, and one does not have to bust open one's head to understand what's being shown. In other words, to borrow Hitchcock's term, in the great films, we 'get' the MacGuffin even if we have to wait a bit. Hitchcock never made the audience wait: he made the characters wait.<br /><br />Nolan, on the other hand, is doing something that viewers generally hate: playing tricks on us without ever really letting us in, thus no real payoff awaits us. It is plain the viewer can barely work out what happened and what didn't, and that is unfair. It is bad filmmaking.<br /><br />Apropos of the preceding, THE PRESTIGE truly insults the wonderful, hard work of Tesla, and the work of magicians everywhere. It also insults movie-making. It certainly insults the audience. My wife, who is a genius, a teacher and a polymath, says she hates films like this. "I don't want to have a stroke trying to decipher a film. I watch a film TO HAVE THINGS SHOWN AND EXPLAINED TO ME." Her own verbatim loud and insistent words. To a degree, I agree, my dear.<br /><br />Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are stellar and well worth seeing, the era portrayed has a convincing feel which is not easy to convey. The rest I leave to you to judge. This film is not real magic. It is a con game, and we are the suckers.<br /><br />UPDATED DISCLAIMER: Originally I did not address Telsa's machine; in a more recent disclaimer, I said it was obvious Tesla had invented a teleportation machine that did not function. Whether this was supposed to be an unworthy trick by Tesla, or simply a rotten lazy trick by director Nolan, it is still insulting and unfair to Tesla's good name. In Nolan's defense, I think he proved in his film that Tesla did indeed invent a cloning machine. That, I think, was Nolan's ultimate trick on the audience.<br /><br />Yet it was all remarkably blurred, in a way that leaves the audience to decide what's what. Make your own decision about what Tesla did and did not do. As for me, the film shows one thing objectively: Tesla invented one hell of a lightning machine for the era, no matter what else you think. Just recall at the end of the film, who would think of replicating a living being? And why would Tesla bother himself with inventing magic tricks? Think about it before you impose your 21st-century judgment on the storyline.<br /><br />Think of the following: 1. Angier fooled Cutter (Michael Caine) with his demonstration of the machine and never let Cutter backstage to see it work; 2. Despite what inattentive fans claim, ALL sequences showing cloning were OBJECTIVE, not read in any journals but recounted by Angier to Borden just after Borden shot him; 3. Fans say Angier who was really Lord Caldlow simply murdered his double, except Borden, being an identical twin, could sniff out the double from a mile away; 4. Cutter, at some stage during Borden's trial, tells the judge that the Tesla machine is "real", thus testifying that whatever it is supposed to do, it really does.<br /><br />It's all sloppy, I know, but WE are left to put two and two together.<br /><br />And remember what Nolan himself said: Tesla invented weird things we still can't explain. Jackman said the film doesn't make sense, and Bale said you have to see it twice to fully get it. Christopher Priest, author of the original novel, stated up front that Tesla was vital to the story because of his ultimate invention of a machine.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />The Prestige is an enjoyable enough and impeccably produced film, but the twists and turns are too many and too much to be believed, so much so that even the final "talking killer" revelatory moment doesn't tie up all the loose ends it's: fun to watch but increasingly frustrating to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>There have been many movies devoted to the misdirection, sleight of hand crowd.  Magic is a favorite theme of writers, actors, and film makers for the obvious reason that this craft so closely parallels their own, the spinning of illusion to make audiences forget for a moment what a dull, hard place the world can be by believing, however briefly, in something that is patently false.  It is a very participatory act, the engagement of the audience in the implausible construct is essential - indeed; that is where the "magic" resides.<br /><br />Almost without fail these movies make great sport of showing how performers fool their audiences, and one another; and their directors like to demonstrate that they too are magicians.  All this can lead to layer upon layer of falsehood, deception, trickery, and even confusion.  The Prestige is no exception.  At times one wishes for a scorecard, and the plodding of the plot gets a bit murky in the middle.  But there's enough intrigue to hold you for the big finish, and The Prestige keeps you guessing literally until the final seconds.<br /><br />One look at the cast tells you that somebody spent some serious money to put together a quality film.  Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Scarlett Johansson lead the way - all are excellent although Bale struggles with his Cockney accent.  London in the late 1800's is masterfully recreated, no small trick in its own right.  But what fuels this wonderful film is rivalry and hate, a grudge between two former friends and colleagues that just keeps going and going until it is no longer mere antagonism but the very reason for living - for them both.  For us, living over a century later, it may be hard to identify with two performers who would stop at nothing to claim the title of, "England's Greatest Magician".  Seems like wanting to be Denmark's Greatest Mime.  But magic is power, and a century ago, it was possible to hold an entire audience in the palm of your hand, if you had the right Prestige.<br /><br />Worth watching more than once, just so you can try to figure out how they did it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>This movie is well worth  watching, not just for fans of magic but for anyone who likes a good, character driven plot line.<br /><br />  Having said that, I caution viewers NOT to watch this if you are brain dead and simply looking for something mildly entertaining to view. This movie deserves full concentration and I found it a bit exhausting at times (but worthwhile).<br /><br />  This is a flawed film (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars) but it does so much SO well that it nearly pulls it off. Both Huge Jackman and Christian Bale are in top form, playing rival magicians, each with a special talents. Bale plays a magician with some spectacular skills but lacking in dramatic performance. Jackman has the drama down pat but isn't as talented a magician and he is obsessed with learning his rival's secrets. Add to that some romance, jealousy, a former friendship between the two magicians and Michael Caine as a superb wise man and observer of the whole situation and you have an excellent film.<br /><br />  Still, there is something lacking, perhaps because the director is relatively new. At times, the film seems to drag and there are a lot of loose ends that don't make sense unless you pay close attention (I actually had to go back, scene by scene, to put it all together after watching it the first time).<br /><br />  Even so, this movie is superior to so much that is out there and the actors do a superb job in delineating the dangers of obsession - as well as the rewards.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>"The Prestige" was made in 2006 and the time the action starts is the dawn of the 20th Century.  The story is about the obsession between rival magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who endeavor to reveal each other's secrets.  The competition escalates and the two illusionists start performing riskier tricks that turn deadly.<br /><br />The ending is just not expected or satisfying.  The complexity of the movie requires the audience to hang on every word and scene.  Overall the movie is interesting, sometimes thrilling and exciting, and worth the watch.  Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine and David Bowie also star in this movie about the dark-side of magic</p></br><a href="../users/A38I00SO3D9ZSM.html">A38I00SO3D9ZSM</a><br/><p>Set in Victorian era London and Colorado Springs, The Prestige is a story about two magicians/illusionists hell-bent on destroying each others' careers and, ultimately, their lives.  The movie is very captivating but entirely implausible.  Perhaps others do not have this same hang up, but it was hard for me to suspend belief that amazing technical advances -- that cannot be done today -- took place  a century ago.  There are many twists and turns in the plot, but each one is pretty easy to figure out before the "prestige" is revealed.<br /><br />Despite its implausibility and opaque "twists," it's an enjoyable film.  I've noticed over the years that Hollywood seems to put out movies on themes in bunches (e.g. Viet Nam movies in the 80's, tornado movies in the 90's etc.) and The Prestige's counterpart is The Illusionist.  Both stories use "magic" as a plot device; both are really about revenge and getting away with murder.  The Prestige is the better of the two sister films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I thought this was an entertaining, engrossing film, with enough of a plot twist to keep us engaged, and a freshing formalism to the script -- particularly in its use of plot symmetries and (metaphorical) mirror-image contrasts.  The acting was quite nice -- although the younger actors are all a tad callow, Michael Caine and David Bowie were both delightful onscreen, each stealing the show in his own way.  This is hardly a masterpiece or an immortal work of cinema, but it's several notches above the current state of action-suspense dramas, mid-decade in the '00s.  Definitely worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Prestige (Christopher Nolan, 2006)<br /><br />I remember, back at the beginning of 2006, a lot of talk about two movies with similar storylines coming out: Neil Burger's The Illusionist and Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Both period pieces featuring magicians, with big stars I like in the lead roles (Edward Norton and Christian Bale, respectively), both with a big mystery at the forefront. Burger was a relatively new director making a big splash, while Nolan had established himself with a really, really great movie, then had turned around and tarnished his reputation with one of the worst remakes imaginable (Insomnia). Needless to say, Ladbroke's could have opened a pool on which one would be better, if there were any objective criteria for judging such a thing. (Both, as it turns out, were nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar; both, quite deservedly, lost to El Laberinto del Fauno. The Prestige also picked up a nom for Best Art Direction. Guess what it lost to.) Well, I've now seen both, and while they're both enjoyable, I'm coming down on the side of the apes in this debate: I liked The Illusionist a lot better.<br /><br />The story concerns two magicians, Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who work their way up through the ranks as partners until a tragic onstage accident results in the death of Angier's wife Julia (Cheaper by the Dozen's Piper Perabo). The two become rivals, with their rivalry leading to Angier's own demise. This is not a spoiler; the opening scene of the movie shows us Borden being convicted of the crime. The question is, was there a crime at all? Much of the movie is told in flashback, showing us the manipulations that led to the trial.<br /><br />And this is its greatest weakness; the complex time structure of the film is in no way delineated, making it exceptionally hard to follow for much of its length. By the time you get into the rhythm of the time changes, the movie shifts back to the present. Thanks, Chris! On the upside, however, you've got an amazing stable of actors (aside from the above, a quick core sample reveals Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, David Bowie, and Ricky Jay), and they all perform at least reasonably well, while Nolan's directing still seems to be climbing back up; he still hasn't reached the pinnacle of Memento again, but he's getting there. (Interestingly, Memento is well-known for how deftly Nolan handled playing with the time element there; what happened here?) And, well, it does lack Rufus Sewell. There are very few movies that would not be improved by Rufus Sewell, who chewed so much wonderful scenery in The Illusionist.<br /><br />Still, for all that, if you can figure out the time element in The Prestige, which may take a few viewings, it's got a meaty mystery, some great emotional manipulation (by the characters, not by the director; this is a positive mark for any film coming out of emotionally-manipulative Hollywood these days), and a fun, if predictable, twist. Just remember: there are some things a cold chisel should never be used for. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>Adapting the novel which "The Prestige" was based on was no easy feat. The film's scenarists, brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wisely jettisoned the subplot from the novel set in the present time which chronicled the machinations of the descendants of the two principal characters. The Nolans also should be congratulated for turning the novel (which features separate diaries of the principal characters written in the first person) into a more coherent third person narrative. Some of the first person diary narration is retained in a series of voice overs but it's not overdone thus preserving the flavor of the novel.<br /><br />'The Prestige' concerns the running battle between the two well known stage magicians in turn of the century Victorian England, Borden and Angier. In the novel, Borden, a total stranger, initiates the conflict by attempting to expose his rival as a charlatan while Angier moonlights as a medium. In the film, Borden and Angier already know each other while working as apprentice magicians. The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two. They introduce Angier as already being married. Borden is warned by Cutter (the engineer/impresario played by Michael Caine) not to use a certain knot because it's too dangerous when tying Angier's wife's hands during a magic trick. Borden ignores Cutter's advice and as a result of his pig-headedness, Angier's wife drowns when she is unable to untie the knot after being placed underwater in a glass booth. Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing. Borden is depicted as being almost monstrous in the way he crassly ignores all safety procedures; what's more, others take no concrete action during the performance to prevent the mishap from occurring.<br /><br />Borden's pettiness is matched by Angier later on when he seeks to sabotage a series of Borden's stage acts. As the story develops, Angier shows up in a disguise at Borden's performances on more than one occasion. At one point he rigs a pistol causing it to misfire, which seriously injures Borden's hand. Soon afterward, Borden introduces a new stage act, "The Transported Man", where he steps into one door and then amazingly steps out of another door on the other side of the stage almost instantaneously. We later learn that Borden's assistant is actually his twin brother and the two have been working together to fool the public into believing that 'The Transported Man' is not an illusion.<br /><br />Angier ends up hiring a look-a-like so he can duplicate Borden's act. For a time it works, but his double is a drunkard who ends up blackmailing him for more money. Angier wants to know the secret to Borden's act, so he enlists his assistant, Olivia, to steal Borden's diary. When he gets his hands on the diary, he realizes he is unable to decode it, so with the help of Cutter, he kidnaps Borden's assistant and holds him for ransom. In exchange for his assistant (who is actually his twin brother), Borden gives him the 'key word' to decode the diary: "Tesla".<br /><br />Tesla of course is a real character in history who was Edison's rival in the early development of electricity. Borden had met Tesla earlier and employs electrical sparks from Tesla's 'alternating current' generator in his act. Angier goes to Colorado to meet Tesla and offers to buy his generator which he believes can transport matter. As it turns out (and this undermines the film's entire plot), the machine doesn't transport people but actually clones them. Angier goes back to London and every time he uses Tesla's device, a new Angier appears. After each act, ludicrously, Angier is forced to murder each newly created double (and stores the corpses in tanks underneath the stage).<br /><br />The Prestige has a subplot involving Borden's wife. Sarah, who is unaware of the existence of his twin brother. She learns of Olivia but doesn't understand that its Borden's twin brother who is having the affair with her. Ultimately she commits suicide.<br /><br />The film's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances. Borden is arrested and found guilty at trial of the murder. After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2. We learn that the man executed was actually Borden's twin brother and the Angier who ended up drowning was actually one of Angier's clones. Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience. As Tesla's machine along with Angier's 'glass tanks' go up in flames beneath the stage, we can see inside one of them: it's one of the 100 Angier clones, still preserved and evidence of the failed career of a monomaniac.<br /><br />'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design. The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England. Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel). Christian Bale is convincing as Borden but Hugh Jackman's Angier is ordinary. Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla. The women are not developed at all in the novel and unfortunately nothing much is done with them here in the film.<br /><br />The principal characters' obsession in attempting to undermine one another takes on a one-note quality thus exposing the characters as one-dimensional. In addition, once the plot veers off into science fiction/fantasy where people are cloned in a blink of an eye, the best one can say about the film is that it would be more fitting as a third-rate Twilight Zone episode. Nonetheless, 'The Prestige' still manages to hold one's interest as it is 'different' and wins points for mood and atmosphere, providing a glimpse into the rarely looked at world of magic during the Victorian era.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>but, if you expect me to retell the plot, you have come to the wrong place. i never do it, it spoils the experience.<br />but i can tell you the story of this movie is brilliant, intriguing, full of twists, and it keeps your eyes locked on the screen thruout the movie.<br />brilliant acting by jackman and bale, but also by bowie as tesla.<br />costumes, jewellery, all so authentic, paired with great acting makes it almost real.<br />the story, as always, is universal story of humanity - of love, passion, sacrifice, choices, obsession, deceit.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>Some things made this movie OK and some things made it kind of annoying.  Bad first.  Christian Bale, what a boar.  His whole presence is kind of loathsome and false.  If there was a sympathetic character it would be Hugh Jackman's character.  So I found it rather disappointing in the end that he loses and not the other way around.  A rather unsatisfying ending that lacks justice, considering that Bale's character starts the whole feud initially by carelessly causing Jackman's wife's death.  Gonna have to throw Caine's performance in with that of Bale's as well.  I was not impressed by the acting and the crappy English accents.  The story however has moments of interest of the kind that decent science fiction is likely to arouse.  David Bowie actually put in a pretty good performance as Dr Tesla.  If there was a was a hero I'd have thought it to be Jackman's character.  I actually could stand watching him (unlike Bale and often Caine whose characters just seemed so "put on" and finally just annoying).  Anyway, 3 stars for acting.  The story (minus the lame ending) I actually give 4 stars as I liked the injection of real sci-fi (in the name of "science" of course) into the mix and it raised philosophical questions about the ethics of "murdering an immediate and exact replica of yourself" - do you have the right to do it?  The movie seems to tell us no and perhaps they are right.  Fortunately science hasn't advanced to the stage where immediate clones are a possibility, but it does make you think a little (and only a little).  So the flimsy concept of the movie is half entertaining though still a bit longish at times.  I'd have forgiven the longishness if the acting (and accents) had been more worthwhile, but there was only so much of the Christian Bale character's nonsense that I could take which made those longish moments all the longer.<br /><br />It's a half decent film with some entertainment value, but if it won any awards for acting I would be extremely surprised.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>At 2 hours 10 minutes, this could have ended much sooner and been a tauter film as a result. The ending left me scratching my head just a bit. Most of the movie is a bit jerkily edited, so viewers have to pay attention. Are we in the present? The recent past? The future? It keeps jumping around, somewhat annoyingly. The second half bogs down a bit. I had to pause several times out of boredom, never a good sign for a movie. Was it really like this in the Victorian era? I wasn't entirely convinced. I did do one double take: yes, that's David Bowie as Tesla, the electrician, though what that was all about, I still don't know.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>I had really great expectations for this film and I was looking forward to see it, especially after I saw 'The Illusionist' recently. Too bad that my expectations for this flick weren't met, ... and that doesn't mean this movie is bad as in fact, it is a very good movie. The acting by Caine, Jackman and Bale is just superb, and the mood is very well captured.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me though was that the apparently bad guy (played by Bale) seems to be favored. When you watch this motion picture, you have to think and concentrate as in a sense from the makeup it's almost a type of Sherlock Holmes mystery although there isn't a detective in sight ... it's just a mystery with a suprising final.<br /><br />Now did I like this movie better than 'The Illusionist'? Can't say, although I have a tendency to favor 'The Illusionist' but I guess both films are well worth watching as both films have their surprises, excellent acting, great mood capturing with good photography.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see David Bowie in 'The Prestige' and too bad he hasn't been in too many films throughout his life as he's an excellent actor too.<br /><br />If the interest is predominantly in magic and the ultimate tricks and illusions, then most Criss Angel episodes will be more interesting and do it more justice in this regard than both of these films. But again, 'The Prestige' as well as 'The Illusionists' are very good films and are enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2KW2KWKABNYNO.html">A2KW2KWKABNYNO</a><br/><p>After hearing the praise from critics and the public alike, I decided to give the movie a try. After telling my father all the great thing I'd heard about the movie, and its considerably high position on IMDB, he decided to watch it with me. Well, he made it about 30 minutes through the movie, and left. I made it about an hour, maybe an hour and a half through the movie till I was too frustrated and confused to keep going.<br /><br />Story: I was so confused by the convoluted, confusing plot, I had to go to a myriad of sites with a full movie synopsis, to figure out what the heck was even going on. And even then, I was still out in the dark. So even though Christopher Nolan has never been one to make a simple plot, this one is way over the top. But wait, that's not all. This movie moves at a slower pace than most days watching C-Span. I mean good gosh, while this movie is at least a good two hours, it feels like you're watching a Peter Jackson movie. And the worst part is, you don't feel as if you spent your time wisely.<br /><br />Performances: Although the actors were good at portraying it, there was really only one emotion in the movie, anger. Not that hard to do. However, I was very surprised at the appearance of David Bowie as the character of Tesla, who I didn't even know existed till this movie.<br /><br />Mood: Very dark; Victorian London was never one for bubbling joy, but really, this is downright depressing. But, that's what this movie is going for, it's not supposed to be easy to swallow, or even fun, it's supposed to teach you a lesson, which I will get to in Morals. But, on terms of mood, the movie achieves what it's going after, and the amazing visual effects only compliment it even further. And again, Nolan knows how to create the mood he wants.<br /><br />Morals: Basically, the movie is about topping one another, and rivalries. And this is a rather bitter one, from crushing of birds, to wives dying, to trying to kill the other. By the end of the movie, you don't really care if any of them go, because they're acting worse than children. In fact, at times they're rather hateful, rageful, and use rather disturbing and strange ways to take their revenge. And of course, by the end, nobody wins.<br /><br />Overall: A very strange, confusing, slow, depressing movie, that really doesn't bring anything new to the table. Sure Christopher Nolan is good, at creating the mood of the movie, but it's not really a great mood. In fact, the number one mistake you can make in a story is you don't care for any of the characters. This movie only gives you more reasons to not like them. So if you like movies that only a critic could love, or you understand complicated story lines, or just like strange moral lessons, then this is the movie for you. For me at least, three words: Over The Top.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Unfortunately, I can't share the enthusiasm of other reviewers. I honestly want to, but I disagree almost entirely with their reviews. This whole movie is a sleight of hand trick, where Christopher Nolan presents you with what you think is a quality film: renowned actors, beautiful cinematography, a supposedly well-crafted script. The problem is that you begin to see the cracks in the presentation fairly quickly.<br /><br />In a story about two rival magicians, Christian Bale tries as hard as ever to pump life into this film, while Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine put forth equal amounts of intensity, but without a solid grounding there's still not much to go with. Scarlett Johansson really drags here with a wavering English accent that annoys more each time it falters. David Bowie really stands out in an unrecognizable turn as Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />The main problem with The Prestige is that it sets itself up for failure. Imagine going to see a great magician perform an infamous trick, and as he flies over the crowd, the strings holding him up become visible. You'd be utterly disappointed, and that's what watching this film is like. Each twist is either entirely predictable or so far-fetched that it belongs in the realm of science fiction.<br /><br />There's just something missing in this film that will ultimately leave audience members feeling like they've been tricked. And I guess that's the point of a good magic show, but with a good magic show, you shouldn't really be able to point out HOW you've been tricked should you?</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>For a movie about murder, revenge, and obsession, The Prestige is remarkably passionless. With thin characters and a thick plot, that's hardly surprising. But the cold core of The Prestige is chilled further by a story that is so mechanistic, so structured like Lego? blocks, and so populated with intellectually interesting, but unsatisfying diversions, that it simply never rises above being a series of pretty pictures and rookie chess moves.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing? To a degree. The story line is sufficiently interesting, if improbable and ultimately unsatisfying, to be a pleasant enough diversion. Despite being given so little to work with, Jackman and Bale draw you in with charisma alone, and it's nice to see Michael Caine. Scarlett Johansson, who I love, is weak, but looks great.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>This movie is ultimately confusing to someone who's a natural blonde like me. It starts at the end, ends at the beginning, and throws in an unnatural amount of twists & turns throughout the duration. It's complicated, and it doesn't help that I was trying to work out the final twist, but I didn't. It was right there I should have done.<br /><br />The Prestige has an outstanding cast, including Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale (who I'm still not sure about as an actor), a short turn by Piper Perabo, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johannssen and a surprising appearance by David Bowie! Of all people! (He's looking old.)<br /><br />I have to say this movie kept me riveted throughout, but I just couldn't understand it. A big hand for all those who could. I just couldn't follow it. But why should a film about magicians/illusionists be straight forward?</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) are apprentices  working for stage magician Cutter (Michael Caine).

Borden gets a wife, child, and mistress (Scarlett Johansson), while Angier goes to scientist Tesla (David Bowie) in search of the ultimate illusion.<br /><br />This film is often compared with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist</a>,"  which is also about a performing magician at the turn of the 20th century, but this movie isn't nearly as good.  The actors do their job (Caine and Johansson are the best; Bale has an oddly 21st century hair cut) and the period is recreated nicely, but I didn't care about or like anyone.  The story  was endlessly confusing, and ultimately based on something that is impossible.  The reveal makes you say, "Oh," instead of "OH!"  Dialogue is often mumbled, and I wasn't even sure of the two main characters' names for a long time.  Their appearance and personalities are too similar; neither stands out as a "hero."  It would have been much better had it been told chronologically, but scenes are in random order, which is irritating.  We know the ending from the beginning, so there is no build-up of tension and the magic isn't fun.  Disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>Sorry it had just too too many cute things for me to enjoy it.It isn't till the end of the movie that it becomes clear WHY the wife of one of the main characters knew when her husband said 'I love you' and he meant it and the days when he said it and he didn't mean it ...

A lot of people compare it to The Illusionist, but in fact we have two very different films here. The Prestige tells the story of Robert (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred (Christian Bale), two friends who make their living as magicians in London. The two start to become competatitve and try and outdo each other with every new trick. When Alfred performs the amazing transportation trick it drives Robert insane as he tries to figure out the secret. His assistant played by Michael Caine says he uses a double, but Robert believes otherwise. He travels to see Nikola Tesla (played surprisingly well by David Bowie), a mysterious man who designed a machine for Alfred once. Tesla's assistant is played by the one and only Andy Serkis who is finally branching away from Peter Jackson. What follows is a great and entertaining film, but it's really more about the tricks and the twists than it is about the characters.<br /><br />  The film is incredibly stylish and it has Christopher Nolan written all over it. He crafts a great film and follows the structure of the magician's act. Act one of the film is indeed the pledge, and we see something that seems ordinary but probably isn't. This seemingly innocent rivalry is more than meets the eye. Act two is the turn in where the magician makes this ordinary something become extraordinary. This point comes when Alfred performs the inexplicably amazing transportation trick. We think we know what's going on, but Nolan knows where he's leading his audience; we know nothing. The final act is called the prestige, where all the twists and turns are presented to the audience. Once this suspense ride finally resolves and ends, the audience is left sitting tensely in their seats as the screen fades to black. "Directed By Christopher Nolan" appears on the screen and we realize who the true magician is. The film is a wild ride with incredible atmosphere and great acting. You truly are captivated by the setting of the film. David Julyan's tense ambient score keeps things on the edge and Wally Pfister's dark and muted cinematography creates the perfect mood. The only flaw of the film is the lack of emotion we as the audience have for the characters. Throughout the entire film we are thinking "oh, what turn is going to happen next?!", not "what is going to happen to Robert!". Don't get me wrong, the characters are strong enough to carry the film, but the film should be centered around them not the magic.<br /><br />ACTING: As in terms of acting we get a fine slate. Christopher Nolan brings his Batman Begins buddies back and we have Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman has the lead role with supporting work from David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Scarlett Johansson. Christian Bale steals the show and crafts a very deceiving character, which all the more helps the impact of the twist ending. Bale finally gets to act with his native English accent, and it's interesting to hear him with it since we are so used to him speaking with an American accent. Hugh Jackman does a superb job at matching Bale's screen presence. The acting is great all around, and it always is when it's a Nolan film.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Nolan delivers a crafty and suspenseful film. It's visually stunning with great cinematography and set design. However, on the character side it lacks to deliver an emotional punch, the film is purely contextual. It's a great movie though that promises to entertain.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>I think that the reason I found The Prestige so entertaining is the fact that 1)It had a good cast of actors. 2) It was directed by Christopher Nolan  and 3) It was just a good chance to go into a movie and fall into the story.  There are moments when the storyline is so seemless and dark and intriguing that I was instantly reminded of Nolan's Batman Begins.  The Prestige is a thriller.  It is sort of a mystery. And it's dark.  Nolan prowls the streets of darkness with authority.  Moving performances by Jackman and Bale.<br /><br />Two aspiring magicians are at odds to ruin each others lives both professionally and privately.  After the death of his wife in a botched water-chamber trick, Robert Angier makes it his mission to defame and destroy the man he holds responsible for his wife's untimely demise,  Alfred Borden!  Angier  is a master showman, full of charisma, spell-binding audiences with his charm.  Borden is a masterful illusionist, bringing the impossible alive on stage.  Each is seeking to become the greatest magician of all time, cullng their bitterness into obsession, seeking the secrets to each other's illusions.<br /><br />In a time when such great cinematic distractions like Pan's Labrynth and Apocalypto were taking my attention, The Prestige was a good contender for my time. Christopher Nolan does not disappoint.  Michael Caine.  Scarlett Johnsson.  David Bowie.  Great supporting cast.  The ending isn't as mind-blowing as I expected, but it was defintely cool.  Pure story, the way I like my movies.  Not a lot of things to pick on.  Jackman and Bale have emerged a fine actors.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NLZVP501JM5Z.html">A1NLZVP501JM5Z</a><br/><p>Wow.  This movie is awesome.  The Twists and turns are just awesome.  I really like how Nolan connected it all together.  If you guess one twist you get hit by 3 more you didn't see coming.  I loved it.  The action, suspense, mystery, drama.  Christopher Nolan is becoming one of the best directors out there.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic.  Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine all are great.  I love the accent on Bale's character.  The biggest achievement for me though was that I forgot I was watching Batman, Wolverine, Gollum, and Alfred.  I really felt I knew these characters.  That is a huge credit to Nolan and the actors.  I actually think Jackman is a great actor now and not just a great action actor.  He gives a helluva performance.  Bale is also extraordinary.  I could keep going on and on, but I'll stop.  Just go see this movie.  I smell Oscars!<br /><br />Oh.  Do not GO TO THE BATHROOM OR LEAVE THE THEATRE!!!!!!!!!!!

Is it  too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at  identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much!<br /><br />When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and our country's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to "win!" As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even committ murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world!<br /><br />While the word "obsession" is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - "the banality of evil." How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - "right and wrong." The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, "and the best" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story!<br /><br />The only very small bright spot in this entire dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story.  His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through Amazon's search engine, and see for your self!)</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Prestige is a slow, tepid, and completely annoying film thanks to all those tricks and twists. I can't believe how boring this film was, Christian Bale is a talented actor but his character makes you just want to punch him about 500 times, he is so unappealing in this role. To my surprise Hugh Jackman is the character you feel the most sympathy for, too bad he plays such a sucker in this one. And oh god that old-looking, shallow, and unattractive Scarlett Johanseen is enough to ruin anybody's day, ugh! The film has a good premise but all the "I got you" surprises becomes too much and I lost interest after 45 minutes, the ending was cruel and lacked spontaneity. Stay away from this stinker.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences. The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. A movie with the power of becoming a cult classic, ''The Prestige'' is magical. In every sense of the word.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>What can be said so early in the game about one of the greatest films ever made? Are you watching carefully? Did you miss something? Yes ... you heard right.<br /><br />The Prestige is not the greatest film ever made, but it does belong in that special group of films that breaks the mold, sets a framework to be emulated and creates something within the film that is greater than the film itself. More questions than answers are put to the viewer as the movie progresses and the film has qualities that stay with the viewer long after the film has ended, creating debate. As simple as an order as this may seem to fill, it is not simple by a long shot, as even subjectively, a lot of film, both modern and classic, can be completely forgettable.<br /><br />Often, during the initial release of a film, it can be grossly overlooked and treated so unfairly that the rancor and the bitterness that precedes it can often overshadow the film for some time, often decades or longer. This has been evinced numerous times in the last 75 years of filmmaking, and more so when a film is made that has all the qualities of a workman-like production. Casablanca was a film that was one of many projects that the director Michael Curtiz was working on at the time and one of a total of one hundred and seventy two productions during his career. It has been often stated that when the film was made, no one thought much about the gravitas, or the film as being special or even close to becoming the classic that it now is.<br /><br />The Prestige was met on a lot of fronts during its release to a sharp rebuke and then a continuous and growing wave of criticism. It didn't help that The Illusionist was also released during the same period, thus giving the viewer a large dosing of Victorian era magic and prestidigitation. Woody Allen's Scoop also made its presence known but was probably the most forgettable Allen film to date. One wonders if these things are a matter of coincidence or strong wrangling of studio one-upmanship. The kind of rivalry that is all too spelled out in the film and leads each party down a dark road. It makes a viewer wonder how much money was lost by trying to overwhelm an audience rather than growing an interest and feeding an audience slowly, much in the way of J. K. Rowling. Who as we know, hasn't done very well with her book to screen adaptations and the revenue that's been collected.<br /><br />The Masterpiece set in Steampunk ...<br /><br />Steampunk is a subversive and somewhat underused term that describes a genre of film, writing, sometimes music and art. Steampunk is usually defined as:<br /><br />works set in an era or world where steam power is still widely used--usually the 19th century, and often set in Victorian era England--but with prominent elements of either science fiction or fantasy, such as fictional technological inventions like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, or real technological developments like the computer occurring at an earlier date.<br /><br />In general, the category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate-history version of an actual historical period) where the Industrial Revolution has already begun but electricity is not yet widespread, with an emphasis on steam, or spring-propelled gadgets. It can also be defined as Psuedo-Victorian, neo-Victorian, retro-futurism and multiple other variances.<br /><br />The first usage of the word was in 1987 by K.W. Jeter while discussing his ideas about `Victorian fantasies' during an exchange with Locus magazine for his 1979 novel Morlock Night and the debate over who was the first author to step into the genre. That discussion aside, Steampunk references can easily be found in earlier works such as The Wild Wild West Television series and a few select novels. Although alternate history and merging timeline tales regarding Sherlock Holmes have been around for the last forty years. K.W. Jeter though is graced with the honor of having coined the phrase and establishing the genre past something vague and indescribably uncanny.<br /><br />During the late 1990's and well into the next century, film makers began to fully realize the genre and embrace it with both hands. Twenty five films or more can be found in between Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and The Prestige.<br /><br />Steampunk on film is usually represented with mechanistic devices that appear new to the eye and in perfect working order and placed in a setting that does not seem out-of place or intentionally out-of place. The meat of the sub-genre is that the reader and the viewer both have to believe that the Steampunk elements are perfectly sewn into the fabric of the world being presented. In the film Van Helsing, Steampunk artifacts run headlong into the decrepit world of Gothic Europe where mechanistic objects take an incredibly rugged and utilized look. The Back to The Future series raised the bar on presenting Steampunk in both a used and new environment, especially the third film which is set in the Old American West. The storyline of Back To The Future however, allowed the deviance into a decrepit depiction of the objects as the DeLorean time machine, the flux capacitor and the repetitive models and other home-made devices had already been established. The items that get presented for the first time, like the brass scope on Doc Brown's large-bore rifle, are shown as new. This is a minor distinction for the viewer and may seem tedious to read, but it is an important point and widely argued by the artists and craftspeople that spend their time making said objects. The difference between new and used is as important for effect as moonlight and sunlight. The two are distinct and both have their own place. Overlooking this fact is often done in cinema, does currently go unnoticed by many, but noted by those watching for it. Recent Steampunk attempts include The Golden Compass, which failed miserably at the box-office despite much fan-fare and J.K. Rowlings' film adaptation of The Order of The Phoenix, which continually delves deeper into the genre as each film progresses.<br /><br />The Prestige shows a world where the exterior is run-down and over-advertised. Flyers, advertisements and printed paper abounds in almost every corner of the film in the outside world, painting a bleak and burgeoning depiction of the Industrial Revolution that was all around them at the time. In some instances, the idea of Steampunk is necessary to cast a more progressive light on a bleak situation, thus upping the dramatic ante.<br /><br />Typically, period film is often devoid of such intense detail as it comes across as distracting and cluttered. Also, from a film-maker's perspective, often the only thing that is important is where the camera will land and be focused. Unfortunately, too many directors lead set-dressers and prop-masters to believe that extra-ordinary detail is unnecessary. But time, and the workings of the last decade has changed these ideas much.<br /><br />Thus the Industrial Revolution will undoubtedly be one of the most visual influences upon film that ever was. Future filmmaker's will most likely depend upon it heavily as the information age wanes and something newer emerges. Drawing from established mythology is a habitual practice of the workman like mentality of both apprentice and master craftsmen in all trades.<br /><br />On some level, The Prestige, for all intent and purpose, does fit the criteria of the later defined sub-genre of Gas-light romance, which is specific in centering on already established figures in history. The inclusion of Nikola Tesla in the film would meet the requirement for such a re-labeling, but the point would be lost as Gas-light romance is newly defined and the protagonists are amalgams of people that once lived and made their fortunes like the fictional Robert Angier and Alfred Borden.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, as all new ages emerge, they are often met with both wonder and fear as it is the unknown that approaches and the unknown being man's greatest fear.<br /><br />A strange, but not-so singular case against Roger Ebert ...<br /><br />The reason for the cold reception of The Prestige can not just be put squarely at the feet of one man, but can be utilized to show a pattern of behavior. Some may read this a think that I'm being unnecessarily harsh on Roger Ebert, but let me explain. While Roger Ebert has enjoyed a very distinguished career in the public eye as a film critic and probably the only critic within the culture that has risen to such a height doing so, thus far, he has an uncanny ability to see past some of the greatest films released on his watch. Dismissing a film so outwardly, barely even mentioning the film within the review, as if the attempt was a complete disappointment and a waste of effort, speaks volumes of the type of disdain Roger Ebert has for the work of a certain type of film ... namely, masterpieces. The reason why this chapter deals squarely with Roger Ebert, is in part that it is wise to deal with the detractors honestly.<br /><br />In 1984, Roger Ebert gave the same type of treatment to a certain Science-Fiction classic that ended up proving to be seen as the most perfect Science-Fiction film ever made and also one of the best films of all time. Blade Runner was panned by Ebert and he ripped viciously into Ridley Scott being the vanguard for a wave of negativity to quickly follow. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that `Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film. The same exact thing repeats itself with Christopher Nolan and his film The Prestige, where he barley makes a single mention of the film, except in passing but gushes profusely and lovingly at its lesser counterpart The Illusionist and dotes upon the graven image of Edward Norton and his `Van Dyke' beard. While the community at large, often prides itself on promoting themselves as individual thinkers, if Ebert had not been so flippant toward The Prestige, it is easy, and simple, to surmise that the others would have followed suit as is often the case with mainstream reviewing. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews on Blade Runner, which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time.<br /><br />In Ebert's Review of The Prestige, he talks long and hotly about Harry Houdini and his love of magic. The review of the film just seems like the vehicle in which he makes his rant, thus trying to land a fatal blow upon the neck of Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Some readers may now lay this down as they cannot bear the humanizing of their movie-reviewing idol, but the real message of this essay would've quickly been lost upon them. Roger Ebert is not the message here, just a final footnote.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`The Prestige' marks one of the finest films I've seen this year, complete in every sense of the word. It's dark and mysterious and funny and strange and eerie and disturbing and thought provoking and engaging and unique in everyway possible. From star performances by Christian Bale, High Jackman and Michael Caine as well as titillating eye candy in Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo, `The Prestige' enlists an all star cast to help tell the twisted story of two rival magicians bound together by a tragic event that haunts their every action.<br /><br />When Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) accidentally causes the death of Robert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife Julia (Piper Perabo) not only is their friendship instantly over but they are now rivals, in every aspect of their lives. The film begins with the death of Robert Angier at the supposed hands of Alfred Bordon. As we await the result of the trial we are given, in flashbacks, the events that preceded the murder. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career highpoints here, adding layers upon layers to their characters and giving us, the viewer, every reason in the world to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of this movie away so I don't want to write too much. This film is utterly brilliant and one that is sure to please. I myself was utterly impressed with every second of this film and am positive that you will be as well. There has been much mention of the twists and turns this film takes and the surprise ending, just note that you may think you know, even I thought I knew, but I really had no idea. Excellent, excellent film!</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Act One: The Pledge<br /><br />London. The early 1900s.<br /><br />Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are each apprentices to another magician (Ricky Jay), serving as audience plants. During the act, they "volunteer" to come up on stage to check the knots on the magician's assistant, Sarah (Rebecca Hall) before she is lowered into a vat of water and escapes behind a drawn curtain. Borden checks her wrists, Angier her ankles before giving her shapely legs a discreet kiss. One night, Sarah is unable to get out and Cutter (Michael Caine), the Magician's engineer, breaks the glass to release her. But he is too late and she dies. Angier is understandably distraught, the Assistant is his wife and he believes Borden is responsible. The knots at her wrist allow the escape.<br /><br />Thus begins a rivalry between the two magicians that will last for years, each of them trying to outdo the other, learn each other's secrets and to destroy the other, personally and professionally.<br /><br />The rivalry comes to a head when Borden develops a trick called The Disappearing Man. Angier wants it and learns Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), a rival of Thomas Edison's, developed it for Borden. Throughout, they play games with each other and each other's lovers, trying to prove who the better magician, the better man is.<br /><br />Act Two: The Turn<br /><br />Written by brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan and directed by Christopher ("Memento", "Batman Begins", "Insomnia"), "The Prestige" presents a complicated, involving tale of two competing magicians who are seeking to become the best in their field. Their pursuit involves revenge, making them cold hearted in their quest. While the film is beautiful, technically outstanding and very interesting, this cold heartedness makes it way into the story, robbing the film of some emotion and some of its power.<br /><br />Nolan is clearly interested in making the same types of films I am interested in watching because every one of his films has been very good or great. How many filmmakers are accomplished enough to create a film like "Memento" as their second film? Not many. Then to follow that with "Insomnia" and "Batman Begins", well, we have a talent on our hands. He seems to enjoy exploring the dark sides of his characters, exposing them to our gaze. This makes these characters intrinsically more interesting. To have a hero's dark side exposed gives us more to think about and to ponder, making them more fully developed.<br /><br />In "The Prestige", Nolan takes two of our most interesting actors and casts them in a battle against one another.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally good. Bale plays the darker, more enigmatic role. Jackman plays the more distraught, grieving member of the duo.<br /><br />After Angier loses his wife, he becomes obsessed with revenge. He wants to make sure he is the better magician than his rival, trying to constantly outdo Borden. But that isn't enough. He also seeks to destroy the other magician's life; straining his relationship with his wife, affecting the life of their daughter, destroying his on stage persona.<br /><br />As Angier sets about this task, Jackman gives him subtlety, so that even when he is acting like a jerk, we still care for him. A large part of this is that we don't always know what is going on, and even when we do, the other member of the duo may be doing something equally as underhanded, balancing it out. So Jackman's Angier is not a bad guy, nor is he a Saint, but he is interesting.<br /><br />Jackman's performance is very good. Even though he is on a quest for revenge, he reveals his obsession in subtle doses. At no point does he stop, stare off screen and break into a maniacal grin.<br /><br />Bale's Borden has a couple of key similarities to his rival and one key difference. He is also obsessed with revenge; as soon as Angier extracts revenge, he changes Borden's life and he then sets a plan for revenge in motion. But Borden wants to be the best Magician. He doesn't care if he has an audience, or fame, he simply wants to amaze people, to be an artist. Angier wants to be a star and this motivates both of them because Angier realizes it will make his own quest more difficult, Borden is more committed to his craft.<br /><br />But Borden's quest for revenge makes him cold and a little heartless as well. He falls in love and marries Julia (Piper Perabo). They have a child. His wife soon realizes that Borden only really loves her on certain days. She asks "Do you love me?" and he will respond "Yes, of course." Some days, she believes him. Others, she knows he isn't truthful. Late in the film, he announces "Not today". When he loves her, the character is full fledged and intensely interesting, but on those other days, he is too cold.<br /><br />When both main characters have hearts of ice, the film has little emotional core, making it seem hollow. It's too bad both characters are unable to show their determination to extract revenge and their humanity at the same time. If this were the case, we would have a five star film on our hands. Without that emotional core, we just have a very good film.<br /><br />Michael Caine plays Cutter, the engineer who creates new tricks. After the accident on stage, Angier approaches him and asks him to work for him. Throughout, he takes on the role of wise old sage, teaching the other two men about the life of a magician. The role is good, and a necessary part of the story, but Caine has certainly done more exciting work in the past.<br /><br />Scarlett Johannson appears in her third of four films with a British accent. As Angier's assistant, she becomes a pawn in the game of revenge and does a good job. Again, nothing outstanding, but interesting. Why this rising young actress would take essentially a bit part is beyond me.<br /><br />Act Three: The Prestige<br /><br />But Nolan is a true artist with his writing. From the beginning, he weaves a complicated, intricate tale about the two magicians. We watch as Angier arrives in Colorado Springs to meet with the mysterious Tesla. Is that a limp? How did that happen? Then we watch as Borden faces trial for the murder of Angier. In a flash back, we watch as Angier performs the Disappearing Man trick and falls into a locked vat of water. Unable to escape, he dies. Then someone delivers Angier's journal to Borden in prison. As Borden reads his rival's journal, we learn of his story. Nolan then sets two stories in motion, crossing back and forth between different timelines, revealing keys to the mystery to us in small pieces.<br /><br />Essentially, Nolan has created a jigsaw puzzle and all of the pieces fit. He and his co-writer, his brother, have worked out every detail, to make sure it fits. Key details may not be recognized at the time, but everything fits into place.<br /><br />The framework of the story is also very interesting. Both men are reading through the journals of their rival. As they begin reading, we hear the other man narrate the story and we soon are watching a flashback. This method ensures that we only learn certain things when Nolan wants us to learn them. It is a neat trick. He has created a method of storytelling that essentially keeps us in the dark until he is ready to let us in on the secret. But it works.<br /><br />This is a film with multiple revelations. Frankly, one of the revelations involving Bale's Borden was not as surprising or shocking as Nolan intended it to be. There are many scenes leading up to this moment and it was not hidden that well. That aside, the other revelations are well performed, proving Nolan may just be a magician himself.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is one of the most interesting to watch films I have seen this year. But the key performances are lacking just that extra little oomph to push the film to the top. They are just too damn cold and the film lacks an emotional heart. Without a heart, it is difficult to become fully engrossed in Mr. Nolan's magic.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>This is the third film to be released in 2006 that deals with magicians and the second of the three to take place in Europe at the turn of the 20th century.  It is also the second to star Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson.  However, each film has been unique and this one is probably the best of the three (The Illusionist is a close second and Scoop is a distant third).<br /><br />Telling the story of two rival magicians over the course of a few years (starting somewhere in the 1890s and ending around 1900), The Prestige is a great story of love, revenge, duality, and mystery.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) start out as assistants to a fairly prominent magician.  They are "plants"; they pretend to be audience members brought on stage to assist with a trick.  Known as the Water Escape, the magician's female assistant, who is also Angier's wife, is bound and lowered into a tank of water only to escape within seconds.  However, when Borden alters the knot he ties to make it look harder to untie, he inadvertantly causes her to drown.  This starts a bitter rivalry between Angier and Borden; they each strive to become famous magicians and outdo the other.  Angier disrupts one of Borden's shows, so Borden in turn does the same.  As the story continues, Angier hires Harry Cutter (Michael Caine), a man whose profession is to build the devices magician's use for their illusions, and Olivia Wenscombe (Johannson) to be his new assistant.  Meanwhile, Borden tends to perform shows by himself.  We soon learn that while Borden is definitely the better magician (he can instantly spot how his colleagues perform even the most baffling illusions), he is a terrible showman.  Even though his act is comprised of great illusions, he cannot keep the audience interested.  Angier on the other hand is a wonderful performer; he knows how to engage the audience and build up tricks.  However, he is nowhere near the magician that Borden is.  Despite Angier's self-realized inferiority, the rivalry continues to heat up, and despite the warnings of Cutter, Olivia, and even scientist Nichola Tesla (David Bowie) of what an obsession can do to a man, they each try to continually outdo the other.<br /><br />The story is not told linearly.  It starts out near the end with Borden being arrested, and most of the movie is a flashback due to Borden reading Angier's diary in prison.  However, there are plenty of flashbacks within the flashback, as there are scenes where Angier is describing in his diary of reading Borden's diary.  Though this may sound confusing, it is actually fairly easy to keep track of where scenes fall in continuity.  Directory Christopher Nolan, who also did the amazing Memento and Batman Begins, is a master of non-linear story-telling, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />The central mysteries of the film are very well-done; they are interesting and have good payoffs, but the best part about them is that there are enough clues for them to be figured out.  They are not easy to figure out, but keen observers may be able to piece certain things together to find the answers (I was able to put most of the stuff together, but I did miss one or two details).  This doesn't take away from the film at all, in fact it enhances it and makes it fun to try and see where things are going.<br /><br />Everything about The Prestige is well done, from the acting to the effects to the writing.  There's a reason why it was the number 1 film at the box office after its first weekend, so make sure you don't miss this.</p></br><a href="../users/A146H6A41B26QT.html">A146H6A41B26QT</a><br/><p>The "prestige" is the finale of a magic trick--the "AHA" moment when the escape artist extricates himself, the disappearing man appears in another location, the sawn-in-half woman is whole again. In this story a finale goes terribly wrong, and two partners embark on a deadly rivalry to be the first to perform the ultimate trick. The plot twists and turns in ways I certainly couldn't forsee, but I left the film not only puzzling over what had really happened, but more interestingly, wondering what was going on inside the heads of these two men as they lived the lives they had created for themselves. There's no real winner here; rather we see a tense pyschological battle that leads to more than one deadly end. Comparisons to "The Illusionist" are inevitable, but these are two entirely different movies. Enjoy them both!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I watched this movie within hours of watching 'The Illusionist'. I think I have had my fill of "magic" for a while. 'The Prestige' is a superior film to 'The Illusionist' in many ways. It was not as easy to see where it was going and the characters were more fleshed out. I did find it a little too long and tedious, with a trim here and there it would have made this a much better film. Movies like this are spoiled by the surprise ending so, rent this don't buy it. 3 1/2 stars for keeping me guessing to the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>It's rare when a movie can redeem itself in its last minutes after what seemed to be two hours of confusion, but the "Prestige" is an exception.  Close to the end of "The Prestige," I asked myself "What's going on?" But the end had me saying "That's a great ending."  A lot of people are comparing "The Illusionist" to "The Prestige," due to the similar themes and time period.  Both movies have great casts, but for my money, I'd say The "Prestige" is playing for higher stakes.  "The Illusionist" is a wonderful movie, but it does tie everything into a nice neat and sentimental bow at the end.  "The Prestige" also has a tight ending, but when things come clear, it signals all kinds of dark undercurrents that had previously left the viewer mystified. Love, sacrifice, ambition, revenge, (real?) magic, illusion, the modern age, it's all there for you to ponder.  Oh, I was still left with plenty of muddy moments that would probably have me going back to rewatch the movie to seek further clarification, but the overall story is fairly clear.  One more comment, Christian Bale gives yet another great performance.  He has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business today.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This is really a beautifully shot film.  It is one of my favorites of the past year.  That being said, it is not perfect.  This does have an excellent cast, and a really interesting setting in turn of the century London.  I really liked the story, though the ending seemed almost too comic book for me.  It was a suprise though.  I expected a twist(and there are a few), but I did not guess this one.  The acting is top notch.  The only problem is the emotional investment wasn't fully there.  Each magacian is very flawed, and I did not know who to feel sorry for, or who to hate.  I guess that is the beauty of good actors playing very real characters.  Overall this is a terrific film, and I would recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>It's only once in a while these days, that a mainstream movie comes along that tells a defiantly original story - and rarer still that it turns out to be intelligently told too.  This movie manages both.<br /><br />It's a movie about obsession - entirely fitting that it should be directed by Christopher Nolan, known for his exactitude. This obsession that two illusionists have for their craft and finding the ultimate illusion, leads from one twist to another as the story unravels, or more accurately unpeels layer by layer.  As the story progresses, we find ever greater depths to which the protagonists are willing to go to perfect their act.<br /><br />The cast are uniformly excellent - it seems Christian Bale is becoming somewhat of an on screen alter ego for Nolan.  And co-stars Scarlett Johanssen and Michael Caine acquit themselves well, the latter especially adding gravitas to proceedings.<br /><br />On the technical side, the dialogue is often at low mumbling levels for key comments or interchanges, and while striking, the photography by Nolan's Batman Begins lenser Wally Pfister is on the gloomy side.  These quibbles are more than made up for by a fantastic cast and inventive storytelling.  If you know nothing of the story, then so much the better.  Be warned, however - there is a direction the plot goes in which verges more on science-fiction, and this may jar with some audiences who are at that point involved with the mystery and period detail.<br /><br />Other than that, a fine period mystery with superior acting and art direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"The Prestige" is a psychological thriller set circa 1900 in the world of master magicians who compete to create the most astonishing illusions using the latest technologies that will amaze and captivate audiences.

Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a brilliant, daring magician from humble beginnings who will sacrifice anything to be truly great at his craft. An on-stage tragedy when the two men were young apprentice magicians sets in motion a bitter, obsessive rivalry that turns violent.

Some obvious flaws in logic and a plot and structure that are perhaps overcomplicated prevent me from giving this film 5 stars. A persistent and pivotal question over which knot was tied doesn't make sense, for example, because the characters could easily see the knot. The great illusion that brings the story to its startling conclusion also defies logic.  But "The Prestige" is a very effective -and very atmospheric- thriller. Christian Bale's performance is especially intriguing. The depth of Borden and Angier's obsession with their secrets and with each other is compelling. Scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie), creator of alternating current, has a small role in this intricate plot. And although I think that Tesla is one of several extraneous elements that might have been better left out, I am glad to see his genius get a little publicity.<br /><br />Curiously, two 2006 films were set in the culture of turn of the century conjurers: "The Prestige" and "The Illusionist". The two films are about entirely different things, but both are clever, effective thrillers that internalize the concept of illusion, assiduously misdirecting the audience until the right moment arrives to reveal themselves. Though imperfect, these two magic movies are among the most entertaining and provocative in my recent memory. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. See them both. They're not redundant. "The Prestige" is a gripping psychological thriller. "The Illusionist" is historically inspired and visually and aurally entrancing. One pits science against the magic arts, while the other places science within them.<br /><br />The DVD (Buena Vista 2007): "The Director's Notebook" is a 5-part featurette that includes interviews with director Christopher Nolan, the cast, novelist Christopher Priest, and screenwriter Jonathan Nolan about Victorian era magicians, the film's visual style, themes, and Nicola Tesla. "The Art of The Prestige" includes publicity stills, photos of costumes and sets, behind-the-scenes stills, and 9 examples of poster art that appeared in the movie. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Fans of Christopher Nolan's other classic--Memento--will know going in not to expect a straight-forward, cut-and-dried story.<br /><br />The Prestige, a film about two up-and-coming stage magicians locked in a violent feud, has more twists than Chubby Checker on speed. The narrative, jumping around in time and from character to character, might be slightly confusing at first but eventually you get a handle on it. The morality is murky through-out, fitting a shadow-filled and dark cinematography; this is a film of ambience and feeling, powerfully suspenseful.<br /><br />An all-star cast does a great job with the material, including a surprise performance by David Bowie as famous Edison-rival Nikola Tesla (!).<br /><br />Obviously, I cannot say too much here without giving away things that should be revealed over the course of viewing, so I'll leave it here. However what you're getting with The Prestige is: a fine-acted, well-directed, dark, twisty/turny suspense-filled mystery populated by characters with secrets and highly-questionable ethics. If that's your sort of thing (see: Memento), then you'll like this too.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Review: Christopher Nolan uses the skillful magician's art of misdirection in the powerful drama "The Prestige". Using a magician's slight of hand to direct the audience in this intricate story about the rivalry between magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) set in turn-of-the-century England Nolan constructs a drama that deals with themes as old as Shakespeare's "The Tempest". The less you know about the plot of the film outside of what I've described the better as the film will unfold its mystery just as the best magician's tricks do with showmanship and a sense of awe. ***<br />Featuring a number of stunning performances everyone from Jackman & Bale to Michael Caine & David Bowie as Nikola Tesla one of the first men to harness the power of electricity shines in the film. Although Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen time Rebecca Hall ("Wide Sargasso Sea") as Borden's long suffering wife has the better, showier part in the film and makes the most of it.<br />***POTENTIAL SP0ILERS HERE GO NO FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO BE COMPLETELY SURPRISED BY THE FILM***<br /><br />Nolan constructs his story in flashback as we see Rupert Angier die during one of his tricks and Borden put on trial for his murder. Weaving back and forth in time Nolan paints devastating pictures of two very different driven men who use misdirection as the seeds of their lives and how that ultimately costs them both in tragic ways.<br /><br />***END OF SPOILERS***<br /><br />Based on science fiction and fantasy writer Christopher Priest's novel of the same name Nolan and his co-screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan (who co-scripted "Memento") do a marvelous job of keeping the audience orientated as to when the flashbacks that we are seeing took place. Since the film is less than chronological skipping back and forth (using the marvelous conceit of diaries that both magicians have kept about their rivalry, magic tricks and experiences) audiences will be very involved in putting the pieces of this puzzle together. As the tagline suggest you should watch this entertaining, clever and ambitious drama very closely as there hints throughout the film that will lead clever audience members to the conclusion before it takes place. That doesn't make the film any less satisfying however as it is a good example of modern filmmaking that doesn't place technique above content. The leap of faith necessary for the conclusion of the film will put some people off--after all it is played as a straight ahead mystery thriller for most of the film but it's precisely this unusual twist that makes the film so vital and entertaining. Certainly Nolan's dark film won't be for everyone but neither was "Momento" or "Insomnia".<br /><br />I highly recommend "The Prestige". Featuring a number of powerful, confident performances, a terrific script based on a top notch novel and sharp direction by Nolan the film continues to suggest he is one of our most talented film directors working. As with all of Nolan's previous films "The Prestige" continues to demonstrate an ambitious filmmaker whose ultimate goal is to tell an involving drama that will challenge an audience's perceptions.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>Let me just say that, I really didn't have any high expectations for this movie. I saw it as a preview while I was waiting until the movie I paid to see began. Frankly, at this point, I'm thinking..right? A movie about magicians, that should be interesting. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. There isn't too much that I can say that hasn't already been said, but this movie isn't for simple minds. I actually had to watch this movie at least 3 times, and each time, I discovered something new. You really have to pay close attention to this one because if you miss anything you will be lost. I don't wanna spoil the ending, but depending on the person, I guess it could be interpreted 3 different ways. However, I wanna get to the meat of the story. This movie is about 2 magicians, Robert Angier, played by Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by Christian Bale. Robert is known as "The Great Danton", and he obviously has more showmanship than fellow magician. Alfred is known as "The Professor", and he obviously is known for obviously being the better magician, but with no stlye. At any rate, a magic trick goes horribly wrong, and results in the death of Angier's wife for which he blames Borden. Thus, starting the fued of all fueds, the rivalry of all rivalries. They now dedicate themselves to destroying each other's lives. That includes everything from stealing each others tricks to sabatoging each others magic shows. This movie is ultimately about revenge, and how that revenge turns into an ugly obsession, and how that obsession can consume your entire life, and that usually leads to death, destruction, and misery for all parties involved. The cast is amazing, Michael Caine is a delight to see as always. Christian Bale's character is dark as ever just like most of his roles in everything from "American Psycho" to "Batman Begins". With that being said, in the end, you can't feel sorry for any of these characters because they brought this misery on themselves by not being able to accept a loss, and walk away. Although, it's hard to tell in the end who ultimately has the last laugh so to speak. Ultimately, they both deserved each other, and they both deserved what they got. I will tell you this..spoiler! When watching this movie keep in mind that the beginning is indeed the end, and the end does indeed explain what you see in the beginning. So, it is reversed, but if you pay close attention you'll see that hindsight is 20/20 vision, so they are giving you clues to the ending the entire movie hence the line..."Are you watching closely?" The ending also leaves you thinking about whether or not real magic does exist. I almost forgot to say that David Bowie is in this movie, and I couldn't even recognize him at first. David is always a sight to see, and he does play the great Nikola Tesla quite classy and elegant.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Set mostly in turn of the 19th Century London, THE PRESTIGE is a magical movie about two rival magicians who become engrossed in a lifelong contest of one-upmanship between each that results in death and destruction.  Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (Christian Bale) are two apprentice magicians who work under the same manager, Mr. Harry Cutter (Michael Caine).  Angier and Bordon are both plants in the audience for a trick for another magician that involves tying his beautiful assistant up and lowering her into a locked huge container of water. The female assistant, Julia (Piper Perabo), also happens to be the wife of Angier.  Bordon has been instructed numerous times to tie the knots on her hands a certain way, but he insists on using a different knot that looks better, but is more difficult to unravel.  After one such performance, Julia is unable to untangle herself and ends up drowning in the tank.  As a result, Cutter, Angier, and Bordon all find themselves out of work and the friendship between Angier and Bordon becomes a hated rivalry.  Angier swears revenge, but after getting it isn't satisfied and goes on to steal one of Bordon's tricks.  Back and forth the rivalry rages.  It leads Angier to Colorado Springs and a meeting with famed inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie).  Eventually, Angier returns to London for the final showdown between the two magicians.  One is an illusionist, the other a true wizard.  So, which witch is which?<br /><br />I found THE PRESTIGE to be an enthralling movie that deserves multiple viewings.  Christopher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, have done an excellent job of adapting Christopher Priest's original novel.  Film is a different medium than a novel and the Nolan's know that well.  The movie is different than the book, but keeps to the spirit of the book, retaining all of the suspense and intrigue of the novel without giving anything away. Christopher Nolan uses some of the same filmmaking storytelling techniques he used in MEMENTO in THE PRESTIGE to keep the audience guessing exactly what is going on.  The Nolan brothers also did a good job of making the characters of Algier and Borden to be both sympathetic and despicable; there are times when you feel compassion towards each of the characters, but what they do in their obsession to out do each other shows everyone just how cold-hearted they really are.<br /><br />Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game as the rival showmen, while Caine gives a solid supporting performance as the man who assists both magicians during their deepest trials.  Piper Perabo doesn't have much screen time, but I felt she was perfect as Julia.  Scarlett Johansson portrays Olivia Wenscombe, the woman that both magicians fall in love with.  Johansson is a very attractive woman and one of the most-in-demand actresses in Hollywood right now.  However, I felt that out of all of the actors in the movie Johansson gives the most lackluster performance.  Olivia has a central (though unwitting) role in the plot, but Johansson seems to have approached it as she does most of her roles, as a vixen who seems more interested in sleeping with different men and breaking up marriages, and doesn't really do much acting.  The surprise performance in this film is that of David Bowie.  Bowie portrays Nikola Tesla.  David Bowie is one of the great rock musicians, but throughout his life he has acted in several different films.  His performance here is the best of his acting career.  I did not recognize Bowie at all and gives a perfect performance as the man who rivaled Edison.<br /><br />THE PRESTIGE doesn't really raise or address any socio-economic questions (though it does touch upon the ultimate science question, just because you can do something does that mean you should do it).  It's not necessarily a deep-thinking movie, though the movie does cause one to think.  It's a very entertaining film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't.  It is an incredible movie at what it does do and for that it's one of the best films to be released in 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>In many cases, I end up doing reviews on BDs long after the DVD has been released. Sometimes, the reviews fall a bit to the wayside, indeed, since they are something of a sequel. But, in these cases, the review is almost as important as the film, no matter how out of time they are from the original material. So be warned - this is a rant that includes a review.<br /><br />Take the Prestige - a fine novel turned into a finer film by the Nolan brothers. In the theatres, the film captures our imaginations as it should. On DVD, there are many people who were just as like unhappy with the sheer lack of behind the scenes material, the prestige of the film, as it were. So now, a few years beyond this, we have the BD. Ergo, my review.<br /><br />Of course the film can be lauded for incredible acting and an amazing turn in cinematography, especially with the 1080p presentation. The sound is almost as nice, 5.1 as is the standard of the industry. But again, it is in the lack of the behind the scenes that dulls the brightness of this product. Don't get me wrong; they included a very nice 'Director's Notebook' that gave us the rare glimpse behind the camera. And there were three scenes, selected by the director for their arresting visual natures. And we get the same features from the DVD as well.Who are the people who decide how much bonus material we get on our DVDs and BDs? Nowadays, one would assume that the motto of "don't hold anything back" would have more drawn. After all, there are a large number of us who make our purchases on the merits of behind the scenes and extras.<br /><br />The Nolens are amazing magicians of film, and I hope they may allow for more of their own impressions to be made once their films gain their next life, beyond the lifespan of the theatre. As to the inevitable question in these cases: 'should I keep my DVD or upgrade to BD?' I would go with the upgrade, simply for the magnificence of the production value sunk into the sets, costumes, lighting and music. These elements live larger than life compared to it's DVD predecessor. But if you are hunting just for more features and optional footage, keep the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>The cover says "You want to see it again the second it's over." Right. But I am resisting the temptation to tell you what that means: YOU WILL NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED! Except maybe my friend Paranormal Princess, who is herself a stage magician.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) worked together as "shills" that tie up the magician's assistant, who just happens to be the wife of one of them. At one point, they decide to try a different knot to tie her hands. Her husband ties her feet. She is put into a tank of water which has a trick lock; as soon as the curtain is put over the tank, she's supposed to spring the trick lock and get out of the tank. Something went wrong, and she drowned.<br /><br />The husband's theory is that his partner who tied her hands used the wrong knot. He admits he does not know for sure what knot he used. Thus begins a deadly rivalry between the two that seems to know no limits.<br /><br />When it gets really complicated, one drops a hint to the other than Nikola Tesla is the key to a really impressive trick that he can't figure out how he did it. So he goes to Colorado Springs, where Tesla has electrified the entire town in exchange for being permitted to use the electrical plant for his experiments in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep.<br /><br />The question becomes did Tesla build an apparatus for the first magician? Is the one he built for the second real magic? And after awhile, you have a more general question: what the heck is going on? It is not made easier by the story being told out of time sequence. It starts with the trial where one of the magicians is charged with murdering the other. Then it jumps back and forth without much regard to whether or not the audience is totally confused, because that's what magicians do: they totally confuse their audience.<br /><br />This movie is very, very successful at doing that, although I had some pretty clever guesses as to what happened along the way. I didn't really figure out very much, but I think it's impressive that I got anything right.</p></br></body></html>

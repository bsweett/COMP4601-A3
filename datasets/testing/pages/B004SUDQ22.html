Adapted by David Auburn and Rebecca Miller from Auburn's Pultizer Prize-winning play, it suffers from arch, rat-a-tat dialogue that works on stage but drones onscreen, and most painfully predictable casting that finds Anthony Hopkins as a mad genius, Gwyneth Paltrow as a melancholy girl, and Hope Davis as another bossy shrew. To the well, to the well, to the well - and now the water's tepid and soot-ridden.<br /><br />Paltrow is Catherine, an amateur mathematician wilting under the smothering pressure of sister Claire (Davis) and the memory of just-buried father Robert (Hopkins), a Chicago University professor who, like some mathematicians, made landmark discoveries in his early 20s, coasted on tenure, and then slowly went insane. Director John Madden only reveals glimpses of Robert's downward spiral before his death through Catherine's harsh eulogy at his funeral; the movie is more occupied with Catherine's struggle to cut her own figure in life when she shares her father's talents. Especially when one of her Robert's old students, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) discovers a brilliant proof that Catherine claims to have written, then<br /><br />locked away out of respect - and fear.<br /><br />Because the answer to this mystery is obvious whether you've seen the play or not - let it be said it is the less interesting of the two possibilities - "Proof" must churn its pleasures from performance and direction, both of which are uninspired. Madden prefers pretty to intense, and so a play entirely comprised of interiors is opened up to the towering Chicago oaks and softly falling snow. Dust is caught only when dancing in a concentrated sunbeam.<br /><br />Paltrow plays Catherine as a whiny waif, while Davis kneads the exact same dough she has for years. Hopkins, as Robert, is asked to assume an odd role - that of an insane man whose insanity is alluded to but never shown. "Proof" focuses on his blustery "lucid" year between manic episodes, and leaves no explanation for the descent, apparently preferring we watch "A<br /><br />Beautiful Mind" and borrow the life arc of John Forbes Nash. Catherine and Claire's mother is not mentioned, strange for characters reflecting on the death of one parent.<br /><br />And the movie speaks incessantly of math without ever dissecting any of its meaning. What's a creative proof? How do new and old methodologies differ? Auburn and Miller supply the words - Madden neglects the music. The characters should talk in a vacuum. The audience should not see in one.</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>What is this movie about, really? Is it like the Amazon reviewer says, "advanced academia, revelations of love, fear, regret, and potential recovery"? Maybe, but I don't think so. This film deliberately toys with its audience so we can't get a fix on whether Catherine is crazy or sane, skittish or companionable, a liar or a saint, brilliant or dull. At the end we find out, but we're given a lot of false scents until then. So maybe it works as a kind of academia thriller, but for me the thrill was gone.<br /><br />To me it seems the story is more about the challenges and ethical issues surrounding the care of ill parents. How much should children be expected to sacrifice to provide a "dignified" life for their parents? But this story falls far short of answering that question, too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>A mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins) has died after suffering from schizophrenia for years.  He was cared for by his daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), who now fears that she may have inherited his insanity.  A young graduate student (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is studying the great man's notebooks,  discovers a ground-breaking mathematical "proof," but Catherine claims her father didn't write it; she did.<br /><br />With these great stars, I expected so much more, but I was very disappointed.  The movie is hampered by a bad script and direction that has every line sounding like a hysterical tirade.  There are no pauses, no un-snappy retorts; every speech is delivered as if the actors are on stage trying to project to the last row of the balcony without a microphone.  The movie is, in fact, based on a play that also starred Paltrow, and it retains the too-large gestures and shrieking that probably fit just right in a big theatre, but look stagy in close-ups.<br /><br />Both the father's mental illness and the math discovery are spoken of in vague terms but never really shown or explained, so the whole plot is left unresolved and unsatisfying.  Gyllenhaal's performance is the most sincere and believable, while Hopkins and Paltrow overact throughout.  Overall, a dry, pointless film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>It dragged sometimes. I also didn't like how it went from present to past and back. The way it was done was slightly confusing and disorienting. Still, during it's best moments it was interesting. I can understand why someone with an mentally ill parent (and both math geniuses) worries that they will become like that too. But it was obvious to me she was just exhausted and suffering a nervous breakdown. Who wouldn't after dealing for five years with a father who is that difficult to deal with? And why shouldn't she be full of rage when you have a sister who was too selfish to help out? Being in her prime and taking care of her elderly father I can understand the rage, fear and love being so tied up together you feel crazy.<br /><br />This is a story about family bonds and stratospheric genius. It's coming to grips of who you are. It's also letting go and paradoxically embracing who and what you are and who and what you can be.</p></br><a href="../users/A2F3SXHT6RBV81.html">A2F3SXHT6RBV81</a><br/><p>This was a father/daughter story -- the end of Robert Lewellyn's troubled life and the beginning of a whole new life for the daughter who was so much like him.  I saw a local performance of the play written by David Auburn.  James Francis was good as the young seducer.  Instead of down-playing by the younger sister, the local actress overdid and her New York dominating sister didn't know how to dress.  So, I left at intermission.  This movie follows the dialogue of the play faithfully, which gets bogged down for a time and, I started to get up and lieave this time, also.<br /><br />What do I know about complicated math anyway -- it wa Greek to me, as I couldn't know a prime number from a zero.  Algebra was bad enough to get through for me in high school.  As they showed scenes around Chicago, I was glad I had stayed.  It brought back good memories of my week there.  The funeral service looked to be the same chapel on the University of Chicago campus where my son's wedding too place fifteen years ago.  Things there don't change much.<br /><br />The older sister hosted a 'gathering' of strangers after the funeral -- "people expect it" -- guess that's where I messed up in 1998 when my dad was buried.  No food was provided by anyone for any body.  Anthony Hopkins was his usual star-quality as the mad mathematician.  His math whiz daughter, Catherine, was served well by Gwyneth Paltrow (pre-Apple), and Jake Gyllenhaal (boy, is he on a roll, in so many films out now) was effective as Hal, who got a little drunk and played sex games with an inexperienced, backward social being.  Is Hal just using her?  Has he been befuddling hre all along, causing her to trust him enough to fall in love?  What a change -- the sexy, short black dress for the funeral (jeans jacket over it) and the bare midrift which didn't fit her character a bit, shows what a little affection can make a difference in a lonely woman's life!<br /><br />Though they'd been in Chicago a long time, they did not sound "Chicago."  Who runs naked down the Midway -- I missed that?  The old man wore a ring on his left hand, proper finger, but had no wife.  Strange.<br /><br />Catherine was thought to have inherited his tendency toward instability, but the drinking (in my opinion) is what caused her to lose "days" while sleeping it off.  He'd tried to stay in touch with his creativity and priorities and taking advantage of the times "inspiration" overtook his mind.  Catherine was always trying to cope and make things better for both of them.<br /><br />She had worked out a "proof" as an assignmetn for her "lost" father and showed it to Hal because she trusted him and it was her gift for bringing her to life again.  "You had a life."  Once I was told that I'd had an exciting life.  Well, I did several exciting things at intervals but, overall, we all end up alone and unloved.  Mr. Lewellyn is a distant relative, and has his excitement in numbers and striving to the impossible: peace of mind and happiness.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Sorry folks but in spite of all the acclaim lavished on this movie, PROOF is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a shreakingly one note performance, whining and pouting, and maybe smiling once or twice in a role that reeks of self-absorption.  Only Jake Gylenhaal salvages his role, and Hope Davis is as annoying as Paltrow.  Anthony Hopkins looks like he has gas, and the movie is about as exciting as reading an algebra text.  Yuck!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>There is no beginning, no idea, no end in Proof.  This is the worst film ever of Gwyneth Paltrow.  Viewing Proof last nite, I couldn't help wishing someone else had played Catherine other than Paltrow.  I thought Paltrow was a bit over the top actually in the role.  Paltrow and Gyllenhaal had nothing together in terms of "on screen" chemistry.  As much as I am trying to put my finger on what the problem was with this pitiful film, I have to admit that it was just about everything. The story did not flow at all. The dialogue did not work. Casting was poor. The sister of Paltrow was just ridiculous.  'd go on about how this film was excellent and get more in depth about this motion picture, but Gwyneth Paltrow ruined it, so I will save my typing and leave it at that.</p></br><a href="../users/A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ.html">A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ</a><br/><p>This movie almost put me to sleep. It's about a daughter of a brilliant (and dead) mathmetician played by Gweyneth Paltrow. She believes she may have inherited his insanity...blah blah blah...this movie has a good cast but it's really dull with a boring slow moving story. Maybe if you are into math formulas this will interest you. I found it anti-climactic. I kept wondering when something would happen and it never did. You never really get a solid answer in the end and it left me asking "WTF?" I would not watch it again unless I had insomnia and even then...</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Proof of a mathematical equation and proof of madness are the two driving forces in John Madden's film. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) who cared for her brilliant mathematician father Robert (Anthony Hopkins) is afraid that she's inherited his other "gift"-mental illness. Catherine cared for her father Robert during the end. When Claire (Hope Davis) Catherine's sister arrives home for the funeral she expresses concern for Catherine's mental state. Catherine begins to doubt her own teetering sanity. Robert's assistant Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) rummages around Robert's papers the night before and after the funeral trying to find an important equation her father was working on before he died. Featuring a group of strong performances, "Proof" is a compelling drama about grief, madness and emotional seclusion. Although Madden's drama suffers from the stage origins of the play but the emotional high wire act the cast performs makes it worthwhile. Whether or not there's "proof" of this film being a "great" film is based on how drawn into the drama you are by the appealing cast. A warning about some of the other reviews here--there good reviews but some of them have spoilers that give away a lot of the plot of the film. If you want to be surpised and enjoy the ride then I'd suggest you skip reading these reviews.<br /><br /> "Proof" looks extremely good here with natural skin tones, sharp image quality and nice definition. The 5.1 audio isn't exactly designed for the format since this a dialogue driven film but there is nice ambient sounds evident in the other speakers.<br /><br />A clinical but interesting commentary track by John Madden is interesting to listen to but would have been enlightened by the cast's contribution. We also get deleted scenes none of which are revelations "From Stage to Screen" covers the adaptation of the stage play to film. One of the challenges was staying true to the stage roots while opening up the player and making it less stage bound. Producer Allison Owen makes an interesting comment-she imagined the film as the type of film that would have been made in the 70's where moving and powerful drama was still king in theaters. The cast and Madden discuss their characters and what attracted them to the project. Madden comments that many audience members thought that the play was like watching a movie which is a bit unusual but that was because of the fact that the play was told from a variety of different points of view and the staging.<br /><br /> A fine film that touches on madness, emotional isolation and the fear of what lies down the road for anyone; "Proof" is a fascinating drama that works amazingly well due to the strong performances. Madden who worked with Paltrow in "Shakespeare in Love" clearly connects with Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>PROOF is one of those rare films that transfers a superb play directly to the screen without losing a bit of the power of the play, but enhancing the story with the advantages of the camera.  With a tough story like this one it takes a brilliant cast and director to fine-tune the work and in this instance it all works to perfection.<br /><br />The story is well known from all the PR of the theatrical screening: recounting it in a review does not  add or subtract the importance of the film or the experience of the viewer.  The premise, mathematician Robert (Anthony Hopkins) and his caretaker daughter Catherine (Gweneth Paltrow) who also is an uncommonly bright  27-year-old mathematics mind and has spent the glowing years of her youth caring for her recently deceased father. They converse in flashbacks, a means of realizing the closeness of their bond emotionally, mentally, and probably parallel mental illness proclivities.  Robert left notebooks filled with thoughts and clues to a complex mathematical proof and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a devoted admirer of Robert's genius, is organizing the thoughts and deciphering the meanings of Robert's scribblings. Catherine's estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis) arrives to 'settle' the matters left by Robert's demise and becomes the camera that brings focus to the fact that Catherine has inherited not only her father's genius but his mental fragility as well.  How this quartet - Robert, Catherine, Hal, Claire - serve to unravel the findings of Robert's (and Catherine's) legacy is the essence of this gripping tale.<br /><br />A more powerful group of actors for this film would be difficult to find.  One expects the brilliance of Paltrow's performance since she had time with the character on the stage, and Hopkins can toss these bizarre characters off with grace and aplomb.  But it is the pleasure of seeing Davis and Gyllenhaal rise to the same level of expertise that makes the film glow.  This is an example of ensemble acting of the highest form and director Madden conducts the performance with sensitivity and momentum.  The result is a treasureable, intelligent, powerful film that challenges the mind while entertaining all the senses.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, February 06</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>John Madden, who directed Shakespeare in Love (1998), and David Auburn, who wrote the script (adapted from his play), have put together a moving story about mathematical genius admixed with mental instability much in the manner of the life of John Nash who was the subject of A Beautiful Mind (2001).<br /><br />Nash was a paranoid schizophrenic who was tormented by voices in his head warning him of dangers and conspiracies that didn't exist.  Like Nash, Robert (Anthony Hopkins) is a brilliant mathematician who, having done spectacular work in his early twenties, goes crazy.  Unlike Nash he is never able to regain control of "the machinery," as he calls his mind, and is never able to do any worthwhile work again.<br /><br />Or is he?  As he is taken care of by his mathematically astute daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow in a most affecting and beguiling performance) he fills scores of notebooks with intense writings.  At one point he seems in remission and at another point Catherine rushes home to find him in out in the backyard in the middle of a snowy night fired with enthusiasm about his latest work.  At another point, he and Catherine work together on a project.  And herein lies the crux of the matter.  As we discover, this project turns out to be a proof of a difficult mathematical theorem or conjecture that will be internationally celebrated if it is correct.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Hal, one of Robert's students who is going through his mentor's papers in the hope of discovering something wonderful.  Catherine tells him that among the 103 notebooks that her father filled during his days of mental instability there is not a single one that has anything of value in it.  But when Hal wins her heart she produces a notebook that was locked away in a drawer.  It turns out that this notebook contains that most amazing proof mentioned above.  And it is here that Catherine says--in line that is so very well set up that her expression fairly takes your breath away--"I wrote it."<br /><br />Well, did she or didn't she?  Because the work seems to be in her father's handwriting and seems to be well beyond her abilities, her sister Claire, played in that clever but somewhat annoying style that Hope Davis has so perfected (About Schmidt; American Splendor), claims that Catherine is deluded and couldn't have written it.  To Catherine's grievous disappointment Hal reluctantly agrees, and this seeming lack of faith in her sends Catherine toward the precipice of insanity.  This is the key question of the plot.  Who wrote the proof?  Its resolution will be the denouement of the story.<br /><br />Clearly Claire believes that Catherine is so like her father that she is about to go crazy herself.  So she tells Catherine she wants to sell the house now that their father is dead and bring Catherine to New York where she lives so that she can take care of her.<br /><br />Will Catherine go or will she trust her heart and begin a life with Hal?<br /><br />This movie does not play well with some audiences I think because the wonderment that some of the characters feel--the absolute awe that transfigures them when they behold a great mathematical proof, is not entirely appreciated by the average person.  Madden makes sure that Catherine, Hal and one of the mathematicians form on their faces an expression something akin to a religious enthrallment when they understand the thrilling logic of the proof.  I suspect that for many viewers something was lost in the translation.  Consequently, although many others, including myself, believe this to be one of the outstanding movies of 2005 it only rates a 7.0 at IMDb and was not nominated for any Academy Awards.  Paltrow won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Shakespeare in Love, also directed by Madden (he seems to bring out the best in her), and that award was richly deserved.  But here in Proof I believe she was every bit as good (in a different way) although she was only nominated for a Golden Globe award and did not win.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is that it is strangely affecting emotionally.  You might find yourself misting up a bit as you watch.  I know I did.<br /><br />See this for Gwyneth Paltrow, a gifted actress giving one of her best performances, and for John Madden, a director who makes beautiful movies with style and finesse.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>Proof boasts prize-winning source material and an excellent cast. What more can one ask for?<br /><br />The film stayed very true to the original stage play, telling the tale of a young woman named Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), who dropped out of college to care for Robert, her mentally ill father (Anthony Hopkins) who also happens to be a famous mathematician. After Robert passes away, Catherine (already a little socially awkward), is lost, rambling around his old house by herself. Graduate student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) requests her permission to sift through the copious notebooks that Robert produced during his decline, hoping to find the next mathematical breakthrough in their pages. Catherine assents, and the two begin a tentative relationship. When Catherine points Hal to a locked drawer in her father's study, he is thrilled to discover a very important, groundbreaking proof that he immediately attributes to her father. When Catherine divulges that she herself wrote it, both Hal and her estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis), who has flown from New York to Chicago to attend the funeral, doubt her assertion. Catherine already fears that, with her father's talent for math, she has also inherited his tendency towards madness. She reacts strongly to the betrayal, and Hal must try to prove that he does have faith in her.<br /><br />What's interesting about the script is that the audience doesn't know until the end just which of the characters to believe. Did Catherine write the proof, or did she steal it from her ailing father? Did her father still have possession of his faculties in his decline, or was he incapable of writing the proof? Is Hal sticking around because he really likes Catherine, or does he want her to let her guard down just enough to allow him to make off with the mathematical prize he's looking for? This tension makes the film (and the play) work. The material's no slouch. David Auburn won both a Pulitzer and a Tony for the play this film is based on.<br /><br />All the performances in this film were very strong. Paltrow particularly shined, rendering Catherine as shy, awkward, and afraid of her own potential talent/madness. I thought her treatment of the character was very original; I haven't seen her perform in a role like this before. She played this same role to stellar reviews on Broadway, and her reprisal of Catherine in the film is delicate and layered. I really enjoyed her.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IWWRZJOXOSYP.html">A1IWWRZJOXOSYP</a><br/><p>It's easy to dismiss "Proof" as a "Beautiful Mind 2."  But it's a film that has stayed with me and left a lasting impression.  For me, that's an indication of quality.<br /><br />Director John Madden ("Capt. Corelli's Mandolin) re-unites with the star Gwyneth Paltrow from 1998's "Shakespeare in Love" that resulted in a Best Director nomination for him and a Best Actress Oscar for her.  Paltrow got glowing reviews for her performance as Catherine in David Auburn's play on the West End stage in London.  The mathematics-laden premise translates fairly well to screen.<br /><br />At times we are confused.  First, it seems that Anthony Hopkins is real and helping his daughter celebrate her birthday.  Then we learn through her dialogue with Jake Gyllenhaal's character Hal that Catherine's father was a brilliant mathematician who suffered from mental illness and has died.  Gyllenhaal who came off a very hot year with an Oscar nomination for "Brokeback Mountain" and a lead performance in "Jarheads" seems very likeable here.  Even so, we're unsure if he's using Catherine or if he's cultivating a relationship.<br /><br />There was a little film called "The Secret Life of Dentists" that starred Hope Davis as a dentist having an affair.  She gave a complex albeit less than likeable performance, much as she does here as Claire, Catherine's sister who is persuaded that like their dad, Catherine is also losing her mind.  With films like "The Daytrippers" & "Next Stop Wonderland," she's creating an interesting body of work.<br /><br />Although there are some strange notes in the film such as Hal's band that seems to invade their party, it's the relationships between the characters that make the film memorable.  A daughter's connection to her father that is strong can inspire her for a lifetime.  Seeing Catherine discover her own brilliance and come to believe it is also quite moving.  This was a little film that our local cinema refused to bring here to the large screen.  It's well worth investigating on DVD.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A39IBJB2PBVC7I.html">A39IBJB2PBVC7I</a><br/><p>There's a wonderful moment late in Proof where Catherine, Gwyneth Paltrow, says sadly to Hal, Jake Gyllenhaal, "I think I'm like my father."  Hal, beaming, says, "You are."<br /><br />What is so marvelous about this exchange is that both statements are correct, but the interaction is a case study in flawed data interpretation.  Catherine means that she's afraid she is mad, like her father.  Indeed there is evidence enough that at the very least she is emotionally fragile and will succumb to serious mental illness at some point.  But Hal is looking right through her fears, he means that she is like her father in that she is a brilliant mathematician.  Ironically it is perhaps the latter of the two possibilities that causes Catherine greater fear.<br /><br />The other spellbinding moment is when she finally reads her father's great proof out loud to him, as he demands.  Without spoiling it I'll just say that this brief scene illustrates the essential truth of the movie so powerfully that it is breathtaking.<br /><br />Proof was originally a play, so the emphasis is on dialogue, beat, structure, nuance, and revelation.  Director Madden also gave us Shakespeare In Love, with Paltrow, so you know from the start you are in for a quality production.  Jake Gyllenhaal is faultless as a young man fearlessly going where a wiser man would not, because Paltrow's Catherine, while beguiling, is trouble.  This is perhaps the movie's greatest power, and Paltrow gives the best performance I've ever seen her give.<br /><br />Catherine is a woman of contradictions, strong yet brittle, selfless yet self-absorbed, generous yet resentful, brash yet timid.  She maintains this highly nuanced state throughout the film, and even though we cannot understand her, (as she cannot understand herself), frequently become impatient with her, wonder if she put herself in the role of victim in order to wallow in it and use it as a weapon against others, we never stop caring about her and hoping she'll be all right.<br /><br />This is a slightly different Paltrow, a little older, a little tougher, and her performance is incredibly confident - really a pleasure.  About Anthony Hopkins what can one say, he is such a fire horse that at this point he must carry around a handful of performances like this in his hip pocket at all times - that said, he is absolutely on target.<br /><br />The sleeper in this movie is Hope Davis as Claire, Catherine's sister.  She is Catherine's anti-matter, and their confrontations reveal much not just about them but also about their father.  With her "To-Do" lists, which she neatly checks off, her clipped speech, and precise thoughts about Catherine's future, Claire is the Uber-Yuppie from heck we all fear.  The irony is that once we get beyond our initial dread we see that she has some valid points.  Even the most elegant solution must be tested, Claire helps.  A rich and deeply satisfying film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>This is the story of a daughter of a brilliant mathematician who has also lost his mind.  She's fearful of developing the same condition.  When her father dies, they discover mathematical proofs that could rock the world as we know it.  The question is--did her father write the proofs or did she?  This is a fascinating and intelligent drama.  I found it difficult to follow due to so much of the story being told in flashbacks.  In many ways, due to Hopkins's excellent acting, the flashbacks were far more real than the storyline they were trying to portray in current time.  Hopkins was almost too good of choice for the father--he far overshadowed either of the lead's performances.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Gwyneth Paltrow returns to high drama after experimenting with some other material.  A highly respected actress she finds her niche in this role with no trouble.  She played the part on stage and obviously has it down cold.<br /><br />The story starts with her character seeing visions of her father (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who recently died.  He was a brilliant mathematician who slipped into mental illness for a short time.  He recovered briefly but then regressed back.  During his regression and before his death, the two of them, sharing the same intellect, spoke of doing the greatest Proof ever.<br /><br />The main idea of the story is her fear of inheriting her fathers mental illness.  Particularly when it looks like she may have tried to plagiarize his work.  Her sister does not make it easier due to her thinking she slipping away as well, just as their father did.  She attempts to take control of her life and get her the `help' she needs.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are top notch.  Paltrow proves once again she has range beyond many of her peers.  Gyllenhaal continues to gain notoriety with strong roles like this and Brokeback mountain, making him one of the best young actors out there as well.  And there's always Sir Anthony Hopkins, reliable as ever, giving an outstanding performance.  The chemistry between him and Paltrow is the best thing about the movie.<br /><br />Although the dramatic element draws on the `Proof', it's mostly just a shell of a reason to get these characters together for the performances that they give.  Underneath the drama is something of an empty shell.  We don't really care about the Proof and it could be emphasized a little less.

I think it made perfect sense the first viewing. The flashbacks were merely to explain the mysteries,not put there to confuse.<br /><br />This movie makes you question if there is any truth to the belief that there is a thin line between genius, and maddness.This movie is based on the pulitzer prize winning play, and is well worth renting, or better yet, adding to your collection...You WILL want to own it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>John Madden and Gwyneth Paltrow first collaborated on "Shakespeare in Love," one of the most intelligent, lush romantic comedies of all time.  They reunite to make a completely different kind of magic in "Proof," a film adaptation of a wildly popular play in which Paltrow also played the lead.<br /><br />"Proof" is steeped in the culture of mathematic academia, where words like "proof" are used with hallowed reverence, and the leading figures are considered to be gods by the "mere" professors and grad students.  Paltrow plays Katherine, younger daughter to a mathematical genius (Anthony Hopkins), who "revolutionized the field twice before he turned 26."  But Dad recently died after a long mental illness, and Katherine put her own academic life on hold to care for her dottering old man as they rattle around their big Chicago house together.  Katherine insists that Dad has some lucid times where he was working again, working on something great . . . could it be found in the hundreds of notebooks Dad left behind in his study?<br /><br />Grad student Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) is plowing through the books as fast as he can.  (One has to suspend a little disbelief here, believing that any university has lookers like Paltrow and Gyllenhall in the same math department.)  Hal and Katherine also have a bit of a thing going, but both of them move with the caution bred from working too close for too long a time.  I've never really been a fan of Gyllenhaal before "Proof," but he gives a sincere, restrained performance that is just perfect.<br /><br />And then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Katherine's older sister, who has flown in from New York to help out.  Claire has clearly abandoned mathematics as a career and has moved on to more practical, lucrative pursuits (although her job is never explained).  Claire has the disadvantage of being a merely "talented" person born into a family of geniuses, and it's pretty clear that she's got plenty of her own issues.  Davis, giving yet another fine performance, conveys much of Claire's repressed frustration with brittle mannerisms and inflections, but neverteless she conveys a lot.<br /><br />But Paltrow is the true shining light here.  Far from the radiant beauty she plays in virtually every film, Paltrow here is haggard, worn thin by her years of caring for Dad and also the worry that she might be "like him" in both good ways and bad.  It's pretty clear that every character Plus, she's carrying a secret.  Either she has gone beyond her father's genius and discovered a new proof that had eluded the old guy, or she has stolen his work and tried to pass it off as her own.  Paltrow, one of the sunniest of actresses, here comes of as believable as a soul in torment.<br /><br />This is a "little film," clocking in at 90 minutes and with a tightly focused plot and cast.  That doesn't mean that it isn't excellent.  Along with "Wonder Boys" and "The Squid and the Whale," "Proof" stands firmly in the short line of recent fantastic movies about academics and academia.  Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>Based on David Auburn's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "Proof" revolves around Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a brilliant, recently deceased mathematician (Anthony Hopkins). Although Catherine has inherited her father's mathematical genius, she fears that her knowledge might come with a heavy price. Her father had a history of mental illness for many years, and Catherine is worried that the disease has been passed on to her. To make matters more complicated, Catherine's pushy sister (Hope Davis) returns to town for her father's funeral and is intent on bringing Catherine back to New York City to stay with her. However, when Catherine shares a breakthrough mathematical proof with her new lover, who also happens to be her father's former graduate strudent (Jake Gyllenhaal), tensions arise as the authorship of the proof is questioned. Did Catherine's father write this amazing proof before his death, or is Catherine its true author?<br /><br />I thought this film was an excellent adaptation of Auburn's play. Paltrow gives an outstanding performance as a young woman coping with the death of her father, her own personal regrets, and mental instability. Hopkins also delivers a great performance as the delusional father figure, although I wish he had a bit more screen time. The only performance I was slightly disappointed with was Gyllenhaal's, who is kind of a putz. However, his character is a bit of a putz, too, so I guess I can't hold it against him too much.<br /><br />"Proof" is an excellent movie about family obligations, mental illness, and self-discovery. Put this one on your must-see list.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>`Proof' plays out with a lot of similarities to the brilliant `A Beautiful Mind', but it approaches its subject differently enough to make it its own film and not a carbon copy of success.  Adapted from the play of the same name, `Proof' covers the week following the death of brilliant yet mentally disturbed mathematician Robert (Hopkins).  His youngest daughter Catherine (Paltrow) had been taking care of him for the past five years, sacrificing her dreams of higher education to watch after her lonely and dying father.  After his death she has to deal with his ex-student Hal (Gyllenhaal) who is searching through Roberts notebooks in order to find proof that even in his insanity he was still brilliant as well as her sister Claire (Davis) who never gave either of them the time of day but is determined to help now that their father is dead.<br /><br />What makes this film memorable is the layered performances by the entire cast.  Gwyneth gives a very structured performance, giving us varying degrees of emotions and unraveling her characters inner workings to us gradually.  Anthony Hopkins is such a wonderful treat here, truly mesmerizing, and Hope Davis takes the whole unsympathetic sister role to the next level.  I truly hated her even though I'm convinced she didn't mean any harm.  To me Jake Gyllenhaal is really stepping up to plate.  He had an amazing year last year with three brilliant performances, one of which lead him to an Oscar nomination (all three of his roles, from Brokeback Mountain to Proof to Jarhead were wonderfully layered and all three different from the next making him a true cinematic chameleon).  Although his character is minimal in this film he really commands the screen while he's on and makes for a wonderful treat.<br /><br />While I'm not a mathematician, nor do I even understand half of what made the characters in this film so smart (all that talk of proofs and primes goes right over my head) one can still be enthralled by the underlying and motivating factor to this film.  This is a film about grief and acceptance, especially of ones self, and realizing that we are all capable of great things.  As Catherine deals with the loss of her father whom she no doubt loved very much she also is faced with the idea that she may very well have not only inherited his genius but also his dementia.  And when those closest to you are convinced you're following in his downward spiral you begin to believe in the possibility, almost convincing yourself of what you are certain could never be.  While not as brilliant or emotionally abrasive as `A Beautiful Mind', `Proof' still works hard to strike the right chords, and thanks to impressive performances by the entire cast it hits most of them right on the head.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>Beautiful and mysterious '{Proof}' takes the lives of two math geniuses, a professor at the University of Chicago, Robert (Anthony Hopkins), and his aspiring student daughter, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Both are gifted and both suffer from mental illness.  Ingeniously, we see the movie from inside Catherine's fragmented consciousness.  Her perception of scrambled time with memories that are elusive makes us passengers inside her struggling mind.  She is his caretaker, but she assumes the independence (and talent) to go to Northwestern and materialize her education.  In the meantime, her father has died, which shatters all the time frames.  Sister Claire (Hope Davis) comes from New York to the funeral.  We find her an irritating presence, but she is intriguing.  Is she thoughtful to Catherine or not?  Everything from shampoo conditioner to funeral arrangements is taxing for Catherine--and it shows. She finds some needed love and reassurance from her father's understudy, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), and this is where the split comes between audience and protagonist.  Paranoid, she suspects he is some opportunist trying to feed upon her and her father's legacy.  Although even her suspicions are logical.<br /><br />The film posts some important questions for us to ponder.  How crazy was Robert during his lifetime?  How much of a genius?  And, especially how much do these two dynamics fit in for Catherine?  She doesn't know herself.  It is hard for Catherine to sort out the truth from fiction in her scattered consciousness, but she finds out the truth, and so do we.  The way the story is presented is fascinating and emotionally rewarding.  Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn.  Kudos for director John Madden, who gets us into Catherine's skin, taking advantage of film in a way that the theatre can't.  '{Proof}' is sometimes a beautifully heartbreaking film with revelations that are poignantly presented.<br />(4 1/2*'s)</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>'Proof' is from the director of 'Shakespeare in Love' and stars<br /><br />Academy Award Winners Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actress, 'Shakespeare in Love') and Anthony Hopkins (Best Actor, 'The Silence of the Lambs');<br /><br />As well as Academy Award Nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, 'Brokeback Mountain') and Hope Davis. 'Proof' tells the story<br /><br />of Catherine (Paltrow) a young woman taking care of her brilliant father<br /><br />Robert (Hopkins). Well, Robert was brilliant. He used to be a famed mathemetician who made an incredible breakthrough in his twenties. Now he's crazy and just writes nonsense in a never ending series of notebooks. But then Robert dies and a former student of his, Hal (Gyllenhaal) volunteers to go through all the notebooks. Meanwhile, Catherine's sister Claire shows up and claims that Catherine's sanity is slipping...And maybe it is. Well, anyway, there you have my synopsis of the movie. I do recommend the movie, it's entertaining and interesting. All the actors are great, especially Hopkins who's not even in the film that much. The movie was adapted from a play and in most cases (unless you're Tyler Perry) movies transition well from plays. Well, hope you like it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I was surprised by this one.  I was convinced it would bore me to tears; but quite the contrary.  The cast is uniformly excellent (surprised at no recognition for Davis and Paltrow at award time).<br /><br />Anyway this unfolds like a mystery and surrounds itself with a hint of depressed madness.  Dour sounding - but it's not.  Gyllenhall brings great energy to his scenes and Hopkins is all demented gusto.<br /><br />If you are looking for a thought-proking piece of drama, stop here.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>Ebert like the tie into Chicago and gave this movie 4 stars. I liked it and my son goes to UofC so I liked the Chicago tie-in  too. The acting is strong. The characters are interesting. The dialog, especially between the daughter and her father is always at multiple levels. The conversations interweave logic, math, and interpersonal concerns. My favorite part is where the Anthony's character (the father) encourages Gwenyth's character to stop moping and start working. He uses the properties of the number 1729 to good effect.<br /><br />The movie is a little slow and predictable so I knocked a star off. If you didn't have a tie into it like "math" or Chicago, I could see where it could drag. The flashbacks are supposed to be slightly confusing. She's having problems with the death of her father and her mental states. I didn't understand the criticisms of the other reviewers of the movie based on the flashbacks. Some of the confusion was intentional.<br /><br />The movie was elegant and thoughtful.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>As the movie starts, I was struck by its stagey quality. First Paltrow declaims; then Hopkins declaims. In the DVD commentary, I learned that this movie was in fact adapted from a stage play in which Paltrow also starred. I had somehow missed knowing about the existence of that originating stage play, but was glad to be proven right in my instincts about how these movie characters were projecting. The acting gets a little more fluid and natural as the movie progresses, but never completely loses its staged quality.<br /><br />Other aspects of this movie are artsy and artificial. For example, Hopkins' schizophrenia doesn't look like the schizophrenia of anyone I've known diagnosed with the condition. Hopkins' schizophrenia is played strictly to the balcony.<br /><br />Paltrow's character, while meant to be sympathetic, actually comes off as being adamant at the wrong moments, over-the-top shrill at the wrong moments, then pliant and self-doubting at the wrong moments. I began to lose interest in her when she brimmed with such loud indigation over the police coming to her door and wanting to question her - after she had CALLED them reporting a burglary in progress!<br /><br />Again in the DVD commentary, Director John Madden congratulates himself and everone involved in this project on creating such nuanced characters. He cites Paltrow's sister as an example of the triumph of nuance over stereotype. However, I found Paltrow's sister to be a completely stereotypical villainess. She has no redeeming virtues. She is a social wasp. The commentary is apt when Madden says her actions remind him of key Shakespearean scenes. She is like the MacBeth play-within-a-play wherein the murderers pour poison into the King's ear. She is Iago, whispering tragic lies into Othello's ear. She goes crisply on her way, scratching people, along with errands, off her "to-do" list. And she doesn't change or grow as the action progresses. She will continue ticking down her list to the end.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is the only truly likeable, sympathetic character in this movie. He is the kind of friend everyone might wish to have. His developing bond with Paltrow is what holds this movie together and makes it worthwhile.<br /><br />As for the math - I wish there were MORE of it. The audience never really gets a feel for the importance of any math study here. All we get is the too-often repeated pronouncement that it's all over for a math thinker by the age of 22. But what about the math itself? We really don't get an inkling of what Paltrow has proven or failed to prove. And making the rudaments of a math idea available to a popular audience is possible, as shown by the TV series "Numbers." I was hoping there would be more Numbers in here, and less histrionics. There may be form in this movie, but there just isn't enough function.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Proof (John Madden, 2005)<br /><br />Okay, so by now it's pretty well known that I will watch anything with Jake Gyllenhaal in it. I mean, I actually watched The Day After Tomorrow all the way through. (For which I still have not received my medal, Mr. Emmerich.) So when I found out Gyllenhaal would be one of the principals in John Madden's adaptation of David Auburn's engaging play Proof, I was pretty much champing at the bit. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Claire (Six Degrees' Hope Davis) are sisters, the daughters of Robert (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a disturbed mathematician. Claire moved away years ago and made a name for herself in the financial world; Catherine stayed at home to take care of her father and follow in his footsteps. Gyllenhaal plays Hal, a graduate student of Robert's. The main thrust of the play centers around a complex mathematical proof Catherine claims she wrote; neither Claire nor Hal believe her. We get to sit back and watch the fallout as these three characters ride the emotional rollercoaster, intercut with flashback scenes giving us pieces to the puzzle of whether Catherine or Robert was the actual author of the proof.<br /><br />"Nakedly manipulative" is the most tactful way I can put the mystery portion of the whole thing. Auburn (who also wrote the screenplay) knows exactly how to keep the viewer confused, but still thinking he's got a handle on things. To his credit, he does it very, very well. The present-day scenes didn't need a script, really; if you put three actors of this caliber in the same room and hand them a one-sheet scenario, you'd be able to film the improvisation and come up with something worth watching. If the movie's got a dark spot, acting-wise, it's Paltrow, who comes off as shrill and unlikeable at times. Still, that's a minor point here; there's a great deal of good in this film. ***</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>I must start by noticing we are in presence of one the warmest and intimate movies made in years. An intimate a very haunting story that deals with the missed contact with the reality of a very young talented Mathematics investigator. Her daughter tries the best she can to join the pieces in this intricate puzzle of formulas and theorems he left. She assumes the difficult task to further his investigations.<br /><br />Behind this very painful script, I should remark the prominent acting of Gwyneth Paltrow , who must play a razor edge role between insanity and reality, to create this diffuse atmosphere that will swaddle our rational, analytical and cold logic.<br /><br />It is not easy to direct two Oscar winners, but John Madden faced the dilemma and with discrete lightning and closed locations made a very poignant chamber work.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Proof is all about the urge to reach out to someone, the painful fragility of both creativity and personal relationships, and the unnerving propinquity of madness and genius. It's a stagey and talky film, that offers up some excellent performances from its lead cast, and gives them some terrific opportunities to indulge of unabashed histrionics, but too often the film feels strained by its propensity towards fussiness, earnestness, and self-importance.<br /><br />The film begins on a rainy night in Chicago in the home of Robert (Anthony Hopkins). Robert is a groundbreaking mathematician, a prodigy who made major contributions to three fields and revolutionized one of them twice before he was twenty-two. His unstable 27-year-old daughter Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) now inhabits the house and as she sits absent-mindedly changing the channels on the TV, Robert comes in and engages her in conversation about her forlorn state.<br /><br />From the moment Robert opens his mouth, something is not right, and in fact it's immediately revealed that Robert has just died, setting the film's plot in motion. Catherine is soon visited by her New York-based yuppie sister Claire (Hope Davis), who begins to take over he life, but also visiting is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Robert's who has become a professor in his own right.<br /><br />Soon we learn that Robert's mind was devoured by dementia; Catherine who is afraid of following in the footsteps of her father is certain that she'll inherit the mental illness that laid him low. Robert was not just a genius; he also was someone who increasingly went in and out of sanity. He'd had lucid periods, one lasting a full nine months, but the last three years had been marked by bouts of madness that included filling 103 notebooks with compulsive writing.<br /><br />Haunted by her father's past, Catherine becomes increasingly paranoid - she begins to believe that Hal may be using her to gain access to a new proof, whilst she also comes to the recognition that her controlling sister Claire is fully prepared to sell the house and move her back to New York for "treatment."<br /><br />The Proof of the title means two things: the specific mathematical proof that either Catherine or her father may have written, as well as the human need to offer proof, to demonstrate to others our value, our worth, the truth of our talents and the sincerity of our emotions. Mr. Madden and Ms. Paltrow do a fine job of bringing these urges to life; and they do an even better job of dramatizing the internal barriers Catherine must break before claiming her life as her own.<br /><br />Depressed and inert, prone to long-winded episodes of conversing with her dead father, Catherine is convinced she'll spiral down if she accepts her own considerable mathematical talents. Clare sees her as a discomfited, somber, and wary woman with few social graces and multiple hard edges. And although Claire might come off to somewhat of a b*tch, she really does have her younger sister's best interests at heart. Both her and Hal, each for their own reasons, desperately wants to help Catherine regain her footing.<br /><br />Brilliant acting aside, the film's stage-bound qualities seem problematic, with director John Madden's tendency makes the characters and the story feel unduly predictable. It doesn't help that the overall conceit of the plot - the discovery of who really wrote "the proof" gets tied up in circles; did Catherine write it or didn't she? With this section of the movie just going on a little too long. Overall though, the film is largely successful, perhaps due to Madden's and Ms. Paltrow's obvious familiarity with the material - both help increase the film's intensity to the point it trumps the underlying earnestness.<br /><br />But the best thing about Proof is Gwyneth Paltrow's formidable performance as Catherine. When she unleashes her emotional range and carries Catherine's internal conflicts on her face and in her body language, she shows why she remains an actress now capable of taking on any role. Her performance is so psychologically naked, her on-screen uncertainty and insecurity so piercing, that the raw pain at the core of this story never fades from view; hers is a performance that redeems everything else about this film. Mike Leonard February 06.</p></br><a href="../users/A31ARSC1LGY8WK.html">A31ARSC1LGY8WK</a><br/><p>Like "A Beautiful Mind", "Proof" attempts to create drama out of mathematicians who are losing their minds.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as a "nice-guy" grad student digging through the notes of a recently dead mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) looking for any mathematical nuggets - the so-called "proofs". Gwyneth Paltrow playing the mathematician's fragile daughter, struggles with a character whose motivations and actions are simply not credible.<br /><br />"Proof" betrays its stage origins in its overwrought speechifying and artifice. The revelation in the third act is not that big-a-deal and the denouement is abrupt. "Proof" has high-minded pretensions but is ultimately unsatisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Proof starring the gifted Gwyneth Paltrow is extraordinary. The film is directed by John Madden who also directed Paltrow in her oscar-winning performance, Shakespeare in Love. Proof also stars the legendary actor, Anthony Hopkins, Jake Gyllenhall and Hope Davis. They all play a vital role involving Paltrow's character who feels she is insane like her deceased math genius father (Hopkins). Her character struggles for sanity after the death of her much-respected father. Gyllenhaal's character is a former student of Hopkins and Davis plays Paltow's older sister. I like the ending, how the credits start to flow across the screen before the last scene is even done. Intelligent, low-key film. Check it out some time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is a fairly tough movie to give an opinion on without spoiling the end of the movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow is the daughter of a famous mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who had some incredible breakthroughs in the field.  At some point Hopkins had gone mad and Paltrow decided to devote all her time to taking care of him rather than place him in a mental facility.  When the movie begins, Hopkins has recently died.<br /><br />Jake Ghyndenhal (I think that is how you spell it) is a university student that was being tutored by Paltrow at her house.  He wants to examine over 200 notebooks that Hopkins had left behind in the house to determine if Hopkins had made any other breakthroughs that nobody knew of.  Paltrow tells him that all the notebooks were gibberish scribblings made during Hopkins insanity however, Jake insists that he needs to look at them.  This makes Paltrow suspect Jake of wanting to steal and publish some of her father's ideas as his own and she even accuses him of trying to steal some of her father's notebooks.  Jake does have one in fact, hidden in his jacket but he claims that he kept it only to give it to Paltrow as a gift because there was a note to Paltrow written by Hopkins in one of his lucid times.<br /><br />In the meantime, Paltrow's sister comes from out of town to help settle Hopkin's estate much to Paltrow's chagrin since her sister wants to sell the house and force Paltrow to move to New York with her.  Paltrow always hated her sister's superior attitude and this angers her to no end.<br /><br />The movie is fraught with flashbacks throughout especially to the one year period where Hopkins had become lucid.  During that time Hopkins had wanted to work and tackle mathematics again with Paltrow as his assistant.  He sits outside in a snowstorm writing.  When Paltrow explains all this to Jake and her sister, the audience is not sure whether what she tells them specifically about this episode (to say what would be a spoiler) is the truth or totally made up by Paltrow.<br /><br />The end of the movie presents the audience with a paradox and the audience is not sure whether the claims of Paltrow are the truth or not (we are never sure if the same madness that had overtaken her father had overtaken her too).<br /><br />This movie is pretty slow but intriguing.  It is the type of movie that could open a lot of discussion afterwards and I am sure that this could be a good film-English project for a University course.  I give it just under four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Gwyneth Paltrow plays Catherine, the daughter of a brilliant, but mentally-ill mathematician who has just died.  Jake Gyllenhaal, playing one of her father's students asks permission to look through the books of myriad nonsense which he wrote during his illness, on the off-chance that he might have done some useful work.  He is amazed when he discovers a proof of monumental importance to the mathematical community and his amazement grows when Paltrow claims authorship of the proof.  Things become more complicated for Catherine when her sister arrives from New York and treats her as if she had the same mental illness as her father.  This is a movie with a wonderfully-written script which is brilliantly played by the actors.  It is highly recommended viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>This isn't the type of film where you are mildly entertained and then forget about the movie within a day or two of seeing it. Instead, the directors have tackled the formidable challenge of adapting a successful Broadway show to screen and, in the process, it sometimes works in much better ways than the stage play, broadening the possibilities and losing some of the claustrophia of the limited stage sets.<br /><br /> It is hard to say exactly what 'genre" this play fits as it equal parts thriller, mystery and exploration of the human spirit.<br /><br />  On the surface, the film focuses on a formerly briliant mathematical genius (played by Anthony Hopkins) who went from flashes of brilliance in his early 20s to utter insanity as he got older (with brief remissions). His daughter seems to show promise as well but she fears that the same mental instablility which plagues her father will someday strike her as well. She is a sad, often bitter, person.<br /><br />  Gyneth Paltrow is so exceptional in the role of the daughter,  Catherine, a woman who is complex, difficult and anxious, that it is hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to the role. After her father's death, she is left to pick up the pieces with the help of a math student who is researching Catherine's father, in both his glory and illness.<br /><br />  In addition to hundreds of illegible journals left behind by her father, one stands out, possibly leading to a breakthrough moment in mathmatical history. It is, in short a great proof...but who wrote it? Did the genius father in one of his rare moments of remission? Or did his talented (but unacclaimed) daughter do so?<br /><br />  Needless to say, this raises issues of trust as well as how you prove something which is very hard to prove. Catherine has been a recluse for years, caring for her ailing father. She disappeared from academia and her reputation was never established. Contrast that with the history of her father and it his hard to decide who was most likely to be in a state of mind to come up with an elegant, groundbreaking proof.<br /><br />  As doubt rears its head, Catherine seems to be suspected by everyone around her, from her boyfriend to her sister. She nearly cracks completely under the pain and pressure and the film doesn't lead to a neat, pat resolution.<br /><br />  The word "Proof" revolves on so many levels in this lovely movie, hinting that some things are ultimately unproveable and must be taken on a certain degree of faith. Catherine nearly loses her strength, her spirit and her confidence in the process but she is stronger than she thinks, although her sister does her best to sabotage her confidence and whatever shreds of self-esteem she has left.<br /><br />  This is a deep, rich movie that makes one think about how we commit to people and ideas, how we prove that our accomplishments are our own (when all evidence seems to point to the contrary) and but how it is always a  the leap of faith to trust others. In that regard, these is no ultimate proof.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Proof" is based on the play by David Auburn, who contributed screenwriting skills as well. The film was directed by John Madden, who previously directed Gwyneth Paltrow in a successful run of the play in London. So both Madden and Paltrow come to the film with a lot of experience. They are joined by a superb film cast, most notably Hope Davis, in bringing this intriguing story of family and identity that revolves around an important mathematical proof to the screen. Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a brilliant mathematician (Anthony Hopkins) who struggled with mental illness. Catherine is very much like her father, so much that it scares her, and was very close to him. She gave up 5 years of her life to take care of him when he was overcome by psychosis. Now her father is dead, and Catherine's fastidious, controlling sister Claire (Hope Davis), has arrived to put everything in order and take control of Catherine's life, which she fears is heading off the deep end. A former student of their father's, Harold (Jake Gyllenhaal), is determined to look at every piece of gibberish the great man wrote in his last years in case any important math found its way through his madness. Catherine relents and leads Harold to the prize: a fantastic proof. But who wrote it?<br /><br />I have only occasionally seen any indication that Gwyneth Paltrow is anything more than a mediocre actress, but those little glimmers of talent were signs of better things to come. Paltrow is very good in this role. Catherine is an intelligent, fragile woman whose outbursts may or may not indicate instability, but who has consciously chosen to deny her nature, even to herself. From the outside, she is an unnerving enigma. From the inside, she suffered tremendously for her father's madness. Director John Madden presents this story as dual narratives: The subjective past, which we see through Catherine's memories, is alternated with the objective present. This is very effective. Clues to the film's 2 mysteries, Catherine's character and the proof's authorship, are found in the past, which unfolds simultaneously with the present narrative that focuses on Catherine's changing relationships with Claire and Harold. I applaud Madden's decision to use a steadicam to impart a sense of realism and immediacy. It works nicely, and it's a whole lot better than a shaky handheld. "Proof" is a thoroughly enjoyable film whose characters always have something interesting going on in their minds. Its talkiness betrays its theatrical roots, but Madden has done such a good job of placing the action in natural settings that I was rarely aware of the film's theatricality.<br /><br />The DVD (Buena Vista/Miramax 2006): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, 2 deleted and 1 extended scene with optional director's commentary (7 min), and an audio commentary. "From Stage to Screen: The Making of Proof" (10 min) includes interviews with director John Madden, producers, and cast who discuss the characters and adapting the play to film. There is a good audio commentary in which John Madden contributes a lot of analysis of the narrative structure and characters, taking us through Catherine's thoughts and emotions, as well as discussing themes, visual style, dialogue, and directorial decisions. Captions are available for the film in English. Subtitles and dubbing are available in French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>Gwyneth Paltrow is Catherine, a young mathematician who is the daughter of Robert, a legendary mathematician ruined by mental illness and played by Anthony Hopkins.  The lives of mathematicians revolve around their ability to craft coherent answers, or proofs for elaborate mathematical questions.  Few mathematicians successfully and single-handedly arrive at a significant proof in their careers and, as "Proof" suggests, most mathematicians hit their peak in their mid-twenties.  Robert managed the first hurdle, but as to the second - his life degenerated into an existence trapped in a house of math books and notebooks riddled with incomprehensible figures.  Catherine, having dropped out of school to care for her father, already wonders if she's destined to suffer the same life of mental illness as her father.  She "loses" time, and endures spates of depression that keep her bedridden for days.  However, when she's up and about, her sometimes lucid father engages her in number games, and urges her to work on proofs while out of school - he himself suddenly feels competent enough to work out a new proof, one which will compensate for years wasted looking for alien messages in Dewey-Decimal codes at the local library.  Mathematics is both home and prison for all mathematicians - it's absorbing, and those steeped in its ways find themselves undone trying to rely on it to explore and explain their reality.  And when a possibly groundbreaking proof is found in one of Robert's many notebooks the script turns into a battle of wills between Catherine who claims to have written it, and Claire who thinks that Catherine is using the proof to hold onto a bleak existence in Chicago where she will follow her father's path into madness.<br /><br />Robert is already dead when "Proof" starts, and we only meet him in flashbacks that hint at both his and his daughter's sanity.  In the "present", in the aftermath of Robert's death, Catherine must deal with Harold "Hal" Dobbs (Gylenhaal), a young mathematician who may represent Robert's opposite - sane but also mediocre.  Hal loves her, or maybe he's in love with being the boyfriend of the daughter of a legendary mathematician, and he's obsessed with finding the shreds of a master-proof buried in hundreds of notebook pages of scribbles.  Then there's Claire (Hope Davis), Catherine's older sister, an established financial analyst in Manhattan (the story is set in Chicago).  One of the best scenes in the flick (and easily the funniest in what's not quite a laugh-riot movie) is the first meeting of Hal & Claire.  Already beginning to suspect that Catherine is well on the road to emotional instability, Claire drills Catherine on details about Hal - always referring to him by his full name, as if he were a delusion of Catherine and needed first and last name to ground him in reality.  In the next scene - driving up to Catherine's and finding Hal already there, Claire points at him with angry vindication - "Harold - Briggs!!".  (The script slyly suggests that Claire may be at least as insane as her father, but found in her job and home an existence that accommodates her mental state.)  When the disputed "proof" is first found, Harold becomes the battleground between Claire and Catherine - the older sister convinced that their father found lucidity before his death to author a last heuristic hurrah.<br /><br />This was a great film, though largely on its performances - the story itself seems unfinished, with a too-pat ending.  I never thought much of Gylenhaal, though he's incredibly mature if befuddled by Catherine (if you didn't like "The Good Girl" because of him, he's still great here).  The deft script makes him a cutting composite of a man who genuinely feels for Catherine while also being exactly what Catherine hates about mathematicians - geeks who hit their peak early and spend the rest of their lives bragging about conferences they attend, playing in horrible rock bands, poking holes in the proofs of others and paving the way for the next generation of mathematicians.  Hope Davis makes the most out of Catherine's extremely unlikable sister, in a script that has little patience for her.  The movie of course belongs to Paltrow who seems to be both fighting a losing battle for sanity and fighting off those who might try to rescue her from it - it's her least "Hollywood" performance, prickly and unfriendly yet oddly beguiling.  Catherine has already learned that math is a prison, but spends the rest of the story trying to find something other than the disputed proof to save her from that cell.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>***1/2<br /><br />Superb acting is the chief selling point of "Proof," the generally interesting film version of the David Auburn play, adapted by Auburn and Rebecca Miller and directed by John ("Shakespeare in Love") Madden.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins plays an aging math genius whose career was cut tragically short when he fell victim to some form of mental illness in his late 20's.  In the years since, he has been little more than a shell of his former self, reduced to shuffling around the house in his bathrobe while filling up endless notebooks - originally intended for brilliant mathematical proofs and formulas - with incoherent messages and doodling.  Gwyneth Paltrow, in one of her most demanding roles, portrays Catherine, his equally bright younger daughter, who is firmly convinced that she is succumbing to the same mental illness that has claimed her father.  Hope Davis is her older sister, Claire, who left their Chicago home to make a new life for herself in New York, but who, now, on the death of their father, has returned with the express purpose of bringing Catherine back home with her in order to "care" for her.  The fourth main character is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), a young math professor who admires the work of the once-great Robert and who, as both a friend and potential romantic interest, really doesn't believe that Catherine is losing her mind at all.<br /><br />In thematic terms, "Proof" makes us ponder where exactly that fine line is that separates sanity from insanity and how we can ever really know if and when we are crossing over it.  As embodied by Paltrow, Catherine becomes a fascinatingly complex character, one whom we seem to be looking at as through a shattered mirror or fractured lens, never quite sure whether each image at any given moment is a true reflection of who she is or a mere illusion.  Paltrow slides in and out of Catherine's many moods with such precision and conviction that she makes us aware of the scary and literally maddening nature of her character's predicament.  As Claire, Hope Davis delivers a beautifully insightful performance as a woman of practicality and reason who apparently has no means of understanding or coping with the certifiable insanity of her father and the possible insanity of her sister.  In the fairly small but pivotal role of the deceased genius, the always reliable Hopkins appears entirely in flashbacks and in scenes depicting Catherine's imagination.  Finally, Gyllenhaal brings an earnestness and intensity to the part of Hal, a character that could have fallen into callowness in less capable hands.<br /><br />The filmmakers have certainly "opened up" the play to the point where it never feels theater-based or stage bound.  The dialogue is literate and incisive, for the most part, although there are times when the movie comes across more as an intellectual exercise than a fully convincing drama about real people.  That`s where, lucky for us, the actors step in to perform their magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, there are several definitions of the word "proof" that apply to the movie of the same name adapted from the David Auburn play.  The etymology of the word can be traced back to the Latin "probare," meaning, "to prove."  Both parts of the first definition of "proof" as a noun come into play: "(a) the cogency of evidence that compels acceptance by the mind of a truth or a fact; (b) the process or an instance of establishing the validity of a statement especially by derivation from other statements in accordance with principles of reasoning."  But there is also another meaning of proofs that is relevant to the story, which in the field of mathematics, where a proof is a demonstration that, assuming certain axioms, some statement is necessarily true.<br /><br />Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the daughter of a Robert (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician who has recently died.  Robert made two enormous contributions to the field when he was in his early 20s and then got "sick," a euphemism by which his family and friends referred to his schizophrenia when they were not coming right out and saying the man went mad.  Catherine followed in her father's footsteps, studying mathematics, albeit at a different university, and she is worried that maybe she is like him in having mental problems as well.  After all, her father is dead and she is still having conversations with him.  But she has more immediate concerns because now that Robert is dead, the vultures are circling down.<br /><br />There is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), who was Robert's student and has taken it upon himself to go throw the dozens of notebooks in which he scribbled mathematical formulas and insane ramblings.  Catherine suspects Hal is looking for something that he can steal as his own to make his own reputation, and hitting on her does not make her think much more of him.  Claire (Hope Davis), her sister comes in from out of town, sells their father's house from under Catherine, whom she seems convinced, is having mental problems.  Then Catherine gives Hal a notebook, and in the notebook there is a proof (of the mathematical sort).<br /><br />The proof appears to be brilliant, but that, of course, has to be proven.  But then Catherine claims that she and not Robert is the author of the proof.  Both Hal and Claire find this hard to believe, and on some level Catherine has doubts as well.  Is she a brilliant mathematician like her father, trying to attain a validation now that she never received before, or is she simply schizophrenic?  More importantly, what would constitute sufficient proof to prove any or all of the above?<br /><br />I have not had a math class since I was a freshman in high school when I took geometry, so I have no clue what the math geeks in this movie are talking about, but that is okay because it is the idea of the proof and not the proof itself that matters in "Proof."  But when I stopped taking math courses I started participating in debate, so I know something about the fine art (if not science) of argument and how to prove things.  The irony here is that neither Hal nor Claire, nor Catherine for that matter, seek any proof.  They all make assumptions and the only relevant evidence has to do with penmanship.  This leads to the question of what sort of proof we would be willing to accept, but director John Madden is not leaving that to chance.<br /><br />"Proof" will appeal to those who are interested in the fine line between genius and madness, even if that idea is becoming overly related to the field of mathematics in movies of late.  Paltrow's character is at the heart of the story and virtually every scene is between her and the other characters.  Hopkin's character goes from lucidity to ravings, but what matters is how Paltrow reacts to him, because they constitute the key proof as to her emotional state and mathematical abilities.  Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes with whichever way the wind is blowing, but it is Davis who's compassion and concern for her Catherine is chilling, so there was a strong sense in how I wanted Claire to be wrong more than I wanted Catharine to be right.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q4XAQXKKV6V.html">A3Q4XAQXKKV6V</a><br/><p>Reading many of the one-two star reviews pretty much sums up my feelings. The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor "ever" is barely seen and when he is it feels like "Instinct" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the "tuh-duh" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!<br /><br />Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same. Proof is just a watered down version of a Beautiful Mind mixed with a high profile cast that prove sleepwalking and acting at the same time is possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Not since the last time John Madden directed her in "Shakespeare in Love" has Gwyneth Paltrow done such sterling work as she does here as Catherine Llewelyn, the daughter of a legendary mathematician and a pained woman on the verge. The vast challenge Madden faces here is cinematizing a play about intellectuals discussing the decidedly non-visual subject of mathematical proofs. He only partially succeeds in opening up the play by effectively using real-life locations at my alma mater, the University of Chicago, as well as interweaving moments that occur in the past and present with surprisingly seamlessness.<br /><br />What Madden does less well is make the math interesting to the viewer, which Gus Van Sant did to better effect in "Good Will Hunting" and Ron Howard with more visual style in "A Beautiful Mind". The fabled proofs of Catherine's father Robert are discussed but not shown to any illuminating effect for the viewer, and consequently we are not engaged in the characters' extensive discussions about them. Instead, we have to relay on the credibility of the actors discussing them, a big dramatic presumption on the part of Madden. The literate plot revolves around Catherine's obsessive perception that she is descending into madness like her father before his death, and in particular, the mystery around the authorship of a breakthrough proof, i.e., whether Catherine or Robert came up with it.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins portrays Robert with his trademark bluster, but since his character consists of flashbacks in Catherine's mind, we really don't get a chance to understand his perspective on his own dementia. As Catherine's controlling sister Claire, Hope Davis proves again to be among the more chameleonic actors around as her character's narrower mindset cannot begin to fathom the creative genius of her family. It's really a thankless, two-dimensional role since Claire simply observes and provides an unwelcome myopia to the situation. Unlike his Brokeback role, Jake Gyllenhaal truly does play a supporting role here as Hal, a protege of Robert's who is so impassioned by mathematics that he pores through Robert's notebooks for days on end. While sincere and engaged, the actor hardly looks like your typical math geek and must additionally carry through the somewhat preposterous romantic situation that occurs in the middle of Catherine's mental incapacitation.<br /><br />On the whole, I think this piece should have been left onstage given the reams of dialogue here. I don't feel the screenplay by David Auburn (the original playwright) and Rebecca Miller (Arthur's daughter and a better writer than a film director judging from her 2005 film "The Ballad of Jack and Rose") is entirely successful in translating it to maximum effect for the screen.  Nonetheless, Paltrow's galvanizing performance and the dramatic intensity of key scenes will reward the more patient among us. The DVD has relatively little in the way of extras, though it does contain a generally informative audio commentary track by Madden. There is a brief, making-of featurette that allows Madden and the actors to provide some valuable insights into the play and the characters. There are three deleted scenes, one actually an alternate to what was finally used, all understandably excised from the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6.html">A1TEMNM9ZEOLJ6</a><br/><p>Adaptation of a play with little action, but some decent dialogue. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a crazy daughter of a crazy math genius. The 'proof' is a math term. I was entertained, but this is fairly forgettable stuff. The sister has some nice moments playing down to the crazy one. You won't laugh and you won't cry.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>PROOF proves two things that I've always thought obvious. Theoretical mathematicians can attain fame but not riches, and, unless they jam in a rock band in their spare time, are unlikely to find sexual partners.<br /><br />As the film opens, renowned math professor Robert (Anthony Hopkins) has just recently died of a ruptured aneurysm, leaving his daughter Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) alone in their rambling Chicago house. The funeral is to be the next day, for which Catherine's estranged sister Claire (Hope Davis) is flying in from New York City. Also intermittently present is Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), one of Robert's former students and now a mathematician in his own right, who, when not casting smoldering looks of longing at Catherine, is going through 113 of his mentor's handwritten notebooks looking for mathematical insights of genius worth publishing. The thing is, Robert had been "insane" for a good part of the last several years, and those notebooks contain nothing but gibberish.<br /><br />This film is as good as it is because of the exceptional performance of Paltrow, perhaps the best of her career, and which should be worth an Oscar nomination. Forget the romantic comedy fluff she's appeared in previously. Gyllenhaal, Davis, and Hopkins are also strong in supporting roles, but the viewer may not notice.<br /><br />The obvious conflict is between Catherine, emotionally battered from years as her father's sole care giver while trying to complete her own math studies at Northwestern, and the perky and obnoxious Claire, who's been off in the Big Apple leading a real life. Then, things heat up when Catherine shares with Hal a notebook squirreled away in Dad's old desk - a notebook that apparently contains a long-sought mathematical proof that would, if validated, turn the discipline on its collective ear. Hal first believes the proof was authored by Robert because it appears to be in his handwriting. Then Catherine claims that the astounding find was her doing. Unless true authorship can be determined, getting it published will be problematic.<br /><br />Compared to the undoubted power of Paltrow's dramatic performance, I thought the plot relatively weak. (Perhaps it's because differential calculus caused me to flame out and crash as a college frosh decades ago.) Robert's mental malady is unconvincing because the audience never really discovers what ails him, and he actually seems pretty normal in most of the flashbacks in which he appears. But weakest was the issue of the proof's questionable authorship. Well before the film's conclusion, the audience knows who really wrote it; Hal strongly suspects, but still can't see a way to prove it. OK then, why not just have the pages of the notebook dusted for fingerprints? The true author would have left them in droves to the exclusion of the other candidate. Hal needs to get out more.<br /><br />As fine a film as this is, tossing out the distractions of Hal and The Proof could have made it a leaner and meaner story of sibling conflict, albeit less of an offbeat love story.</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>I had a psychiatry professor in medical school who advised us about recognizing depression in our patients.  "If you start to feel depressed being around them, then they probably have depression", we were told.  A different psychiatry professor gave us a lecture on the sometimes grey area that exists between "genius" and mental illness.  For example, he proposed, if modern miracle anti-depressant medications like Prozac were available, would you have treated Van Gogh - preventing him from disfiguring and ultimately killing himself, IF you knew that by treating his "illness" you might also be depriving him (and the world) of his "genius".<br /><br />That is a good question that has no definitive answer.  This film explores that nebulous area `twixt genius and madness.  It also looks at relationships, trust and "love" between father and daughter, between sisters and between lovers.  The reason I began this review discussing how it can make you feel depressed being in the company of depressed people is that watching this movie made me feel a little depressed.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow stars in David Auburn's script, adapted from his play, as Anthony Hopkins' daughter, Catherine.  Hopkins' Robert was a math genius, twice making "life-time achievement" kind of discoveries in the field before age 27, at which time he began to become ill with a mental illness that caused him to deteriorate until his death many years later.  Much of the film is told in flashback.  Catherine took care of Robert for his last half-decade.  Did she do it out of daughterly duty?  Did she do it to be near her father's mathematical genius as she was working out her own mathematical proofs?  Did she do it to avoid moving forward with her own life and academic career?  The film suggests perhaps all three, and leaves the viewer to your own conclusions.  Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Hal, one of Robert's graduate students, smart enough to understand the high world of mathematic academics, but not quite genius enough to make the kind of revolutionary breakthroughs that make you legend.  After Robert passes away Hal asks permission to read through Robert's copious notebooks where he scribbled down page after page of gibberish, hoping that a spark of genius will appear amid the mad scribbling.  Hope Davis appears as Robert's other daughter, Claire.  Although Catherine may have inherited some of Dad's genius, Claire is the one who seems to have her life in more order - for the kind of folks who think lives should be orderly.  Claire flies into town for Robert's funeral as well, hoping to interject some order into Catherine's life.<br /><br />The film does not delve into deeper mathematics.  Rudimentary arithmetic is not required to view "Proof".  The movie looks at the lives of these people and presents the characters "as is".  We see that Hal also plays drum in an alternative rock band made up of math grad students.  One of their pieces is called "I" after the imaginary number that equals negative one when squared - this song consists of the band standing silently on stage after telling the audience the name of the song.  If you're the kind of person who might find such things entertaining - this may be the film for you.<br /><br />The storyline concentrates on Catherine and explores whether or not she may have inherited her father's genius, or his madness, or both.  Although the film is filled with the fine acting you'd expect from a collection of Academy Award winners and nominees, it was not the most pleasant thing for me to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I don't know how "Proof" worked on stage, but for me it just did not work well on film.

It was intellectually and intelligently done, and it even stars two of the most versatile actors today, Jake Gyllenhaal (Hal) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Catherine) as well as seasoned actor, Anthony Hopkins (Robert Llewyln) and supporting actress, Hope Davis (Claire).  The core of the film centers on Catherine coming to terms with her father's passing, and what evolves from her experience is her struggle with her identity.  Who is she? and What is it that she really wants to be or does not want to be?  The film goes through the process of her grasping and grappling with the reality that she too is a mathematician as her father, but she appears to deny it or hide it for fear of upstaging his  work.  In addition, Catherine temporary loses her ability to make pertinent choices that would reflect her own life.<br /><br />The film is intense and perplexing.  The direction by John Madden and the screenplay by David Auburn and Rebecca Miller were highly effective in showing the complicated storyline, and their use of flashbacks allowed the viewer to understand Catherine's relationship and her witness to her father's debilitating condition.  Also, the investigative technique used to reveal the truth behind Catherine's father's notebook and Catherine was quite intriguing as well.<br /><br />I recommend this film for anyone who likes a thought provoking film.

As many say on the net, the film is based on the critically acclaimed play (which I have not seen). It is about Catherine (Paltrow) and her recently deceased father Robert (Anthony Hopkins). Robert was a genius of mathematics, but his last days, as is suggested in flashbacks, were troubled ones.<br /><br />Now one interesting thing happens after his death. Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal), former student of Robert, finds a notebook, which might or might not contain a brilliant finding of mathematics. Of course, we need a proof as to the authenticity of the writing. But eventually Hal realizes another proof is needed: who really wrote this?<br /><br />[STAGY (YOU MAY LIKE IT OR NOT)] `Proof' is no more about mathematic theories than `A Beautiful Mind' was. `Proof' is about Catherine and other three characters - her father, Hal, and her domineering sister Claire (Hope Davies). Almost all the dialogues are exchanged between Catherine and one of these three roles, and their exchanged words, which often get emotional, suggest the truths about their relations and the past. The method is notable for its lengthy speech, which reminds us its stage origin, and whether you like it or not, you never forget that you are watching a filmed version of a stage production.<br /><br />But perhaps that would not be really annoying. Paltrow' shows splendid acting, so does Hopkins. Unfortunately Davies and Gyllenhaal are less compelling than the other two, partly because Davies's character is basically a off-putting one, and Gyllenhaal's unconvincing. His must show enough intelligence to convince us that he can notice the true value of the notebook in his ex-instructor's library. Sorry, but I couldn't see anything like that.<br /><br />Oscar-winning `Shakespeare in Love' is one of my favorite films, but if the director had been someone else, it could be much better than what we are seeing now. John Madden, who directed both `Shakespeare' and `Proof,' handles the material pretty well here, but the results are far from perfect. The overuse of flashbacks is confusing, and when the film shows the romance, his direction becomes suddenly banal. And it must be admitted that the film gets silly sometimes. Throwing such a precious notebook into a car window? Didn't he think of any better idea?<br /><br />`Proof' has intelligence, and the academia presented here looks real enough. But I'm afraid that is exactly the reason I was disappointed with the film. The performance is strong and good enough to make us care the characters while the story is convoluting, requiring us too much patience to follow it. The film says the notebook contains a significant discovery of mathematics while they don't even think of the simplest way to prove who wrote it In this way the characters are presented with superb acting, but we are never truly allowed to feel the pains or regrets of them.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Proving or disproving something is the goal of many mathematicians. But PROOF takes that equation into an entirely different dynamic. Gwyneth Paltrow (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998) as Catherine gives the best performance of all in this ensemble cast. She's the daughter of a genius (Anthony Hopkins, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, 1991) who'd lost his mind and recently died. But his brilliance was legendary. His equations changed mathematical history. And when Catherine appears to be just as brilliant as her father, her fears drive her to extremes. She feels she may be losing her mind, too, so she hides her intellect behind a mask of despair, longing for her lost father. Behind this facade we see her own battle with depression and her worries that she may be too much like her father. Will she end up just as mad as he? This is the question that eats at Catherine throughout the story.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, 2005) plays Hal, the love interest, as well as a math student trying to come up with his own proof (i.e. mathematical breakthrough). He's pouring over Catherine's father's final papers, trying to determine if there was anything of value left in his fractured mind just before his death. And when Catherine gives him a key to the desk, Jake uncovers what could be a discovery of monumental importance. But who wrote it? The father ...or the daughter?<br /><br />Hope Davis (THE MATADOR, 2005) stars as Claire, Catherine's distant sister who returns to town to help bury their father and to tick Catherine off of her "to-do list." She was the other shining star in the film, acting as a neurotically classic type-A personality.<br /><br />______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Although PROOF held my interest, it's impact on me was negligible. There was no "hallelujah" moment where everything fit together or where an actor or actress did something extraordinary. They just ...were.<br /><br />The pacing of the film was pretty laid back, too. Director John Madden seemed in no particular hurry to get a resolution to the audience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But for a "family dynamic" film, there could've (should've) been something more gripping that held my interest.<br /><br />I will say that the picture was acted and shot well. Just not "very" well. Anthony Hopkins was just Anthony Hopkins, for instance.<br /><br />Psychology students might eat this story up, but for the general population it may fall pretty flat.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>"Proof", directed by John Madden ("Shakespeare In Love") and based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn, features fine performances by Anthony Hopkins, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jake Gyllenhaal. But...<br /><br />After her father (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant mathematician, dies, Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow), also a fine mathematician in her own right, fears she might have inherited her father's madness. Dad's student advisor, Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal) comes over, under the pretense of helping her organize his papers, but she suspects he may be foraging through her father's office to find some hidden work, to publish under his own name. Her sister, Claire (Hope Davis), a controlling busybody, arrives from New York in time for the funeral. Claire is concerned about her sister and wants her to move to New York with her. Hal manages to convince Catherine that he is looking out for her, and her father's best interest, so Catherine gives him a notebook containing a proof for a previously unsolved problem. Hal is amazed and certain that it should be published. Then Catherine reveals that she wrote it. Claire and Hal don't believe her and Catherine becomes despondent.<br /><br />Basing a film on a play is a tricky thing. A dramatic play is a very different beast from a film. When you are watching a dramatic play, your attention is focused on the actor speaking their lines. As the story unfolds, one or two other characters may enter and exit the scene. When the scene is over, the scenery changes and a new scene begins. When you adapt such a thing to film, you have the opportunity to "open up" the action; to expand the scope and breadth of the characters and their movements. In a film, you can cut back and forth between different places in the same timeline. More than two or three actors can appear on screen at one time. Some filmed adaptations do this very well, making you forget you the source material was ever performed on a stage. Others, not so well. "Proof" is about halfway between.<br /><br />The film is clearly adapted from a play. Catherine is the main character and she is one screen for almost the entire film. In every scene, she only interacts with one or two characters and the action rarely moves from her house or her father's classroom. It seems very "stagy".<br /><br />The thing that saves "Proof" is the acting. The first scene, with Paltrow and Hopkins threatens to bring the film down to the level of "Closer", one of the worst `play-to-film' adaptations I have ever seen; "I love you." "No, I love you." Paltrow's Catherine is having a conversation with her father, yet they never touch and they always stand a few feet away. Hmmm. I wonder if he is dead? Sure, enough. But the secret is never really a secret. We know he dies, so why even have the pretense?<br /><br />But after this initial attempt by the writer to prove how clever he is, we start to get to know the characters and their complexities and enjoy the acting.<br /><br />Hopkins is a great actor and if anyone can make a crazy person seem real, it is Hopkins. I remember hearing a conversation with Michael Caine. He said that the best way to play someone drunk is to not slur your words and do all of the stereotypical things. And he is right. If you have ever seen Caine play drunk, he plays it perfectly. Hopkins seems to follow this same rule. He is a man who is crazy, yet he doesn't have continuous yelling episodes, claim he is Napoleon, or any of the other stereotypes. He simply becomes quiet at times and excited at others. Clearly, he is losing his mental faculty, as evidenced by the fact that he is very sad, sad that he is no longer the brilliant thinker he once was. When he has a moment of inspiration, and believes that he might be able to work again, he excitedly announces his plans to his daughter.<br /><br />Paltrow is good, but she is a bit too hysterical through most of the film for my liking. She yells a lot, cries a lot and is generally unpleasant as she copes with the loss of her father and the possible loss of her sanity. The best scene involves Catherine and Hal. As they become closer to one another, Hal leans in and kisses her. She is very vulnerable, because she hasn't had a relationship in a long time. After they make love, she isn't immediately a happy, lovely new person, as so many films portray. She is still morose and in mourning, but more calm.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is also good. Hal is a bit of a mystery for the first part of the film as we are unsure if he is trying to steal the professor's work. Unfortunately, the story makes this pretty clear about halfway through, when the mystery turns to whether Catherine actually authored the work. Towards the end, his character becomes a bit superfluous, but until that point, he is interesting to watch.<br /><br />Throughout the entire film, there are two or three scenes with large groups of people. Beyond that, we never see more than two or three people together at any time. The film attempts to open up Catherine's character by flashing back to other points in her life. But even these flashbacks only have two or three people in them. Because of this, the film feels claustrophobic and dense. I'm sure this is intended to give Catherine an extra level of dimension, but what it does is make the film seem small.<br /><br />"Proof" is a good film, but painting the same story on a larger landscape would have made the film seem more significant and interesting. Instead, it seems like we are watching a filmed presentation of the play, like they used to do for PBS. I don't mind watching these on PBS, but I don't like paying $8 or $10 to watch it. I would rather go see the play.</p></br></body></html>

I like Jennifer Weiner though I haven't read this partiular book- but then I recognized Susannah Grant's name from the fame Erin Brockvich movie and my interest perked up.  Rightly so.  In Her Shoes is a wonderful character study about sisters/ friendship or just plain ole relationships.  They're hard-sometimes impossible and more time than you care to admit you just want to toss your hands up and walk away from them all.  But emotions don't always follow logic and I think the actors as well as the screenwriter successfully gets that point across.  In the begining you will hate Maggie but by the end you will come to understand and perhaps love her-despite the flaws.  Even Rose the martyr has a few cracks in the mirror and her character arch isn't as dynamic as Maggie's but at least she's smiling by the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1O60Q7LBN4MQ.html">A1O60Q7LBN4MQ</a><br/><p>This is a good sister relationship movie. I liked it because it has a good script and doesn't go just for laughs. I guess it's what used to be called a melodrama. It's a word that seems out of use today but fits this movie perfectly.<br /><br />It's about two sisters who are very different from each other. Cameron Diaz plays Maggie, who enjoys a life of dalliances and trifling experiences. Her sister Rose is played by Toni Collette. She is a serious lawyer who used to make herself feel better by food and has turned to shoes. Both Maggie and Rose are trying to fill a void in their lives. But it's Rose that has to bail Maggie out of trouble and is tired of it. She wants a real life. Their fragile relationship is damaged when Maggie has a fling with Rose's suitor...or at least Rose wants him to be a suitor. They lose touch with each other when Maggie decides to go to her long lost grandmother.<br /><br />This is a great rainy afternoon movie that maybe some sensitive guys can get into as well (but I wouldn't count on it!). Get some ice cream and curl up on the sofa or in the bed and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>This is a good one to see...the differences between sisters.I thought it had a great storyline...and had a great ending also. Not just for the girls to see I think a good man would enjoy this also.  It's probably more an age thing to feel this movie has any meaning.<br /><br />A Must See</p></br><a href="../users/A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q.html">A2VD2D1QHCMF9Q</a><br/><p>This is a pleasant movie.  It starts off with a self-absorbed younger sister ruining just about every thing and every one she comes in contact with.  The older sister is responsible, hard working, sensitive, and has a poor self image.<br /><br />The re-acquaintance with a long lost grandmother brings the sisters balance and success in their lives. It also gives the grandmother some peace, which was missing from her life for decades.<br /><br />Although the film is predictable, it has humor and pathos, and leaves you with a good feeling.  Nothing very deep, but it is enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EOLRV216BXJ9.html">A1EOLRV216BXJ9</a><br/><p>The beginning of the movie saw two struggling women - a drifting and jobless Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and her elder sister Rose (a slim Toni Collette), a lawyer who took care of Maggie in time of need. Both were unhappy and after a bitter quarrel split apart abruptly.<br /><br />Came to their rescue was grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine) - a healer who helped Maggie stand on her feet (a job and a home), reunite the two sisters and consequently found herself reconciliated with her son-in-law.<br /><br />Although the movie had a slow and depressing start, it lighted up with hope when Shirley Maclaine showed up and graced the screen with her intelligence, subtleness and worldliness. The movie provided us a glimpse of an active community for retirement in Florida and it was here that Maggie found her worth and career. Cameron Diaz, as Maggie, looked very much in the role - she was so unattractive before her life was transformed by Maclaine but radiant with purpose afterwards, so much so she could rescue Toni Corette's fallen apart engagement. Toni Corette (Mauriel's wedding) was the one to watch. She was not very beautiful yet she was real and unpretentious. She had far less scenes with Shirley Maclaine than Cameron Diaz did, but she alone could deliver her own struggle with her feelings for and against her sister fluidly and capture attention. Towards the end, there were warm moments that could evoke an overflow of emotions and sentiments.<br /><br />Blood is thicker than water. An emotional baggage not handled means one (Maggie) has not yet grown up and jeopardised one's (Rose's) happiness even with an engagement ring on the finger. A feel good movie that women audience could definitely relate to their personal experiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>A great film with great acting and a great story. The soty starts like any other movie but ends up tugging at your heart and making you fall in love with it's charactors. The story is about 2 oppoist sisters who get in a big fight and go diffrent ways. Camreon diaz dose a great job in her best preformance yet. The movie has some slow parts but mostly the movie is good. There is also amny almost teary moments between the sisters and the other characters. One of 2005 best films and it's one that you'll love.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>I frequently judge a book by its cover and a movie by its titles. When Garbage's Stupid Girl started rolling in dolby, I knew the director's taste was very much on the ball for a theme where a high roller leaves a lucrative job to become a dog walker. As achingly familiar as the rest of the premise may seem (family folk coming together) this is an earnest, contemporary dramedy about adults -- ok, women -- that has little use for cynicism or oh-so-clever hipness. It chugs right along, all the three leads do their bit, especially Shirley McLaine who even steers Diaz to class hitherto unseen from her (although the shots of Miami could really have done without their glossy painful golden tint), and by the time you're done, you realize that this effortless little delight has in fact built up enough emotional curve to couch quite a touching statement about life and love. A bit like Wonder Boys, that shared the texture of this film. Which means I should probably caveat my gloating paean with the usual 'For discerning audiences only' as a film of this cadence may not appeal to those weaned on a steady diet of Something About Mary or She's the Man. Highly recommended rental if you covet meaning in your movies and don't mind a story that unfurls like a flower instead of a Jack in the Box.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is a naughty party girl. We first meet her when she's throwing up in the rest room of a nightclub, a young hunk hovering over her in disgust. Insecure and neglected, she's been coasting through life basically on her looks. But time is steadily catching up with her; she can no longer rely on her tarty beauty and her ability to beguile men as much as she used to.<br /><br />Her more introverted sister Rose (Toni Collette) is Maggie's mirror opposite: She's superficially a mess - a slightly overweight workaholic who settles for finding love in the pages of romance novels. She buys shoes because they are the only item of clothing that fits her properly, and marvels at her handsome boss' presence in her bed, even taking a photo of him to prove that he is actually there.<br /><br />Both these sisters are insecure, but in different ways and about different things. With Maggie passed out drunk, Rose needs to come pick her up. When she tries to take Maggie back to their father's house, however, she's barred at the door by their evil stepmother, who insists Rose take her sister home with her. Maggie steals from and betrays Rose, she helps herself to her sister's expensive shoes, ice cream, and other stuff that she knows she's no supposed to take.<br /><br />Rose is obviously angry with her sister's laziness and lack of ambition, yet she is reluctant to evict her, when Maggie betrays Rose in a moment of thoughtlessness, a gigantic rift is caused between them. Finally evicted, she boards a bus to Florida without a word to anyone, hooking up with her long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine). Ella helps Maggie get back on track, finding her a job as a hospice worker and helping her start a business as a personal shopper for the assisted-living set. Rose meanwhile comes to terms with her insecurities by quitting her job and becoming a part-time dog walker and even gaining a new boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein) in the process.<br /><br />In Her Shoes is all about the ups and downs of sibling love between injured and self-doubting opposites. And while this issue has obviously been movingly explored in other movies, rarely has it been tackled with such emotional honesty. Although In her Shoes may be earnest, and contemporary, and it certainly highlights the needs and insecurities of women; the film is not that ironical - apart from the fact that Maggie and Rose are apprehensive about different things, and it's interestingly un-cynical; there's definitely no room for cutting-edge, or clever hipness in director Curtis Hanson's world.<br /><br />Instead we have a heart felt and well acted drama that is more interested in flirting around the mysteries of a love-hate relationship and selling the message of the importance of family and that everything's probably going to turn out alright in the end. For Rose, salvation and deliverance comes in the form of exotic food and a man who disregards her propensity to put on the pounds and can finally love her for whom she is, and for Maggie it comes in the form of newly found confidence, insight, responsibity, and even poetry!<br /><br />The acting is generally top-notch, with the incredible Ms. Collette, with her horsy laugh and wide, puppy dog eyes proving that she's one of the most versatile actors around. And Shirley MacLaine does a nicely understated turn as Grandma Ella, but it is Cameron Diaz who is the real find here, giving one of her best performances in years as the irresponsible, good for nothing vamp Maggie.<br /><br />In Her Shoes lacks originality and is fairly formulaic fare, but it builds to a surprising level of emotional power, and makes up for its shortcomings with its understated intelligence, sensitivity and finely attuned sense of character. Hanson is a restrained but confident director who knows that an audience will remain engaged to a story, no matter how prescribed, as long as people they care about populate it.

One is a career-focused workaholic lawyer, Rose Feller (Toni Collette),  who is drab and slightly plump.  Rose has one weakness of wonderful, colorful expensive shoes she can always fit, but never wears outside her apartment.  She also likes to fill her fridge with delicious Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream.<br /><br />She has a younger sister, Maggie (Cameron Diaz) who is blond, tall, shapely, beautiful, dyslexic, binge drinker, and seductress.  Her sister Ruth is constantly rescuing her from parties, high school reunions, and one night stands.  Maggie also likes to borrow Rose's shoes - and wears them outside the home.<br /><br />The movie opens with a rescue by Rose returning her to her parent's home.  The stepmother has had enough of Maggie's irresponsible behavior and throws her out of the house.  Rose takes her to her home.<br /><br />Rose soon tires of Maggie's behavior, irresponsibility and failure to find a steady job.  The last straw is a heart-wrenching betrayal . Maggie seduces Rose's new and only love in many years.  He also was her immediate supervisor at the law firm.  Rose throws Maggie out of her home.  She is also so traumatized she quits the law firm she had dedicated her life to.  She survives and learns who really cares for her.  She also falls into a dog-walking job and finds true love with another lawyer she used to work with.<br /><br />Maggie, looking for money to survive goes through her father's drawer and finds a bunch of hidden letters from her grandmother.  She thought the grandmother did not care about her or her sister so opens each one - a birthday card with notes of love and hope to see her.<br /><br />Because she has no where else to go, she travels to Florida to see her maternal grandmother (Shirley McClain) in a Florida Retirement Community.  She wants to milk her for financial help but finds a new view on life.  It is amazing how Maggie learns to grow into a mature woman and the retirement community is a hoot.<br /><br />The grandmother also wants to see Rose and finds Maggie is hesitant - so looks through her purse and contacts Rose to come visit as well.  The family secret of how and why their mother died is revealed and faced as the sisters remember the fun they had together.  After the grandmother and sisters  reunite they realize how they need and love each other and how important facing the harsh truth and forgiving is..<br /><br />It is a good story for both men and women.  The family drama and laughs are honest and give us valuable lessons on growth and facing life's challenges.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>while the Movie went into alot of areas from to time&couldn't make up it's mind if it was gonna be serious or funny there was a good story line about the relationship of two sisters,there father&there grandmother. the film kinda flip-flopped on certain issues&things,but the film was alright.Cameron Diaz did alright. Shirley Mclaine was alright though she has been playing the same role since She did"Terms of Endearment".this film had some good things going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Yuck.<br /><br />Despite good acting by talented performers, and the always-strong appeal of long shots on Cameron Diaz' legs, this is a tiresome movie, too-long by almost half. It suffers from a lack of story.<br /><br />It's a chronicle of two very different sisters. You might think the tale has them interact until they learn valuable lessons from one another, or something like that. However, the movie splits them up and has them experience their own "adventures." Shoes play no *real* role in the tale, if you were thinking they might, nor is anyone forced to "live anyone else's life" in anyway. In fact, there's nothing really consequential going on... just characters living their lives. It all winds up feeling like a memoir--a woman's reminisciences of "me and my sister," without an editor's eye for the necessary features of good cinema, like plot.<br /><br />What plot there is feels contrived--yeah, sure, the high-powered lawyer gives up her job to take up dog-walking without a moment's difficulty or regret, and the whorish sneak-thief blends right in to a retirement community and parlays it into a successful entrepreneurship. Makes perfect sense.<br /><br />There's no real change in the main character (Toni Collette): her attitude is basically the same at the end as it is at the beginning--"I love my sister, no matter what." The only real change to her is that she finds a good relationship, but that takes place completely externally, not on the inside.<br /><br />Other plotlines and relationships are strewn across the stage haphazzardly--each of the sisters' relationship with their grandmother, with their father, with their stepmother, with their stepsister, with their deceased mother. Nothing ever comes together, here, just a lot of venting of feeling, pointless characterization, and schmaltzy "feel-good" moments that come almost out of nowhere.<br /><br />Bad, poorly written, cinema.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R90OGE1EACZE.html">A3R90OGE1EACZE</a><br/><p>This movie is based on Jennifer Weiner's book of the same name. I enjoyed In Her Shoes, but since I read the book before I saw the movie I was dissapointed in the movie because of the noticable differences between the two.<br /><br />The story-line is the same Rose and Maggie are sisters that have nothing in common, but their shoe size, but after a parting of the ways they find that they have to mend fences when the grandmother that they thought was dead ends up very much alive and well and living in Florida. Very good acting by Toni Collet and Cameron Diaz.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>I saw this movie on the plane to Europe and to tell you the truth I didn't like it at all. It's a bad story itself, but the actors were horrible. How could Cameron Diaz sleep with her sister's boyfriend? I think it's one of those movies that if you don't see you don't lose anything. It's bad, real bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Cameron Diaz has no acting ability except to giggle, smile and make angry tense, facial expressions.  You meet all the characters. They are all over acted (except Diaz, who just walks around looking stupid). They have all sorts of conflicts. They spill their guts in scenes that are suppose to be sad, but laced with humor. Everyone realizes they should treat each other better and learn to understand each other.<br /><br />The middle is the only part where a couple of interesting things happened - the beginning and ending where completely awful. And there was really no resolution to the title "In Her Shoes" other than Cameron Diaz's character taking and using (and ruining) various pairs of shoes (yawn). While this movie had a couple of moments that were interesting, at the end I just rolled my eyes and regretted wasting the 2 hours.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>Not far into "In Her Shoes," Rose, played by Toni Collette, tells her sister, "You ruin everything!"<br /><br />She's right, too.<br /><br />Maggie, played by Cameron Diaz, is a party girl pushing 30 who's unemployed but works full time making messes. Sort of a Holly Go-Not-So-Lightly, she ruins borrowed clothes, parks in tow-away zones, is far better at consuming liquor than holding it and has a bad tendency to cozy up to the wrong guys.<br /><br />Lawyer Rose, on the other hand, has her act together but isn't much better off. Lonely and scrunched up, she reads romance novels through stark glasses and has a smile that's a little disconcerting. When she finds herself in bed with a co-worker, she sneaks a snapshot of him just to preserve a rare moment.<br /><br />Obviously, the sisters are both going through kind of a sad phase and when they have to move in together, they mix like bleach and ammonia. Their toxic conflict, however, nudges them in good directions.<br /><br />Director Curtis Hanson doesn't rush the story -- one thing happens, then the next -- but it's surprisingly enjoyable to watch as Rose and Maggie eventually try to fix themselves. It could've been slow going, or corny, but it isn't. The writing (by Susannah Grant, who adapted Jennifer Weiner's novel) is so natural, and the performances so assured, "Shoes" is easy to settle into. Diaz convincingly inverts her bubbly persona into something with dimensions far beyond "Charlie's Angels," while Collette is a refreshingly sympathetic grouch. And though they may not look anything at all like siblings, they do a fine job of acting like them.<br /><br />Also good is Shirley McLaine as the sisters' grandmother. She has played quite a few stern, disapproving women before (she's to chick flicks what Bruce Willis is to movies for guys who like movies), but here she very nicely downplays her usual volatility.<br /><br />At just over two hours, the film might strike some as a bit long, and I'm usually the first to complain about excessive length, but in thinking back about it afterward, it's hard to come up with anything that should've been cut.<br /><br />Smarter and more heartfelt than the previews suggest, "Shoes" is a tearjerker that earns its sniffles.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>"In Her Shoes", the book,  was decent chick lit; a sophomore effort by author Jennifer Weiner.  Of note is that Weiner's books will no doubt get a fresh breath in sales after a ton of American women openly weep for this movie!  I'm not sure how the studio (Fox) got Curtis Hanson to direct the film.  Hanson, who's scored big with "L.A. Confidential", "Wonder Boys" and "8 Mile" seems an unlikely choice, but it is he who wisely emphasizes what is real about the film; the relationships, sibling rivalry, difficulty for a family to deal with a member who is outwardly normal, but who suffers from a psychological trauma; generation gaps and the expectations for people to be what they look like, and not who they really are.<br /><br />Hanson beefed up his chances for more that just fleeting commercial success by securing Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, About a Boy) for the really central role in the film, and surrounding her with Diaz, MacLaine, and a solid cast of performers in lesser roles.  (This is not to take anything away from Mark Feurstein, who plays Simon.  As always he exudes charm and vulnerability in his roles that makes him a favorite of nearly every woman who sees him on the screen).<br /><br />Hanson takes Collette, as Rose, from disgust at having to deal with messy, drunken, inconsiderate sister Maggie (Diaz) when all she really wants to do is focus on a new love affair, to angry lashing out when Maggie betrays her.  He allows her to show the sense of loss she has when she doesn't know what happened to Maggie, self-discovery when she gets away from being a workaholic lawyer, sweet charm when she discovers love under her nose and begins to enjoy it, to self-loathing.  And back again!  He allows us to see Diaz as someone at her worst - uncontrollable, inconsiderate, a woman chock-full of destructive behaviors who slowly, slowly begins to find herself when faced with a woman who won't just give her what she wants so she'll go away.  Diaz is at once her most beautiful and her most cheap and tawdry in this role.  MacLaine, as Ella, a caricature of every character she's played in the last 10 years, has the dubious distinction of making Maggie decide to get real and have a real life, crazy as it seems, in a Florida senior citizen community.<br /><br />In the journey of self-discovery that is Rose's and Maggie's, at the same time, but in different states, Hanson fills us with the longing they both have, and the need they have to be together.  For all their opposite traits, for all their mistakes, Rose and Maggie, above all, are two sisters whose lives are so entwined, they cannot be torn apart.<br /><br />In the quintessential scene from the film, where MacLaine, (who has been shut out from the girls' lives because she interfered too often with their mother, her own mentally unbalanced daughter) takes out a photo album, the two reminisce about the "best day" with their mom.  Two days before her death she withdrew them from school, took them to Manhattan, and attempted to sell her fudge to department stores ala Mrs. Field's cookies.  Spurned, she bought Rose a Nancy Drew book and Maggie a puppy.  She returned home to her husband, who was frantic with worry....he has closely guarded the girls, since she is so unstable, and he feels she needs to be hospitalized. (Manic depressive?  We learn she has not been taking her meds).  It is remarkable to see Maggie (Diaz) learn for the first time what that day really meant; that it caused their mother to commit suicide (Maggie thought it was a car accident) and that from that day forward, Rose protected and sheltered her from the ugliness of what their mother had done and why.  It's a powerful scene, made more powerful by the information as elicited by Ella, over the old photos.<br /><br />There are more well-nuanced scenes in this film, and there are also places where it attempts to play too much on your emotions, such as Maggie's insistence at picking out Rose's wedding dress.<br /><br />In her shoes, of course, is metaphoric for the same shoe size that both the sisters wear, the incongruity of a closet-full of beautiful designer shoes purchased by Rose, and unworn...that Maggie dips into and takes whenever she feels like it.  You never really know what life is like for a sister or a friend until you've walked in her shoes.<br /><br />All in all, Hanson does a remarkable job with the material, Collette is spectacular, Diaz shines, and the film has both power and light touches that will make it memorable for women from all walks of life.  Men?  I daresay the handful of men that see it will like it, but most should wait and watch the DVD as a favor to their significant others!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJPMB7N776WS.html">A1TJPMB7N776WS</a><br/><p>Cameron Diaz is always the brightest, prettiest, most popular girl in the room. She's the girl all the guys love and the women envy. She can throw down shots of tequila with the guys on the one hand and go shoe shopping with her girls on the other. So far in her career, she's played the live-wire, the over-achiever, the most elegantly dressed...the sexiest, friendliest, the most dazzling.<br />Not so in Curtis Hanson's (the sublime "LA Confidential") "In her Shoes." Diaz's Maggie Feller is a forlorn thief and drunk and more to the point a loser. Diaz's incandescent beauty is even dulled here: she's all dolled up, yes but underneath it all she is tragically sad.<br />I've always believed that the bond between siblings is the strongest bond in anyone's life and Maggie's bond with her older sister Rose (the terrific Toni Collette) is the backbone of this story: they hate each other, they love each other and they can't live with or without one another. Rose and Maggie have fought side-by-side on the battlefield of family deception and misunderstanding. They are comrades.<br />Director Hanson's movies always reek of the aroma of well observed life and relationships and "In Her Shoes" is no exception to this rule. But, in this case you can also marvel at Cameron Diaz's transformation into an important and serious actress of the first order.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>The greatest thing about 'In Her Shoes' is that is proves to be nothing you expected it to be.  I expected a comedy, somthing trivial and just ordinary to pass the time...but what I got was a delightful dramedy that touched my heart and made me laugh, cry and smile almost as much as this years 'The Family Stone'.  This story, adapted from Jennifer Weiner's novel of the same name, revolves around two sisters.  Rose (Toni Collette) is the smart succesful lawyer with low self esteem due to a little extra weight and not so much of a love life (in the first few scenes we see her take a picture of a man in her bed because she wants proof she actually slept with someone).  Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is the funny, ditzy, trampy one who deep down has low self esteem because of her illiteracy.  These two sisters love to hate each other and after one too many fights they part their ways.  What happens next is a great look at family and life and life without family.  Maggie, upon discovering they have a grandmother they never knew, or at least thought was dead, decides to take a bus to Florida to stay with her.  Her grandmother Ella (Shirley McLaine) lives in a "retirement home for active seniors," and offers to help Maggie get back on her feet.  With Maggie out of the picture Rose starts to grow, socially and actually gets a boyfriend, a serious boyfriend who in turn proposes.  At the same time, Maggie goes from trampy mooch to respectable, responcible and reliable.  It almost seems as if these girls are better off apart, but as they soon realize without each other they don't make sense.  As the girls finally come to terms with each other and, with the help of their 'newfound' grandmother, come to terms with the early death of their mother, we see them grow and mature, each in their own ways.  What's so great about this film is that is aproaches each charactor with care and compassion helping you too sympatize with each one.  You feel for Rose when blows up at Maggie because you understand how crazy Maggie must make her, but you also feel for Maggie when she fails a job interview because of her illiteracy.  In the beggining you'll want to cry, by the middle you'll start to laugh, and in the end you break a smile.  This is a great, underrated and swept under the radar type film that should be enjoyed by everyone with a heart.  Performances were great across the board, most notibly by Cameron Diaz who stole my heart with every frame.  This is truly one of those films that both women and their husbands (I'm one of those husbands) can really enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/AY69ZK7G6CNYJ.html">AY69ZK7G6CNYJ</a><br/><p>One of the best date films of 2005, In Her Shoes is a dramatic relationship comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. Directed by Curtis Hanson, the hand behind such films as 8 Mile (2002), LA Confidential (1997), and The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), the film is successful in a genre where so many of its peers have miserably failed. The casting is superb, and the onscreen interaction between the various characters creates a realistic impression of wavering love and conflict. Based on the novel by Jennifer Weiner, it weaves a tale of two sisters with differing lifestyles and a lifetime of personal baggage...<br /><br />In Her Shoes begins with the latest installment of an ongoing personality clash between sisters Rose (Toni Collette) and Maggie (Cameron Diaz) Feller. When the shy and reserved Rose is approached by the most eligible bachelor in her law firm, the two hit it off quite nicely. But Maggie ruins the affair when she shows up on Rose's doorstep and steals the man away with her unrelenting flirtations. After constant feuding, Rose kicks Maggie out while contemplating her own future. She takes a leave of absence from her law firm and contemplates dog walking as an alternative career path. Along the way, she encounters another colleague from the firm, Simon Stein (Mark Feuerstein). The two strike up a romantic relationship, but Rose's past threatens to ruin the whole thing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Maggie discovers the two have a long-lost grandmother, Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine), who lives in Florida. With no one left to leech off of, Maggie heads straight for Ella's retirement community. But Ella has no intention of being a human punching bag, and for the first time in her life, Maggie meets someone who won't put up with her perpetual self-centeredness and grossly inconsiderate behavior. It's a stand-off certain to change the lives of everyone involved...<br /><br />Toni Collette is outstanding in the role of the responsible and untrusting sister, Rose. She portrays an overachieving, yet somewhat socially awkward, individual sick of playing the part of parent to her wild and rebellious sister. Her actions are understandable and believable; her reluctance to see Maggie in a new light is well-paced. On an equal note, Cameron Diaz fits the part of the irresponsible, yet likeable, Maggie. Yearning for approval, her arrested development transitions to adulthood in the face of unconditional love.<br /><br />The strength of In Her Shoes is almost solely attributable to the various performances of the cast and the screenplay itself. This isn't a plot-driven movie, and the slightest bit of awkwardness between cast members or the least bit of forced dialogue could wreck the whole film. Luckily, the audience experiences neither, and most viewers will walk away satisfied with their experience. Kudos to screenwriter Susannah Grant whose portfolio includes box office hits like Erin Brockovich (2000), Ever After (1998), and Pocahontas (1995). Grant's vast expertise in manufacturing high quality scripts provided the cast with a firm foundation from which to deliver their lines. Overall, In Her Shoes is not a blockbuster titan of the big screen. It has few memorable one-liners, but from an entertainment standpoint, it works well. It whisks its audience away to another place and time without leaving them empty handed, and that's what all good movies are supposed to do...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Toni Collette (Muriel in 'Muriel's Wedding') chose another great role, or perhaps it chose her? She plays older sister Rose to a very messed up 'party girl' Cameron Diaz (Maggie). Maggie gives the line; 'You only hurt the ones you love' deeper jabs as she sabotages her own life and her sister's. But family bonds are never truly broken in this movie, and when Diaz discovers she has a grandmother (Maclaine), their past with a mentally ill mother becomes clearer to all of the women. Once they are able to sift through some childhood shadows, Maggie realizes that Rose has been her protector all her life. I found it interesting that the film brought out how the adolescent mind can 'tone down' tragic moments. This movie has soul, and though my husband dubbed it as a 'slight' chick flick, he enjoyed watching as well.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>Two sisters, Rose and Maggie, at opposite ends of the spectrum, and life. Rose, high pressure wallflower attorney spends her life caring for beautiful, aimless Maggie, harboring a hidden secret of her own. At first, it harbors the appearance of "chick flick", especially when you find out Shirley MacClaine stars as an aging grandmother who lives in a Florida retirement community. But what Curtis Hanson has crafted is a smart, sharp drama that is compelling, emotional, and wonderful.<br /><br />It could have very easily slipped into becoming a Lifetime movie of the week, but Hanson's expert direction, and the excellent performances, allow this movie room to breathe and grow into a fine ensemble piece. Each performance is nuanced and balanced. The always strong Toni Collette pulls off her role as Rose with rage and understanable heartbreak. Cameron Diaz turns in another surprising turn as Maggie, proving she's more than just a pretty face. The two are magic together. Shirley MacClaine's Ella is understated and brilliant, making her all the more believable.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you would too.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>It must take courage to wade through an overstuffed yet flimsy novel such as Jennifer Weiner's IN HER SHOES and find that without all the paraphernalia bruising the essential message there is a fine story to be told.  Such is the case of director Curtis Hanson (8 Mile, LA Confidential, The Wonder Boys) who consistently pares down stories and focuses on significant human issues.  He is greatly aided by Susannah Grant's fine screenplay and by a cast of actors who are at their peak. For all the PR that ruined this film in the theaters (the Magnum Opus 'chick flick', about shoes, silly graphics, etc), this is in truth a fine drama about sibling rivalry and sibling devotion and the cruel effects self-loathing bifurcated parents unwittingly have on their offspring.<br /><br />Rose Feller (Toni Collette) is a bright but dumpy lawyer, successful in her career but miserable in her social life. Her sister Maggie (Cameron Diaz) is her opposite: a silly, shallow, drunken, dishonest party girl who has never been able to hold down even the most menial job for her obsession with men and inappropriate sexual situations.  Moving in with Rose out of desperation, Maggie turns Rose's life into chaos: the two fight, loathe each other, split and yet each of the disparate sisters also acknowledges that they are, in the end, all that each has.  When Rose finally throws Maggie out, Maggie moves to Florida to mooch off the grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) neither sister has ever known because of a long standing parental riff that has altered their lives more than they appreciate. The separation of the sisters by space offers each the chance to discover each other's value and the manner in which the two rejoin is the results of tough lessons learned.<br /><br />Collette, Diaz, and MacLaine each offer wholly professional, fully realized performances.  The supporting cast is likewise fine and the keen directorial leadership by Hanson is evident.  The film is grossly overlong (130 minutes filled with far too much repetitive excess) and the opting for sentimentality as the film moves toward the finish is a bit off-putting, but the surprise here is that this is really a good movie!  Who would ever know form the PR and the associated bungling of the packaging?  Grady Harp, February 06</p></br><a href="../users/A1SPB225CVTRUU.html">A1SPB225CVTRUU</a><br/><p>In Her Shoes is not intended to be a conventional chick flick nor romantic comedy, but it actually works better as a family dramedy. There is plenty of funny and touching moments in this film to make it worthwhile watching, especially the the three leads perfectly fit their roles in this film that deals with dysfunctional sisterhood, history of family feuds, forgiveness, and reconcilation. I must say that initially I was drawn to seeing this film for Shirley MacLaine and my favorite Austrilian actress Toni Collette, but I was quite impressed by Cameron Diaz whom I had little expectation for as a serious actress. To my surprise, this is probably her most striking performance since Being John Malkovich. Guys will get to see enough of her wearing skimpy outfits, underwears, and bikinis. I guess that's part of the whole commercial selling point, no wonder she receives top billing and she's the only one on the poster.<br /><br />The movie starts with Maggie Feller(Cameron Diaz) in the middle of a foreplay scene with a former classmate at her high school reunion. She was too drunk to even have sex in the first place, and ended up passing out in the washroom. Her sister Rose(Toni Collette) was summoned to pick her up and take her back to her father's house, but ended up getting kicked out by the mean stepmother. So it was Rose' turn to take her in as her new roomate, but they ended up gettting on each other's nerves since they had nothing in common. At one point, Maggie says,"I'll do your makeup if you do my resume." Rose is overweight and could care less about her image, and she's a total workaholic. One would wonder how the heck does Rose' sexy and hunky boss Jim(Richard Burgi) was interested in her in the first place. She's so inexperienced sexually and romantically, which is the opposite of her promiscuous sister. Richard Burgi is somewhat wasted with minimal screentime, but he did get to show off his ultra-muscular body. The breaking point between the sisters take place when Jim cheats on Rose with Maggie. That's where they verbally and physically attack each other.<br /><br />The homeless and jobless Maggie went back to her father's house for one more time to steal some cash and accidently discovered letters written from her obsentee grandmother Ella(Shirley MacLaine) whom she thought had died years ago. She then headed to Miami to track down her uninformed grandmother. Ella was very delighted and surprised by her visit. She eventually shared with Maggie the secrets, lies, and feuds between her daughter, son-in-law, and her before she had to abandon the family. At this point, Maggie starts to reflect on life and makes changes to improve herself. She had to move beyond her imature and crazy old self and take life more serious. She takes the job as a caretaker for the seniors and for the first time she's sober and clean. Meanwhile, Rose is falling in love with her ex-collegue from the law firm. Her first official boyfriend Simon Stein(Mark Feuerstein) had a crush on her since day one. She had no idea where Maggie had gone and she starts to worry and miss her. Then she receives an unexpected letter from her grandmother.......<br /><br />Cameron Diaz looks very sexy and beautiful in this film and she had the most amount screentime, but her role is not as dramatic and challenging as Toni Collette's. I guess one gets to deliver serve as the eye-candy and the other gets to be emotionally affecting. I really enjoyed their fight scenes together, because I can totally relate to what it's like to not get along with your siblings. Shirley MacLaine's role is somewhat low-key, and she had merely a few funny and touchy moments opposite Diaz and Collette. Her performance was so subtle and believable that I just wished she had more screentime to work with. The verdict: this film did make me laugh a lot, it almost make me cry, and it made me smile in the end.</p></br><a href="../users/ASJ89T42CIUHU.html">ASJ89T42CIUHU</a><br/><p>If you're looking for a movie to put a little kick in your step this one will do it. It's about family and about discovering the individuality within that family while keeping both intact.<br /><br />The film centers on a rather tumultuous relationship between sisters Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette). Each sister is a complete opposite of the other yet bound by ties that run far deeper than surface appearances. Rose is the mousey responsible sister who tries to rescue Maggie, the flakey beautiful one, from self-destruction. As with all relationships complications arise, feelings get hurt and an inevitable split occurs. Into the picture arrives a long lost grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine) and everything is up for grabs. But it's the way the storytellers reveal each character's nuances that make this movie so special. It covers the ages with insecurities and doubts but heals the wounds with subtle intention.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is truly wonderful in her role as Maggie and she brings to the role a depth she has rarely been able to delve into in her prior films. Toni Collette steals the show with her tremendous acting ability and Shirley MacLaine is given the chance to be the films stabilizing force. So there may be a closet full of beautiful shoes in this movie but they really aren't what it's all about. Beneath all the expensive heels and fancy slides lurks the truth of this family's hidden treasures. Trust me this movie will leave you skipping home barefoot in delight!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose (Toni Collette) are sisters.  When they were children their mother died, their father became catatonic, and all they had is each other.  Rose grew up to be a lawyer in Philadelphia, and Maggie became beautiful without bothering to grow up.  Tossed out of the house of her father (Ken Howard) by her shrewish stepmother (Candice Azzara), Maggie moves in for Rose and completely takes advantage of the situation.  No number of post-it notes will stop Maggie from taking her sister's jewelry, money, and shoes.  We know from early on that Maggie is not a good person, and then she does something so horrific that Rose throws her up against the wall and screams, "Get out of my life!"  Rose is right to do so, but given that after their mother's death Rose gave up her childhood to ensure that Maggie had one of her own, her sister's absence is a void that cannot be filled.<br /><br />It seems obvious early on that this is going to be one of those movies where each sister is going to learn to be a bit more like the other, but surprisingly that proves not to be the case.  This makes sense because while Maggie is a failure who needs to "grow up" and become somebody different, Rose's fault is in not being happy with who she is; some modifications are necessary, but not the radical overhauling that Maggie needs to undergo.  The Maggie we meet richly deserves her "F," but at worst Rose is but a "D."  There is the sense in which the two sisters are opposites, since Maggie likes herself more than she should and Rose likes herself less than she deserves, but Rose is clearly the one more sinned against.  Then fate throws Maggie a life preserver in the discovery of her maternal grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine), who was shut out of her life by her father, and who lives in Florida.  So Maggie disappears and Rose tells no one that she does not know where her sister has gone.<br /><br />I found "In Her Shoes" to be much better than I expected.  This is one case where the trailer for a film proves to be deceptive (rather than serving up all of the good parts), because the film is darker than the comic moments we see would indicate.  I like that the cruel twist of fate that brings Rose together with another lawyer at her firm, Simon Stein (Mark Feurestein), who turns out to have the charming ability to make ordering from a menu a romantic occasion.  Simon will attempt to do for Rose what Ella is trying to accomplish with Maggie, but in the end it is only the sisters who can complete the healing process.  The insight comes when Ella reveals that after her daughter's funeral she received what was obviously a suicide note.  What it says explains why Ella cannot be content simply to try and get Maggie to grow up, and why other things must take place.  Whether the credit goes to novelist Jennifer Weiner or screenwriter Susannah Grant ("Ever After," "Erin Brockovich"), the key thing is that the writing is what matters here.<br /><br />Maggie's transformation actually begins before she arrives on her grandmother's doorstep, because it hurting Rose to the point where her sister turns on her, Maggie has finally sees herself for what she is, which is not much.  There is motivation to change, as represented by her remaining sober, but Ella provides the opportunity when she offers Maggie half a helping hand.  Although she is now surrounded by a retirement community of active seniors, where the women look down their noses at her and the men look over their sunglasses, it is a blind English professor (Norman Lloyd), who gives Maggie reason to think for the first time in her life that she is not just a stupid tramp who has nothing to offer anybody but her looks.  What begins with a harsh revelation during an MTV interview and is heightened by the disparagement regarding the insult "Fat Pig," becomes a wonderful surprise at the end.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>I'd truly enjoyed both experiences, reading the book as well as getting a chance to see the movie. It doesn't really matter which you do first so if you've happened to see the movie, you'll still enjoy reading the book - or vice versa (read the book, see the movie). I admit I lead toward reading the book first.<br /><br />The basic story seems simple but is richly layered, showing the complexities of sisters trying to connect when their personalities are so different. It also reveeals how family secrets can cause damage for years (I won't divulge the particular family secret - it is a whopper). I WILL reveal this much - the tragic secret not only damages the entire family (father, daughters, sisters and stepmother) but, even worse,divides the sisters, motivating one (played by Toni Collette) to become an obsessively controlled person as well as a caretaker type. She doesn't feel attractive but she DOES feel competent.<br /><br /> In contrast, her sister (Cameron Diaz) is absolutely gorgeous but thinks very little of herself, willing to try and coast by on her good looks, whatever jobs come her way and the kindness of men who are all too willing to pay her bar tabs for a chance of bedding her. She relys on her sister to save her when she drinks too much, to rescue her from herself. The strain is taking its toll on the already tense relationship between the two.<br /><br />  I think Camerson Diaz is stunning in her role as the perpetual "screw up", putting on a good face while feeling like an idiot underneath. Instead of being a goofy sexpot, this time she allows some genuine vulnerability and pain to come through and she pulls it off. She engages the viewer and elicits sympathy (something that isn't always so easy to do for someone who seems so genetically blessed). In short, Diaz comes across as a very real, flawed person who eventually (but slowly, tenuously) gains hope that she can do better.<br /><br />While I found the film to be worth at least one viewing, it had some flaws. It dragged at certain points and even though it wasn't a long film, somehow it seemed to go forever. Still, I was eager to see how the sisters worked through their anger and pain to try and reconnect. Along the way, they encounter a grandmother they'd never known and who is a major factor in resolving their differences.<br /><br />  The girl's grandmother is played by Shirley MacClaine, a woman whose personality is so forceful, so simply and completely PRESENT, that it is hard to pay attention to anyone else when she is on screen. At times, her role of eccentric older woman was a bit much for me, almost stereotypical, but she seems to approach every role with complete conviction so I can easily forgive any apparent excesses. Besides, she isn't afraid to be unpleasant on screen. She is willing to show that getting older isn't this wonderful experience, that there are good days and bad along the way. I imagine there might have been some pressure to soft pedal that approach. I'm glad she didn't.<br /><br />  This movie is also about stepping outside one's usual routine, of taking chances and moving towards a middle ground, one where both sisters become (a bit) more like each other. Finding peace with one another isn't easy because one sister betrays the other early on in a particularly painful way. But find peace they do and I was left with the reminder that maintaining family bonds is worth quite a bit, including some assaults to pride and dignity. No one else shares quite the same memories and history as one's sister.<br /><br /> Toni Collette, an actress I really  enjoy watching on screen, just didn't seem to hit her stride in this film, while Cameron Diaz went far beyond my expectations.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>Maggie Feller (Cameron Diaz) is a party girl who has tested every relationship in her life. Drunk at her high school reunion, with no where else to turn, she calls her sister, Rose (Toni Collette), a successful, but lonely attorney. Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in, crashing on her couch. A few weeks later, Maggie has officially overstayed her welcome. She can't go home to her father, his wife won't allow Maggie to live there. So Maggie travels to Florida to visit her grandmother, Ella (Shirley MacLaine), a woman she didn't know was still alive. In Florida, Maggie gradually learns about her place in life. Back at home, Rose deals with a conniving co-worker and falls in love with Simon (Mark Feuerstein). Eventually, distraught over Maggie's disappearance, Rose gets a letter from Ella.<br /><br />"In Her Shoes", directed by Curtis Hanson ("L.A. Confidential", "8 Mile") is a film filled with good and great performances. Ultimately, the performances help this "chick flick" overcome a story that is not the most original or interesting. It's all about the performances.<br /><br />Curtis Hanson has consistently demonstrated his range and provided evidence of his skill as a director. His body of work can not be categorized as simply "drama", "comedy" or "mystery". Each film has shown that he has a good handle on the conventions of the genre; in some cases, he shows mastery ("L.A. Confidential", "Wonder Boys"), in others, a good understanding ("The River Wild", "8 Mile"). With each film, I have found myself more and more appreciative of his talent as a skilled director. Few directors working today are as adept at moving from one genre to the next. If they do this, they are not skilled enough to make each and every film enjoyable on some level. Curtis Hanson has proven that he has the skill and I eagerly anticipate his new films.<br /><br />"In Her Shoes" is a "chick flick", whether the studio, Cameron Diaz or anyone else wants us to believe otherwise. Instead of trying to downplay this angle, and lose potential viewers, why not embrace it? Was it really necessary for Diaz to go on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and repeatedly mention how "human" the story was? Stewart picked up on this and it was one of his funniest interviews in a while. If you embrace what the film is, the woman will flock to the theaters with their sisters, mothers, aunts, boyfriends, etc. in tow. Tell the women to bring a box of tissue, their boyfriends and husbands can dole it out as needed.<br /><br />The relationship between Maggie and Rose is the key to the film and it is remarkably balanced. Maggie, the beautiful, but dumb party girl has always used her looks to get her dates, drinks and "companionship". Rose is the studious, hard worker who spends every available hour at the firm, working. She also buys a lot of expensive shoes, even though she doesn't use them. Even though they get on each other's nerves, and drive each other crazy, they are still sisters and love each other. When Maggie travels to Florida, she doesn't tell anyone where she is, more to spite Rose for kicking her out. But her sister becomes concerned and scared about what has happened to Maggie. As Maggie begins to appreciate life with her grandmother, she doesn't feel it necessary to tell anyone. In fact, when Rose finds out, Maggie becomes a bit jealous, momentarily, until they begin to share things as sisters again.<br /><br />Of the two younger actresses, Toni Collette's performance is better. Collette is simply a better actress and it shows in the way she reveals so many different layers to her character. Rose, always concerned about her looks, is the stronger, smarter sister. Yet, just because she is stronger and smarter, doesn't mean that she doesn't feel loneliness and make dumb decisions. When a partner at her firm gives her the eye, she immediately falls for the attention and begins a short-lived relationship. Throughout the film, we learn more and more about the contradictions in her character making the performance always interesting to watch.<br /><br />This is not to say that Cameron Diaz is bad. She is very good in this film, perhaps her best performance ever. But her character is not as multifaceted as that of Rose. Basically, Maggie is a party girl and she is perceived as dumb. When she arrives in Florida, these conventions are put to the test and her character evolves. As she begins to challenge herself, Maggie becomes a stronger woman and Diaz makes this transformation more subtle than you might imagine.<br /><br />Shirley MacLaine is also great as Ella, the long-lost grandmother of Maggie and Rose. Maggie initially decides to visit her grandmother for a couple of reasons; she didn't know she was still alive and she wants to bilk her grandmother for any available cash she possibly can. Ella is a smart woman and recognizes this. Because she has a lot of mixed emotions about her relationship with her grandchildren, she lets Maggie stay with her but won't give her or let her steal money from her. She makes Maggie an offer that works for both of them.<br /><br />Throughout, the supporting characters are very strong. Mark Feuerstein as Simon, Rose's potential suitor is very good. Persistent and, ultimately, charming, he wins Rose over. Yet, the relationship has more depth than this as well. Most films would be content to let the relationship stay at this level. Hanson takes it even further, adding a lot of depth to the story. As the story shifts to Ella's life at the retirement community, we meet a number of the people who live there. This is, perhaps, the best part of the film. The seniors are portrayed as real people, rather than the usual stereotypes. Each of the people is a different, unique person, simply older. As the main characters interact with this group, we learn about them, both young and old, and what they have to offer each other and the world. Ella is courted by another widower at the community, Louis, and they begin a relationship. A friend of Ella's, Mrs. Lefkowitz, uses a motorized wheel chair and Ella's help to get around, but she has a lot to offer and ultimately helps Maggie find her true calling. It is a remarkably even handed portrayal of a demographic so often stereotyped.<br /><br />The story veers towards the soap opera-ish at times and the film is too long. But the performances more than make up for these two problems.<br /><br />All in all, "In Her Shoes" is a surprisingly good film. Actually, I am not sure why I was surprised at how good the film was. Director Curtis Hanson hasn't let me down yet.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>The movie "In Her Shoes" is based on Jennifer Weiner's novel with the same name. I read the book several months ago and really enjoyed it, but I never had any desire to see the film because I couldn't picture Cameron Diaz as Maggie. That was a big mistake on my part. Diaz gets a bad rap because she's starred in a lot of crappy movies ("Charlie's Angels," anyone?) and is dating a former Backstreet Boy. However, when presented with a good script, Diaz proves that she can actually act. She was amazing in "Being John Malkovich" and delivers an outstanding performance in "In Her Shoes."<br /><br />This movie is about two sisters, Maggie Feller and her sister Rose (Toni Collette). Rose is a successful attorney and is the stereotypical boring, responsible older sister. Younger sister Maggie spends her days and nights drinking and partying, sleeping with whatever random guys happen to be around, and never being able to hold a job for more than a couple of weeks. Being the kind sister that she is, Rose allows Maggie to crash on her couch for what seems to be the millionth time. The two women argue about their respective life choices, and eventually have a big fight. Rose demands that Maggie vacate the apartment, and Maggie retaliates by seducing Rose's coworker/lover, Jim (Richard Burgi). Rose catches Maggie and Jim and the act, and Maggie suddenly finds herself with nowhere to go. Her only option is to track down a mysterious grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) who has been out of the picture since the Feller girls were very young. Maggie travels down to Florida and learns some important lessons from her grandmother Ella, who lives in a senior retirement community. Meanwhile, Rose goes through some personal transformations of her own back home. In spite of everything that has happened between them, Rose and Maggie are unable to sever the bond that has always tied them together, and with the help of their grandmother, the girls are finally able to appreciate each other and enjoy a satisfying reconciliation.<br /><br />I really, REALLY enjoyed this movie. I was impressed at how true the film was to Weiner's novel. There are several things in the film that differ from the book, most notably the fact that Maggie's entire experience hiding out at the university is omitted from the movie. That was a real disappointment at first because I always thought that aspect of the story was one of the most interesting parts of the book. However, Weiner's novel is pretty long and not everything could make it to the big screen. Some material had to be cut for the screenplay and it made sense to cut out the university. Besides, the screenplay incorporates several themes from the university section of the book by creating a relationship between Maggie and a retired Italian professor who lives at the retirement center, which was incredibly moving and well done.<br /><br />The entire cast of "In Her Shoes" is phenomenal. Diaz and MacLaine steal the show, but the supporting cast is spectacular. I especially Mark Feuerstein's performance as Simon. (By the way, the character of Simon is much more attractive and overall appealing in the film than he is in the book!) The one performance that didn't thrill me was Collette's. For some reason, I just couldn't warm up to the character of Rose at all. I thought that Collette's portrayal of the character was way too edgy, resulting in Rose coming across as extremely unlikable. When I read the novel, I was instantly sympathetic toward Rose and hated Maggie...then Maggie underwent her slow character transformation and I eventually warmed up to her as well. While watching the movie, I was able to sympathize with Maggie's character almost right off the bat, even though she was such a brat. I never really felt sympathetic toward Rose, even though all these terrible things were happening to her. Collette's interpretation of the role was too stuffy and cold, which was extremely unfortunate. I wish someone else had been cast in the part.<br /><br />In spite of Collette ruining the character of Rose for me, I still think that "In Her Shoes" is a great adaptation of Weiner's excellent novel. Fans of the book will love the film, and anyone looking for an emotional "girly" movie will love it as well.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>Being a guy I can't say I really wanted to see this movie.  But after my fiancee bought it I ended up watching it with her one afternoon and it wasn't half bad.  For being a Chick Flick there is a fair amount of guy humor and enough diversity that anyone can get drawn into the movie.  Overall I'd say it is a typical Cameron Diaz movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ARMVAHWQQ9S8A.html">ARMVAHWQQ9S8A</a><br/><p>Color me surprised.<br /><br />When my mother chose this film for our weekly movie night, I was skeptical to say the least.  I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz, and both the title and the trailer turned me off.  It was a small mercy that Toni Collette starred opposite of Diaz, but the film seemed to scream "stereotypical chick flick!" at the top of its lungs.  Well, turns out, it's not.  Instead of hopping from cliche to cliche, it bravely swerves around them, taking the audience on an unexpected and blissful ride.  The considerable running length that initially made me cringe became a blessing, because I just wanted more.<br /><br />Collette shines as expected, and Diaz admittedly impresses here.  Their nuanced performances, which punch up an already fantastic script, allow the viewer to really feel the characters, loving and hating them at the same time.  I'll avoid plot summary here, because this is a film that should take you by surprise, but the general idea behind the film is that Collette plays Rose, a sexually deprived woman, and Diaz plays Maggie, who uses sex to get what she wants.  The two clash throughout the film and... I'll stop there.  There are so many awesome plot elements that are thrown in that really make the movie a layered, enjoyable, filling experience that to describe further would be to deprive you of the many surprises the film offers.<br /><br />In short, watch the movie.  You'll be surprised, touched, and entertained.<br /><br />8/10</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>It may seem on the outset to be nothing more than another chick-flick, but `In Her Shoes' is not only smart and entertaining but it's complex in many ways.  It tells us the story of two very different sisters, Maggie and Rose, who love one another deeply despite the fact that they rarely get along.  Rose is the successful `plain looking' one who can never seem to find the right man and Maggie is the unstable `pretty' one who bounces from one man to the next.  After an explosive argument where each party says things they really don't mean the two girls separate, disbanding their relationship.<br /><br />The beauty of `In Her Shoes' is that it delicately and affectionately relates each girls side of the story.  While Rose is successful in her own way she wishes she had half of the gusto and spunk her sister Maggie possessed, and while Maggie may have a way with people, she lacks self confidence in her own abilities.  She gives herself away because she doesn't realize she deserves more than that.  Rose thinks that she is ugly, Maggie thinks that she is stupid; both girls pick themselves apart yet find a way to blame their own insecurities on their sister.<br /><br />As the film progresses; Maggie moving in with their estranged Grandmother Ella, Rose actually finding a man who loves her for who she is; it continues to grab us and connect to us.  It never falls apart or dives into overly sympathetic or in other words `pathetic' territory.  Sure, it grabs at your heartstrings and may even bring a tear or two to your eyes but its all legitimate emotions.<br /><br />The acting is particularly splendid here as well.  Toni Collette is always a delight (how is it again that she has but ONE Oscar nomination) and here she is flawlessly on point.  She really helps the audience to understand Rose.  Shirley MacLaine proves yet again that her talent is never-ending.  As Ella she is moving and affectionate and truly outstanding.  To me though, this movie belongs to Cameron Diaz.  I'm really dying to see this girl fully embraced by the awards circuit.  I don't understand how she has gone this long without a single Oscar nomination.  As Maggie she really fleshes out this girl's strengths and weaknesses.  She makes her three dimensional, relatable and sympathetic.  The scene where she auditions for MTV alone made me cry; it's so real and raw and believable.<br /><br />In the end `In Her Shoes' is well worth the time.  It's an elevated chick-flick with heart and soul; a film that really understands what it's aiming for and truly delivers in the end.  It's not what I was expecting and I'm sure you'll get more than you bargained for as well.  Director Curtis Hanson has a nice way of approaching his projects, and while `In Her Shoes' is a far cry from Hanson's Oscar winning `L.A. Confidential' it has a level of maturity we've come to expect from a man who continues to hand us cinematic gems.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>With its predictable situations and stock characters, I am genuinely surprised that I ended up liking this 2005 movie, the epitome of a chick-flick with its veneer of Lifetime TV banalities. However, after a slow set-up, a closer look yields a frequently perceptive, often touching film that exceeds expectations on several levels. First, director Curtis Hanson, not known as a women's director given his previous works include "LA Confidential" and "8 Mile", has an idiosyncratic eye for the overriding themes of self-esteem, caretaking and inextricable sisterly bonds. Adapted from a popular chick-lit novel by Jennifer Weiner, the story focuses on two sisters, a study in physical and behavioral contrasts - Rose, a workaholic Philadelphia attorney who falls into the trap of an office affair with her slick boss, and Maggie, a seductive, dyslexic and ethically marginal party girl who cannot keep a steady job or a place to live.<br /><br />Their can't-live-with-her, can't-live-without-her relationship has an authentic feel, even if at the beginning, their increasing polarization smacks of stereotype. They have an explosive blow-out at which point the movie tracks their evolving lives on parallel paths. This is where the film's strongest section begins, as Hanson and screenwriter Susannah Grant do a nice job of showing how Rose and Maggie have similarities beyond their mutual fondness for designer shoes. Rose hesitantly starts a relationship with a former colleague unconditionally smitten with her, while Maggie journeys to Florida to meet and  live with Ella, the grandmother neither sister knew even existed, at a senior citizen community. Fulfilling the film's coy title, Rose and Maggie eventually merge paths toward an inevitable conclusion by ending up in each other's shoes. The emotional pay-off gratefully resonates as Rose becomes more free-spirited and outgoing, Maggie becomes more introspective and respectful, and both like themselves much more for the change.<br /><br />Hanson sometimes veers too far into soap opera but ultimately taps into the emotional honesty of the characters by eliciting three superbly rendered performances. As she has proven in films as diverse as "Dinner With Friends", "The Hours" and "Japanese Story", Toni Collette manages to get to the core of her characters with minimum fuss, and her Rose is an intelligently observed, warts-and-all performance. Tearfully pushing Maggie out of her life, she viscerally handles the plot's turning point like a wounded hyena. Collette also provides the film's funniest scene when responding to a humiliating slideshow, she wields a kitchen knife in front of her venomous stepmother Sydelle (played to the hilt by Candice Azzara). As Maggie, Cameron Diaz does unexpectedly strong work here as she demonstrates how far more resourceful she is than her fun-loving personality would indicate. Unafraid to lose viewer sympathy, she paints a rich portrait of a self-deluded young woman who gradually discovers that her self-worth extends beyond her obvious beauty.<br /><br />In an even more dramatic change-of-pace, Shirley MacLaine does not play Ella with the predictable bluster which mark her performances since "Terms of Endearment" but rather in restrained shadings that represent some of her most subtle work. It's a commendable turn by an actress entering the sixth decade of her illustrious film career. Not too surprisingly, the male actors are completely overshadowed, but given that, there is nice work from Mark Feuerstein as Rose's supportive boyfriend Simon, Norman Lloyd as the kindly blind professor who makes Maggie realize her inner strength, and Ken Howard as the sisters' resentful father. Brooke Smith plays Rose's cynical friend in a manner almost identical to the character she plays in Woody Allen's "Melinda and Melinda", and Francine Beers is on Estelle Getty autopilot as opinionated Mrs. Lefkowitz.<br /><br />The DVD includes three surprisingly good featurettes. The obligatory making-of short, "The People in Their Shoes", actually provides insightful comments by Hanson, Grant, co-producer Carol Fenelon and the principal cast on what motivates the characters and why the story evolves the way it does. The funniest piece is "A Retirement Community for Acting Seniors", which comically profiles the non-professionals who took part in the senior center scenes of the movie, while "From Death Row to the Red Carpet: The Casting of Honey Bun" provides a sincere look at how shelter animals are used in films, such as the puppy that plays Maggie's dog, Honey Bun 2. Surprisingly, there is no alternative audio commentary by Hanson or the cast.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>IN HER SHOES is hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.  It explores the relationship between two sisters, their father and stepmother and then the grandmother they never knew as children.<br /><br />Toni Colette is brilliant as the successful sister who seems to have everything worked out right in her life except for a personal relationship.  Her biggest dilema is her useless sister (Cameron Diaz) who keeps drifting into her life and using her.  Toni is  one of the best actors out there, and it is a pleasure to see her continue to impress with each new role.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is also very appealing in the film.  While her character is easy to dislike, it is interesting to watch as her character goes full circle.<br /><br />Shirley Maclaine plays the grandmother of the two girls, and there are some very special scenes that highlight why she is one of the greats.<br /><br />While some reviewers have called it a chick flick, I would call it a film for anyone who has experienced the ups and downs of having a sister or a brother.<br /><br />IN HER SHOES runs for over 2 hrs & 30 mins.  The film is outstanding but perhaps could have been wrapped up a little before this.  A minor complaint.  Overall, a must see for all!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I enjoy this movie.

She does so, but with great difficulty. After asking if she is dyslexic, the professor encourages Maggie to continue reading to him while offering emotional support to her. Maggie finds a friend in the professor, the first person in her life who does not ridicule her difficulties with reading, and actually helps her to improve in this area. As time passes with the professor, Maggie's confidence grows not only with reading but with her general image of herself. In addition, she also becomes friendly with the residents of the retirement community. In doing so, Maggie discovers a livelihood that is greatly needed among the elderly women, a personal clothing shopper, an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent. Ella who also does not ridicule her difficulties with math, offers to run the financial aspects of the business. In the process, they become close and resolve their past history. "In Her Shoes" is an enjoyably entertaining comedy/drama featuring a number of topflight performances and some hilarious dialogue.</p></br><a href="../users/A17LEYMZI8OYOQ.html">A17LEYMZI8OYOQ</a><br/><p>Beautifully adapted by Susannah Grant from the novel by Jennifer Weiner, exquisitely directed by Curtis Hanson and played to perfection by Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, Shirley MacLaine and a hand-picked cast, this overlooked family comedy was one of the very best films of 2005.<br /><br />Collette and Diaz are sisters, living in Philadelphia.  Toni is a responsible attorney with a low self-image when it comes to men, while Cameron is a flaky, flirty, uneducated party girl who detests work and leaches off of her sister.

Cameron Diaz plays Maggie, a not so responsible woman and Toni Collette plays Rose, her up-tight sis trying to force Maggie to "grow-up." I couldn't believe how good Diaz is in this film, the best performance of her career, so vulnerable and real. Collette is great in any movie she sinks her British teeth in. Their relationship gets tested Maggie has a fling with Rose's potential boyfriend. Maggie goes looking for the grandma she didn't know she had played by Shirley McClaine. Rose and Maggie learn interesting things about themselves along the way, separately of course. Can their tarnished relationship be fixed, you just have to rent this chick flick and see for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>I have seen this movie in the cinema but I have to say that the extra features in the DVD is very helpful to provide us with depth and insight with the Director's interpretation of the story.  As the Director said himself in the interview, he didn't want the audience to be conscious of the decisions that he made but all those subtle things in the movie such as arts chosen, the usage of mirror, the choice of camera used, the debate of either using a mutt or pure bred dog to play Honey Bun 2 was discussed openly.  By the time we watch the movie, we have a keener observation and appreciate it even more.  The director does play a pivotal role in ensuring that the actors and actresses conveyed their scenes by not overplayed their characters and all of them didn't disappoint.  The storyline never condescended any people in particular but it simply rolled on smoothly to see how people deal with their inner demons, self-esteem, and subsequently, finding a way to know be in touch with their inner selves and thus, learning to forgive and reconcile with themselves and their loved ones and moving on with their lives.  It has been a long time coming that a Hollywood movie manages to pull my heart string and truth to be told, it's brilliant.  To much my surprise, Ridley Scott is one of the executive producer.  Perhaps, that's just a hint of quality and perfection in finer details.  A movie that shall not be missed and a movie to be shared with the loved ones.  It is very relevant to modern days relationship.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2.html">A3FBGZ4E6KGIW2</a><br/><p>I didn't think I was going to like this, but I ended up liking it quite a bit.  Cameron Diaz is great in her role of Maggie.  I thought the rest of the cast was good as well.  This is a movie that has a lesson behind it and keeps you interested-I know it held my interest all the way through.  Good for a rental, I would certainly consider purchasing it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>How can two sisters be so different?  Toni Collette plays Rose, a big-city lawyer who is a real straight arrow.  Her sister Maggie, played by Cameron Diaz, is an irresponsible party girl who specializes in sponging off her relatives and avoiding work at all costs.  This movie starts out rather slowly and does not really pick up speed until the appearance of Shirley MacLaine, the sisters' long-lost grandmother.  She attempts to make up for lost time, first with Maggie and then with Rose.  She never pushes them, but under her patient guidance, Maggie begins to find herself and discover that she has a brain in addition to the obvious physical attributes which she has always depended on.  Somehow, under her subtle guidance, the sisters are able to stop feuding and start acknowledging the strong bond between them.  Interesting characters who add a lot to the movie include the sisters' overbearing stepmother and Rose's caring fiance.  When all is said and done, however, it is Shirley MacLaine the talented veteran, who steals the show.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>When theatrically released in America, `In Her Shoes' was not a big hit. Then it came to Japan, it was not a big hit either. It is a pity that not many people have seen this film because for all its flaws, `In Her Shoes' is a sweet, heart-warming film with good acting from the three ladies - Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley Maclaine. Well, probably people thought the film is so-called `Chick-Flick.' (words I hate to use). It is, perhaps, but that does not mean a bad thing.<br /><br />The story is about two sisters -- Cameron Diaz's Maggie and Toni Collette's Rose. While Rose is very serious-minded and a little frumpy lawyer, Maggie is easy-going, fashionable, beautiful, but utterly self-centered and irresponsible. When Maggie is evicted from the house of her father, she goes to Rose's apartment, in which she `borrows' her sister's desinger clothes and expensive shoes without permission. And finally Maggie steps on the toes of Rose, by doing what you can predict in the first ten minutes by watching sexy Diaz roaming in the room.<br /><br />Again evicted from her sister's room In Philadelphia, Maggie heads for the south to seek for comfortable life, after finding that she has a grandmother she had never met. The grandma Ella (Shirley Maclaine), living in Florida's home for the old, welcomes Maggie, but she is also wise to detect the true purpose of her granddaughter's visit. In the meanwhile, Rose starts to have a date with a handsome but slightly geekish co-worker Simon (Mark Feuerstein), but it doesn't take long for her (and us) to realize that the presence (or absence) of Rose is the obstacle for her to begin a new life with him.<br /><br />It must be said that the script of Susannah Grant shows few unexpected developments in story itself. The film goes where you think it goes, and Curtis Hanson refrains from using obtruding skills in telling this simple story. Perhaps the film is too long (more than 2 hours), and perhaps the three ladies are typecast. Perhaps, and this is the most important, `In Her Shoes' wears its heart on its sleeve.<br /><br />However, I liked the film because it does wear its heart on its sleeve. And when the film moves us emotionally, it does so with complicated characters supported by the intelligently written dialogues. Flawed as they are, the characters, even minor ones like the charming old folks, come to be more and more endearing.<br /><br />`In Her Shoes' is a kind of film of which content you think you know before watching it. In a sense you are right. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a well-made, feel-good drama with the attractive cast and sophisticated line. It is sweet, maybe too sweet at times, but delightful all the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"In Her Shoes" features Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as two of the unlikeliest sisters imaginable.  One (I'll let you guess which) is a promiscuous, perpetually unemployed alcoholic who is drifting aimlessly through life, while the other is an uptight Plain Jane who spends most of her time working at her job or finding her fulfillment in cheap romance novels largely because she doesn`t believe she deserves to be loved.  Even though they were apparently close as children, the two have grown apart of late, separated by the vast differences in their personalities and views on life.  When Rose (Collette) finally kicks Maggie (Diaz) out of her house, Maggie travels to Florida to stay with the grandmother (played by Shirley Maclaine) whom she hasn't heard from since the suicide of the girls' mentally ill mother many years before.  (One perplexing inconsistency in the screenplay involves the fact that Maggie, the younger sister, somehow knows she has a grandmother living in Florida, while Rose, the older, has no knowledge of the woman's existence at all).<br /><br />Although it is overlong and occasionally languid in its pacing, "In Her Shoes" is a fun movie to watch, primarily for the rich performances of the three leading ladies, who throw their hearts and souls into the characters.  They help to compensate for a certain contrivance in the plotting and the lack of conflict that results from Rose and Maggie being, for long stretches of time, in different parts of the country.  During the course of the story and through their interactions with others, the two young women eventually wind up acknowledging the hopeless direction their lives have taken and set out to rectify the situation, ultimately coming to embrace the indissoluble bond they share as sisters.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Jennifer Weiner, the film, written by Susannah Grant and directed by Curtis Hanson ("LA Confidential," "8 Mile"), feels too artificial at times to be taken very seriously, but the actresses, professionals all, bring it home anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>In Her Shoes" has all the makings of a terrific film. It is based on the best-selling "chick-lit" novel by Jennifer Weiner. It consist of a terrific cast (Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine) and a fantastic director (Curtis Hanson of "L.A. Confidential," "Wonder Boys" and "8 Mile.") Although it has its flaws, it definitely was not disappointing. It is also one of the better movies I have seen this year.<br /><br />Diaz plays irresponsible, unemployed Maggie, who still lives at home with her father and evil stepmother. She is Cinderella gone wrong, but still manages to get through life thanks to her remarkable looks and lack of scruples.<br /><br />When we first meet her, she is making out with a stranger in a bathroom stall at her high school reunion, before throwing up all over him.<br /><br />Toni Collette is Rose, her straight-laced, plain-Jane older sister, who is also a successful lawyer. She is the one called in the middle of the night to pick up drunken Maggie, and we know she has been through this many times before.<br /><br />The two have absolutely nothing in common except their shoe size.<br /><br />When Maggie's stepmother evicts her, she lands herself in Rose's apartment. The sisters seem to be getting along relatively well until Maggie betrays Rose by seducing her boss' boyfriend. This prompts Rose to kick her out and Maggie to track down their long-lost grandmother (MacLaine). The plot might sound like a bad soap opera, but what follows is a chain of events that are hilarious, touching and heartbreakingly real.<br /><br />Director Hanson does not rush the story, but the writing (adapted by Susannah Grant, who wrote the script for "Erin Brockovich") is so natural, and the performances are so assured, that "In Her Shoes" is easy to settle into.<br /><br />Although Diaz tends to be cast as the beautiful ditz and Colette the geeky, "overweight" oddball (even though she is only overweight by Hollywood standards) way too often, neither actress plays the stereotype.<br /><br />Diaz convincingly inverts her bubbly persona into something with dimensions far beyond "Charlie's Angels," while Colette is a refreshingly sympathetic loner, and perhaps a grown-up version of the lovable character she played in "Muriel's Wedding." Both actresses bring their characters to life in surprising and sometimes unexpected ways.<br /><br />On the surface, "In Her Shoes" may seem like an odd choice for Hanson, whose previous efforts have been "guy flicks," but it is ultimately not that far off from the relationships portrayed in his other films.<br /><br />This is not a "chick flick" by any standards. It is a movie about women, but not necessarily only for women. This is a rare film I think anyone can appreciate and relate to regardless of gender.<br /><br />"In Her Shoes" feels so real, and the characters so authentic, you actually forget you are watching a movie and feel a part of these people's lives.<br /><br />This is a movie for any moviegoer wanting something a little meatier, spicier and with more emotional depth than the standard Hollywood fare.<br /><br />I became so emotionally invested in each character's lives that I did not even realize how involved I was becoming until the story was wrapping itself up. At a length of two hours and 10 minutes, this is not a short film by any standards, but the minutes flew by and I realized that I cannot wait to see the film again.<br /><br />Although it is not perfect, this is a terrific film in every possible way. It consists of a superb cast, a compelling story, interesting characters and just the right blend of drama and comedy that makes "In Her Shoes" a great place to be.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>I love the fact that it isn't shallow and hits some tough topics. Cameron Diaz shines along with Toni Collette! Shirley Maclaine makes the second half of this movie extremely funny!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>For those who've read any of my previous film reviews, you probably know that dysfunctional family stories aren't my favorite genre. They tend to be too psychologically dark if not downright depressing (THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a prime example). I don't mind dark themes; in fact, I enjoy them, but they need to have more substance than just dark qualities. There needs to be character studies that go deep and delve into people as a whole, not just their black side. And that's why IN HER SHOES works ...<br /><br />Some might see this as a chick flick, but it isn't. Although all of the prime players are women, they just as easily could've been men (brothers and a grandfather). But here, it just happens to be strong female leads that pull us into the story. The premise is simple: two grown-up sisters (played by Toni Collette and Cameron Diaz) are at odds with each other. One is a responsible attorney while the other remains a sexy playgirl, and a damaging evening involving one of their boyfriends rips them apart. But as time goes by, both learn that being the "other" sister isn't such a bad thing; they are both equal parts of the other, and this comes into focus when they learn the truth about their mother's death and discover that they still have a living grandmother (the excellent Shirley MacLain).<br /><br />Tears and laughter are mixed throughout the film as we learn more and more about this wily family and how one sister's shoes (both figuratively and literally) might well fit the other ...and vice versa. The title of the movie is absolutely perfect in that we see early on Toni Collette's character's affinity for footwear and how the sisters fight over shoes and life, and how sometimes life doesn't always nuzzle-up to us in a comfortable way but shoes (family/sisters) always do.<br /><br />This is an excellent film to cozy up with next to your favorite (or embittered) sibling and take a voyage of discovery down Family Lane.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The first impression of In Her Shoes might come across like a melodramatic story, but with a director such as Curtis Hanson, the final product should be something else.  After all Hanson directed the brilliant thriller L.A. Confidential (1994) and the terrific film with the pot smoking college professor who could not finish his book in Wonder Boys (2000).  In 8 Mile, he caringly displays the tough upbringing of the infamous rapper Eminem, and how his efforts paid off after years of misery.  Thus, it is not without reason to expect that Hanson could pull off something extraordinary while the title plays directly towards the allusions of something trite and common.<br /><br />Even though, Hanson generously applies stereotypical females through Cameron Diaz's portrayal, as the typical long-legged blond bimbo Maggie.  Then there is Toni Collette, with several admirable performances since her roll as Muriel in Muriel's Wedding (1994), who reveals a counter-opposite character to Diaz through her excellent personification of the overachieving sister with strong type-A and anal-retentive tendencies.  Maggie, on the other hand, is the kind of girl men turn their heads after while Rose disappears in the masses.  The differences between the two sisters cause much friction between the girls, as Maggie's beauty enhances Rose's insecurity about her looks and her ability to date and Maggie internalizes her insecurity through Rose's driven and self-made success, as she lacks knowledge, wisdom, and skill.  The only thing that Maggie possesses is beauty, which she scandalously uses to her advantage to gain what she desires.  However, time is catching up with Maggie, which only increases her own insecurities.<br /><br />Through Maggie neediness for constant attention have formed this helpless woman that barely knows how to drive a car.  The only thing that Maggie seems capable of is to put together a sexy or fashionable outfit.  It often means when she runs out of money or place to stay she returns to Rose.  These moments are very difficulty for Rose, as does not have the heart to throw Maggie out, even though she is fully aware that Maggie will end up hurting her by using her for the moment.  Rose even makes effort to help Maggie stand on her own feet, and not be dependent on others by trying to find a job for her, which proves to be a far more difficult task that expected.  One of the best scenes in the film takes place when Maggie stays with Rose and it is when Maggie is trying on Rose's expensive shoes.  During this scene they talk about the purpose of having these luxurious footwear, which subtly enhances the distinct difference in their existence.<br /><br />The insecurities and personalities that Maggie and Rose hold stem from their childhood, which seems to have strong ties with their mother who passed away while they still were children.  Meanwhile, their father has remarried the stepmother from hell who does everything possible, both consciously and unconsciously, to make both sisters lives extremely difficult to deal with.  On top of this, Maggie discovers that their grandparents are not dead, as their father has said.  Instead, some hidden letters indicate that their grandparents live in Florida.  To make things even worse, Maggie crosses the line of no return, as she sleeps with Rose's boyfriend and gets caught in the act by her sister.  In this complicated situation, Maggie flees to Florida to use her unaware grandmother Ella Hirsch (Shirley MacLaine), as a resort where she can heal her wounds.<br /><br />To this point In Her Shoes seems to present a rather usual set up for a melodramatic drama, however, it is also at this point where Hanson throws in a wrench into the melodramatic machinery.  Instead of turning it to a typical romantic comedy, or sappy drama, Hanson transcends the film beyond the superficial anticipation of a silly over-the-top comedy of broken hearts and retribution.  The film brings the audience on a journey through the agonizing memories of distant and recent past, which allows the story to bring forth moving qualities such as forgiveness, understanding, and an opportunity for second chances.  The story occasionally feels a little too sentimental, however, Hanson incorporates these elements of the story with delicate touch in such a way that it feels natural and acceptable.  Thus, Hanson meets the expectations again, as In Her Shoes proves to be a poignant tale of two sisters' relationship issues that requires much change and wisdom.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Y87E22UVYCE6.html">A1Y87E22UVYCE6</a><br/><p>Director Curtis Hanson has filmed many remarkable films: "The Hand that Rock the Cradle" (1992), "LA Confidential" (1997) and "8 Mile" (2002). All of them were a fairly box office success at their release. Yet none of them may anticipate Hanson's incursion on a "Family Conflict" genre movie.<br /><br />Wow! What a debut in this area! IMHO "In Her Shoes" (2005) may be compared with such remarkable films as Woody Allen's Interiors (1978), Robert Redford's wonderful, four Oscar winners "Ordinary People" (1980) and also five Oscar winners "Terms of Endearment" (1983).<br /><br />The story is about two sisters.<br /><br />Rose, the elder one, is a successful lawyer with an unsuccessful love record. She compensates this frustration buying wonderful dresses and lots of shoes.<br /><br />Maggie the younger and amazingly beautiful sister is unable to keep a job and be an independent person. Nevertheless she is able to seduce whichever male she decides to. Things start to get messed up when Rose gives shelter to Maggie.<br /><br />The young cute uses her sister's shoes, car and dresses and eventually seduces her recent lover. Obviously Rose expels Maggie.<br /><br />Fate let Maggie discover that she has a loving Grandma living in Florida and there she goes trying to profit from her.<br /><br />Grandma Ella and her senior friends prove to be smarter than Maggie and start to re-educate her.<br /><br />The film follows both sisters living in far apart cities and their spiritual and intellectual growth.<br /><br />Ella will reunite them and "family secrets" will be discovered and solved one by one.<br /><br /> Play acting is outstanding. Australian actress Toni Collete as Rose gives a very convincing characterization, showing with subtlety her internal changes. One more detail: she had to gain weight (25 pounds) for the first part of the story and then lose them.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is more, much more, than a pretty woman. She gives deepness to her character and let the audience know little by little of her internal suffering.<br /><br />What to say about Shirley MacLaine?  She IS a great actress and always gives some uniqueness to her character. Her Ella is full of tender wisdom and at the same time steel stubbornness.<br /><br />Mark Feuerstein as Simon (Rose's fianc&eacute;), Ken Howard as girl's father and Jerry Adler as Ella's pretender are solid and true to life.<br /><br />Thumbs up for this movie!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>"In Her Shoes" could have so easily been a disastrous film.  If it had stuck to the formula of being a comedy about two very different sisters, the result would have fallen flat.  To the extent that it also makes a careful study of human relations and how the generations can and do drift apart, the film rises above the dreary and pursues a path less travelled.<br /><br />The two sisters are played by Toni Collette as the stuffy and less than beautiful one and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde.  Their differences only serve to antagonise the other.  Indeed, the differences do ultimately reach breaking point and they go their separate ways.  Their eventual reconciliation is touching.  The film's credibility revolves around this very point.  The result is a success.

Chris Evans is very believeable as Steve Rogers, both before the transformation of the expirment. And after, And Hugo Weaving as Red Skull. Wooooooooooow, people have complained that this movie was empty. And lacked substance and style, for a movie set during WWII. Question for you, would it really be appropiate to have modern day explosions, which there were plenty of. The director handled Cap with class and dignity, surprisingly following the comics. After he becomes a supersoldier, because the doctor is killed by a Nazi spy. The formula is lost, leaving Rogers to be the only Super Soldier. So the army uses him as a propaganda tool, a nod to what both D.C. Comics, and Marvel comics did during WWII. Using their characters to sell war bonds, Rogers gets tired of this. And goes off on his own, to rescue a squadron. Including his friend, my only problem with this movie. Is that they kill Bucky, but the movie actually makes up for it. For those who didn't like this movie, must have liked the 1990 movie, where Captain America is portrayed as a buffoon. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO RESCUE HIM FROM RED SKULL, but I digress. A dignified presentation of a classic comic book character, which is more than I can say for the recent Sherlock Holmes movies. Or the Dark Knight, this is how you handle a Comic book character. Not philisophically, or trying to be afraid to be a comic book movie. It is what it is, I loved this movie. And I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is probably, next to THE DARK KNIGHT and SPIDER-MAN, one of the best super-hero movies out there. One of the best things of the film is that it is a World War II movie and a super-hero movie all rolled into one. Faithful to the character's comic-book origin and with overtones of patriotism and good 'ol fashioned American values, the movie is somewhat of a throwback to old time movie-making story-telling. MARVEL studios went all out to make the tone just right and the production values top-notch with excellent casting. From Tommy Lee Jones in a great support roll as Col. Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull/Johann Schmidt, the Howard Hughes composit Howard Stark (father to Tony Stark aka IRON MAN)played by Dominic Cooper, Chris Evans is excellent in the title role, and finally Stanley Tucci is perfectly cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine (the kindly scientist who sees the good in Steve Rogers to make him the candidate to use his scientific research and create Captain America)... The film delivers on all parts of the super-hero film genre. A definite must-see film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>A wimp who is so small and weak that he cannot even get into the military has a few other things going for him. He has bravery and the sense to do the right then when needed. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) joins a military program after he comes to the attention of a German scientist working for the Americans. He is transformed into a fighting warrior whose goal is to help win WWII and support the American way.<br /><br />Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is the lead female actress in the movie and she slowly becomes infatuated with Captain America and he also likes her. While it does not go much further in the movie it creates a little romantic side plot.<br /><br />The villain is the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who leads the Nazi war machine and technology division to defeat the world for his own plans to take shape!<br /><br />When I watch a movie made from the story line of a comic book I look for a few things:<br />-Is it interesting?<br />-Is there a lot of good action?<br />-Is it true to the original story?<br />-Are the special effects good enough to enhance the comic book's story?<br />-Did the movie make the comic book characters seem real to life?<br />-When it is all done did I enjoy it?<br /><br />This movie met all the above questions with a yes answer from me. My family enjoyed it and it was fun to watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>I was definitely skeptical when I heard of Chris Evans' casting for this role but he more than made up for it. I'm not a big Marvel fan ... or Captain America fan, for that matter. I consider him to be just a big propaganda creation for the U.S. military. And while he is just that, this was still a really well-done film. It was not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWZW42">X-Men: First Class</a> but it is right up there with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a>.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>Once in a while, Hollywood gets it right. "Captain America: The First Avenger" (2011) is nostalgic fun. Director Joe Johnston doesn't let CGI overwhelm this engaging World War II comic-book adventure. Chris Evans delivers a sincere performance in the title role - well-matched by Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci (doing his best Maximilian Schell imitation) and a memorably villainous Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull. The Marvel superhero finally receives the A-list production he richly deserves.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>i was so excited to see this movie, i wished i would of seen the midnight showing. this movie was everything i expected it to be. the origin was excatly like the comic, the actors were awesome. hugo weaving did an excellent red skull and chris evans was fantastic as captain america. this movie was awesome. and the battle between red skull and captain america was outstanding. the only problem i have with this movie is that i wished they wouldof stuck with the original costume but other than that this is my number one superhero movie of the year. marvel you guys did great on coming out with good superhero movies for this year. i do hope that marvel will put out the original captain america movie on dvd soon. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>However, still watchable. I'm gonna make this kinda short and say that the main problem I had with this movie was that there was a lot of talking and explaining stuff (lots of these superhero movies are so serious at times lately!) and NOT ENOUGH ACTION. Where was it? Sure there is a pretty girl at Captain America's side and for anyone who cares, Captain America is played by the hottie Chris Evans who is seen shirtless a few times so there's that part of it. But to me there just wasn't enough fighting and fast-paced things going on in this mostly slower-moving movie. The action that did take place was fine and the scene where he is trying to escape a place that will soon explode with a friend was very gripping and kept my attention, but honestly there wasn't that much to work with here. I don't wanna step on any toes here when I say this, but I'd take any of the first 3 Spiderman movies over this one (oversensitive Pete and all). I liked those movies anyway.<br /><br />3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>While I do love that Marvel has finally after so many years of being the underdog in the 90's and mid 2000's to D.C. has gotten the attention they deserve,  but while this movie gives many people and longtime fans of the hero their overdue live action movie it doesn't go beyond a typical action summer flick.  The movie gives for the most part an accurate telling of the story of Steve Rogers from a lanky weak but courageous patriotic American wanting to fight the tyranny of the Third Reich and their villainous ideals but also adds another character for the future line up of the Avengers movie coming out next year.  While the action of the movie is pretty good I wasn't as entertained as much by it as I was with the action in the Iron Man movies or the Thor movie,  again while not bad the movie just feels with its storyline to even up with the Fantastic Four movies though with some better dialogue though and with a much more talented villain for Captain America(Hugo Weaving being a fantastic actor).  Still for what the movie is going for and for any fan of the Marvel universe here's a great deal regardless that no one should pass up...</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>I thought that Joe Johnston was a good pick to direct Captain America. He's made two movies that I'm quite fond of that are full of action, scares and laughs (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXS">Jurassic Park III</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000031EGV">Jumanji</a>), so I figured that with Johnston at the helm for Captain America, we might be in for more of the same. The trailer for Captain America sure made it seem like at least the action would be there, but ultimately I found Captain America to be very slow-moving and the weakest entry among the movies that have been introducing us to next year's Avengers.<br /><br />I admit that I had a preconceived notion about Captain America way before the pre-Avengers movies even started to get made, and my preconceived notion was that Captain America was outdated and quite frankly boring. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828">The Ultimates</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382">The Ultimates 2</a>. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Captain America (and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P8A">Thor</a>). Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books, and similarly I gained an entirely new respect for Captain America because of Millar's books. The integrity of Millar's delivery of Captain America is somewhat still in place with Johnston's Captain America; there's just something about Johnston's that made him into more of a campy, corny kind of character that left me unsatisfied by the end of the film.<br /><br />Captain America is a bizarro period piece mostly set in the early 40s that documents Captain America's making and rise. So I think that the campy, corny part of his personality that Johnston instilled was deliberate and meant to suggest it was sort of the natural disposition of a lot of people back then. But for me it just came across as rather droll. Surprisingly, with a cast that includes some other greats like Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving, you'd think that the drollness might be made up for by stellar acting. But if you ask me, those guys are gravely underused in Captain America.<br /><br />Look, if you want to see the birth of Captain America and keep the continuity of the introduction of the Avengers prior to next year's Avengers blockbuster, I certainly don't recommend skipping Captain America. But if you want to read a MUCH better story with Captain America in a key role read Millar's books.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Unlike most of its peers, this film isn't as overdone with endless fighting and chasing, though there is plenty of that here. Instead, because it has to have some plausibility as being set during WW2, the effects here are not as headache-inducing. Yes, it has the usual evil-genius plot we would expect, but it also delivers some male bonding storyline, and a somewhat cliched strong-female love interest to relieve the hardware fantasy show. If you haven't seen how this fits into the grand scheme, you will still enjoy because the movie stands alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OCJNB6B46OKP.html">A2OCJNB6B46OKP</a><br/><p>Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.<br /><br />This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.<br /><br />This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>This is an enjoyable movie to watch.  Great special effects, good acting, and a decent plot make it worthy.  Could it have been done better?  Only in the plot.  I wont go into details since the plot has been told by many previous reviews, but the ending could of been done better.  I understand Marvel wanted to bridge the gap into the 21st century and have Captain America be a part of The Avengers, but the ending was not as good as expected.  That though is being picky on my part.  I enjoy Superhero movies and Marvel and DC have done an overall good job on bringing their characters to the big screen.  This movie is no exception.  It is great fun to watch and I recommend it to any Superhero fan!</p></br><a href="../users/A2WB4OWBUH2VQX.html">A2WB4OWBUH2VQX</a><br/><p>I don't have a long history of comic book fascination but I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in "bigness" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides "The Avengers", which looks very promising!</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>A young man, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to join the military. Unfortunately this is during World War II and he is deemed to be 4F. He doesn't really want to kill Nazis just thwart bullies. He gets his chance through the efforts of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci,) who fattens him up a bit through injections and extreme infusions of blue light energy. Now comes the question of how will he use his newfound abilities, for good, for evil, or for frivolity?<br /><br />Most of us already know the story of Capt. America many of watched programs or read the comics. So we already have a preconception of how this should come about and what he should be doing as the superhero. However I suggest you set those preconceptions aside and watch the movie for what it is. You will find that it is entertaining, fast-paced yet slows down every once in a while so that Steve Rogers can look into Peggy Carter's (Hayley Atwell) eyes and wonder what it would be like if the world was different.<br /><br />Being a little bit on the cynical side you would almost think that this movie is really an outlet for out of work actors. We see many of our favorites and a few that may become favorites. Tommy Lee Jones looks a little bit like he might've melted in his old age but we still remember him from that fantastic movie "Volcano." Every time I see the bad guy okay the Crimson Skull (Hugo Weaving) I think of "Lord of the Rings." But it's too bad that Stanley Tucci did not get a longer part as he is a very flexible actor. You should really see Stanley in the movie "Undercover Blues."<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot comment on any peculiarities of the other versions. And watching the credits they explained that this is really just the first movie of the series of movies.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>After watching all the superhero movies as of late I was pleasently surprised at how good Captain America The First Avenger is. Thor and Green Lantern were good, but Captain America was much better in my opinion. Although the twist at the end with him being in modern day America is sure to make me enjoy the next film that much more. The movie is about a young soldier named Steve Rogers who volunteers to undergo a series of experiments for the US army Super Soldier program. After transforming him into a Super Soldier the rest is history and Captain America becomes the First Avenger,<br /><br />The "Captain America: The First Avenger" Blu-ray Disc is presented in 1080p high definition with English 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Audio Description with English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.

When I first saw it, I thought it didn't have enough action and started out pretty slow. But the more I see it, I appreciate it more. The action scenes were pretty awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.)<br /><br />Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the "Super-Soldier" experiment. He soon becomes tall and muscular and becomes a national treasure as 'Captain America' with an awesome motorcycle and bulletproof American flag shield. He must stop Red Skull from destroying the world with a cubed jewel. If you enjoy Marvel Comic movies, you might enjoy CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>I've never been the biggest Captain America fan. Even when I was into comics he always just seemed kind of boring to me. I have friends these days trying to tell me he's even more awesome now, but it just seems like too little too late. My comic book reading days are over, for the most part. But despite that Captain America: The First Avenger looked like it had a lot of potential. Chris Evans seemed to fit the Steve Rogers role incredibly well and Hugo Weaving always plays an excellent villain. I've also enjoyed nearly every Marvel film since Iron Man anyway. So Captain America: The First Avenger looked like it could be great, but also had a lot to live up to. It mostly delivers, but comes up a little short in being fully and completely satisfying.<br /><br />Just about all of Captain America is spent in 1942 during World War II. We follow Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) as he persistently tries to join the army and fails repeatedly due to his small size and asthma. A scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees potential in Rogers and recruits him to Camp Lehigh in New York. Erskine sees something in Rogers; his integrity, his honor, his natural desire to be nothing more than a good man. It's here that Rogers is chosen for the "super soldier" experiment and eventually becomes Captain America. Meanwhile, Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) leads HYDRA, a private terrorist group, and has just come into possession of a mysterious tesseract that Schmidt claims gives him the power of the gods.<br /><br />The cast is ridiculously flawless in this. I've always been a big fan of Chris Evans, but I never really imagined him in the role of Captain America. He fits the role so well. He does look a bit odd before he gets the super soldier serum injected into him, but the method used was probably the best way to go. Evans is able to portray Rogers in a spectacular light. You believe he's a good guy just doing what he thinks is best for his country. Hugo Weaving is also a fantastic Red Skull. He's so hellbent on destroying the world yet he has class taking time out to have someone paint his portrait or enjoy a glass of wine in the middle of a pep talk to his HYDRA troops. Tommy Lee Jones also manages to squeeze in quite a few humorous one-liners. I feel like Hayley Atwell deserves the most credit though. In most superhero films, the love interest usually just does that; makes love to the superhero and sits on the sidelines worrying about him the rest of the time. Atwell's Peggy Carter actually makes herself useful. If it wasn't for her, Captain America never would've been given a serious chance as a soldier. Atwell also showed the widest range of emotion in the film next to Evans, as well.<br />Captain America felt simple in the most flattering of ways. It never strayed too far from Cap swooping in and having to save the day and never tried to over complicate things by cramming too much of the comics into an origin film. The action usually resulted in tremendous explosions and men being thrown across the screen. It's like the movie gave you pride to be an American without being too political or overly preachy. In fact, it wasn't either of those things at all. It was just extremely gratifying entertainment that did its source material justice.<br /><br />The special effects were really top notch, for the most part. The finale with the highly anticipated battle between Red Skull and Captain America is probably the most impressive. There's a fight that takes place in freefall between Cap and a few henchmen that's done incredibly well and the special effects always shine brightest whenever that blue cube Red Skull is obsessed with is shown on screen. Some of the scenes that were obviously shot in front of a green screen kind of got to me though; once you notice that it kind of takes you out of the action for a moment. Luckily, this was a film that made it easy to get sucked back into it.<br /><br />Captain America has a lot of buildup with the pay off coming up short of completely delivering. We spend all this time with Steve Rogers before the super soldier serum and after and his time on stage selling war bonds. We're basically itching and craving for him to beat the snot out of some Nazis by the time he goes off venturing on his own to where the 107th's last known whereabouts. That scene delivers the action in spades, but everything else that's exciting after that seems incredibly short. We get a montage that would've been amazing in its entirety and we basically get bits of incredible action sequences sprinkled throughout the second half of the movie. We never really get that tingling sensation from being punched in the face too hard during an incredible action scene. Fantastic things happen in the film, but they seem to end as soon as they begin.<br /><br />Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the best written and most well-rounded superhero films of the year. The entire cast is phenomenal, the special effects are impressive, and it has all the right seeds planted for next year's The Avengers. The action almost feels like an afterthought though. It's as if there was too much story to tell and Joe Johnston had to cut down on action to cram in more dialogue. Captain America: The First Avenger is still explosive, exhilarating, captivating, and fairly entertaining, but it drops the ball on delivering a completely satisfying climax.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8.html">A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8</a><br/><p>I wanted to like "Captain America" but the movie's faults made this a one-off--good enough to watch once, but probably not one of those that the viewer will watch over and over again over the years.  The characters had potential but did not live up to this potential.  Steve Rogers and Peggy Clark have a chaste little attraction going, but it never matures into anything of note in the film.  Steve Rogers himself lacks depth, and the film could have developed him, and his friend "Bucky" much more.  The same is true of the villains--they are one-dimensional bad guys and that is pretty much the end of it.<br /><br />The special effects are good, and I applaud that the movie is pretty much true to the original "Captain America" story.  I just think that this one could have been done better.  RJB.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In 1942 as America enters WWII, a skinny and timid man named Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) with his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) sign up for training yet Rogers is determined to be a great soldier despite being weakly. So in turn, Dr. Erkstine (Stanley Tucci) with industry captain Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) conducts an experiment on him that turns Rogers into an enhanced and more tougher version of himself including enhanced fighting skills and improved Stamina as he wields a shield made out of a rare metal as he becomes Captain America who is the first Avenger ever. Nazi leader Jonahn Schmidt aka Red-Skull (Hugo Weaving) is the head of a Nazi organization called HYDRA where he wants absolute power from an ancient magic cube that thinks might make him more powerful than ever as Captain America wages war on Hydra.<br /><br />Co-starring Samuel L Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones and Haley Atwell, this movie is a prequel to the Avengers saga and Rocketeer director Joe Johnson has done a great job of making this well acted and well produced comic based saga to life. An improvement over the 1990 monstrosity, Evans was fantastic and Hugo was born to play RedSkull. The film is an action packed extravaganza that is quite true to the original Marvel comics of the 40s and 60s, i like how they used amazing digital make-up in the Benjamin Button tradition on Evan's character to make him a weakling which looked almost real and how Hugo's make-up was. This movie is basically a prequel to The Avengers films which started with Iron Man in 2008 as if you can link this with Iron Man afterwards then Incredible Hulk then Iron man 2 and finally Thor to know the whole story then you get "Avengers". The film has that Indiana Jones feel of adventure in a timeless period and that's what is so cool about this movie plus there are 2 endings like one after the credits then finally a teaser to Avengers.<br /><br />This DVD/Blu-Ray combo contains quality picture and theater style sound with cool extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, featurettes and a funny short film that takes place during "Thor".</p></br><a href="../users/A3NKFB39AIEN8W.html">A3NKFB39AIEN8W</a><br/><p>I saw this film last night. Before I get to my review I want to address the editorial review on this page, which said that there wasn't a link from the period this story takes place to the future when Captain America is part, or leader, of the Avengers. That reviewer evidently did not see the very first and very last scenes in the film, which explain the process by which Captain America is frozen, then thawed in the future.<br /><br />Anyway (sorry for the spoiler but I had to get that out the way because I don't think it was fair of the reviewer to overlook these scenes), I confess that it's been a very long time since I had such a good time on a superhero film. The reason I enjoyed this film is because, for one of the rare times with these types of films, its human elements didn't take a back seat to the special effects. In fact, it was the other way around. The acting was very good as was the story, as believable as a story so preposterous as its presented, can be.<br /><br />Basically, the story takes place during WW2 and a rogue general in one of Hitler's divisions called Hydra has acquired an ancient energy source that has enabled him to construct the ultimate weapon. The only hope for the Western axis is to develop "super soldiers" starting with a short pencil-neck recruit named Steve Rogers who volunteers to be a guinea pig that will amplify both his physical and also his moral attributes.<br /><br />This is one very good film, far and away the fourth best superhero this decade behind Batman Begins, the Dark Knight, and Spider Man. They really took time getting into character development, it wasn't just Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Ma'am straight to the action, but there was a real story here and not just enough to justify special effects later on. I really appreciate the film's attempt to recreate that era, to make the film feel alien enough for me to believe that it happened in another time. As usual, both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were terrific, Weaving as the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee as the hard-bitten military guy. Like I said, this film is more story than action even though the action and cgi effects are very good in this film, and always feel appropriate for the situations in which they are used. I like the sepia look of the human parts of the movie and how this look contrasts with the scenes showing Captain America doing his thing. This is a great primer for next year's Avengers film and I hope that the creative team who put together Captain plays a part in that film. Must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I never read the original Captain America comic from the 40's, but considering this is probably the first of at least one sequel for "Cap" I think the film was very well done. Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four film. It's a little light on "Cap" action, but the story is pretty easy to follow. Great FX and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans and also gets us pumped for next summer's Avengers film, but purist may find flaws I didn't notice or care about.<br /><br />The three disc 3-D/Blu Ray/DVD combo has some interesting extras making of etc. and an excellent looking Blu Ray transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>While Captain America (Chris Evans) and his origin have had screen time before it's no mean feat to bring off TWO origins stories in one film (a period film no less), make it a fun adventure AND set up a big screen sequel with what amounts to a satisfying ending all in a little over two hours.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's experience with previous franchise films ("Jurassic Park III") and retro superhero stories (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JZBP4Q">The Rocketeer: 20th Anniversary Edition [Blu-ray</a>]) boded well for "Captain America: The First Avenger".

Of all the superhero movies this past summer only "Captain America: The First Avenger" delievered on all fronts. The main flaw of the movie is that the origin story as essential as it is seems to go on a bit too long but, in some respects, that also allows us to identify even more with Rogers as we share his frustration every step of the way. Unfortunately that also leaves LESS story for us to see Cap in action.<br /><br />Originally presented in 3D in theaters "Captain America: The First Avenger" looks marvelous with a simply stunning Blu-ray transfer--colors are bold in a retro sort of way and the detail is amazing from the crisp, sharp images to the 7.1 lossless Surround mix.<br /><br />Special features include a feature commentary with director Johnston surrounded by DP Shelly Johnson and Editor Jeffrey Ford. Their discussion focuses primarily on the technical aspect and while there are large sections of silence, they don't babble away like many folks do on commentary tracks.<br /><br />We also get six featurettes on the creation of the film that covers everything from costuming, adapting the comic and the characters of Rogers and the Red Skull. Also included is a featurette on the transformation of Rogers from whimp to action hero. We also get an opportunity to hear from co-creator Joe Simon (who wrote "Captain America" while the great artist Jack Kirby did the artwork and helped plot the comic as well)on the origin of Cap. The special features are rounded off by two theatrical trailers for the film and a short "Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To Thor's Hammer" that follows Agent Colson as he makes his way to the site where Thor's hammer falls in the film "Thor".<br /><br />Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to enlist in the good fight against the Nazi's during World War II but he's a 96 pound weakling; Roger is left behind while his pals including "Bucky" Barnes ship off to fight in Europe, he's left behind feeling like even more of a loser. Rogers can't pass the physical until Dr. Abraham Erskin (Stanley Tucci)takes an interest in Rogers and signs him up for his super solider experiment. Once injected with Erksin's powerful formula Rogers transforms into everything that Erskin could have hoped for the only problem is that Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones perfectly cast)sees Rogers as little more than a promotional tool once it becomes clear he won't get any more super soldiers and sees his best possible soldier as too big an asset to gamble on in battle. Ultimately, though, it's only Captain America as he comes to be known while out promoting war bonds that can fight the mutant result of another of Erskin's experiments the Red Skull.<br /><br />Although the film focuses a bit too much on Cap before he gets out there to fight the Red Skull, "Captain America: The First Avenger" delivers on the promise made early with Marvel films such as "Iron Man" and is the best of the batch after that film with a strong retro look, great action sequences and some truly stunning set pieces. The film also provides the perfect set up for next summer's action superhero epic Josh Whedon's "The Avengers" and we get a brief peak at that film at the conclusion of this film after the credits.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A28MM46KI4EQB2.html">A28MM46KI4EQB2</a><br/><p>I saw this in the theatre with my now wife, and we bothed loved it!  I thought it was very well done!  This is a definite must own for sure!  Words cannot even describe how excited I am about the upcoming Avengers film next year, and about every single one of the Marvel titles leading up to it!  So awesome!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>It's crucial that you get to like Steve Rogers when he was only this 98-pound weakling, crucial that you grow to care for this runty, scrawny, asthmatic kid who persists in standing up for himself and for others, never mind that this usually rewards him with bruises and lumps. It's 1943, in wartime America, and Steve Rogers yearns to do his part, if the military would only allow him to. Five times he's tried to enlist only to be summarily rejected as 4F. Meanwhile, his best friend James "Bucky" Barnes is a sergeant in the U.S. Army, cutting a dashing figure, shining the ladies, bullying those who'd been bullying Steve. You note Steve's lack of resentment over this, and like him for it.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is the one I'd been looking forward to the most this year, and I'm pleased as punch to say that this movie did not tank, that it in fact is fairly bloody brilliant. I enjoyed THOR and X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, but CAPTAIN AMERICA is the best Marvel flick since IRON MAN and it gets you charged up for THE AVENGERS movie. Chris Evans - damn.<br /><br />Steve Rogers's impassioned speech to Bucky is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine, a kindly German scientist working for the U.S. government. Dr. Erskine heads a top secret government program involving the creation of the super-soldier, and on these shores he's looking for a candidate to be his inaugural test subject (he'd had an earlier candidate elsewhere but that didn't work out so well; more on that in a bit). Dr. Erskine sees past Steve's sickly frame. He's intrigued with Steve's spirit. He gets him enlisted in the U.S. Army.<br /><br />Compared to the rest of the film, the first third segment is less action-packed, but that doesn't equate to dull or slow. We track Steve Rogers' time in boot camp and we take in his struggles. He tires easy. He's always finishing last. The camp's gruff director, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, hogging all the good lines), is highly skeptical and takes Dr. Erskine to task for Rogers' presence. But we note Rogers' quiet diligence and doggedness, and these strong character moments provide the building blocks for making what happens to him later so resonating and gratifying.<br /><br />If you're caught up on Marvel Comics continuity, then you're up to snuff on what happens next. Steve Rogers undergoes Erskine's treatment which galvanizes change on an awesome cellular scale. I think the best CG work done by the film's f/x crew, hands down, is in the shrinking and scrawnying of Chris Evans and making it look seamless. Steve Rogers as the beneficiary of the super-soldier serum is a picture in bold contrast, a foot taller and now rippling with muscles. But this is Chris Evans in real, the guy having worked his tail off to get this buff (even though Chris Hemsworth probably still points at him and smirks).<br /><br />If you don't know your Captain America history, I'll just mention that an act of sabotage renders Steve Rogers the world's one and only super soldier. Which gets us to an inspired plot thread which isn't part of Captain America lore. And, fine, here's a ***SPOILERS alert*** for the rest of this paragraph. With Rogers the only one of his kind, Colonel Phillips has no use for him, and so Steve Rogers is deployed to USO tour appearances, putting on a show in the home front with chorus girls and shilling war bonds as the military mascot "Captain America." Like a good soldier, Steve goes along with it, but he wishes he could do more. We know that Cap will join the war soon enough, but, in the meantime, his time on stage just fills me with cinematic joy. I absolutely love that he gets his own awesome show jingle, "Star Spangled Man," with music by Alan Menken. I also like how the film addresses the inherent cheesiness of the traditional Captain America costume, which is what he wears on these shows. Cap's later costume re-design would be more practical, less shiny, less tights.<br /><br />Chris Evans inhabits his role with conviction, imbues Steve Rogers with spunk and an appealing sweetness, and I'm not worried any more about how he might hold up against Robert Downey, Jr. and Samuel Jackson in THE AVENGERS movie. He just proved to me that he can command the screen. Fine actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving add so much to the story. If you could point at the heart of the story, it may be the almost father-son relationship between Steve Rogers and Tucci's Dr. Erskine. Tucci isn't in the film much, but he leaves a defining mark. I was concerned about how the Red Skull would come off, but I should've known Hugo Weaving would make it work. His Nazi commandant, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. the Red Skull, is a convincing villain and, incidentally, a failed past test subject of Erskine's. As a guilty pleasure, I'm glad the biochemist Arnim Zola is here as well. Or, I dunno, maybe I'm fond of him because Ookla the Mok's "Super Skrull" song references him. ("He's endorsing RC Cola and cruising chicks with Arnim Zola.")<br /><br />Parts of Steve's origin are snatched from Marvel's Ultimate universe (portraying Bucky as someone in Steve's age bracket, for one thing). For fans of Marvel's cinematic continuity, Dominic Cooper riffs Robert Downey, Jr. a bit as Tony Stark's rakish genius industrialist father, Howard Stark. I wish Hayley Atwell as British Agent Peggy Carter were given more to do, but I suspect Atwell will reappear in future films as Agent 13, Sharon Carter. And if you were expecting Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos to show up, you're sort of right. The action is terrific, and maybe it's terrific because the story had taken the time to invest in its lead character. These aren't just tatters of action sequences. There's a compelling thru arc to tie everything together.<br /><br />But, okay, one thing nagged me. There's something jarringly anachronistic about the presence of Hydra and its super science. The strongest emotional impression I have to Cap is that he was a World War II hero who fought the Nazis and later became a tormented man-out-of-time. This movie removes the first part by replacing the Nazis with Hydra goons. And, although Hydra is supposed to be affiliated with them storm troopers - serving as Hitler's "deep science division" - it's not the same. "Heil Hydra!" just doesn't ring true. And Nazis always did make the best big bads.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER gives it up with that old-fashioned wartime nostalgia, with a grip of strong performances, with an indomitable legend to whom Chris Evans does justice. This movie has heart. Nothing embodies that more than the sequence in which the new Steve Rogers is in pursuit of a spy who tries to distract him by tossing a boy into the drink. About to dive in the water, Steve hears the boy briskly yell at him: "I can swim. Go get him!" That bit of bravado from the kid generated the loudest cheers from the theater audience.<br /><br />As per norm, stick around until after the closing credits. If what you see doesn't excite you... then you're probably executives over at DC Comics.</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>After years of awaiting a movie worth this historically rich character's name, I'm happy to announce that a good Captain America film finally here. I was quite blown away by how much I enjoyed it. My fear of the worst kept my expectations in check as I waited for The First Avenger to hit theaters. For a while, I expected it to be mediocre to moderately good, but I retained a cautious optimism. I didn't have enough faith in it to hype the movie up to friends and family, but I prayed it would be as good as the previous films in the Avengers Saga. Being a huge Marvel fan, I was obliged to see it no matter how good or bad critics said it was. Surprisingly, it turned out to be just what Joe Johnston's credentials promised. It was a good old fashioned throwback action adventure flick that's fun (for the family, despite a few shockingly violent moments), humorous, and surprisingly, emotionally resonant. I thought it was a notch or two above Thor, albeit I wouldn't recommend one over the other. Johnston's last few films (The Wolfman, Jurassic Park III and Hidalgo -- two of which I actually enjoyed) didn't have great receptions, so it was understandable for most to be weary of him directing, but I think he did a damn good job with material that had the potential to be very silly. The character, Captain America, is one of those characters that everyone knows of, but not many people care about. He probably comes across as a boring character, due to his overtly American themes, simplistic superpowers, and his shield.<br /><br />In fact, the film could have easily been quite boring, or laughably silly, but I'm pleased to say that this movie is none of the above, and neither are most of Cap's latest publishings, to be honest. This is a classic case of not judging a book by its cover. Granted, there are inherently cheesy moments throughout the film, but what do you expect from an apparent propaganda piece about an unlikely soldier with an American flag costume and a big shield, who is battling an evil Nazi with red skin that is bent on world domination? I actually loved the cheese factor. It went quite well with the 40's WWII atmosphere, and the film as a whole. Like I mentioned before, this film was a throwback to the old fashioned action adventure movies like Indiana Jones and The Rocketeer (another Johnston film). There's an automatic cheese factor that goes with the territory. Early flags were raised by internet dwellers about Chris Evans not being right for the leading role. I never bought into those complaints. I mean, have you guys seen him? Blonde hair, blue eyes, quirky innocence, toned body, and actual acting abilities (if you've seen him in anything besides Fantastic Four -- which he was actually one of the best aspects of). What the hell else did we need for him to be right for the role? I don't know, but I had faith in him and he delivered. Some people have said that he was bland and just a good guy with no internal conflict, and for the most part, I agree. That's who he is supposed to be though. His character was developed as he grew up, due to him being physically inane. That was the very reason why Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruited him.<br /><br />I loved Evans as Steve Rogers, and even more as Cap. He just flat out kicked ass, in my opinion. He went against what we've become accustomed to in superhero movies, and it worked well. Spoilers: When Cap threw a knife into a Hydra agents back, then threw two other Hydra agents right out of a plane, I knew his portrayal would be a legend for years to come. I really was not expecting that kind of brutality in a cartoonish comic book movie where us older fans have come to expect major toning down for young children. I mean, he is a soldier, and this is a war, but you get my point. It would be asinine for him to go through all of that trouble trying to enlist and getting turned down, only to go overseas and just knock his enemies out. Killing is what war is about, so hats off to Johnston and his writers, as well as Marvel Studios and Paramount for having the testicular fortitude to let that happen in The First Avenger. Another surprisingly violent moment was when the older woman in the hidden base got shot and we actually saw the impact. Well, she did have a machine gun, but even so, I applaud them again for letting that happen in a family blockbuster. It added to the seriousness of the situation, and left more of an impact. The audience should take from that, that the Nazi spy who gunned down the older women needed to be taken down as soon as possible. While I did appreciate the mature sparks of violence, there were also other noticeable tone downs that conflicted with them.<br /><br />Now I'll admit that this is just me nitpicking, but that's what reviews are for, right? Similar to the Decepticon canons in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I have to say that I was distracted by the way that Hydra's advanced weapons disintegrated their victims, pretty much reducing them to dust, instead of actually showing the devastation of the weapons like they did with regular guns. I'm not saying that it was necessary to show blood splatter when the cosmic blasts impacted. I understand the ratings system, but what they chose to do was pushing it, even for science fiction. Speaking of those weapons, some have argued that they seemed more appropriate for a film set in the future, more so than one set in the 1940's. That is an understandable quibble, but that was the point. The cosmic cube allowed Hydra to develop weaponry that was far beyond anything from the time period. That was why Red Skull went through such lengths to attain the cube, and develop the Hydra tech with it. Speaking of Red Skull, I have to say I loved him in this movie. Perhaps he was not as menacing as he could have been, but, I'll be damned if he wasn't one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Hugo Weaving should just play villains in everything for the rest of his career. He does it too well. After seeing his performance, I cannot think of another actor who I would have chosen over him. I'm glad to have him immortalized in the Marvel Universe now, and I hope he returns for the sequel. I'm sure he will because he's obviously not dead, only teleported to another dimension or plane. Actually, I think the whole cast was great.<br /><br />Haley Atwell was probably the best main love interest of all the Avengers Saga films, which is surprising given she's the least recognizable of all of the actresses who played them. If I were to rank them, I'd do it as follows: Haley Atwell, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman, and lastly, Liv Tyler. As for Atwell's character, Peggy Carter, I loved how they chose to keep her sexiness hidden until she appeared in that stunning red dress. Her character was introduced as a tough one, but she showed compassion towards Steve. She was a very well developed character, and I'll be sorely disappointed if this is the last we see of her. Spoilers: The moment she and Steve shared before he crashed into the ice was moving, and as I was feeling for them, I was quite surprised that this film managed elicit such an emotional response from me. The same film that I feared would be drowned in mediocrity. They did such a fantastic job at developing thirt relationship. Sadly, I'm pretty sure this is her only outing. There were quite a few moments when I sincerely cared for the fate of the characters. Not only Steve and Peggy, but Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as well. He has one of the saddest, and most surprising moments in the film. Even as a fan of the comics, who knew what would happen to Bucky, as well as who he later becomes, I have to admit that moment got me. I mentioned Stanley Tucci briefly before, but I didn't say that I enjoyed his performance as the doctor responsible for Steve's transformation. I thought Tucci did a pretty good job with the minimal screentime he had.<br /><br />What more can one say about Tommy Lee Jones that hasn't been said before? He was primarily comic relief, and he was quite funny. Dominic Cooper (The Devil's Double, An Education) was an appropriate choice as Howard Stark. He was a nice counterpart to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. I was pleased with the Howling Commandos as well. Neal McDonough was great as Dum Dum Doogan. His character wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked, considering the role he played in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s development, but he was fine nonetheless. Now all of this praise is not to say that I don't think the film is flawed. It's far from perfect, and many people will most likely have issues with the overall cheesiness of the plot and stereotypical portrayals of the characters, but I enjoyed it very much. It was a great tie-in to the Avengers Saga, but nothing took precedence over Cap's origin story. This is first, and foremost, a Captain America film.The build up for The Avengers has been an exciting one to experience. Each link in the chain is solid, with some obviously being stronger than others. I think Captain America: The First Avenger falls in at second best in the series, after the first Iron Man. As for the transfer, the picture quality is as good as one would expect a modern release to look. Detail is strong and fairly crisp, although some may confuse the Director and Cinematographer's choice of dim lighting and color timing as soft. The sound is pretty much flawless. As far as the extras go, they leave a lot to be desired. The best of the bunch is without a doubt, the commentary. The featurettes, as well as the Marvel One-Shot, are short, but sweet. All in all, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Note: I own the Best Buy exclusive version, but the only difference is the cardboard slipcover.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>Colorful, nostalgic and splendidly executed on many fronts, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER ranks with the most satisfying comic-book movies to date.<br /><br />Joe Johnston, who did such a fine job helming Disney's underrated WWII-period genre film "The Rocketeer" some 20 years ago, was the right choice to bring Marvel's patriotic hero to the screen in a confident, satisfying film that hits every note from its first frame to nearly its last.<br /><br />Chris Evans makes for a perfect Steve Rogers, the tough kid from Brooklyn whose motivation and courage are unfortunately not matched by his scrawny, weak body - one that prevents him from serving Uncle Sam in WWII. Rogers is continually rejected for service until his determination is noted by scientist Stanley Tucci, working for the U.S. military and who sees in Rogers the perfect candidate for their new Super Soldier program, spearheaded in part by brilliant Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing none other than Tony "Iron Man" Stark's father).<br /><br />Rogers' transformation, though, at first applies mostly off the field of battle, with Captain America serving as a USO salesman for war bonds (there's a wonderful musical montage set to an original Alan Menken-David Zippel song). Much to the consternation of gruff colonel Tommy Lee Jones, Rogers eventually presses his way into service, saving an Allied troop from certain death at the hands of HYDRA, a Nazi off-shoot presided over by the evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Schmidt has not only been previously transformed by Tucci's doctor into the vile Red Skull, but has also corralled one of Odin's energy cubes and created a new destructive weapon that threatens the future of the entire world.<br /><br />"Captain America" does dial down the particulars of its war-time setting so as to not feel like too much of an "all-American" story, replacing any overt feelings of rah-rah patriotism with an overriding message that Rogers is a hero not because of his nationality so much as his courage and heart instead (as he tells Tucci's scientist at the beginning, Cap "doesn't want to kill anyone" but can't stand "bullies"). It's a decision that ultimately works, managing to make the picture more appealing to foreign markets while not turning the material into a completely toothless, "Politically Corrected" portrayal of the character either (a gambit that paid off with the movie having grossed $365 million worldwide, slightly more than half overseas).<br /><br />Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script confidently profiles Cap's dogged pursuit of the Skull with just a hint of romance (British newcomer Hayley Atwell is fetching as Peggy Carter), though supporting roles for the likes of Sebastian Stan (as Cap's sidekick Bucky) and Neal McDonough (one of the "Howling Commandos") come off as if they've been reduced in the editing room. Johnston's fondness for the material, though, is always evident, marked by crisply-edited action scenes that bring the vintage Marvel comics to life. Technically the movie is graced by an occasionally rousing Alan Silvestri score (his end credits "March" is just great) and cinematography by Shelly Johnson that was done no favors by the movie's 3-D exhibitions, which darkened an already limited visual pallet that overly accentuated green-screen.<br /><br />If there's one disappointment with "Captain America," it's that the film works so well, it's a letdown when the material moves into the present day for its inevitable "Avengers" set-up in its concluding moments - making one surmise that if there is a sequel, it's not going to involve the period setting and supporting characters from this exciting "Cap" to the year's super-hero efforts. (Perhaps some kind of time-travel device can send Steve back to the `40s?)<br /><br />Paramount brings "Captain America" to Blu-Ray and 3-D Blu-Ray this week in a number of different variants, including a limited-edition three-disc bundle. The 3-D for the movie is well-handled for the most part with depth-of-field effects, yet as I mentioned before, the cinematography is dulled even further from its standard appearance so I would recommend the 2-D version instead. The DTS MA soundtrack is dynamic throughout.<br /><br />Extras include five minutes of deleted scenes in HD with incomplete special effects that fans will find of interest, including a different introduction to the Howling Commandos and a longer ending. Seven Making Of featurettes give a slick, mostly promotional-type look behind the scenes while there's another brief, amusing "Marvel One Shot" with Special Agent Caulson (Clark Gregg) set in between this picture and "Thor." Rounding out the disc are trailers and a commentary track with Johnston, Shelly Johnson and editor Jeffrey Ford.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AK7ZFKW08HID.html">A2AK7ZFKW08HID</a><br/><p>This is a awesome movie. My two year old boy loves Captain America and he has watched this movie over and over and never gets tired of it. The action was great and there were some pretty funny parts mixed in to. All around great movie, can't wait to see The Avengers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3APW42N5MRVWT.html">A3APW42N5MRVWT</a><br/><p>Update:<br /><br />I saw "Captain America" again for the third time. This time projected from a 35mm print and, while there are a few brief moments which were designed for 3D that aren't quite as cool in 2D, overall it is a much more rewarding experience than the underlit 3D presentations I saw. This is really a bright, colorful film with lots of detail in the action, sets, backgrounds, and facial expressions which are lost in the dimness of digital presentation. Well worth a second viewing if you can find someplace running it on film. I expect that the DVD and Blu-Ray will be closer to the brightness of film than the dimness of digital theatrical projection.<br /><br />Original post:<br /><br />Saw "Captain America" twice already. Both times in 3D (which ain't too shabby). Liked it the first time. Liked a lot better the second time - for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />The first is that I wasn't distracted reconciling the movie with the comics. The movie is very, very good but, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034G4P80">Thor</a>, it has the job of filling in all of the back story needed for The Avengers in 2012 and there's a LOT more back story. Captain America really deserved Iron Man's two film lead in. And, as much as the movie does an impressive job adapting decades of story into two hours there are inevitable differences some of which were a bit jarring to me. On second viewing I could appreciate the movie for itself because I already knew where it differed from the stories I was familiar with.<br /><br />The second viewing, I saw the movie with my teenage daughter who knows almost nothing about the character and I was curious how she would respond to it. We, of course, stayed through the credits for the anticipated after credit scene and then this occurred:<br /><br />The movie ends. Daughter turns to me.<br /><br />Daughter: "Really?"<br /><br />We stand and walk to the end of the row.<br /><br />Daughter: "Really?"<br /><br />We walk up the aisle a bit.<br /><br />Daughter: "An ad?"<br /><br />And a bit farther.<br /><br />Daughter: "That's stupid."<br /><br />A bit farther.<br /><br />Daughter: "As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?"<br /><br />We exit the theater and in the lobby are four of her friends. They greet and hug and ask "what are you seeing? and "what did you see?"<br /><br />Friend: "We're going to see Harry Potter again."<br />Daughter: "Captain America"<br />Friend: "Cool. How is it?"<br />Daughter: "Ummm..."<br />Friend: "Oh. That good?"<br />Daughter: "Well ..."<br />Friend: "What would you rate it?"<br />Daughter: "Mmmm...three stars."<br />Friend: "Oh."<br /><br />The friends obviously have no interest in seeing Captain America now.<br /><br />Daughter: "But stay 'til the end"<br />Daughter: "It's disappointing, but stay 'til the end."<br /><br />The friends obviously now have less than no interest in seeing Captain America.<br /><br />We leave the theater, walking to the car.<br /><br />Daughter: "That free-fall fight was cool!"<br /><br />Me: "Yeah. I liked that a lot, too."<br /><br />Daughter: "I'd have probably given it four stars but that ad at the end was a dumb move."<br /><br />Me: "I liked the movie a lot more this time. I think because I knew what to expect and wasn't trying to reconcile the movie with the comics and I knew when the movie really ended and when to stop expecting more. I think the ad at the end colored my feelings about the movie, too."<br /><br />Daughter: "Yeah. When we sat through the credits and it said 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' I though 'We stayed for that?'. But then the tag and the ad played and I thought 'ending with 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' would have been better. Or ending after the little punching bag scene. It wouldn't have been GOOD, but it would have been BETTER."<br /><br />The moral: Marvel Studios, which had been doing a great job building anticipation for The Avengers with the tag scenes after the credits which teased and enticed, went for the hard sell. I doubt that that hard sell is building audience because, as daughter said, "As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?" But the hard sell almost certainly lost the sale of four tickets to Captain America which daughter's friends had been interested in (and had both time and disposable income to spend for) because the Avengers ad disappointed her and unfavorably influenced her immediate response to the movie.<br /><br />Y'know, for good word of mouth you want to send people out on a high note, not feeling like they've been subject to a bait and switch; expecting the tradition of a cool teaser tag to continue in this movie but being delivered a tiny anemic tag followed by a routine and traditional ad.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Is Captain America: The First Avenger perfect?

Unfortunately, he is also exceptionally small, weak, and asthmatic. But, when a particular scientist takes note of his determination and amazing goodness, Steve is recruited to be the subject of a groundbreaking super-soldier experiment that transforms him into "Captain America: The First Avenger". From there on, we follow Captain Rogers as he struggles to take his fight from the home front propaganda circuit to the battle overseas, where he finds himself up against the original guinea pig of the super soldier syrum, the megalomaniacal Red Skull, leader of Hydra, an organization formerly tied to the Nazis, but now running purely under Red Skull's control.<br /><br />When I first went to see 2011's "Captain America: The First Avenger", I was pretty psyched. I've never been a reader of the comics, but I've always been a fan of the more famous superheroes due to being a huge cartoon and film fanatic. There is a derogatory term comic fans have for such screen-based superhero fans as myself, but I can't remember it just now (for the record, I have always read comics, just not superhero ones; I would like to catch up with them someday). I've been a huge fan of the Marvel films since they started up with the X-Men, Spider-Man, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises, and things really got kicked up a notch when "Iron Man" came along as the first in this line of films leading up to the currently in theaters "The Avengers".  All 5 preceding films and The Avengers itself have been excellent to varying degrees, but "Captain America", in my opinion, is one of the best. This is largely due to the excellent casting, performances, retro-styling, music, and great Joe Johnston direction (this is the man who gave us The Rocketeer, another great, retro superhero film, as well as other excellent works like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, which I still love to revisit on DVD). Now, when I first saw the film, I have to admit, I was more enthralled by the first two thirds than the final act. That's not to say there is anything wrong with that final act, but knowing only a limited amount about Captain America going into the film, both myself and my date expected it to be a bit more superhero-ish than it was. It was really more military offensive type stuff. Totally appropriate and well done, but for us, who are not war movie types, the story of Steve Rogers' transformation into Captain America and the relationships he makes were more fascinating. Rewatching the film more thoroughly on Blu-Ray, however, without being partially focused on how much my date was enjoying the film, ha, I find the later portion of the film much more engaging than I originally thought, and the whole thing is just a masterfully done piece of entertainment. Again, though my knowledge about the characters is limited, they seem wonderfully translated to the big screen. Nothing hokey looking about Red Skull at all, and Hugo Weaving is fantastic in the role! Chris Evans in the lead could not be better, either, and the special affects used to make him appear puny in the first part of the film are just amazing (they look much better in 2D than in 3D, as I remember seeing it on the big screen). Hayley Atwell does a wonderful job as Cap's love interest and military superior, Peggy Carter, and  it's great to see Tommy Lee Jones in the Marvel cast of characters here too, playing a hard (on the outside) Colonel as perfectly as you'd expect him to. There are plenty of other noteworthy cast members (always enjoy Toby Jones in films, and Stanley Tucci as well, he brings so much to this film), but it really is enough to say that everyone is excellent (and one of those Captain America chorus girls always catches my eye, but I won't take the space to try to specify which one).<br /><br />"Captain America" is a fantastic film, particularly because of the great job it does with the retro qualities and bringing such potentially campy characters to life without slipping into that hole even slightly. Most of the Avengers-fueling films have done a great job with that, and I hope D.C. takes a lesson from this and starts working towards a proper Justice League film (though I have great concern, as they have yet to prove they can get the balance just right, no matter how awesome the Nolan Bat films are). Oh, and on the subject, I just love how all these films have been tied together (who hasn't loved that?), with S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury, Stark Enterprises (Dominic Cooper is a hoot in this as a young Howard Stark, Iron Man's dad),  and Phil Coulson popping up everywhere. The Blu-Ray is a must have if you are a Marvel fan or even just a fan of Word War II era films. It is brilliant in both respects. The movie looks and sounds great, and it comes with a fine set of bonus features: The best of the Marvel One-Shot short films (A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer), a collection of featurettes and trailers, some deleted scenes, and a commentary by Director Joe Johnston, Director of Photography Shelly Johnson, and Editor Jeffrey Ford. The commentary is not the most fascinating one I've heard, but still good, and the featurettes are great as behind the scenes material. If you were a fan of "The Avengers" and plan to buy it when it comes out, you need to own this one too, and I certainly hope you've seen it by now. Don't forget to pick up Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk as well! That's the Edward Norton "Incredible Hulk", not the Eric Bana "Hulk", though I still say Bana's is a good film too, even if it's not AS good.<br /><br />PS: As a bit of extra, interesting info I just looked into, aside from animated works, Captain America has been onscreen in two 1979 TV movies (now on DVD), and on the big screen in a 1944 serial and a 1990 film not released in the States except on VHS. It seems the general consensus is that none of these are very good, though I still wanna see them and would love to own the serial if they'd ever release it. Anyway, thankfully, we now have a truly great Captain America film in "Captain America: The First Avenger", not to mention "The Avengers", and "Captain America 2" is scheduled for 2014.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>For a long time now, Captain America has been my favorite Marvel comics character. He's just awesome. He's been a little on the dark side, particularly during the 80's, when it was required that EVERY superhero comic went through a dark phase, and with some of the recent Brubaker era work, Steve Rogers has seen some serious stuff go down. What Joe Johnston did with this film, and how it not only differentiates itself from all of the other Marvel films (not just the Marvel Studios films, but all films based on Marvel characters), but also how well it works, is how unapologetically sincere and earnest it is.<br /><br />Without exception, all of the other Marvel-based films have had their fill of post-modern cynicism and self-referential humor, and I'm not really knocking it. For the most part, it's suited the films well, particularly X2 and SPIDER-MAN 2. But this is a film set in the 1940's, and it's about a young man who believes so much in the ideals of his country and who so badly wants to make a difference, he's willing to put his own life on the line to potentially change it.<br /><br />Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss "God" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either. There is great fun to be had with this film, and you gotta love the little RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK references in it. Also the cast in and of itself is quite good, particularly Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine. I honestly get choked up in the scene Erskine and Rogers share in the barracks the night before the experiment. It's my favorite scene of the film, because it gives you time to connect with the characters on an emotional level without any flash or gimmicks. This is pretty easily my favorite of the Marvel Studios films thus far...</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2011's "Captain America: First Avenger" does a nice job stitching together a superhero's World War Two origins with his future as a member of the present day Avengers, wrapped around a good period action movie with a great villain and some neat special effects.<br /><br />In 1942 Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (an earnest Chris Evans) is a under-sized but spunky straight-arrow kid who can't get into the military.  A quirky scientist named Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and gets him into a secret super-soldier experiment run by the gruff Colonel Philips (Tommy Lee Jones) and his lovely English spy assistant Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).  The experiment succeeds beyond expectations, turning Rogers into an incredibly strong, fit, and hyper-agile human being.  When a Nazi assassin kills Erskine, Rogers discovers what the audience already knows, that the Nazis have their own superhuman, the ruthless Red Skull (Hugo Weaving in snarling full Germanic mode) who has evil designs rivaling those of his boss, Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />Rogers is diverted to a war bonds drive as the costumed Captain America, but when he learns from Carter and Philips that his best buddy from Brooklyn is missing in action, Rogers gets into the war in a big way.  A series of action sequences set up a big finale against the Red Skull, with a bittersweet ending.  Fans are urged to hang through the credits for a nice teaser to the 2012 "Avengers" movie.<br /><br />With the exception of two brief scenes set in the future, "Captain America" manages a nice retro feel without drowning in nostalgia; even the high tech stuff looks period appropriate.  A brief romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter is handled with commendable and touching restraint.  A cameo by Samuel L. Jackson nicely frames the ending.  "Captain America: The First Avenger" is highly recommended to fans of the current series of Marvel Comic superhero movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A26IVJJTXOE85B.html">A26IVJJTXOE85B</a><br/><p>"What makes you so special?<br />Nothing. I'm just a kid from Brooklyn."<br /><br />After being deemed unfit for military service, Steve Rogers volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals.<br /><br />size="+2">REVIEW<br /><br />Slam-bam crackerjack origin story of the classic Marvel Comics' titular patriotic hero (with an amiable Chris Evans) AKA Steve Rogers, a 98 lb. scrawny kid from Brooklyn trying to do his gung-ho best for America during WWII, finding himself transformed into a pec-laden super soldier and facing the nefarious Nazi villain Johann Schmidt - AKA The Red Skull (a fierce steely-eyed Hugo Weaving) - hell bent on world domination. Along for the ride are the estimable Stanley Tucci as the German &eacute;migr&eacute; scientist Erskine whose top-secret serum gives the hero his juice; Tommy Lee Jones as crusty as ever as the taciturn Colonel Phillips and comely aide de camp Peggy Carter (the luscious Hayley Atwell), all provide fine ensemble work. Credit yeoman director Joe Johnston to let Christopher Markus' & Stephen McFeeley's adaption fly freely with a peppering of humor and pathos, great rousing score by veteran composer Alan Silvestri; ace sepia toned cinematography by Shelly Johnson, evoking the era perfectly; expert production design by Rick Heinrichs and great costumes by Anna B. Sheppard. The 3-D is pretty nifty with Cap's trusty shield thrown your way for good measure; Saturday matin&eacute;e vibe only adds to the movie magic.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Chris Evans becomes America's ultimate weapon against evil in the fun-filled superhero adventure Captain America: The First Avenger. In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discovered an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination. Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed romp. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />If you're a fan of comic book heroes or good old-fashioned adventure, then Captain America: The First Avenger is a highly recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The comic book blockbuster is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not the sharpest transfer of any Paramount releases, the movie still looks fantastic with fine detail and vivid colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA soundtrack delivers fine clarity, well balanced surround effects and good bass. The Blu-Ray features a nice variety of extras: audio commentary track with director Joe Johnston and production crew, five minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, the short film A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer, and six behind-the-scenes and in-depth comic book featurettes. Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger scores a "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>It is now obvious that when you want a super-hero film that takes place during World War II, the man to turn to is Joe Johnston.  First the highly underrated  "The Rocketeer" in the summer of 1991, and now the best super hero film of the summer of 2011.  Most people know the story of Steve Rogers, the 98 lb weakling turned into a  super-soldier by a scientific experiment.Created by the legendary Jack Kirby and Joe Simon before the U.S. officially entered the war, this film is fun and exciting from start to finish.  Chris Evans, the "Human Torch" from the Fantastic Four films is great both as 98 lb. Steve and super soldier Steve.  Tommy Lee Jones is a riot as a Pattonish Colonel that Captain America serves under.  British actress Hayley Atwell is beautiful in 1940's style make-up and hair design as the British officer assigned to the Captain America experiment who winds up being Steve's nominal love interest and Hugo Weaving is appropriately nasty as the Captain's nemesis, Red Skull.<br />As stated the action is fast and furious and the patriotic spirit of WW II is captured beautifully.  There is a nice patriotic musical number, "The Man with the Plan" starring the good Captain and a group of dancers probably representing the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, played during the Captain's war bonds tour.<br />The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are fine.  There are numerous not very long "making of" segments and one featuring the story of the Captain's origin.  There are deleted scenes and a much longer segment of the scene at the end where the Captain first meets Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury that is far better than the scene actually used in the film.  The music by Alan Silvestri is fine and the end-credits include patriotic posters, most of which were probably actually used during the war.  This just adds to the film's obviously patriotic feeling.<br />I looked forward more to "Green Lantern" last summer and greatly enjoyed it.  However I enjoyed this film more.  (If you enjoyed Director Johnston's work on this film, check out the previously mentioned "The Rocketeer"  I'm sure you will enjoy that one as well.)<br />And now we can look forward to the good Captain joining Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and others in the "Avengers" film next May.<br />And if you haven't already seen the film in the movies, stay to the absolute end of the credits for more on the above.</p></br><a href="../users/A34GZPHWYPSY2T.html">A34GZPHWYPSY2T</a><br/><p>Some films are mere commercials at the expense of fans and cinema; this turned out to be no exception. THE AVENGERS await us! (In theaters, 2012.) It is a pity, because I thought that as the 'final' word on Captain America movies, this would rise to the occasion. It's a bit ... meh. Recall that we waited years for this stupid thing to come to fruition - and this is what they give us.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER (2011) is one of those bizarre films that just doesn't seem destined for success, despite its production values. As the latest iteration (the list includes one film just a few years old) I ask: Is this overproduced? B-quality? A morbid fixation?<br /><br />Chris Evans is stunning in his beauty and manliness; why not present him in the best package available? So, it could be all or none of the abovementioned.<br /><br />Chris Evans is a comic-book-film regular. He's already done both the FANTASTIC FOUR films, PUSH, THE LOSERS, and SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. See my reviews for PUSH and PILGRIM. His involvement in THE AVENGERS will be his 9th or 10th involvement in a comic book project.<br /><br />Here we have the story of Capt. America, beginning with what looked to me like Chris Evans' head rotoscoped onto the body of a thin 16-year-old boy. This is to put across his short, '98-LBS.-weakling' status. More amazing overproduction: what I described is what they wanted to do; what they did instead was digitally shrink and shrivel poor Chris. Beyond that, it is one of the most singularly boring back stories I've ever seen - there's some humor in it to lighten the load. I leave the rest of this mostly silly, empty story for you to discover.<br /><br />I will confine my review to random observations:<br /><br />1. Hugo Weaving makes an excellent Red Skull, with a flawless German accent. (Yes, I know he pronounced a "v" word with a "w" sound. Germans occasionally do that.)<br /><br />2. The production is great.<br /><br />3. Hitler should not have been left out of this.<br /><br />4. Stan Lee's cameo: brilliant!<br /><br />5. Dominic Cooper (as Howard Stark) is CUTE. I loved him as Sky in MAMMA MIA. Much easier on the eyes than his cinematic son Robert Downey, Jr.<br /><br />6. This film made me wonder: is Captain America just a wee bit gay? Of course when I ask that, it is meant as a COMPLIMENT. He should have been gay. Another wasted opportunity. Small-minded, cowardly America!<br /><br />7. Don't hold your breath waiting for any really good lines, or intelligent ones.<br /><br />8. Toby Jones, who is used as a prop here, deserves better than this. In fact, so does Hugo Weaving. Lord bless them, they acted their hearts out, though!<br /><br />9. This film actually did answer a burning query I'd had: THE AVENGERS (is that the right title?) will be released in May 2012. All the dopey films, such as THOR, have ended by saying the main character will return in THE AVENGERS or THE JUSTICE LEAGUE or POSSIBLY GAY HUNKS IN TIGHTS or whatever it is. (Remember what I said about "gay".)<br /><br />10. Much as I love him, I am so tired of seeing Samuel L. Jackson popping into the post-credits as Nick Fury. OK, WE GET IT!!<br /><br />You can tell what a bore certain films are, when you consider the things crossing your mind as being much more fascinating than the film. Waiting for something, anything really, to happen - I just waited til the end of the film. In that, it matches the far better <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005H9B2CE">Thor</a> (see my review): just another stepping stone of a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>For me the long awaited film `Captain America: The First Avenger' about one of my favorite childhood comic book superheroes turned out to be a somewhat bittersweet experience. I probably shouldn't have expected anything less since ones expectations always surpass what one ultimately receives. You see I wanted nothing less than total immersion into an imaginary world where good and evil are plainly marked, heroes and villains wear memorable garb and the action and adventure comes at you non-stop.  Now that I think of it, a little bit of na?ve idealism, justified revenge and romance should be thrown in just to spice things up even more.<br /><br />From a technical point of view the film meets or excels all my expectations, I honestly can't find any fault with the final on-screen product. The visuals are superior, storyline solid, soundtrack memorable and the overall aura of a WWII America comingling with a surreal occult, Nazi universe is just short of miraculous. Yea, I guess I liked it. And what about the cast you ask? No problems here either. Who wouldn't love Chris Evans in the role of Captain America and immediately fall in love with Hayley Atwell in the role of the Captain's love interest Peggy Carter. Then of course there's the incredible Hugo Weaving in the role of Johann Schmidt (aka: Red Skull), Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (Iron Man's father). There's definitely loads of quality talent throughout.<br /><br />At this point you might be wondering why I described my initial viewing experience as "somewhat bittersweet" since I've had only positive things to say about the movie. The reason is that the film disappoints on one level which for me is the most important of all. I like to call it the repeatability factor. For me the most important quality in a film is its ability to instill within the viewer the unquenchable desire to watch it over and over again. It has to be able to `click' with the audience in such a way that always leaves one panting for yet another viewing. For me `Captain America: The First Avenger' just doesn't connect with me on that level. It does however cause me to look forward to the next screen appearance of the good Captain, maybe that was the filmmaker's prime intention all along.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LGT6UZL99IW1.html">A3LGT6UZL99IW1</a><br/><p>I skipped seeing this at the theaters - I thought i would be a waste of time.  Then I saw on one of those 5" seat-back screens on a flight to Denver. I was really surprised. The special effects, as expected, were amazing. The background of cap and his character development really added to the plot.  The Red Skull? Again, the movie pulled it off.<br /><br />People that give this movie 1 or 2 stars don't get it.  Some parts are supposed to be cheesy and over the top! Tying in Iron Man's dad and all the little tidbits that are planted throughout the movie also help build the background for th Avengers. Although I still think "Thor" was the worst movie in decades, there's even a major tie-in to Odin.<br /><br />This is a fun romp, does not take itself too seriously, and draws simple lines between good and evil.  The Red Skull is such a baddie, even the SS fears him! Cap is more American than the Man of Steel. Both owe their strength and powers to the same scientist, and even if they are not biologically related, they have a common genesis and "father."<br /><br />This really is a must see for action hero fans!</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>CAPTAIN AMERICA succeeds on so many levels that it is difficult to list them all.  But perhaps one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is that it treats the story in a time frame (WW II) that makes the 'supernatural heroes and villains' seem like operatically overstated normal people.  Opening the film with the superhero as a skinny nerdy but ethical and committed to do good kid and then see him transform into the hero of heroes who for once is doing good things because he cares about his fellowmen and his country makes for a feel good experience.  Dapple that with some old-fashioned 1940s Rockettes type dance sequences and keep the 'impossible gimmicks' down to a level of near credibility and you have a winner.<br /><br />Quick, borrowed plot outline: 'It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins.'  And that about says it all.<br /><br />Now, populate this story with a cast of first rate actors - Chris Evans as the magnificent Adonis built Steve Rogers/Captain America, Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine, Hayley Atwell as the sole 'love interest' Peggy Carter (Natalie Dormer does have a few seconds of screen time, too), Tommy Lee Jones as the military guy in charge, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best buddy, Dominic Cooper (a good guy), and a set of villains starting with Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Toby Jones as Dr.Zola, Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and then fill in the spare parts with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Michael Brandon, Martin Sherman  etc and the results are almost guaranteed to be good.<br /><br />Joe Johnston directs the film in a propulsive fashion that takes time out for some humanity amid all the military derring-do and allows just the right amount of sarcasm and humor (courtesy the screenplay by  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and it all comes out 'just swell'. A terrific night's entertainment! Grady Harp, October 11</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Captain America: The First Avenger, in my opinion, is this summer's top superhero movie. Heck, it might even be the best movie of 2011, period. Forget X-Men: First Class, Thor or Green Lantern. I'll have to say it, when noone else will, that this has to be Marvel's best, thus far.<br /><br />The movie, basically, tells the origin of how Cap came to be with him going up against The Red Skull(who himself is a super soldier). There's plenty of action and the performances of the cast are top-notch and believable. Chris Evans plays Cap much better than he did as The Human Torch in Fantastic Four(which I always questioned anyhow). He's definitely more physical in this movie, with all the action he does.<br /><br />However, where I find fault in the movie, The Red Skull doesn't get much screen time in the movie and-for that reason- he doesn't seem to be THAT serious of a threat to me. In the comics, The Red Skull is maniacal and is hellbent on threatening all humanity and making good on it. Like the original Batman movie(by Tim Burton), I was expecting the movie to portray the villain in as close a manner as he was in the comics but was disappointed that he wasn't. I can't find fault in Hugo Weaving, though. He did an excellent job as The Red Skull. Too, the conclusion of the movie seemed awkward and forced. I find fault in Director Joe Johnston, who seemed more concerned in laying down the origin and foundation for the upcoming Avengers movie. Not that that is a bad thing as it isn't but(..). With the sequel, however, he better 1-up everything...if he wants Cap to continue as a viable movie franchise. I suggest he looks to the Iron Man movies for inspiration or bow out while the gettin' is good and let someone else give it a shot. I know that's being critical but Cap deserves better.<br /><br />Other than that, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. One of Marvel's best, if not THE best.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) isn't exactly cut out for the Army: he's short, scrawny, and asthmatic.  In essence, he's the exact opposite of what Uncle Sam is looking for.  Yet Steve just can't wait to get over to Germany and kick some Nazi butt.  A scientist (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci) admires Rogers's ambition, as well as his good heart, and enlists him in a special Army program, against the wishes of Colonel Phillips (a deadpan Tommy Lee Jones).  Rogers come out of the experiment stronger and smoother, and teams up with a feisty female (tough-as-hell Hayley Atwell), his best bud (super-suave Sebastian Stan), and scientist Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper doing a dead-on Robert Downey Jr.) to take on the evil Johann Schmidt (the always-sinister Hugo Weaving) and his cohort (Toby Jones.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER has one solid thing going for it (no, not that god-awful title): its cast.  Everywhere is admirably cast, and while a few get underused (both Joneses, for example), and still others don't get much time to shine (Weaving is perfect when he's Schmidt, but as Red Skull, the special effects kind of get away from him), throughout these characters remain relatable and intriguing.  We genuinely root for Rogers, and though Captain America comes off as a bit of a d***** (rhymes with "whoosh"), that could be intentional.  Director Joe Johnston knows what he's doing, at least: crafting a middle-of-the-road superhero flick, something meant to tide us over until THE AVENGERS gets here (the set-up for the latter is actually interesting; not believable or original, but interesting).<br /><br />It seems I'm heaping a lot of criticism on the film.  Well, I am.  But note those 4 stars.  CAPTAIN AMERICA shouldn't be taken for anything more than it is.  It's not a great comic book film; merely a good one.  But hell, that's better than so many others out there.  If nothing else, it makes the 1940s look spectacular; kudos to Johnston for knowing how to make a period piece.  Watch this film if you're a fan of the comics, enjoy a good action/adventure yarn, or want to know all the pieces of the puzzle before seeing THE AVENGERS.  You won't be blown away, but you won't be bored, either.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>I will admit I'm not a Captain America fan but I wanted to see this movie the trailers & TV spots looked so good I saw it & I have to say it's a pretty solid movie. Directed by Joe Johnston he directed Honey I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji & Juraassic Park III. Stars Chris Evans as Steve Rodgers, Captain America, Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter & a small appearance by Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Story is Steve Rodgers wants to join The Army during World War II but a commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips gives him a hard time cause he thinks he's too small a docter named Abraham Erskine has created a super soldier serium. Steve Rodgers agrees to it so he can serve his country. An assassin kills Dr Erskine Peggy Carter tries to stop him but he flees outside Steve Rodgers chases him down pretty good scene he throws a kid in an ocean the boy tells Steve Rodgers it's ok I can swim. It has it's fun moments. The assassin commits suicide with a cyanide capsule before he can be questioned. Rodgers is given The Captain America costume & is sent to promote war bonds on some kind of U  S  O  tour he learns about has been captured fighting in the war. Colonel Phillips won't let him go but he disobey's Peggy Carter Howard Stark ( Tony Stark's father) sneak him in cool action scene where he rescues the soldiers. Your introduced to The Red Skull they have a fight better than any of the fights between Red Skull & Cap in the 1990 movie. Check out my review for Captain America 1990. Red Skull escapes Rodgers is feared M  I  A or  K  I  A but he returns & asks what his punishment is Colonel Phillips says nothing. There's another good action scene where Cap & the troops are owning N  a  z  i's. Well done scene on the train a buddy of Cap's falls to his death. Cap finds out about the base of operations of the Red Skull. You have a really good chase with Captain America on a motorcycle being chased by The Red Skull's goons. Cap is captured but US Forces bust in it's a pretty good finale. Captain America stops The Red Skull from destroying New York City. They have a pretty good fight scene. Cap can't land the plane or cause the weapons will go off he has a final conversation with Peggy Carter who has became a love intrest. he crashes in the Antartica. Steve Rodgers wakes up 70 years later in a 40's style hospital room in NYC. He feels something is wrong he flees outside Nick Fury which leads into The Avengers next year. I know I didn't explain the plot very good but I enjoyed Captain America it was slow & talky but it had enough action a lead that could carry a movie that it's a pretty solid movie Joe Johnston did a decent job directing. I didn't know a whole lot about Chris Evans but he did a good job. Hugo Weaving wasn't too bad he was a better Red Skull than Scott Paulin Weaving at least stayed in The Red Skull make up. Tommy Lee Jones wasn't given much to do but he did a good job. Hayley Atwell was pretty good. I like this movie wholehearted more than X Men First Class. I'll continue with my LW reviews soon.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FYOTC">October Sky</a>) and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPH2">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>) appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers storylines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> and the 1977 version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K4X5XA">Superman</a>.<br /><br />The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as &eacute;migr&eacute; military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy "Bucky" Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves "Bucky" but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.<br /><br />While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/"The Human Torch" in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTU">Fantastic Four</a> movies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341SC">Infamous</a>) as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore. No matter since the whole venture has obviously been designed as a springboard for 2012's "Avengers" sequel.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations for the Captain America movie. They're tried to adapt it twice before and... well, it was ridiculous. And I'm not just talking about the costume.<br /><br />So it came as a pleasant surprise that this latest comic book movie is not only better than the previous adaptations of Captain America's story, but is a robust, action-packed thriller in its own right. "Captain America: The First Avenger" has an earnest, idealistic tone mingled sometimes poignant realism -- exactly what it needs to have.<br /><br />The time: World War II. Scrawny asthmatic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) desperately wants to defend his country, but he's too puny to enter the army. Dr. Abraham Erskine sees the goodness and courage in Steve's heart, and enlists him in a top-secret experiment to create a super-soldier. Within minutes, Steve has superhuman strength, speed and big shiny muscles. HOORAY!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the army seems more interested in using the superpowered Captain America as a mascot than a fighter. Are you really surprised? This is the GOVERNMENT we're talking about.<br /><br />When Steve learns that his best buddy has been captured by the Nazis, he singlehandedly invades an enemy base and rescues dozens of soldiers. But this brings him to the attention of the Nazi super-science division Hydra, and its malevolent leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) -- who is the only other man as strong as Captain America.<br /><br />This summer has had a lot of comic book movies -- some were horribly disappointing ("Green Lantern," "Priest") and some were wonderful ("Thor"). I wasn't entirely sure which kind of movie "Captain America: The First Avenger" would be, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and solidly-plotted it was.<br /><br />There's also a lot of gritty, smoky action with flying bullets (and shields), fiery explosions, and speeding trains carrying machine-gun robots. But the writers don't neglect the human side of Captain America's story, whether it's his friendship with a fellow soldier or his budding romance with an icy sharpshooter.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is the MacGuffinness of the subplot MacGuffin, which really doesn't do anything except also be an unnecessary deus ex machina. Really, was there ANY reason for the Odin cube to be in this?<br /><br />As for the cast, they're uniformly solid. Chris Evans plays Steve as earnest, sweet and loyal, but with iron-clad determination and plenty of courage, and he's backed by excellent performances by Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and a steely-nerved sharpshooting Hayley Atwell. And Hugo Weaving is AWESOME -- this guy can play a Nazi in a red latex mask, and still come across as insanely scary.<br /><br />"Captain America: The First Avenger" is a lot like Captain America himself -- robust, action-packed, with a good earnest heart at its core. Thoroughly enjoyable.</p></br><a href="../users/AAZRWLML88IZK.html">AAZRWLML88IZK</a><br/><p>Captain America put the finishing touches on a triumphant summer for Marvel that included hits Thor and X-Men: First Class and successfully bridged the gap to next summer's much anticipated Avengers movie. Directed by Joe Johnston and starring a surprisingly heroic Chris Evans in the title role, Captain America plays out the origin story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny but determined military recruit who signs up for a secret super-soldier program, only to be faced by the threat of the evil HYDRA organization and its leader Red Skull, another recipient of the super-soldier treatment. Though I was initially a bit unsure what exactly to expect from the film, I enjoyed it. It's solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment with pulpy action, a retro vibe, and some fine acting performances. Even if Captain America wasn't your favorite comic hero, chances are you'll have a pretty good time with this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>On its surface, the Captain America character is pretty ridiculous. The name alone is rife with World War II jingoism that seems out of place in today's considerably more cynical and global world.  Director Joe Johnston smartly embraced the silliness that is a superhero with a giant "A" on his forehead through a mix of digital wizardry, American montages, and good old fashioned Nazi-punching.<br /><br />Steve Rogers (who first appears as a digitally-altered version of Chris Evans) is an asthmatic wimp with a hero's heart.  He can't fight for beans and he's been rejected from the Army four times, but that doesn't stop him.  Rogers may not be popular with the ladies but he's a moral man, a theme that will carry throughout the film. It's his bright soul that attracts former German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to Rogers for a top-secret super-soldier project.<br /><br />That project, initiated by Erskine under the funding of insane Nazi Johann Schmidt (played with feral menace by Hugo Weaving), is a super-soldier serum.  It has one side-effect however - whoever is injected with the glowing blue stuff gains super strength and endurance but also reveals his true self. Schmidt's face peels off, thus his moniker The Red Skull.  Once Rogers becomes the hero he always knew he could be, Captain America: The First Avenger really gets rolling.<br /><br />Until then, the scrawny, CGI-diminished form of Rogers is distracting.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but Evans just doesn't look right. Evans' booming voice betrays the deeply powerful body that it belongs to. But once Rogers is in Evan's true form, he is a wonder to behold.  The film literally hits the ground running once Rogers becomes Captain America.<br /><br />Lurking around the edges of Captain America is the idea of the ubermensch or superman.  It's interesting that the film completely avoids this topic; Erskine's genetic research was a real focus for both the German and U.S. governments.  Good old Cap is the Nazi ideal realized, but the script never goes there.<br /><br />The Nazi obsession with the reclamation of a Slavic identity is also missing.  In part, this was the motivation behind the Ahhenerbe quest for ancient artifacts proving German supremacy - the same quests that were made legendary in the Indiana Jones series.  There is mention of Yggdrasil, the Nordic tree of life, and the Tesseract, which fortunately is never actually named in the film. This cube, a boundless source of energy, funds all sorts of Schmidt's projects and it's not long before he turns against his Nazi overseers to launch his own splinter organization, HYDRA.<br /><br />Captain America is basically a guy juiced up on super steroids that runs around with a bull's-eye shield, and the film cleverly capitalizes on the larger-than-life comic book without disrespecting the pulp feel of an ugly war.  Rogers transforms from super-soldier to poster boy for America, and his ridiculous outfit comes complete with dancing girls.  This plays well in the States until Rogers is sent to the front lines to cheer up the troops, where he's jeered as a "chorus girl."<br /><br />The film never lets us forget this: superheroes are ridiculous enough in civilian life, but in war they're a dangerous liability.  Rogers has to prove himself every day to crusty Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, with some of the funniest lines in the film) and the beautiful-but-tough British Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter).  Atwell's burgeoning romance with Evans centers the film; they're less star-crossed lovers than two kids just trying to go out on a first date in a war-torn world.<br /><br />Captain America, being a war film, has heaping measures of American optimism and personal loss.  The optimism is embodied by the Howard Hughes-like Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing Tony Stark's father), who is the host of the World's Fair and inventor of Rogers' outfit.  When Rogers' best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is captured by HYDRA, it's propels Captain America to risk everything to rescue him. During that rescue mission Rogers gets a glimpse of a map with the locations of HYDRA's bases, leading to the final conflict as Captain America and his soldier buddies take down the wicked organization, one technologically-advanced Nazi at a time.<br /><br />It's hard not to love Captain America.  Ever respectful of its roots, it harks back to a time when America believed in the promise that anyone could be a hero at a time when the world desperately needed heroes.  Although it glosses over some rough edges, this is a film made by someone who clearly loved war films.  You can see the fingerprints of its pulp ancestors on everything from the lensing to the musical score to the brilliantly executed credits.  Captain America may be something of an anachronism in today's world, but this film does his reputation justice as a war hero.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DDPQ9342UNMY.html">A3DDPQ9342UNMY</a><br/><p>There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in "Captain America" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his "Captain America," before and after the transformation.<br /><br />As summer blockbusters go, "Captain America" ranks with one of the best. Within the scope of little more than two hours it sets up the Marvel comic with a flair and style worthy of more important material, succeeding in recreating the WWII era (from a World's Fair with art deco touches to the USO entertainments), with costumes, sets and characters all firmly set in traditional 1940s style.<br /><br />And the cast is up to bringing all this material to life. HUGO WEAVER has a fine time as the crazed mastermind out to ruthlessly destroy his enemies. He's a sort of Conrad Veidt villain on steroids. TOMMY LEE JONES as a gruff colonel with a heart of gold, HAYLEY ATWELL as a pretty soldier who knows how to throw a punch, and SEBASTIAN STAN as our hero's best buddy--all of them shine in colorful supporting roles. DOMINIC COOPER as Howard Stark and STANLEY TUCCI as Dr. Erskine bring additional humor and grace to their parts.<br /><br />Joe Johnston's direction gives the light touch where needed (especially during the USO shows where Captain America is being used as a poster boy before the troops), but never falters during the explosive action scenes.<br /><br />Likewise, Alan Silvestri's jaunty score never fails to support the on screen antics with some flag-waving patriotism suitable for the movie's thematics, and assures the viewer from the start that all he has to do is sit back and enjoy a well-delivered popcorn package of thrills and laughs.<br /><br />Recommended for all Marvel fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ICW5OUWX2A2V.html">A2ICW5OUWX2A2V</a><br/><p>Marvel seems to be resembling Pixar as of late, considering how they've made so many high quality movies, and success after success at the box office, with a seemingly unbroken string of great superhero films, from Iron Man, to the Incredible Hulk, and Thor.  One would think after a while, their luck would run out, and a sub-par film would be break the chain of hits.  Thankfully, with the release of, "Captain America:  The First Avenger," that string remains unbroken.<br /><br />"Captain America:  The First Avenger," tells the story of Steve Rogers, a scrawny weakling desperate to get into World War Two, despite his tiny form and long list of health problems.  Feeling left out when his friends and his country head off to war, he's offered the chance to join a program that may help him become a powerful super soldier, and help change the course of the war.  Jumping at the task, he quickly finds himself confronting what may be the Nazi's most powerful figure, and weapons that could end the war, and not in favor of the allies.<br /><br />What makes "Captain America" so great is that it knows exactly what it sets out to be:  A homage to the serials of the 30's and 40's, in the vein of Raiders of the Lost Ark (there's even a clever nod to it early on).  Combining elements of war films, science fiction, and pulp fiction, "Captain America" is a near perfect blend of all three, with great action scenes, an awesome retro feel, and a nice sense of humor.  There's nary a weak note to be found here, as the cast is strong all throughout, with Chris Evans portraying a hero who has no ego, and only wants to do the right thing, and Hugo Weaving proving once more that he can play bad guys like no one else, embodying the scientific madness of the Red Skull.  To top it off, the visuals and production values are top notch throughout, and the film really does feel like a comic book come to life, with each new action sequence outdoing the last.<br /><br />If I had to nitpick, the only real flaw in the film is a a romance subplot between Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter that I felt was unnecessary.  But even then, the film seems to realize the same thing, as it doesn't go very far, a fact that I'm glad for.  "Captain America" focuses on constantly providing thrills and adventure, and succeeds wonderfully.  While it does feel a bit long, I didn't mind in the slightest.  If anything, I wanted to see even more of Captain America's world, as this is a film filled with optimism, where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's no grim and grittiness that so often drenches today's heroes.<br /><br />I could keep raving about the action, the costumes, the humor, but I'll leave it at this:  "Captain America" is now one of my favorite superhero films.  It knows what it wants to do, doesn't deviate from the path, brings all of it's elements together, and provides a light hearted escapism that the world so desperately needs.  If Marvel can keep making movies this entertaining, I can't wait to see what they have down the road!</p></br><a href="../users/A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE.html">A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE</a><br/><p>If you loved Captain America comics, you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Firstly think 'the curious case of Benjamin Button'. This is how I saw the transition of Steve Rogers (a very small skinny guy) into Captain America - a fairly large muscular guy. Obviously a lot of computer work went on here. Although all very well done, there was still something slightly disturbing about this transition.<br /><br />The anomaly that sort of diminished this movie is that it is set in the 1940s, yet the technology seems to be on-par, or exceeds what we have today - ray guns that can vaporize an entire human in a single shot. This begs the question, why more like Captain America were not made, and how come over a period of 70 years we have not been able to perfect and replicate this kind of technology.<br /><br />Putting aside these issues... The acting and the movie as a whole is entertaining. Hugo Weaving puts on an excellent performance as the bad guy. Another weird thing about this movie was the idea of the US Army using their most combat ready soldier for musicals and cheap entertainment. Very strange ... but I suppose they had to have some filler to make up the time, so that it would be a full movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I want to say this.  I am firmly convinced that Chris Evans IS a super hero.  Sadly, he isn't much of an actor, and it shows in this film.  He just isn't convincing as a person, constantly displaced from the people around him (especially the stunning Hayley Atwell, who can actually act her butt off here).  Honestly though, Chris Evans is the least of this film's problems.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' suffers from trying to do too much without placing it firmly in focus.  It opens VERY strong, establishing young sickly Steve Rogers' backstory very well.  As an origin story, this film gets it and it works it beautifully.  This is aided by the beautiful production design, recreating an era and a place that consumes every frame.  From the costumes to the set pieces to the brilliantly cloaked cinematography, `Captain America' promises to be amazing.  Sadly, after Steve Rogers makes his transformation and his first heroic act the film loses its footing.  This comes from rapid segments that feel like an excuse to show pointless action sequences.  There is no meat in these scenes.  Secondly, the reveal of Hugo Weaving's villain seems kind of anticlimactic (why does he wait so long to show his comrades something he doesn't seem so intent of hiding anyways).  All of these elements create a second half that drags pretty badly.  The film wares out its welcome before it is half over.<br /><br />Still, some of the scenes are expertly crafted, and the technical elements at play here are nicely composed (making Chris Evans a scrawny little twig of a man is not only mind-blowing but believable) but in the end, this is a film that only `half' works.  I just wish they had stopped while they were ahead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1.html">A1KZQ5DIX0YUE1</a><br/><p>I love comics. Always have, always will. I doubt that anyone could beat me in Batman trivia. Or Green Lantern. Or Swamp Thing. Anything Darkhawk.... Okay, so DH is Marvel. Anyway. What I have always loved in comics is man's ability to overcome enormous tribulations without relying on so called 'super powers'. Knowing this, you can imagine how bad I wanted to see Captain America. Despite the fact that I am a DC fanboy.<br /><br />Marvel's latest addition to what will be the Avenger's film is a knock out of the park. The sense of the Cap before the super-soldier program is amazing. There's this 80-pound version of Chris Evans and he's the best. Loyal and morally strong, with a love of the American ideals. The transformation into a super soldier is amazing; he is shown 'over-using' his new body and all but trips himself up because he actually realize he's running faster on foot than the cars drive around him. His innocent patriotism becomes an unstoppable force, and it makes you believe that one man can indeed make a difference.<br /><br />I have to give a nod to Alan Silvestri's score for the film. It strikes a strong central theme that fits the balance between patriotism and honest strength and it sounds authentic to the mid-40's. Well done, good sir.<br /><br />Cinematography is marvelous. Together with the stages and authentic vehicles and storefronts, we actually feel that we've been engaged with WWII hanging over our heads.<br /><br />The BD is just as awe-inspiring. We have the Holy Grail of sound - a 7.1 Sound track; it's only the 2nd I've ever seen. We get several featurettes, all showing various technical tid-bits and it is not the same point-counting drivel some folk have thrown together on DVD or BD. They manage to provide the tech talk with their own appreciation of the source material. There's a short film featuring Agent Coulson which demands automatic laughter at the most unsuspected details. Worth the $25 of the Blu-Ray 2-disc. It's gonna be a classic, mark my words.<br /><br />I'm watching the film now with the commentary. Already it seems less 'stuffy' than most; a mixture of technical talk with fond memories.  >>>EDIT: the commentary is actually pretty fun stuff, pointing out Easter eggs and hinting towards things to come. Alas, they provided no commentary on the post-credits scene. Not that they needed to; it pretty much speaks for itself.>>><br /><br />But the best part is, we have seen some bit of what Marvel has in store for us. The Avenger's film is going to break a few benchmarks in modern film making. DC may have the Animated features each a tight and solid entry for the DCU, but beyond the Batman franchise, and possibly Green Lantern, DC just doesn't match the steam behind Marvel's power. I'm still holding out for a Flash feature film.<br /><br />I'll probably catch some flames from this review. But I have to be honest and objectionable. Marvel is reminding me of a time in my youth when I didn't know DC Comics existed. And the Avengers were one of my favourite titles way back then. I'm glad to see anything positive come from anything comic-book related. Makes the years of living as a geek somewhat tolerable. Almost.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>"There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the Ogpu [State Police in the USSR] and the atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker." (C. S. Lewis "On Three Ways of Writing For Children," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IUSIYM">On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature</a>, 39)<br /><br />The best part of this movie, hands down, is Steve Rodgers BEFORE the vita-ray treatment.<br /><br />Consider the 90-pound asthmatic Steve Rodgers. He is persistent. He wishes to honor the life and death of his father. And he understands appropriate deception. This is understandable and forgivable, considering his chicken-little body, and his lion's heart. These are all heroic qualities.<br /><br />Then consider two of the three tests he passes before the vita-ray/super soldier serum treatment. The first is intelligence. He solves the flag-pole problem and gets the girl. Rodgers is not "scientific smart" like Reed Richards (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I9U8NW">Fantastic Four</a>) or Howard and Tony Stark (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UYV08E">Iron Man 2 (Single-Disc Edition)</a>). But he is shrewd, wily, and clever, like Samson (the riddles in Judges 14) and Hercules (the Twelve Labors were tests of brains as well as brawn). And he needed to pass "the brains" test before he became the New Hercules for the New World.<br /><br />The second test clinched the deal. Our 90-pound weakling was the first on the hand grenade. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). And his self-sacrifice was so instinctive! No thought, no doubt, no "refusal of the call," just quick action in the right direction.<br /><br />The last test was the one Samson failed, the test of chastity in the face of a buxom vixen. Forget Camelot's "Fie on Goodness," this is vintage Tennyson: "My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure." (Galahad).<br /><br />And I applaud  Marvel for both understanding their own property and also understanding the nature of heroism. Considering the abomination (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LM1456">The Incredible Hulk</a>) (pun intended) that have been many of the previous hero movies (they still can't get the Punisher right, nor Galactus for that matter), this one was a shot in the arm. And a vita-ray treatment, too.<br /><br />We have all become Captain America.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This long awaited film had been in development hell since 1997 which included lawsuit delays and a recent strike by the Writer's Guild of America. Chris Evans does a commendable job of playing the humble, heroic lad who will be turned into Captain America. Stanley Tucci gets one of the best speeches even though his time in the picture is limited. Hayley Atwell is one of the better love interests of the various Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is under used. The reference to MI6 was in correct as they were known as the SIS during WWII. Small nitpicking there, I admit.<br /><br />There's a good deal of pulpy action and overall the story is good even if not great nor superlative. This film cost $140M to make and yielded a tad over $365M at the box office. A sequel is expected but THE AVENGERS (which will appear many of the Marvel Heroes) is going to be released beforehand. Critics were generally positive about this film. This picture was nominated for a number of awards and the 2011 Scream Awards gave it Best Superhero.

Five exams in five different cities. Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file. Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis? Steve Rogers: Is this a test? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes. Steve Rogers: I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from. Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? /// [to Steve] Dr. Abraham Erskine: So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi's invaded was their own.

[he waves his hand] Dr. Abraham Erskine: And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, you...he says you will us strong. Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for a cult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. [flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine's formula and injects himself with it] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man. Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength.

First he took his turn as Johnny Storm in two Fantastic Four films and now he's emerged as Captain America. (Supposedly he's contracted to "appear" in six movies)<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with this movie is the director. The only Joe Johnston movie I enjoyed was the perfect Rocketeer. I thought Jurassic Park 3 was a franchise-killer, Hildalgo - bleh. And nevermind The Wolfman.<br /><br />I thought it was great to do a period film when showing the origins of Captain America and staying with the original comics. However I found the pacing to be a bit off. I was actually bored with most of this movie. Every character seemed very bland. Even the fantastic Hugo Weaving was demoted to half-a-second moments.<br /><br />While I did enjoy this movie more than Thor, I'm not sure what I should expect from Marvel and their super hero movies anymore. If this was a tease of what's to come in The Avengers, I shudder.<br /><br />On the plus side, this does equal summer fun. There isn't anything questionable as far as content. I was just hoping for more super in this hero. Let's hope we'll get that in The Avengers and the next Captain movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A12IRGQLFE4EBA.html">A12IRGQLFE4EBA</a><br/><p>While I didn't expect much based on what has come out of Hollywood calling itself superhero movies in the last 10 years, I was still disappointed in how flat Captain America was.  Chris Evans made an excellent Captain America (IMHO), but the supporting cast came up too short.  I expected more from Tommy Lee Jones and way more from Hugo Weaving.  I love just about every character Hugo Weaving has ever played in his career, but his portrayal of the villain bored me to tears.  Maybe it was the directing?  Even the feel of the portrayal of the Nazis were off.  They got the look right, but that's about it.  I kept thinking that someone like Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have done a much better job at making this movie pop.<br /><br />Captain America had potential, but it seemed like the powers that be were so intent on just getting it out in theatres to start working on an Avenger movie, that they kind of just threw it together and got lucky with choosing Chris Evans as the lead.  It's not the worst superhero movie I've seen (Punisher would be that), but like the majority of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past decade, it had nowhere near the depth and intensity that the new Batman movies (with Christian Bale) had nor did it have the fresh, fun, thrill and charm of the Superman movies (with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman) that came out in the late 70s.  Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America.... everyone else?  Not so much.  I thought the movie was a bit boring and for a superhero movie that is not good!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Although Hollywood has jumped on the superhero bandwagon which has made some flukes Captain America is a Very Good and Patriotic Movie(Minus FDR who was aBiggovtLiberalFascist himself)and Evans(Not another Teen Movie) as Cap,but oh well.<br />The Red Skull is wickedly Cool,the action is good and while the part with Bucky which I should not mention is not true to the Comic it is nonetheless a decent film adaptation with some flaws but worth watching.Besides Cap Fighting Hydra and As in the Comics the Germans it would have been nice in both or perhaps in the next installment(highly doubt it) he would fight RedFascism(Communism/socialism) but being Cap is Apolitical,The Special Features is great with the Creator of Cap(God Rest his Soul) give a interview at 90 years old and some other great features,If your A Fan of Cap you need to see the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Maybe it's the fact that we've had way way way way too many superhero movies lately, or maybe it's the fact that all of these superhero movies we have had lately are ALL THE SAME!!  Sure they're different characters, with different ways they are created, born or transformed, but for godsakes, I can only count 2 that stepped away from the formulaic same old same old screenplay: Dark Knight & X:Men First Class.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA is an interesting film, don't get me wrong, and I'm almost certainly gonna buy the BLu-ray when it's available, but it has pretty much the exact same storyline as Spiderman 1-3, Iron Man 1-2, Batman Begins, Green Lantern etc. etc. etc. Superhero starts out a normal guy, becomes a superhero, learns he has skills, practices his skills, bad guy threatens to destroy the world and Superhero fights bad guy.<br /><br />I know. I know. That's comics. Like I said, maybe it's the oversaturation of these movies on the cinemaplexes. You may ask, what do you want? Well, I want the unpredictablility of DARK KNIGHT. I want the emotions of X:Men First Class. I want to feel my guy tensed up in knots like it did when Sebastian Shaw comes to convince the mutant students to join him, or when the Joker put the two people Batman cared about in different warehouses and you actually... wait for it... wait for it... FELT SOMETHING.<br /><br />I wanted to feel something. I wanted to feel some emotions, rather than just saying, that was cool looking. CAPTAIN AMERICA is cool looking, and for what it is, it's a good movie. It's just, in my opinion, another cookie-cutter superhero movie to throw into the pile with the rest of the superhero movies. Unfortunately, the pile of unique superhero movies is much much much much smaller.</p></br><a href="../users/A3QH6BEY6RYQR0.html">A3QH6BEY6RYQR0</a><br/><p>A scrawny young man wants to enlist in the army to fight WWII, but is turned away.

Tommy Lee Jones is good as always, as the officer leading the band of soldiers. He brings humor even as his character is playing it straight.

Very entertaining and informative.<br />Negatives:<br />Some background on the energy source would have made the story more coherent.<br />More of an explanation as to how all the  high tech gadgetry came about. A cop out to comic book fans who don't like to think while being entertained.<br />A more developed plot sequence on how the various HYDRA labs were to be attacked rather than just show up out of nowhere and start firing away. Again bowing to a certain comic book audience demographic.<br />Roles and acting such as Jones' character shows he tediously stuck in an actor's rut. Usual token roles again for Asians and blacks and the overdone female role portrayed by Atwell as romantic interest and tough girl just seemed tossed into the plot to satisfy both the male comic book audience and to widen the demographic viewer profile all for remunerative reasons.<br />Positives:<br />Evans portrayal of the Cap was good, but I'm not sure which body was his and which was morphed in.<br />Fairly good quality and not yet overly overboard dominance in the use of CGI - just enough to create a good fantasy atmosphere. They did seem to borrow props and scenes from The Thing and Sky Captain ... amongst others.<br />The story tie in with WWII was integrated with appropriate humor and where appropriate, seriousness. Even though there's boxes of old comics to draw from I think the script people did a good job although less of a comic book feel would have helped the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XT8AJB7S9JJG.html">A1XT8AJB7S9JJG</a><br/><p>"Our goal is to create the greatest army in history.

In my opinion the best superhero movie of the year was "X-Men : First Class", and if this came out first I may have liked this more. The one thing I really liked about this movie is that it was more like "X-Men" then "Green Lantern" in the fact that it was more about the story then effects. That did help the movie, as well as the casting. Overall, this is a good movie but with the hype, as well as the other comic book movies released lately, I was expecting more.

I suspect they will continue to get made until we stop going to see them.  The Marvel cast of superheroes eventually becomes a gang called The Avengers.  This film is about a 1945 young man who wants to get into the fight against Hitler and the Nazis.  Because he is small and frail, he is always rejected by the Army.  He is being observed however, by members of a small group of scientific government types as a subject for an experiment to make a super soldier.  He is Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and becomes The Chosen One (he he).<br /><br />The experiment works but soon after, everything is destroyed by a Nazi infiltrator.  We get a high dose of wizardry in terms of exotic weapons, especially from an ultra Nazi called Red Skull.  Yep, he has one too.  I really liked that.  Assuming you can get past the re-creation of WW II, "CA" has much to offer.  First, the retro look of the film is a welcome departure from the more futuristic style of most films of this ilk.  Like the "X-Men" prequel of a few months ago, the acting is very good.  Chris Evans in particular is well suited to this role.  He gives Rogers/Capt. America a nice guy/Superman image, complete with a sense of humor.  Does this film rank as one of the best of the genre?  Well, not quite.  It's better than the "Greens" but not as good as "Thor" or the aforementioned "X-Men".<br /><br />1-2-12: Blu ray update - The DTS HD Master Audio soundtrack is excellent with window rattling explosions but also subtle enough to show off the score from Alan Silvestri.  This 2-D version is also visually excellent.  The package comes with numerous featurettes, commentary tracks, deleted scenes and 5 trailers.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>Captain America saves America (of course) AND this movie! Chris Evans makes Captain America a down-to-earth, refreshingly humble superhero. He starts as a scary skinny recruit, but becomes a super soldier. To his chagrin, he is used for patriotic propaganda. He fights back, and fights, FOR REAL. Tommy Lee Jones stars as his mentor. Dominic Cooper of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJFO">The History Boys</a> again stars in a period piece, though this time it's as Captain America's sidekick rather than a British schoolboy. Hugo Weaving, who was the gentle&brave elf lord Elrond (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)</a>), relishes being the villainous head of HYDRA, Red Skull. When he removes his face a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630512762X">Face/Off</a> it's a truly creepy moment, showing how Red Skull has lost his humanity in his quest for power. Samuel L. Jackson also makes an appearance in the twist ending, making it like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXQA">Unbreakable (Two-Disc Vista Series)</a>. "Captain America: First Avenger" goes for an over-the-top retro look, an exaggerated WWII era.<br /><br />This would be an otherwise routine action film with explosions&gunfights, if it weren't for the humility and hunkiness of Chris Evans. He's likeable as Captain America. "Captain America" is all for the American way!

Casting directors, just because an alleged actor or actress has a nice body, it doesn't mean he or she can carry a movie, even a special effects extravaganza like this one!<br /><br />Only the ever resourceful Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci make much of an impression here, and that would be -- look what good actors will do for a paycheck...<br /><br />The director Joe Johnston must take a large part of the blame for the lack of suspense here.  I liked his "Wolfman" and "Honey I Shrunk the Kids", but this film must take its place among his growing list of misses.<br /><br />Really, American film makers are going to have to find more worthy sources of inspiration than Comicon -- or the mortgages on their McMansions.<br /><br />Finally this DVD appears to be devoid of any extras, but in this case that's probably not an issue.  I did wonder, however, how CGI managed to make such a transformation in Evans' body from 90-pound weakling to hulk.  I am guessing the color green played a role.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>He was always Capt. America, at least in spirit.

It resonates with the little kid in anyone that wants to be looked up to.<br /><br />Then, it takes place during WWII, the last war that Americans generally supported. It becomes clear early on that the war isn't against Germans as Germans, but against a specific group out for world domination - something that appeals to today's more carefully targeted kind of enmity. From there, it moves forward in an utterly earnest way, as if no one had ever heard of irony. Or much in the way of humor, either - after the wise-cracking Tony Stark of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA">Iron Man</a>, this comes across a bit bland. Tommy Lee Jones does what he can to pull this one along, but the movie's sodden weight seems too much even for him.<br /><br />On the whole, it's a more than adequate comic movie, but not one I'll be coming back to.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the releast to theaters</p></br><a href="../users/A3FY3H6F4249E0.html">A3FY3H6F4249E0</a><br/><p>I was pretty happy with this 2011 Marvel Comics release in the theaters.  It was no award winner--just good entertainment and on an incredibly humid 105 degree day in Baltimore (yuk).  I don't remember any foul language either.  It was a war movie, so people got shot and killed everywhere, but they did not focus on blood and guts, thank God!  I saw it in 3D, but I don't believe the 3D really added much.<br /><br />Steve Rogers, from Brooklyn NY, is a guy who wants to join the military and serve his country so bad he can taste it.  It is March, 1942, so WWII is going strong.  Steve is pretty small and "puny," and gets rejected 4F every time he applies.  He is in the right place at the right time when a scientist overhears him about to apply again and decides Steve is perfect for a secret government experiment.  Steve is classified 1A by Dr Abraham, given a special serum injection, and he becomes a lean-mean (muscular) fighting machine.  His metabolism is about 4 times faster than other guys, his muscles are expanded at the cellular level, and he can run fast as heck, jump on top of taxis, and stuff like that.  We are told early on that the puny guy was selected because he had a good heart and the serum amplifies the inner characteristics a person already has.  Initially, Steve becomes part of a War Bond show for the army, but as you would have guessed anyway, soon finds a way to get in the war.<br /><br />The evil force is Nazi Johann Schmidt (aka Red Skull), who is looking for a way to win the war for Germany and Herr Hitler.  Tommy Lee Jones is a military commander, also involved in the secret project, and as always, is exceptionally good in his role.  Federal Agent Peggy provides an Army Girl presence, quite capable of kicking butt. There is also a pleasing innocence about Steve's character.<br /><br />Lots of action--It is probably more of a "guy" movie (generally) because it is primarily a war movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ALWB64XOXNMDP.html">ALWB64XOXNMDP</a><br/><p>Captain America was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby back in the 1940's.  This was one creation that didn't involve Stan Lee.  Stan was responsible for the Captain's revival back in the mid- 1960's.  Ironically, a  1990 feature film version of the Captain prominently displayed Lee as the creator.<br /><br />Captain America was one of the first to show the element of genetic engineering or "super serum".  The movie shows character actor Stanley Tucci as the German scientist who recruits Steve (Chris Evans) Rodgers for his experiment. The scientist wants a humble man who "knows the value of strength".  He wants a man who knows failure and weakness. He doesn't want an ego maniac who could turn into another Adolph.<br /><br />On the other side of the globe, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)is preparing an attack on the U.S.A. and overthrowing Hitler.  The Cosmic Cube, which is a device in Stan Lee's 1960's Captain America revival, holds the key to his power.<br /><br />The movie places all it's elements together at a fast pace. We even get to see Bucky, Cap's partner. Although in this version he doesn't have the costume.  The Howling Commandos make their appearance.  Sans Nick Fury in this movie, because he's alive in the 21st  Century.  Neal  McDonough has a few moments as the ever popular "Dum, Dum Doogan, Fury's burly and  mustached right hand man. If you're a fan of the comics; you are in for a special treat.<br /><br />That's the advantage of Marvel producing this film. I would have to say out of all the super hero movies this summer, this is the best of them all. You won't be disappointed if you're a die hard fan like myself.  The directors commentary provides lots of unknown information on how the film was made. You get to hear the director, Joe Johnston  talk about how the movie was developed from the ground up.  This has to be the most plausible version of the character I have seen.<br /><br />There were four attempts to bring the Captain to the screen. In the 1940's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown. That version brought him into modern times. However the script was very slow to develop.  The 1990 feature film starred Matt Salinger  son of the famous author) as Captain America.  It also featured Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in supporting roles.  That too was also painfully slow to watch.  What the current producers see was the fact that fans want to see action on the screen. Not two hours of talking heads.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>Some of the special effects in this movie are incredible, some of the best I have ever seen.

The last stand-alone film from Marvel Studios to set up next year's mega-super hero opus The Avengers, Captain America stars Chris Evans (who funny enough played The Human Torch in the two forgettable Fantastic Four films) as the titular star-spangled hero, who takes on the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) during World War II in an effort to stop his nefarious scheme and his evil Hydra organization.  What makes Captain America so enjoyable is the fact that director Joe Johnston (The Wolfman, The Rocketeer) injects so much heart and soul into the otherwise pedestrian script, and the fact that Evans himself is surprisingly enjoyable in the title role without falling into the kind of cockiness/self-referential performance that often accompanies his roles.  Hugo Weaving is great, and Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as well, but in the end we all know what this really is meant for: The Avengers.  And by the time the end credits roll, you'll be salivating for it like never before.  All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is a supremely enjoyable and just plain awesome superhero film that is more than worth your time and attention, and it does a fantastic job at making us all forget about that early 90s schlock-fest with the rubber-earred suit.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>Not as blatantly, ridiculously dumb as "Thor," but -- from start-to-finish -- completely synthetic and artificial and, to me, deeply disappointing.<br /><br />As a fan of "The Rocketeer" I was excited that "Cap" would have the same director, but Joe Johnson brings along absolutely none of the spontaneity, breakneck fun or lurking danger of the former film. "Cap" is "The Rocketeer" completely drained of its essence. The structure is uncertain, the pacing sloppy, the action dull, the logic constantly questionable.<br /><br />This is a movie just going through the motions, but at the same time it feels like a four-hour film trimmed down to two. Motivations are unclear, questions go unanswered, introductions are set up and then never made. For example: Why have The Howling Commandos appear at all if you're not going to identify them as a unit?<br /><br />Probably the biggest missed opportunity is the handling of Steve Rogers, who -- thanks to a super-serum and some "Vita-Ray" exposure -- goes from 96 pound F-4 weakling to a strapping, totally cut uber-soldier. His "before" version is whiny, passive aggressive and seems a bit of a masochist (taking brutal beatings from bullies, diving onto runaway grenades); his "after" version never really seems the least bit disoriented, conflicted or even very excited by his transformation. And most importantly we never learn exactly why Rogers was so gung ho to fight in the first place, even though there are countless opportunities for a quick monologue that might explain his passion.<br /><br />In an effort to seem important, "Captain America" clutters itself with World War II-era iconography, but its "chase-fight-chase-fight-repeat" train of thought comes from a cut-rate videogame.</p></br><a href="../users/A6X6LNZO1C3EZ.html">A6X6LNZO1C3EZ</a><br/><p>I have to admit a lot of mixed feelings on this movie.  Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, and a few others I recognized in this film notwithstanding, somehow this movie cheapens the above and beyond super heroism of everyday men and women in the armed forces serving in hostile zones of combat.  Maybe it was different in WWI or WWII, but beginning with the Korean war, this country has had trouble welcoming their heroes returning from war - especially from Vietnam and since that time.  These days there are no ticker tape parades and cheering crowds who respect and honor the men and women who have watched their fellow soldiers die on the battle field.  There is widespread unemployment, a nation near bankruptcy, and a misery index as high or higher than when Jimmy Carter was president.  And this film won't make you feel good about being given a 4F rating by the Selective Service System registration office, if you honestly wanted to serve in the military.  So it is hard for me to rally behind a film that suggests our nation's finest require a super-chemistry enhanced hero to inspire them to enthusiastically face the enemy.  Especially if the country you're fighting in hates you being there.  But never mind all that, it's just a movie.  A movie about how drugs can make women fall in love with you, taking drugs and experimenting with drugs can make men who hate you willing to follow you as their leader and fight by your side for whatever mission you personally undertake, and taking drugs and experimenting with drugs will let you live over a hundred years and never physically age a single day.  The message in this film is that a sublevel romance that never finds fruition is enough to give somebody the inspiration to accomplish anything even far above and beyond human ability - no wait, that was the drugs, nevermind.  This movie has very little gore, predominantly has a lot of gun violence (more of what today's America desperately needs), a little bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.  It's a PG-13 film, and for having a 140 million dollar budget, you'd think the writers and producers would require a little bit more out of the director and editor.  Dud, flop, fail, fizzle, flummox, lay an egg, loser, turkey, and weenie.  Not even a good chic flick.  I wouldn't give this away to somebody I hated.  Bonfire fodder.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>While some of the Marvel superhero films don't do a great job of adhering to the source material, Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) does better than most, as it succeeds in capturing to a large degree, the spirit of the comics which saw the genesis of the character during World War II.  The film features Captain America battling his greatest and most ruthless adversary, Red Skull, the personification of Nazi cunning and fighting spirit, and the leader of the Third Reich's secret weapons branch.<br /><br />In superhero movies, setup and character origins typically eat up a nice chunk of time in the initial film.  That is somewhat true here, but the process is streamlined by Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the future Captain America, not having a complicated backstory, and the action being set in the already familiar setting of World War II.<br /><br />The year is 1942, and a patriotic Steve Rogers has once again been classified 4F, and rejected by the army.  Recruited by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), the scrawny Rogers finds himself in uniform, as a volunteer in a top secret experimental program to develop an enhanced fighting man.  The process is successful, as Rogers becomes a muscular specimen, but when Erskine is assassinated, the secret of the process is lost.<br /><br />Instead of an army of supersoldiers, there is just Rogers, and as the costumed "Captain America" he is used mainly as a public relations tool for the red, white, and blue.  Under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), Rogers is in Italy entertaining the troops, when he learns that his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) has been reported missing, while battling German forces led by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).  With the help of British intelligence agent Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), Rogers embarks on an unauthorized rescue mission.<br /><br />Dressed as Captain America, Rogers frees Barnes and other American soldiers being held prisoner.  Schmidt the leader of a force of specially trained HYDRA agents, reveals himself as Red Skull, a man who has aspirations that exceed even Hitler's.  Rogers puts together a strike force, and sets out to destroy all of HYDRA's forces, leading to a dramatic final battle with Red Skull, and setting the stage for Captain America's appearance in The Avengers (2012).<br /><br />With World War II as the canvas against which the action takes place, Captain America: The First Avenger successfully captures some of the spirit of the comics, while adding a ton of high-tech enhancements.  There isn't much time devoted to character development, as director  Joe Johnson focuses on keeping things moving, and making the second half of this darkly atmospheric fantasy, as action oriented as possible.<br /><br />Although the war becomes a complete parody, borrowing from films like Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America is still one of the better Marvel adaptations to date.  With a rating of 4.5 stars, don't miss this one while it is available on Amazon Prime.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>"Captain America" is a well-crated redux of clich&eacute;s, and in this, it's the superhero version of "American Beauty." If you like "Captain America" -- and given its acting and production values, you probably will - it's because you've seen it all before somewhere else. You can tick off the standards: outcast superhero, Steve Rogers (who's basically the kid that gets sand kicked in his face in those comic book Charles Atlas ads), eccentric but well-meaning scientist with the German-Jewish accent (Albert Einstein, Hans Zarkhov, etc.), sadistic Nazi bastard (take your pick, Indiana Jones movies, The Phantom, The Rocketeer, The Marathon Man, etc.). It's full of romanticized 40s nostalgia, so much so that everyone, even the baddies, is apple-cheeked and there's no need to put minorities in it unless they accidentally walk by in the background. Captain America himself is Hitler's wet dream in the sense that our buff, blond and blue-eyed Olympian is essentially everything the Germans were after, the master race but on our side, by golly, and since Hitler's evil and we're not, it's all okay (and he's got that nifty, muted American flag costume to remind us). None of this is a problem necessarily, but to enjoy "Captain America," you have to be prepared for it. If not, you'll find it pure corn and not a little propagandistic, albeit with a slick retro quality that might make you want to believe the world was ever actually like this. If your politics run toward accusing Hollywood of liberalism, you'll find this movie difficult to fit into that viewpoint.  There's not much to say about the plot.  There's an evil Nazi running around with his own agenda and a wholesome hero who must stop him.  That's about it.  The rest is a well-photographed exercise in flag waving. Chris Evans, who looks like a less creepy version of Ryan Gosling, is fine in the limited role, and his female handler, played by Hayley Atwell, is basically today's version of Emma Peel. Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, and Tommy Lee Jones are quite competent. The film reminded me of Disney's "The Rocketeer," which wasn't surprising given that both were directed by Joe Johnston, who gives the whole thing a Steven Spielberg gloss when he was in his prime. Though I had to fight to stay awake in parts and was a little distracted, I'm not sure that was entirely the movie's fault, but I will say watching it was the equivalent of eating a Big Mac on a full stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley<br />Atwell star in this 2011 action film based on the marvel<br />comics.

Now, let me clarify this now, I've never read a CA comic, don't know how closely this (movie) relates to those (comics). Okay, moving on! I like the story, and the setting. Interesting to see a superhero WWII setting. The characters were good, and the choices of actors and actresses for each role was perfect. I also like how they gave a nod to Iron Man (was that his {Iron Man's} dad, or granddad, as a character?). The ending was perfect to tie in to the endings of certain other Marvel movies (Iron Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor), setting up The Avengers perfectly. Good movie that I recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br></body></html>

This movie is worth buying if not renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EFS5PV3HOFDI.html">A1EFS5PV3HOFDI</a><br/><p>Anchorman is definatly not for everybody's tastes. Rauncy, wild and completely out of control, it's nothing like Elf, nor half the innocent romance of Bewitched. Rather, Will Ferrell parades, struts and otherwise flaunts himself at the idea of being serious. Thought to be immature, this comedy can only be enjoyed if you are prepared not to sit down to a very intelligent and sophisticated movie. If you already know that, you're now ready to watch this movie.<br /><br />Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, a anchorman who is insanely vain, and loved by the people.Its more of a boys club in the news room as his three other buddys Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd,Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and Champ Kind( David Koechner) do everything except blatantly make fun of the rest of their coworkers. All is fun and games until the boss hires Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate.) Its open war between the sexes, a war which becomes even more heated when the unfortunate Veronica finds herself the sole object of adorations from the infatuated Ron Burgandy. But love will have its speed bumps, and this perfect couple is no exception. What happens is comic magic.<br /><br />With Cameos from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Danny Trejo, Jack Black, and Vince Vaugn there is no stopping the hilarity. If you love Will Ferrell, then I highly recommend this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>This movie was a pure joy.  Its sidesplitting funny from start to finish.  Will Ferrell is in top form, Christina Applegate is equally as funny, and the whole supporting cast is funnier than 4 seasons of SNL and MadTV combined.  Ron is like a younger Ted Baxter (you know, from the Mary Tyler Moore show) but on acid.  Good ole Ted certainly couldn't have gotten away with things as Ron did.  Great cameos flesh out the movie and are numberous.  This is one dern good movie.  Now, fair warnng:  IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO LAUGH THEN THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.  More comedies should be this funny.  Kinda braindead but still SO funny!  Sit back, relax and DON'T think so much.  Enjoy...</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>The script may have have the imprateur of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay but I also sense the influence of Judd Apatow, Todd Phillips, and David Wain.  Take it a step further Steve Carrell gained prominence on "The Daily Show" and Christina Applegate cut her bones on "Married With Children".  This is a terrific Seventies satire capturing the mores and fashion of that time.  The film makes a point of highlighting institutionalized sexism but oddly glosses over racism but thats a minor quibble.  This may be Ferrell's greatest screen creation with his Burgundy an amalgam of hair, mustache, and pomposity.  Thought it was a nice touch naming his dog Baxter, a reference to the idiot news anchor, Ted Baxter, played by the late, great Ted Knight from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show".  Equally funny is his rival from another station played by Vince Vaughn is named Wes Mantooth which recalls the bland actor from "Emergency", Randolph Mantooth.  I saw this in the theatre in 2004 but it left no impression on me.  Watching it now I appreciate it as a milestone in modern comedy.  Time has caught up with Ron Burgundy and is very kind.</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I finally got to see this Will Ferrell vehicle.  Parts of the film were just hilarious, parts not so much, some gross (well, more than some, but we're talking Will Ferrel here), and some tender and romantic (just kidding!).<br /><br />With over 400 reviews here, I'm not going to re-state the plot or comment on much other than my over-all reaction to the film.  First of all, if you're a Ferrell fan, this is a must-see.  Even if you're not, it's worth the price of admission.  Ferrell is his typical over-grown teenager (again) in Anchorman.  He plays a man-child who is vain, dumb, clueless, awkward, and somewhat sentimental.  He loves his dog, his own mug, his friends, and not much else.<br /><br />There are fights, sing-alongs, dog punting, dog survival, bikers, women-libbers, homoeroticism, cute girls, sterile apartments, teleprompters, and a zoo.<br /><br />Mildly recommended.  If the film were edited down a bit to get rid of some of the more stupid scenes (arms getting ripped off, a wild melee between news crews), this would be a better film.  Ferrell is terrifically talented, but only in a set way.  One can compare Ferrell with another SNL alumnus, Bill Murray.  Murray shows range in films such as 'The Razor's Edge' and 'Lost in Translation'.  One cannot imagine Ferrell pulling off either of those films.<br /><br />Three-and-a-half stars for 'Anchorman'.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a man among men. He's got it all. Good looks, smooth moves, great suits, and the best job in the world as the number one lead Anchorman in San Diego. He even has his own entourage that consists of his fellow newsmen. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the on-scene reporter, as well as a self-proclaimed ladies man. Champ Kind (David Koechner) is the sports analyst and almost a `much too close' friend of Ron's. Then there is Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the weatherman and, well, lets just say `not so smart' guy of the group. They are kings of the news in San Diego, until a Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) shows up. As Veronica is trying to work her way into the camera lens, the boys are trying to keep her out. They are doing quite well, until one day when Ron has a freak accident, which lets Veronica have center stage.<br /><br />The first time I saw this was with two of my best friends when I was driving through Texas and stopped for a few days of having fun in San Antonio. For most of the first half of the movie, I was barely laughing, and almost not enjoying the movie. And then about 35% to 50% into the movie, it clicked. I started to get the humor. And then the movie became hysterical. I was in tears on some parts. Now after the DVD came out, I even loved the movie more. From beginning to end, I find the whole movie hilarious. I honestly can understand why some might really hate this movie. The jokes can be very dumb at times. But once you find the humor in how the jokes are delivered, it becomes golden. The things I find myself laughing at the most are how the lines are delivered, or how some of the words are annunciated. The over the top acting also helps out a lot. It's just VERY silly. The improv lines are great also. When Ron and Veronica are smiling on camera and talking, the sound is muted for the audience in the movie while the credits role, but we as the viewers get to hear them hate on each other such as Ron saying "I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well. Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and even Seth Rogen (not a funny part at all really, but it's funny seeing him just be a plain old camera man with like 2 lines).<br /><br />In the end, if you love this kind of silly comedy, then definitely own this. It never gets old.<br /><br />P.S. - I own the double disk feature, and have yet to watch "the adventures of Ron Burgundy continue" feature yet. It's supposedly a ton of extra stuff they cut out from the movie. Enough to make a completely different movie. I fast forwarded through it enough to see there is like a bank heist and everything. So I'll give it a look-see sometime soon once I get the urge to watch some more Ron Burgundy. Then I'll just update my review with its review.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UQIIJ2CD8REE.html">A2UQIIJ2CD8REE</a><br/><p>In the 1970's, the television news scene was a man's world, and the local news anchor was king! In San Diego, that king was Ron Burgundy, a ladies' man, man's man, man about town. Ron loved his city, and his city loved him. This all changed when the first female anchor came onto the scene. When Ron met Veronica Corningstone, it was love at first sight, but his male-chauvinist, co-worker pals, Champ Kind of Sports, on-the-scene reporter Brian Fantana, and mentally challenged weatherman Brick, weren't ready to give up their friend, or their newsroom, without a fight. When Ron and Veronica's fledgling relationship suddenly goes sour as a result of her promotion to a lead anchor, the boys are happy again to have Ron back as their leader, until Veronica exacts her revenge and turns the entire city against him!<br /><br />While his best film thus far would have to be the charming, stylish, instant Christmas classic "Elf," "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" may always be considered the quintessential Will Ferrell comedy. Hilariously silly 99.9% of the time and recapturing the tackiness of the '70s throughout, if you love comedy and Will Ferrell, this film is a must have. The ensemble cast features some of the best comedic actors of the 21st century in both major and minor roles, from Steve Carell as Brick Tamland to Fred Willard as newsroom chief Ed Harkin; from Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone to Jack Black as a very angry biker! The humor is random and unpredictable, the performances are spot on, the "Afternoon Delight" scene is unforgettably funny, and yes, there's a story too. Good stuff all around!<br /><br />The Unrated, Widescreen DVD doesn't disappoint much in the extras department either. Granted, the DVD commentary is mostly a waste of time. It's basically just Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay cracking wise about everything BUT the movie, which they hardly even talk about, along with some other cast members (a few simply call in) and some completely unrelated guests. The commentary is wacky, but while I usually love Will Ferrell's comedic antics, it's mostly not as funny as it tries to be. There's a ton of other stuff too though. We get a Ron Burgundy interview with Rebecca Romijn Stamos from MTV, a wealth of deleted scenes and outtakes, a hilarious "Afternoon Delight" music video, an interview with Ron, a making-of featurette, an ESPN audition, and a ton of text bios and production notes! My only regret is not getting the release packed with "Wake Up, Ron Burgundy," which is supposedly like having an entire second Ron Burgundy movie to enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>This is a movie I could watch once a week and always laugh out loud (as well as always replay the dog over the bridge scene for extra laughs). There are more outrageously bizarre and side-splittingly funny moments in this movie than any I can think of, and after four plus decades on planet earth (you stay classy...), I've seen a lot. The entire cast is brilliant, the satire gleefully over-the-top, and the plot, well, are you really curious about a plot? Who cares? Check your prudishness at the door and get ready to choke on your popcorn and spit-take your beverage as this movie will make you laugh your breathtaking hiney off. This is one of those Caddyshack-type movies that will have you dropping lines from it and getting the knowing winks and follow-up lines from those who have seen it as well. It is the gift of laughter to get for yourself or those who have a sense of humor that does not involve gentle mews of joy but loud guffaws of bombastic pleasure. If you don't find at least a half dozen solid belly laughs in this movie, then I don't think I want to know what you find funny.<br />By the way, the special features are funny, too, and numerous. Good stuff all the way around. Get it, laugh, and make your world a funnier place.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>Stupid comedy is an art.<br /><br />Like with any art, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.... On the top end of the stupid comedy scale, we have films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the Wedding Singer, Spaceballs and Mystery Men. On the other end of the scale, we have all of the Rob Schneider movies and a few of the Pauly Shore ones. Dodgeball is closer to the bottom, There's Something About Mary is closer to the top.<br /><br />Anchorman is right about in the middle. The humor works... sometimes... like the gangfight scene. That's pretty funny. But sometimes Anchorman falls flat, like the "jazz flute" sequence. The jazz flute bit is kind of lame.<br /><br />People who don't usually like stupid comedy probably won't like Anchorman much at all; the humor relies on Ferrell's mugging and obnoxious overacting. Some of the casting is good, some misses the mark--Steve Carell is comedy gold, and usually Fred Willard is, too, but he looks a bit miscast in his role, here. The cameos are awesome, bringing in Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and others.<br /><br />Overall, this is an inconsistent film. Some people are going to absolutely love it, others are going to hate it. Me? I was a little disappointed, but it's still an okay movie. It's not Ferrell's best work--he's better in Zoolander, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and the Producers, for instance--but he does a fine job nonetheless. Among stupid comedies, it's of a comfortable, middle quality.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy," may be an "Adam McKay film," but this is Will Farrell's beast from start to finish.  Arguably the best performer ever on "Saturday Night Live," Farrell has made a career out of bringing hilariously ridiculous characters alive.  Ron Burgundy is another such creation.<br /><br />Set in the 1970's, in an America on the cusp of new "fads" like feminism, jogging, and environmental awareness, "Anchorman" charts the fall and redemption of Ron Burgundy, San Diego's top anchorman.  As the title character, Farrell brings his unique brand of hilarious sincerity to one of his most befuddled characters.  Ask yourself -- could any actor bring more to the line, "San Diego, as everyone knows, was founded by Germans in 1904"?  If you love Will Farrell, you are sure to like, and quite possibly love "Anchorman."<br /><br />Burgundy and his "crack news team," which includes Paul Rudd as the horny roving reporter Brian Fontana and Steve Carell ("The Office") as weatherman Brick Tamland -- and Carell plumbs the depths of how low the bar is set for weathermen in San Diego, rule San Diego's TV screens.  But trouble hits paradise when Burgundy's boss Ed Harkin (played by the always perfect Fred Willard -- although he's given surprisingly little to do) is instructed by "corporate" to bring on . . . gasp! . . . a woman!  Yes, feminism hits the newsroom in the beautiful form of Ms. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, proving that she is worthy of overcoming her "Married With Children" legacy).  Can Burgundy and his pals tolerate this desecration of the male bastion that is the newsroom?  How can Burgundy reconcile his professional pride with his raging lust for the delectable Ms. Corningstone?  Can Burgundy woo the resisting Ms. Corningstone with his fiery jazz flute performance?  Of such false drama is hilarious comedy made.<br /><br />One can easily imagine Will Farrell and his buddies cranking this movie idea out over a long weekend of beer and pizza.  Many of the jokes are indeed inspired.  Look for some hilarious references to "West Side Story" as the news teams from different networks get together to "rumble."  Vince Vaughan leads the second-tier news team with comic timing that proves that "Swingers" was no fluke.  (From this insanely funny idea we get wonderful cameos from Luke Wilson as the anchor from the third-tier newsroom, from Tim Robbins as the anchor from PBS (of course), and from Ben Stiller as the anchor from the Spanish newschannel.  Genius!)  Who else could conjure up a cologne named "Sex Panther" that "smells like pure gasoline"?  Who else could dream up a beloved pooch who wears a head-gear retainer to bed and speaks with bears?  The comic talent at work here is dazzling (look for another inspired cameo from Jack Black, by the way).<br /><br />Still, at the end of the day, "Anchorman" leaves one unsatisfied.  Perhaps its because the movie is so darn short -- even the "uncut, unrated" version clocks in at barely over 90 minutes, and that's with filler.  True, a lean, mean comedy is better than a bloated gasbag, but this movie is so lean that it borders on emaciated.  Or perhaps it's because the cast of the movie is so darn good that the expectations can't be met.  Whatever the reason, "Anchorman" does not rise to the level of beloved comedies.<br /><br />Full disclosure -- I was on the floor laughing when Vince Vaughan's character was introduced as "Wes Mantooth," which is the name of one of my best childhood friends.  To hear that name attached to that character had me in stitches.<br /><br />Another point -- this is the "unrated uncut" version of the movie, but unlike so many other comedies, "unrated and uncut" does not translate into "more T&A."  I am not a prude by any means, but too many "comedies" use nudity to cover up the fact that the movie just ain't that funny.  "Anchorman" is refreshingly nudity-free, choosing to go for real laughs rather than blatant titilation.  The language, while coarse, also generally refrains from profanity, with one funny exception.<br /><br />Check out "Anchorman" for some huge, if isolated laughs.  I cannot say this is a "must for the film library," but you should definitely see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>When I first saw this in the movies I laughed but I thought it sucked but the other night I saw it was on HBO and thought I would give it a second chance and I did and well this time I liked it and decided to buy the unrated edition and yeah i did and i'm happy I did.

When men were men, and they thought women were too.  Now, that is not true.  It is interesting however that, although portrayed in a comedic manner, gender segregation was a component of early broadcasting.  History aside, Anchorman was creative, albeit not the wittiest piece of work in film.  Enjoyable, maybe if only for the first viewing, this film still has some shine.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell's star is on the rise. With hits like &quot;Elf&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot;, and now &quot;Anchorman&quot; under his belt he seems to have made a life for himself beyond &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, the number one news anchor in San Diego in the 1970s, who is somewhat of a living legend in the area. He is the face that everyone looks to for the news. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), a woman with high aspitations, and a determination that set off a war between herself and Burgundy. She wasnt to be an anchor, and he does not see how a woman can do what he does. When fate steps in, and Bergundy finds himself late for a broadcast, he finds his world turned upside down as Corningstone fills in for him...and does well.<br /><br /> &quot;Anchorman&quot; is a very satirical look at the news world of the 1970s as women are trying to break into a man's game. Will Ferrell disappears into Ron Burgundy, and carries the movie completely. The supporting case (along with a few surprise cameos) lend their own quirkyness to the supporting characters. If the previews looked funny to you, you will enjoy this movie. There are plenty more laughs to be found...and be sure to stay through the credits!</p></br><a href="../users/AX9J0U8J6XTCY.html">AX9J0U8J6XTCY</a><br/><p>oh the joy, the outrageous laughter, the sheer fun to be had over and over with will ferrell's latest smash hit comedy! it was made to order for him, as well as the rest of the cast. ms. applegate really holds her own here as straightman to will ferrell's anchorman. the pandemonium that occurs from here on is non stop hilarity-sometimes a bit vulgar and crude, but oh the sheer fun you will have if you let loose a bit. the entire theatre screamed with glee thru out, as i did again with my new dvd. get it and have a real ball new years eve-right in your own home.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy" is funny!

What could have been another unmitigated disaster turned out to be a very funny story about 1970's sexism and news teams.<br /><br />Veronica Corningstone takes a new position with the Channel 4 news team and finds herself surrounding by egotistical male chauvinists. Not that she is any damsel in distress, as she can more than handle her own and she has plenty of ambition to go with it. The love thing between her and the lead anchor, Ron Burgundy, make things all the more interesting.<br /><br />With cameo parts played by Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and a minor role with Vince Vaughn, this movie certainly gave the story a good shot. There is a lot of "silly" humour, but it is all very good. The comedy covers a variety of bases from the purely ridiculous to the situational and more. It is a diverse movie in this sense.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a whole lot, and have seen it a few times now. Although not something you would want to overdo, it is an enjoyable laugh at when "times were changing".</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy<br /><br />Released on July 9, 2004<br /><br />Written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay<br /><br />Directed by Adam McKay<br /><br />Anchorman is a very funny movie, but it is inconsistent in tone. They do anything for a laugh, and ad libbing was encouraged by director Adam McKay, but it often veers off track, and the story is pretty stupid. It just doesn't make sense, half the time. That being said, it has some of the funniest scenes ever filmed, and I'm sure there were a lot of laughs, on screen and off.<br /><br />It begins with the following narration, spoken by announcer Bill Lawson: "There was a time, a time before cable. When the local anchorman reigned supreme. When people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls."<br /><br />There is the movie in a nutshell. It is very funny in spurts, but spins out of control just as often. The problem is that the funniest parts could also be the out of control ones. Will Ferrell is excellent as Ron Burgundy, all empty headed and puffed up with self importance. There are great scenes of the news team doing the purposeful walk, wearing 70s style suits, it is so right on and true to the period.<br /><br />Another problem is the theme of a woman breaking into the male dominated world of TV News. It tries to be too PC, and that gets in the way of the comedy. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't know if she wants to play it as a professional or a conniving slattern. Does she loath Ron Burgundy or love him? If she is as intelligent as she appears, then how could she love someone as ignorant as Burgundy? Should the movie mock her, or should it just mock Ron and the other male chauvinists?<br /><br />I like the part where Ron Burgundy comes home and talks to his dog, Baxter. Also outstanding was the scene where Ron Burgundy jams at a jazz club with his flute. There is a running gag where the other news teams rumble, and one of them gets his arm ripped off. Later, when everyone is trying to cover the Panda being born at the San Diego Zoo, he is shown with one arm. I just wish they could have shown as much care for the other plot lines that led nowhere.<br /><br />I want to emphasize that I think this is a very funny movie, and I recommend it, but it gets silly at times. There are some very funny people in it. Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Fred Armisen, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Owen Wilson, and Chris Parnell, as well as co-anchors Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate. Four of them have double L's in their names.<br /><br />Good Night, San Diego, Stay Classy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AP6H48QHX8BR.html">A3AP6H48QHX8BR</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is simply one of the finest comic actors of his generation. His comedic style isn't suddle at all and he is so clumsy and akward on screen you can't help but LOVE him... Former SNL star turn superstar Ferrell has made a name for himself as the comedic willing to go the extra mile for another slapstick joke- Anchorman- written and I believed produced by Ferrell is no differant.<br /><br />Ever absurd incident is hillarous and although the movie itself is absurdity of situations from Ferrell playing the jazz flute, to having his dog drop-kicked off the side of a bridge because of an anger motorist, to having an all out battle between all the news stations involving a man on being on fire and a grenade... Ferrell's amazing absurdity of events seem to work to create a movie that my ten year-old brother and I LOVE to watch...It's the perfect choice on family movie night for us because both the kids and adults seem to enjoy it together...<br /><br />It's movie about a time when everyone believed what they heard on TV and only men where allowed to read the news. Arrogant and over the top Ron Burgandy(Will Ferrell) the man about town is suddenly threatened when Veronica Cornerstone(Christina Applegate) takes the position as co-anchor. The two mutual hate eachother- Ron who reads anything off the telepromter is uncermoniasly fired when Veronica puts "Go F*** yourself San Diego" during a broadcast. Ron's life halts and with a absurd amount of ridicolous issues the story ends with a "life-changing" happy ending.<br /><br />Although corny, and slap-sticky the movie is still enjoyable because of it's all-star cast and the amazing comic genius of Will Ferrell who gives his best performance(even better then Old School).<br /><br />The kids and adults in our family seem to enjoy it on family movie night making it a good movie to rent or own in your collection!</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>It occured to me after watching this film that Will Farrell is probably a great comedian because he says SO much that some of it is bound to be funny.  It is then up to his directors and editors to trim out what doesn't work and leave in the good parts.  For the most part, they succeed in Anchorman - the Legend of Ron Burgandy.  Both Farrell and his male castmates embody their stereotypical parts.  The actors bring enough new life to the stereotypes that we immediately recognise the characters, while still being able to surprise and entertain (rather than bore) us.  Christina Applegate has the unenviable task of being the "straight man," but pulls it off and even gets some great comedic moments herself.  She is, I think, the key to making the film work - a central realism around which the waves of absurdity crash - much like Graham Chapman in the Monty Python movies.<br /><br />No, I don't mean to say that Anchorman is a ground-breaking or paradigm-shifting film - it is not Monty Python, Airplane, or There's Something About Mary.  At best, it's a minor comedy, but there are more laughs in it than in the entire Adam Sandler catalogue.  Or, for that matter, in all of Will Ferrell's SNL skits (the Jeopardy parodies excepted, of course).  The story: The four stooges of Channel 4's news team - the top 6-o'clock news show in San Diego! - are threatened when the station manager chooses to hire a woman reporter.  Instead of the expected story arc - they try to make her life intolerable but she eventually wins them over with her pluck - we get a weird conglomeration (and, oddly, more realistic) of macho chest-thumping and competition over who can bed her.  It is not until she has the audacity to fill in for Ron as anchor when he is unavoidably detained by a littering incident that the animosity breaks out into full-scale gender war.<br /><br />For someone to appreciate the film from a review like this normally requires quoting jokes.  The great thing about the jokes in this film is that the funniest ones are not one-liners appropriate for TV spots.  Instead, they are longer, situation-driven banter that builds.  When the film strays from this pattern into going for the cheap laugh (and, I suspect, ad libs), the film slows into inanity (like some of Farrell's other pictures e.g. Old School).<br /><br />The director's comentary included on this "unrated" DVD version seems to confirm the point.  Because it is unrated, commentators Farrell and director McKay think it would be funny to see who can come up with the most offensive words to say to see if they get beeped.  That in itself might be a little funny or at least educational if there was some buildup.  Instead they go on for 10 minutes in a game of 1-upmanship that is not funny because they are, in fact, beeped, and because it goes on and on (and on and on..... you get the idea).  The other special features are more enjoyable, including some out-takes (but not too many of the type where the actors start laughing, thank goodness) and a long list of deleted and/or alternate scenes.  There are some interesting choices in there, and a discussion on why certain performances were used instead of others would have made an interesting DVD commentary.  Too bad we get the swear factory instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>This is a scattershot comedy that ended up frustrating me. The parts that were funny, had me laughing until I couldn't breathe and the parts that didn't work had me looking at my watch waiting for them to move on. The basics are Will Ferrell plays a 70s era local news anchorman who is very popular and works and parties with his crew: weatherman, sports reporter and field reporter. Christina Applegate arrives as a beautiful young reporter trying to move in on what has been a male-only broadcast. This was a lot like a Monty Python movie in that it seemed more like a group of sketches loosely tied together to try to make a coherent movie. In this case when it works it's extremely funny and clever. But when it doesn't, it's just stupid.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ.html">A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ</a><br/><p>I watched this movie with really no expectations, but I did laugh a lot. Will Ferrell is super funny as Ron Burgandy, a hip, kinda (sexist) clueless, immature local newsguy, and Christina Applegate really brings Veronica Corningstone to life, she knows what she wants and is tired of being belittled and given fluff assignments in the age of women's lib. Trouble is, she falls in love with Ron and their rivalry on-air ends up costing him his job. There are lots of funny moments, a lot at the expense of dimwitted weather guy Brick (Steve Carell from the Daily Show) and the big street throwdown with the different newcasters from the area (including Vince Vaughn as Ron Burgandy's rival, Ben Stiller as the Latin newsguy and Tim Robbins representin' PBS).</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell's first big comedy after Elf won't rake in the dollars that his holiday heartwarmer did, nor is it likely to go over as well with critics, who were able to forgive Elf's schmaltzy ending due to the imaginative gags. Anchorman is a pretty funny comedy, although there is nothing much to occupy our minds as we wait for the next funny joke. The movie takes a shotgun approach, spraying us liberally with jokes to see what sticks, and enough did that I was happy walking out of the theater. The storyline is pretty simple-Ron Burgundy is a bigshot local tv anchorman in the seventies, who is so entrenched in the way that things are that he can't even conceive of an aspiring female anchor as a threat. He quickly falls in love with said aspirant Applegate, but they break up as soon as her encroachment on his professional turf is too much to ignore. Happy ending, blah blah blah.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This limited edition version which is only at sale at a certain retail chain  and here evidently features a interesting box with a 'diary' of Ron Burgundy and trading cards. The package has two blu ray discs with a unrated  version of the movie and a made for dvd flick as well. I don't know if they will release this modern classic comedy on a regular blu ray without the extra film but certainly the packaging will be different after this edition sells out. Making it a collectors edition. This imo is a modern classic comedy, the movie just does everything right , it's funny and has great acting from everyone involved and it features the golden age of news anchorpeople the seventies, that was the decade when women really made inroads into the field and laid the groundwork for all the top anchors that would follow. The seventies too are always a great decade to have a comedy in, it's the predigital age (1980's-) and things were in someways better than today for sure, others not. but at least they didn't have bad rap music to contend with.<br />The characters are real enough not be believable too, after all the seventies was THe decade of excess and personal out of control freedom gone amuck. The blu ray looks stunning on all versions in this package. This one sold out at the chain store I got it at so grab this limited edition if you are a fan of great comedy and this one has quite a following because in the last decade it was one of the better comedies out there. And this one is without a doubt Will Ferrels most complete character and best work of his comedy career. He just creates a perfect character here which is more realized than some of his others movies characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>Anchorman is a film that only comes around once every decade or so and it sets the standard for any comedies to follow. Arguably being Will Ferrells best it's a film with very ridiculous comedy moments brought together in an extremely intelligent way. It's not something where the jokes are reeled off one by one in an in obvious way, in fact some of the more funny jokes you can miss the first time round as they're very subtle. Along with Will Ferrell this film has a very strong supporting cast with people like Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Christina Applegate. They give us a great blend of serious acting with very, very silly humour. I'm not usually a fan of the silly comedy movies and I'm sure a lot of people will shy away from it because it looks just that, however, it's something that will surpass all expectations and then some.<br /><br />Anchorman tells the story of 1970s San Diego news Anchor Ron Burgundy and his time as the most respected Anchorman in the San Diego area. Him and his team, Brian Fantana (Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) & Champ Kind (David Koechner) are brought into peril when an aspiring woman Anchor is brought into the team. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought into the news office due to complaints of lack of diversity. This woman is strong and no matter how hard the main news team will try, she's not going to be put off from her goal to be Anchorwoman. Ron manages to use his charm and his ability to play the Jazz Flute (No Inuendo intended) to win over Veronica and they end up dating. She wants to keep it quiet because it will peril her career, but Ron being a mans man tells San Diego live on air that they're sleeping together. Through another series of unfortunate events Ron Burgundys dog baxter is killed leading to him being late for newscast. Seizing her chance, Veronica takes charge and becomes Anchorwoman for the one show to the dismay of Ron. Because she was so successful she is promoted to co-anchor and the relationship is off.<br /><br />I'm tempted to tell you the entire story but I wont. It is awesome though and is one of the most bizarre, childish and intelligent comedies I've ever seen. People would try to knock this film slightly by saying it's not as funny as his prior film, Old School but it's definitely much much funnier. The over the top acting of Ferrell is worth it alone as I could watch him in his outrageous emotional state after Baxter was killed, all day. Steve Carell is also another shining light in the film as he plays the dumb weather guy who's the over the top idiot that comes out with hysterically stupid things. "I stabbed a guy in the heart" the way he said it has to be witnessed as it's just classic Carell.<br /><br />One of my favourite lines from the movie which occurred in the opening credits as it was just so unexpected and very very silly. "The human torch was denied a bank loan" is an absolute classic which I think many people will agree with. Also the fight between the different channels news teams is also a classic as it features cameos from one of the greatest comic actors in Ben Stiller as the Spanish language news Anchor. I could honestly go on and on about how crazily funny this film is but I would give everything away. All I can say to wrap this up is you will need to watch it more than once in order to catch all the jokes as some you will miss the first time around.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GYX971VETQBV.html">A2GYX971VETQBV</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell comes alive in _Anchorman_, once again proving that he is one of the few talented acts to come out of the SNL machine in quite some time.  Whenever you're watching a comedy whose talent is a bit low on the sophisticated meter, you have to be enthralled by the characters and the actors who play them.  Ferrell delivers in spades and, while the plot spins around and goes nowhere, he manages to continually delight the audience with his own brand of humor.  Bottom line, if you love Will Ferrell and his style of comedy, you will love _Anchorman_.  If you don't, shop elsewhere.<br /><br />The premise of the film is a hilarious look at the power of reporters during the "golden age" of local television.  The character of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious and it is a delight to see a chauvinistic icon struggle with what he views as an invasion by women in the workforce.  My only complaint with the film is the same complaint that I have with many of the comedies that are being released these days.  These comedies seem to be based off quick sketch ideas, many of which are spawned from Saturday Night Live and the like.  The problem with this formula is that many of these sketches are hard to sustain over a couple of minutes, let alone a feature length film.  One gets the impression that these films, including _Anchorman_, would be truly dynamite if they could just restrict themselves to an hour.  The "90 minute" comedy rule is just too long for these films to sustain their interest, forcing them to sag at many points.<br /><br />That being said, _Anchorman_ still receives my approval.  Each time I have seen it, I have been laughing out loud and forced to tears at a few spots.  Will Ferrell's performance is stunning and I think he is truly one of the most gifted comedic actors working these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Anchorman is the funniest film that I've seen in the past ten years. I haven't laughed as consistently or harder than I did at some of the lines from this film:<br /><br />Champ: I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and then never call her back!<br /><br />Wes Mantooth: Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint!<br /><br />or<br /><br />Brick:"...Years later a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and that I am what people would call mentally retarded."<br /><br />or<br /><br />Ron: "You have an incredible heine...I mean that things good...I wanna be friends with it...Do you know who I am? I'm kind of a big deal...I'm known...I have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mohogany."<br /><br />Seriously, do not hesitate to buy this film it is hysterical. Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy but his supporting cast is just as good. This will go down in the comedy annals as one of the greats. Highest Recommendation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>I'm sure we have all wondered what exactly goes in the offices of our local news stations. And what exactly do they say to each other when they break for commercial and we can't hear what they say?. Or when it's over and the credits roll?. Well, we find out here, and it's one of a number of deliriously silly and funny moments that fill up this goofy, but funny satire. Will Ferrell, who can do no wrong by this reviewer, continues his streak of making funny, enjoyable little pieces of comedy fluff. This is probably his most inspired creation so far. The film is narrated by Bill Kurtis, an A&E staple who hosts such shows as "Cold Case Files", and "American Justice". Will plays Ron Burgundy, a local 1970's anchorman in San Diego(or San Diago as he has called it), who seems to be riding high on all fronts. He is an insanely childish and pompous, and the lights are pretty dim in that well coiffed melon of his. He's treated like an important celebrity(or at least he think he is)and he is living the high life. Along with his buddies. Champ Kind(David Koechner), is the cowboy hat wearing sports guy, and has an unhealthy interest in Ron. Roving reporter Brian Fontana(Paul Rudd), is the big mustached ladies man. And then there is weatherman Brick Tamland(the hilarious Steve Carrel), a simpleton who has been declared "mentally retarded". The guys' male dominated lifestyle and world is shaken up when the station hires Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate), a hot young lady who aspires to be a top anchor herself, and throwing a wrench in what the men, and life at that time in general, thought of as an "only men" kind of thing. A time when women didn't have the power they have now. When they were assistants or secreteries, and were seldom seen, and heard even less. As the movie shows it as being. Once she arrives, the comedy really kicks in, especially when the two result to petty pranks and name calling to make it to the top. The always great Fred Willard co-stars as the station's boss. There is no great plot or meaning here, except for Will and the gang to have fun with their characters and make a silly little comedy that is only meant for pure fun and entertainment. They succeeded. It is no surprise that Applegate is funny and holds her own. She practically comes from an entire life of comedy, and her ditzy work as Kelly Bundy on "Married With Children" was an inspired bit of comedy buffoonery acting, and was not appreciated in the right way. She has come a long way from that role with tons of other parts since then. Ferrell is the kind of comedian who will just jump right in there and do it. No matter what. Burgundy can get a bit tiring after a while, but he is always ready to pull you back in with a funny line or scene. Carrel, as Brick, gets the most laughs here. There is a great scene where our reporters are confronted by the other channel's news teams in a hilarious "battle" scene. The moment is only made better because of the cameo appearances from stars who plays the other top anchors. I won't say who. That will spoil the fun. The design of the film works real well and has that 70's look and vibe, and the outfits and facial hair are hysterical. As is the use of The Starlight Vocal Band's hit, "Afternoon Delight". The DVD claims it is the unrated, unedited version, but I never saw the original theatrical release, so I couldn't tell you what is newly put in and what is there. The special features are a delight. There are bloopers, which can also be found during the end credits, and outtakes, and lots more. Plus a hilarious video of the already mentioned song above. Bill Kurtis himself appears in a feature that has him having a 10 minute talk with Ron Burgundy. All in all, it's a riotously silly and cheeseball comedy that will leave you with nothing more than a smile on your face and the knowing that you saw a completely mindless film that only wanted to have fun for an hour and a half. And what fun it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Having just been thoroughly entertained by The Forty-Year-Old Virgin, I thought it might be fun to go back and watch Steve Carrel's supporting role in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Well, the good news is that Carrel is incredibly funny in this movie, sometimes without even trying!<br /><br />The movie itself is sort of a mixed bag. No doubt the producers are invested in making you laugh at its flat-out absurdity, but the silliness of it all often overshadows the clever irony. More often than not, Anchorman succeeds in its aim, but towards the end, the movie and Will Ferrell more than wears out it's welcome.<br /><br />Anchorman launches us into the world of `70s broadcast journalism with local San Diego anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as the epitome of male egoism. His supporting anchors introduce themselves by breaking the fourth wall with all the casual gusto of their on-air personas.<br /><br />There's old cowboy Champ Kind (David Koechner) with sports, ladies' man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) in the field, and dummy Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) on weather. They revel in their boys' club in gleeful ignorance of terms like "sexual harassment" and equal rights for women, until new reporter Veronica Corningstone (a terrific Christina Applegate) comes to work for them.<br /><br />Improbably, Ron and Veronica hit it off until a series of events puts her in the co-anchor seat and professional jealousy rips them apart, sending Ron on a downward spiral. But the thinly laid plot isn't what's important because the story is just a vehicle for Ferrell an director Adam McKay to craft a series of increasingly absurd set pieces that highlight the star's ability to play the most ridiculous situations with an over-the-top childishness.<br /><br />On his first date with Veronica, Ron breaks into a jazz flute solo. In an otherwise normal scene, Ron and his news team burst into song.  For Ron and his team see TV newsrooms of the '70s as kindergartens. The high jinks and attempts to undermine colleagues are akin to children fighting over the sandbox.<br /><br />This bright comic idea extends to a rather absurd street fight among all the male San Diego news teams, which features achingly funny cameos by Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, and as a PBS newsman, Tim Robbins. Anchorman is at its worst when it attempts to make a socially relevant statement, and at its best when some sight gag or comically mystifying bit of dialogue comes out of nowhere.<br /><br />A lot of the film's best moments come from McKay's willingness to let the actors find the funniest detours in any scene and improvise. Ferrell, an experienced improvisational comedian, does wonders here, but it's Carell, who ably steals every frame he's in. Applegate is also riotous as Veronica and more than readily holds her own against the men.<br /><br />It's sometimes crude and juvenile and incredibly infantile, but Anchorman proves that even puerile humor can be funny. The film does make you laugh even if you hate yourself for doing so. A creation of former Saturday Night Live colleagues, the comedy plays like an extended skit with bits of improvisation and several slightly extended sequences.<br /><br />The behind-the-camera team has goofy fun with the era's truly awful hair and fashion styles, equally bad music and monochromatic TV news desks. Of course, the main fun comes at watching the era's stupid male chauvinism, with the realization that these men were pretty dumb to think that way in the first place.

Christina Applegate handles the lead female role admirably, and she has matured into a real beauty, which makes it all the more enjoyable to watch her onscreen. The story line is thin, to say the least, but there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.

All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more "diversity" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board.  Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news.  Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants).  Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.<br /><br />"Anchorman" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like "Network"), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb.  The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial ("Panda Watch: Day 46") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits.  Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in "Anchorman" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever "West Side Story" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.<br /><br />Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles.  Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.<br /><br />"Anchorman" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now.  Still, "Anchorman" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>Being in the broadcasting business, I can identify with most of the routines that goes on in the newsroom from this movie.  On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny.  It was very spotty as far as laughs.  However, the script comes off prety lame.  The acting was pretty obnixious and made it seem like I was going through a root canal at the dentist office.  Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting lots of laughs.  It could have been a much better film!</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>It's a one-joke premise. This is very quotable and is actually rewatchable. Each character is steriotypical but to the extreme, mix that is with the quirky personalities, and you have an undeniably funny cast. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the `70s. Feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons...well it's all out war. The comedic take on a woman invading the news desk in the 1970s was inspired by a decidedly more serious documentary on the women who actually broke that glass ceiling. Will Ferrell was watching the documentary, which featured interviews with several anchormen of the 1970s, and found some of the interviews with the newsmen to be unintentionally funny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My brother quoted a line out of Anchorman that immediately caused my wife to put it at the top of our Netflix list. We couldn't pass up the opportunity to see Steve Carrell screw up the news like he did in Bruce Almighty.<br /><br />Anchorman has a plot, but does anyone care?  It's mostly about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) playing a 70s overconfident anchorman whose macho buddy-verse consisting of Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner) is disrupted by the promotion of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) into their news ranks.  Mostly.<br /><br />Anchorman is all over the place.  It pokes fun at news shows, like how they all hate each other like 50s gangs (and imagines them duking it out with bats in alleys).  It jokes about how the intelligence requirements to become a weatherman (Brick has an IQ of 48 and is "what some people call mentally retarded.") It mocks 70s fashion (Look at those shoes! That moustache! Those slacks!).  It painfully wrangles with the struggle of equality in the workplace.  Sometimes it's about the love between a man and a woman...and sometimes it's about the love between a man and his dog.<br /><br />Anchorman's a lot of things, not all of them funny.  In fact, Carrell is far funnier than Ferrell, and he has a lot less lines.  Ferrell infuses Burgundy with a vague accent that he drops in and out of.  He says all his lines like a kid play-acting in front of his high school class.  Being funny takes a lot of work, but it shouldn't look like it: Ferrell seems constipated for most of the movie.  That leaves poor Applegate to shoulder the burden, bless her heart...but she's the straightwoman, so there's not a lot she can do to help.<br /><br />It's hard to say a comedy is bad. Just about every movie can be funny, even unintentionally, and a judgment on quality humor is extremely subjective. I have to be honest, though: Anchorman feels lazy.  It doesn't really have a plot, the acting is terrible, and most of the jokes are beaten to brutal, bloody deaths.  I mean, jazz flute is funny and all, but after awhile you need to put the flute down and tell a joke or something.  The ending doesn't even make any sense (and it's clear, after watching what was cut, that they cut a major plot point).<br /><br />I love Carrell though.  His lines alone make the film worth watching.  And now that I've seen it...<br /><br />"I love lamp."</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>I hadn't expected much from Anchorman, but prepare to be pleasently surprised at just how funny the film is.  Will Ferrell is deadpan as Ron Burgundy, a TV newscaster on top of the world with his news team (including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and the Daily Show's Steve Carell), and soon finds himself at odds with a tenacious female newscaster (Christina Applegate) who is looking to make it big, even if it comes at Ron's expense.  While some of the gags fall flat at times, the film for the most part is a joy, and the viewer is able to tell that the cast is having great fun which makes this even more enjoyable.  Anchorman for the most part is a surprisingly funny mainstream flick that fans of Ferrell will no doubt enjoy, and cameo roles from Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller will have you grinning from ear to ear.</p></br><a href="../users/AWJOVW1BZZ34H.html">AWJOVW1BZZ34H</a><br/><p>If you like Will Ferrell you'll like this movie, the story or plot are not important it is just about screwball comedy.

Will Ferrell brings in the laughs as he always does and they kill with each deliver...funny and I liked this better then Dodgeball....a comedy classic of its own kind...laugh, cry...Anchorman is sweet.

He thinks it will become funny if he repeats it three or four times, then explains the joke. No. Only his fool, Paul Schaefer laughs. Anchorman gives you escapist fare & you'll find yourself predicting what will happen next. Will Farrell sharpened his acting skills since then, but not much.

That's about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>Anchorman isn't much like the typical Hollywood comedy these days, but those who have seen enough of such comedies should realize that's definitely a good thing.  It's not quite a classic, but it's a silly, perverse, and occasionally surreal adult farce that effectively exploits the same formula that made Caddyshack a favorite among young guys everywhere: twisted characters, oddball dialogue, and a few lowbrow gags to keep everyone loose.  Even more importantly, it doesn't try too hard or wear out its welcome (having sat through Wedding Crashers in the theatre, I can attest that mainstream comedies shouldn't run past 100 minutes; this one clocks in at a highly palatable 90), and even the unrated DVD cut doesn't pile on gross-outs just because it can.  In other words, it's a lighthearted, funny, frequently inspired flick, which on its own makes Anchorman a success by the standards of the past few years.<br /><br />Set in late 1970's San Diego, Anchorman scores some major points with its comedic take on the rapid social changes of the time and the inhernet vacuity of the news anchor's job.  The cast is surprisingly good, led by a brilliantly over-the-top performance from Ferrell (whom I could normally take or leave) in the lead role of Ron Burgundy and the constant scene-stealing of the great Steve Carrell as dim-witted weatherman Brick Tamland.  There are plenty of mock-serious poses to go around, and some hysterical physical comedy led by Ferrell's bizarre turn playing jazz flute (check out those flames!).  Hell, Ron Burgundy's mustache is a great running joke in and of itself.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to have many aspirations beyond just being really goofy, but to be fair, it accomplishes that task extremely well most of the time.  Anchorman is at its best in its first half, when it revels in the excesses and political incorrectness of late '70's and pokes fun at them at the same time.  Not to mention, it's a goldline for memorable lines (in fact, Bill Simmons, aka the Sports Guy of [...] fame, used quotes from this movie for this year's NFL preview).  Here's a sampling of some of the classic lines from the first half-hour alone, not counting a few that I can't repeat:<br /><br />"Years later, a doctor will tell me I have an IQ of 48 and I'm what some people call mentally retarded."<br /><br />"I'm very important...I have many leatherbound books...my apartment smells of mahogany...I'm friends with Merlin Olsen."<br /><br />"I could be wrong, but I believe diversity's an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era."<br /><br />"It is anchor MAN, not anchor LADY, and that's a scientific fact."<br /><br />"I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and NEVER CALL HER AGAIN!"<br /><br />"You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter...you're so wise...you're like a miniature Buddha with hair."<br /><br />"I have very little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office."<br /><br />Unfortunately (even though I sort of saw it coming) Anchorman does lose a bit of steam after the halfway mark, although there are still some great bits of slapstick to be found: Jack Black's dog-punting cameo (an instantly memorable scene if ever there was one); the five-news team brawl, and the knock-down-drag-out fight between Ron and Veronica Corningstone chief among them.  Still, Anchorman manages to generate plenty of laughs and goodwill in its brief running time.  It's certainly not as nuanced and intelligent as, say, Sideways, but then I don't think it's supposed to be.  What it is supposed to be is a nice little piece of goofballery, which it very much winds up being.</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I just had no interest at all in watching this one; I just didn't think I could stand Will Ferrel again after I suffered through "Elf". But for a measly $2 a rental around here, I figured I'd grab a bunch that I didn't wanna see, because the ones I really have wanted to see have been crap, and I figured the ones I didnt wanna watch would probably become new found favorites.<br /><br />Well, this is by far NOT a new found favorite, but it was OK and seeing as how I was thinking it would probably be one I'd turn off after 30 minutes, it survived a whole screening from me.<br /><br />The humor is a little weak through a lot of the movie, but some parts got me laughing.<br /><br />Just a rental/wait for TV imo.<br /><br />The high point is what Will says to San Deago that results in him getting fired. The low point is there is a small scene with Ben Stiller. I rolled my eyes and nearly puked, is there any non-stoner comedies made in the past few years that doesn't have him in it?</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>There are some gags that are hilariously funny, but the plot  doesn't hang together. There are too many over-the-top scenes. This strategy works for Mel Brooks, but here Ferrel takes potshots at everything and pretty much misses everything. For example, there is a voice over at the end for a character that is never seen in the movie. Was that intentional and not funny? Or was it unintentional and sloppy editing? The language is bad in spots. Furthermore, there is a lot of yelling in the movie by different characters. I am not sure why that is funny.<br /><br />The good points were the dog was cute, Steve Carrel as Brick was funny, and some of the cameos were funny. I won't spoil the cameos, because who they got to play which character is part of the fun. Unfortunately, the rest of the scene was not as funny.<br /><br />The movie just doesn't work for me.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is one of the most hilarious comedies from Will Ferrel and Steve Carell. I don't care if it looks dumb or it's not very smart, all I care about is that this film definintely makes me laugh. Carell steals the show as the mildly retarded Brick ("Fantastic!"), while Ferrel and Applegate make an interesting onscreen duo. And let's not forget some unexpected cameos in the middle of the film.<br /><br />Watch it, and you'll be in hysterics.

The local news has no competition from cable of any sort, so Burgandy and his crew are celebrities in the San Diego area.  His viewers recite his trademark line that he closes every broadcast with:  "San Diegeo, you stay classy."  Burgandy has a dream of one day becoming a national news anchor.  Then, Veronica Corningstone, played by Christina Applegate, comes to work at the station, and Burgandy's world is thrown off its axis....<br /><br />This movie definitely has its moments.  Ferrell shines at various points in the movie as a newsman that is full of himself, but is large in his community, that is just doesn't matter.  The movie does an adequate job spoofing local television news (right down to the almost unnatural attention a pregnant panda gets).  The gangster like rivalry between the local news stations (which have crews filled with Ferrell's buddies, such as Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson) is amusing and culminates in a rumble.  Fred Willard also turns in his usual excellent comedic performance as head of the newsroom.<br /><br />However, the comedy is not evenly paced and frequently over the top simply to be over the top in the hopes of getting a laugh.  Ferrell's big hit 'Old School' did a much better job of maintaining an even level of humor without having to get so ridiculous as to lose the plot.  The movie could have been better with a few more news scenes that allowed Ferrell's behind the desk personality to take center stage.<br /><br />Overall, Ferrell fans will probably like the movie, but will probably be a little let down after movies like 'Old School.'  Its worth a rental, but don't set your expectations too high.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  3 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I caught this one on HBO over the weekend and I laughed hard at least a dozen times, which is exactly about a dozen more times than I thought I would. Will Ferrell is getting a little annoying to me the more I see him in films (loved him on SNL), but he gave me a few chuckles in this one. I loved all the cameos and some of the dirty humor, but this is one you won't want to see more than once or twice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>You know you're heading for a good movie when you get the first giggle at the very start. Right at the very start. Before the movie starts.<br /><br />I normally would go out of my way to avoid a movie that not only features Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell etc. The latest Hollywood Rat Pack. Sometimes they can be good in movies (Shallow Hal), but mostly, they think they're funny.<br /><br />This has to be the first movie where they ARE funny. I was initially expecting a movie that was totally sexist. While it is totally sexist, it's cringeworthy (the outfits, the BAD hair, the facial hair), and funny (Baxter talking to Ron among others), and it's superior to all the other movies that feature the main stars. I can't really comment on Will Ferrell, I've only previously seen him in Old School (I think), and don't remember being that fussed about that film. It was something to pass the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Christina Applegate character is a role any actress could have played. How many actresses could have got away with it though? She manages to pull off a previously stupid sounding role, and make it her own, and make it work against Will Ferrell.<br /><br />Anchorman is a story about the seventies. And I'm not just talking about bad hair, bad clothes, bad facial hair, bad music. It's a man's world. Women belong in the kitchen, tending to their husband's every need, making babies, while he goes out and earns the money, and eyes up the pretty girls, and regrets getting married. More specifically, it's about a woman, trying to break her way into being the first female anchorwoman on TV news. It was a very man's world apparently. But the lead male anchorman has some fatal flaws, apart from his looks - he falls for a pretty girl in a skirt, he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter (heaven forbid, don't put a question mark at the end of a sentence that doesn't require one). The rest of his supporting anchorman include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell). They yet again manage to hold their own against Will's character, Ron, and pull off memorable performances, especially Steve LOUD NOISES Carell.<br /><br />Full of funny situations, hilarious lines, funny outfits, and deliberate OTT acting, Anchorman is a film I would have normally avoided, and I totally expected to do an entirely different review. Excellent movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a 1970's chauvinist anchorman. The old boy newsroom antics are on full display. Crude jokes and sexual overtones are the norm.<br /><br />When Ron Burgundy misses his anchor time slot Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is thrust into action. She is the first female anchor to see the airway. Ratings go through the roof. Ron is let go. What will he do?<br /><br />This uncut DVD is sometimes over the top excessive language. This movie is vintage Will Ferrell. The script could be more polished. The writing tries to squeeze to many jokes into conversations.  The movie does not flow well. Will Ferrell can improvise with the best of them (SNL), but sometimes restraint works too. He is an enormous talent and will squeeze his way into the comedic hearts of America.<br /><br />"Old School" and "Elf" are destined to be Will Ferrell classics.<br /><br />Have you noticed! In Hollywood circles, if you are the lead, hot actor, bring in your actor friends for some cameos. If you follow Adam Sandler's movies you know what I mean. Ride the pony!</p></br><a href="../users/A3ATTCCO32ZXET.html">A3ATTCCO32ZXET</a><br/><p>There's no way that a cast which includes some of the funniest comedic actors of the new century could fail.  That's not just Will Ferrell, but Christina Appelgate, Fred Willard  and Steve Corell from Comedy Central's Daily Show.  Separately, they've each made their own success in past roles but here in Anchorman they're a comic force ad libbing their way through a script that sets an already impressive foundation.  I nearly cracked in half a few times.<br /><br />The premise is, what was it like that historic day in the `70s when the first woman went in front of the camera, not as a cheesecake weather girl but as a serious reporter?  The all-male news team reacts with the predictable; attempts to sabotage her with innuendo and psychological warfare, seduction, immature jokes.  The sort of stuff that happens any time a woman "invades" a male-dominated field.  Only Veronica (the much-underrated Christina Applegate) handles it all with a bemused tolerance and class.  Nothing could bring her down, that is, until the impossible happened...she falls for Ron Burgundy.  Ron, the living stereotype of chauvinism and a Jr. High Schoolboy mentality, is lonely underneath all of his unqualified success as a tv news anchor.  Can love temper their differences and bridge the gap between the sexes?<br /><br />I think that what makes Anchorman work is an underlying glee at lampooning the self-important, phony airs put on by talking head all over the country.  In every well-modulated tone, every pretentious turn of phrase and every carefully choreographed inflection we can see the Channel Four News Team's hilarious, accurate mimicry. The entire cast has it down perfectly.  We instinctively recognize that it's a delicious send-up of the so-called journalists we are familiar with as a television audience.<br /><br />Then again, if you don't watch the news on television you probably won't get half of the in-jokes.  That would explain *some* people's reactions, but...<br /><br />A niggling thought occurs:  could it be that Anchorman's detractors were uncomfortably reminded of their own behavior at times?  Really and truly folks, the film's message about `70s sexism was delivered with lightheartedness, gently, and with no righteous fury whatsoever.  And yet, some people may take even the lightest poke as a full frontal assault.  A case of a guilty conscience making for a sensitive viewer, perhaps?<br /><br />In any case, I plead with you not to allow a few negative comments from other reviewers to keep you from seeing what I think may be the funniest film of 2004.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this movie.  Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke.  Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat.  The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen.  Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller.  All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment.  Will Ferrell can do much better than this.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Yes, this movie is dumb. But it is fricking hilarious. Will Ferrell is a comedic genius. Ron Burgundy is a lovable loser without a clue, and Steve Carrell steals the show as an incompetent weatherman. The writing and improvisation was funny, and it was a laugh a minute!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C9GCHR99WX3F.html">A1C9GCHR99WX3F</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell stars in this movie playing a newsman in the 70's in San Deigo, and while I wasn't to much of a fan of Elf, but I do have to say that I really see Ferrell playing a newsman, then see him play a giant elf, or a human that doesn't know he is a human, that thinks he is an elf. As the movie opens, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), are the top news team in all of San Deigo. Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), is the top anchor at the station that is second to Channel 4, and he hates Ron Burgundy, and would do anything to be the number 1 anchor. Ron lvies by himself with his dog, but then one day Ed Harken (Fred Willard) hires Veronica Corningstone (Married with Children's Christina Applegate) as a reporter. And without welcoming her, they make comments on her assets, and even maybe try to score with her. But then Ron manges to get him to agree to a date, as co-workers as he intoruces her the city that she will be broadcasting news to. And then soon she is prompted to the anchor desk, to co-host the news with Ron, but watch what you put on the teleprompter, because Ron will read whatever yout put up there.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (the unrated version) cowritten by and starring Will Ferrell is a sophomoric comedy based on one idea borrowed from the very rich plot of `Broadcast News', spiked with some tired themes the character Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show plus some other borrowings from less likely sources such as `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.<br /><br />For starters, I simply did not laugh at this movie. Not once! It was less funny to me than a Three Stooges short, and I don't like the Three Stooges. This is not to say I don't appreciate some good potty humor now and then. I happen to think that Kevin Smith's foul-mouthed marathons such as `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are really very, very funny.<br /><br />One of the most deadly aspects of the movie was that it was predictable. You can see punchlines coming from two blocks away. Even the crudest, cheapest gag / shock value in the movie which involved Burgundy's small, much beloved dog being kicked off the highest point of the high bridge over San Diego bay could be anticipated, as improbable as cruelty to animals scenes are in movies. The fact that the canine body falling to San Diego bay was so obviously a dummy dog neither improved the comedy nor took the sting out of the cheapness of the business.<br /><br />Ferrell has had a fair amount of success since he left Saturday Night Live and many, including Kevin Smith attest to his comedic abilities, but I just don't see it. I watched `Elf' a few months ago and I could appreciate that it was a better than average Christmas movie, but it really wasn't anything special. I just don't think Ferrell has the kind of natural comedic talent of people like Billy Crystal or Dan Aykroyd, let alone the comic geniuses like Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams. Carrey and even Williams can sometimes become parodies of themselves, but the lapses usually don't last too long, and in any given 5 minutes on the screen they will get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook.<br /><br />There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie. It probably is no less a cartoon of its subject than `Zoolander' or `Animal', but it is neither laugh out loud funny like `Garfield' nor `wryly funny like `Doonesbury'. The only character in the movie for which I had any sympathy at all was the news director played by Fred Willard. Ferrell's foil, the female newscaster played by Christina Applegate was too predictable and unnatural to elicit much empathy from me, especially since her competition was so artificial.<br /><br />If a movie is good, I typically rate DVDs on the basis of the quality of the bonus features. This is why a Kevin Smith DVD is such a good bargain compared to even great classic comedy DVDs such as `Ghostbusters' or `Some Like It Hot'. If the principals are not around to provide a good commentary, the rewatchability drops a bit. But this movie is not entertaining to begin with, so what interest do I have in listening to a commentary of why they decided to punt a dog dummy off the San Diego bridge.<br /><br />This movie may be worth a rent, but not a buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A6FIAB28IS79.html">A6FIAB28IS79</a><br/><p>Al Franken, Molly Shannon, Chris Farley, Will McDonald, Dana Garvey, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, and now Will Ferrell--why do these talented performers dependably crack me up on their SNL 10-minute bits yet leave me constantly looking at my watch during their feature-length movie offerings? Well, for one thing the writing is atrocious--thinly disguised, formulaic soapers with a few "F" words and whoopee cushion jokes thrown in to justify the length and venue. Characterization is nil--apparently a viewer's prior familiarity with the on-screen personas is considered sufficient--and plots are mono-dramatic situations used as excuses for lame (and loud) verbal and sight gags.<br /><br /> In the case of "Anchorman" the title says it all. Ferrell plays a vain and fatuous television news anchor whose chief attribute is his hair, which is suddenly under threat by a foxy woman rival with both brains and hair (no matter that the sexist situations and dialogue are at least 30 years out of date). For no reason other than dramatic necessity the two competitive anchors get their act together both romantically and professionally by the end of the movie (which came 60 minutes too late for this viewer).<br /><br /> Just to show you how short this film is on creative ideas, the highlight for me was the voice-over narration supplied by CBS and cable news commentator Bill Kurtis. A close second would be a 5-second out-take from "Smokey and the Bandit Part 2." A 3rd would be Tim Robbins' walk-on as a ruthlessly ambitious PBS rep.<br /><br /> I'll be curious to to see how well this film does. Pre-college kids probably won't get the political humor of the opening sketches; college kids couldn't care less; adults find SNL humor, at least since the Belushi-Akroyd days, way beneath them. I have a hunch the makers of this film might wish they had chosen to invest their money in something like "Fear Factor: The Movie."<br /><br /> I'm giving the film 3 stars because of Farrell's great comedic potential (he's actually a pretty good musician and dancer) and because he mercifully spared us that noxious cheerleading bit, which is as unfunny as any SNL sketch I've ever seen. Also, his "in character" interviews in promoting the film were so subtle he had me believing I was watching some of the anchormen from my youth in northern Wisconsin. Finally, the only other spectator in the theater--my wife--claimed that she liked the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>The Legend of Ron Burgundy has it's high and low moments, some moments are genuinely funny, other moments are a bunch of dirty jokes that make you smile and the rest is a little dull. Will Farrell, Christina Applegate and all of the others do well in this film, but there just isn't that much to work with.<br /><br />The high point of the film is when Ron plays his Jazz flute in the club, that part was hilarious and my favorite part of the film. Like I said, there are a few other highlights, Ron throws a burrito out the window and hits biker Jack Black, and like when one of Ron's co-workers wears his sex panther cologne that smells like "a turd covered in burnt hair" among other things. These parts are hilarious!<br /><br />The soundtrack to the film is amazing; some of the best 70's music in one collection. Farrell and three other co-workers show off their singing ability by singing a version of "Afternoon Delight".<br /><br />Overall a good film, mainly for fans of Will Ferrell. If you like comedy movies that are what you see, this film is for you. If you want a deep story with a moral this ain't for you. Just fun, nothing more</p></br><a href="../users/A1IANEBSMVGHS9.html">A1IANEBSMVGHS9</a><br/><p>I had a chance to check out "Anchorman" not too long ago.

It sure had some funny moments, but for the most part it reminded me of how boring of an experience watching "Old School" was: thematically, it was lame, and it made me wonder how good a comedian can Will Ferrell be, while continuing to pull off such bad movies.

A Hollywood disgrace.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JPFWKS83R49V.html">A3JPFWKS83R49V</a><br/><p>This movie, starring Will Farrell in the main role, is a weak attempt at comedy from director Adam McKay. As much as I like Farrell from his Saturday Night Live days, this movie is a little too juvenile in humor and plot to make it a good comedy.<br /><br />Farrell and his female co- star Christina Applegate fight for attention in this film as they battle it out for the role as lead anchor on the local news. Farrell has held this role on the news for many years and doesn't want to relinquish his position to a woman. The movie is set in the 1970's- a time of feminism and social revolution- and the rivalry turns into a battle of the sexes between the two adults. This is a pretty standard movie formula and it could have worked better if the writing was more engaging and the comedy more sincere.<br /><br />The humor in this film is mostly bathroom- style and the jokes are primarily the types that appeal to younger kids. There isn't much in the way of original comedy, and what little originality the film can muster up is still juvenile and silly. In a matter of seconds, most of us could think of jokes and general humor at least as good as that offered here in Anchorman.<br /><br />Will Farrell is good in this role, and I liked Applegate. The addition of Fred Willard to the cast was also a good idea, but I would have liked it if Willard had a greater role. The other supporting cast of goons is rather lame and I can think of many actors/actresses who could have done just as well. On the other hand, the script of this film makes it tough for anyone to perform very well.<br /><br />Overall, Anchorman is a movie to pass on unless you're in the mood for this type of brainless comedy. Maybe if I had been in a more giddy disposition from the start, I would have liked this film more than I did. But taken as it is, this movie is a throwaway, with only a few drops of real comedy in large pool of manufactured laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>A silly goofball comedy set somewhere in TV's dark ages of two decades ago, "Anchorman" is about a San Diego TV news anchor (Will Farrell) who is also a self-aggrandizing, chauvenistic simpleton with a nice voice and a good mustache.

This movie literally made me feel stupid- but not so stupid as to continue watching it past about half an hour.  The part I did see, however, made me think of movies in which Will Ferrell was actually funny- movies like Elf, my personal favorite from Ferrell, or more recently Talladega Nights: The Story of Ricky Bobby. Anchorman really wasn't that interesting, I laughed at maybe one joke in the movie, and overall I hated the experience.

I say this knowing that for the most part I could not stand the Ted Baxter character and while I was not exactly wincing at the one-liners in this 2004 comedy, I was not laughing a lot either.  The script by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell sets up some comic opportunities but tends not to take advantage of them.  For example, it is established early on that Burgundy will say anything that is written on a teleprompter.  While this comes up as a major plot development, it strikes me as a waste of a really good running gag because they could have come up with so much more.<br /><br />Ron Burgundy represents the news anchor in his prime, circa San Diego in the 1970s.  Arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention incapable of saying anything that does not sound pompous and egotistical, Burgundy is enabled by his producer Ed Harken (Fred Willard), and the rest of the evening news team: hip roving reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and clueless weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell, Bruce Almighty).  Into their male dominated world comes Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who wants to read the news her self, apparently unconcerned that it is a man's job.  Thus, the battle lines are drawn between Veronica and all of the guys as the station.<br /><br />Now, a battle of the sexes sounds pretty good, but that idea is undercut by the fact that a romance springs up between Burgundy and Corningstone.  The fact that they have the hots for each other does not take away from their ambition, and the funniest scenes for me in the film are when the two of them are muttering insults each other at the end of the newscast while the credits role.  But there should have been a lot more comedy to be milked from their on camera battles, and "Anchorman" is to busy running on to the next bit to stop and figure out how everything fits together.  This is a film that has people singing "Afternoon Delight" at one moment and then has news teams getting ready to rumble in a back alley.  But it never comes together with any sort of unified comedy theory that makes it all work.  Instead we are left with bits and pieces with as many misses as hits.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" should have been a satire, and it ends up being nothing more than an over-extended comedy sketch.  The movie is set in the 1970s and you would think that should come into play more in terms of the comedy, but it really does not.  The flaw, I suspect, is that McKay and Ferrell know that their SNL audience has little in the way of a rudimentary knowledge of that particular decade (to wit, leisure suits and facial hair), so the story is set back then simply so the idea of a female news anchor can be see as a radical idea.  But even that become another font of comic opportunity that "Anchorman" neglects to use to great effect.  The result is okay, and Ferrell certainly tries hard, but for me the entire movie has as many laughs as one of his really good SNL skits, and when you are talking a feature length movie, that is not a good thing.</p></br><a href="../users/A33IZJVCKFKDPU.html">A33IZJVCKFKDPU</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is probably the hottest and most in demand comedian in movies right now and deservingly of course.  He is an amazingly funny person.  He just sends of that impression of being an old creepy guy that uses stupid pick-up lines on girls and tries to hang out with the younger crowd.  Almost anything that he does turns out funny.  Well, except for this movie.  <p>Anchorman is about a new anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His station is the number 1 rated news broadcast in the San Diego area.  Ron Burgundy is a sexist, extremely cocky person who is always trying to hook up with girls by saying "You know, I am famous."  Along with the rest of his news team, all of them being male, they strut around town and are well known by everyone.  Well, the management at Channel 4, Ron's station, decides that they need a change and hire a female news reporter.  This does not sit well with Ron and the rest of the news team.  So after a brief relationship with the new female broadcaster (Christina Applegate), Ron decides to try to destroy her career.  This backfires against him and he becomes scum and then rises back to the top.  Enough said.<p>Now don't get me wrong, this movie had its funny moments.  The cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Jack Black (whose cameo turned out to be the funniest moment of the movie) were really good.  Steve Carrell was the funniest of Burgundy's news team.  The problem is that the movie felt like a really long SNL skit that started to get old after about 20 minutes.  During most of the movie, the audience was not laughing.  The movie had a lot of dry parts and moved at a much slower pace then, say, Dodgeball.  This wasen't a bad movie, its just wasen't what I was hoping for.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>"Anchorman" just didn't do it for me.  At once it was a laugh out loud, slap your mama funny movie and then it becomes this dull, worn out, drawn out and unfunny Saturday Night Live skit from the mid-90's.  In other words, when it is funny, it's very funny, but when it misses the mark, it misses by a good ol' country mile.<br /><br />Will Ferrell goofs his way through this flick in sometimes funny, but mostly annoying, fashion.  Christina Applegate wasted herself here.  The "newsteam" that backed up Ferrell was boring.  I have to admit, though, that they captured the oafishness and all out idiotic mentality of most reporters.  I've worked with a few in my day when I was at a local station, and the majority of them aren't half as great as they think they are.  Their egos are bloated well beyond capacity.<br /><br />The funniest parts of this film are when other stars make cameo appearances.  Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson all have wonderful bit parts that result in hilarity.  The gem of the bunch has got to be Jack Black.  His burrito-induced road rage resulting in a punted pooch is classic.<br /><br />I don't recommend purchasing this flick.  It's not silly enough to be considered "brainless" humor and it is entirely too idiotic to be intelligently funny.  However, the few gutbusters that are found here are worthy of at least one viewing.  Pick it up as a rental and then let fate take over from there.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>How stupid is this?  Well, pretty stupid.  Consider the scene where the News at Five teams from the various local stations (in San Diego) square off, gladiator style complete with tridents, swords and axes.  Or how about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) reading everything put on the teleprompter--"You put it there, he'll read it" including the "f" word.  Or the musical score in the background, a selection of the most sappy seventies tunes including (God help us) "Skyrockets in flight/Afternoon delight."<br /><br />I watched this on a United Airlines flight and took a read on the other passengers.  The guy in the window seat was in and out of sleep most of the time, and there weren't many of the other passengers laughing, at least not aloud.  However I have to say almost everybody put on their headsets and watched.  I attribute that to the mass bucks the producers spent on advertising.  I just had to check it out.<br /><br />And it WAS kind of fascinating to see a film done this way, so much so that even if you don't laugh, you might be glued to the tube anyway.  The satirical idea is to lampoon TV news anchors as empty-headed, surface kind of people who wouldn't know a differential equation from their hair spray.  Ferrell is perfectly shallow and vain and arrogant--and that is right on target.  However he proves the counterpoint to the movie's premise by actually being Quite a Guy, especially in the scene at the bar restaurant when he gets up to play the flute.  He plays one mean flute, I gotta tell you.<br /><br />Ferrell gets support from Christine Applegate as Veronica Corningstone who wants to become the anchorperson herself.  Most comedy fans will remember Applegate as the ditsy and voluptuous Kelly from TV's "Married with Children" where she started out when she was something like 14-years-old.  However, you might not recognize her at first glance since (1) she is trimmer, although she still has a bodacious figure; and (2) she's had the pre-mature wrinkles under her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different.<br /><br />Although this is a burlesque of the "reality" at your local news station, some of it is strangely real.  For example, the lead story constantly being the latest update on the panda bears at the San Diego Zoo and the media frenzy surrounding them is pretty much true.  Also real was the fanatical insistence by the TV producers (as a means to higher ratings) to feature human interest and crime stories as entertainment for couch potatoes.<br /><br />One of the funniest bits in the movie is near the beginning when Ron Burgundy tries out his unique pick-up style on Veronica by telling her that she has one very fine rear engine...or words to that effect, and she comes back with something like, "You sure know how to flatter a girl," the sarcasm as heavy as molasses in January at the North Pole.<br /><br />See this for Will Ferrell, whose over-the-top performance fascinates even when he isn't funny, and just kind of zone out on the dead parts that don't quite make it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CQON0P01BITL.html">A1CQON0P01BITL</a><br/><p>I suggest not even renting this one...such a disappointment.<br /><br />All I can say is this is a bad bad movie!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>I didn't have alot of expectations&that was a good thing.the film like so many of recent time try to get back into the 70's&use a Soundtrack of Songs to reflect the time period but do it all in a bad party kind of way which never gets fully off the ground.I didn't find this film that much interesting at all.there were a couple of aight funny moments,but it's pretty forgettable.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell shines in this movie about the old boy's club at a 1970's TV news show being threatened like anything when--of all things--a WOMAN is hired to join the crew. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as "the Middle East."  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the "Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the "Ron Burgundy A&E Biography." Sound and picture quality are very good.<br /><br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>Anchorman is my kind of movie. It gives you lots of great laughs, and has a good cast and awesome cameos. The movie's about Ron Burgundy, the # 1 and beloved anchorman in San Diego. He loves his dog, women, and scotch and life is perfect for Ron. But then a woman whom he finds very attractive wants to be an anchor. Ron and co anchors are infuriated because it's a man's job and it's anchorman and not anchorwoman. Ron's obviously got some new competition on his own news station and of course also has competition with all of the other news stations. (That have lead anchors Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller) The reumble between all of the news stations a la West Side Story rocks! Ron's co anchors all also neat and funny especially Brick, a very "special" weather man. (You'll have to watch to find out)<br />The movie's plot is simple and it's quite stupid but is just absolutely hilarious. The motorcycle/ burrito scene with Jack Black is the best but this movie's got loads of laughs. If you want some good laughs in your collection, this one's a good choice. Also the special features rock with Ron Burgundy at the MTV awards, and auditioning for ESPN. And lastly, there are a lot of hilarious deleted scenes. This one's worth your money.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman excels only in proving that people find stupidity funny for its own sake; the movie's appeal stems largely from lines like "I love lamp" which have no inherent humor value unless one is a 12-22 year-old male.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>This was Will Ferrell's least funniest movie yet to hit the big screen.There was like 2 funny parts and that's it.Christina Applegate is getting much to old , her nose job really looks bad.I hope Will Ferrell stops making stupid non-funny films.I liked ELF more than this movie.What happened to Ferrell in this movie.Either way the man got payed "jerk".</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>I must have been in a bad mood when I viewed ANCHORMAN - THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY. How else to explain my negative reaction to this hilarious (NOT!) movie. On the other hand, if I was in a bad mood, shouldn't a good comedy have cheered me up? The answer to this seeming contraction is, of course, that ANCHORMAN may be a stupid, inane, badly-written film. On the other hand, maybe I'm just not the type of guy who enjoys farce that much. That would quite possibly put me in the category of an up-tight someone who needs to chill out. Or, again, it could be that ANCHORMAN is simply a stinker of a movie. Maybe these things come down to taste. However, for me, the bottom line is I just didn't think ANCHORMAN or Will Ferrell was funny. Your call.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>I bought this movie after watching Elf. Elf was outstandingly good.

It tried way too hard. It had absolutely no plot or any kind of motivation for any of the characters. The supporting cast was extremely dull and uninspired. Will Ferrell was on auto-pilot, playing a pompous uncharismatic lead character, who gives us no reason to root for him or like him at all. Christina applegate was terrible. It had some good moments, but over all it just wasn't funny enough. <p>Why does an audience of 2004, give a rats patoot about a woman becoming an anchorman? I know it takes place IN the 70's, but the audience of today doesn't care about those issues anymore. Yet the film used it for its only mild plot device. What a waste.<p>I can't believe this film actually has a script. Ron's team was so over the top. The sports guy was never funny. The guy from daily show, was a waste. Its too easy to throw in a character like that for cheap laughs. The last guy again, not one good joke.<p>I wanted more stories about the rival studios, and less of the crap of a 70's news station getting a female anchor for 90 damn minutes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TYC8T6W81DDB.html">A3TYC8T6W81DDB</a><br/><p>Anchorman is the story of Ron Burgundy and his legacy as an anchorman on the channel 4 news time that frequents the number one spot in the ratings. His news team includes the sports newscaster, Champ Kind, the investigative reporter, Brian Fantana, and the weatherman, Brick Tamland. In this era of newscasting, only men were allowed to read the news. So what'll happen when Veronica Corningstone enters the picture? A woman who has the experience and the dream of becoming a network anchor. Will that dream come true? As Bob Dylan said, "the times they are a'changin'." Anything can happen and it's something you're going to have to deal with.<br /><br />Reviewing Anchorman is more difficult than it looks. While it's one of my favorite movies, it's so incredibly random. There is a plot, but it takes a backseat to the memorable and hysterical one-liners from the film that had to be improvised at times. With a movie that's this spontaneous, it's a bit hard to comment on things like the story since it's kind of minimal in a movie like this. The actors who make up the channel four news team portray these characters pretty flawlessly in the film though. They're pretty absorbed in these roles and that's a good thing. It makes this ridiculous movie somewhat believable.<br /><br />Now I've been a Will Ferrell fan for quite awhile now. He's made some pretty hilarious movies in his career, but this one was the last comedy he did that I really enjoyed. Every comedy he's done after this followed the same kind of formula; little plot and a lot of random one-liners and jokes that seemed to come out nowhere. It's funny the first time around and decent the second time, but after that it gets really redundant. People may find that flaw with this film, but I personally enjoyed it. The movie has almost a cult status for its ridiculousness alone. It's not only a film that continued my appreciation for Will Ferrell, but made me a fan of Paul Rudd as well.<br /><br />Anchorman isn't really a movie for everyone. If you're looking for a film that has a good story, a lot of character development, or a steady buildup towards anything worthwhile then this isn't the movie for you. This is the type of movie that is designed just to make you laugh. You're not really supposed to think about what's happening or why it's happening. You're just supposed to have fun with it and enjoy the moment at hand. If you can follow something like Family Guy and laugh at the humor in that, then you shouldn't have a problem with Anchorman. You'll enjoy the comedy for what it is and like it says in the narration at the beginning of the film, you'll probably wind up thinking...one anchorman was more man then the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I personally feel that Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men alive.  He makes everything he touches hysterical and worth watching, to me at least.  I do know those who can't stand him...those people I am not friends with...HA.  Anyways, so that said I couldn't believe it took me so long to see `Anchorman' but it was just one of those movies that slipped through the cracks for me, despite the fact that all my friends kept insisting I watch it.  So, after watching `Talladega Nights' I just knew I had to see `Anchorman' ASAP.<br /><br />While I don't feel it's as much a riot as `Talladega Nights', `Anchorman' still holds my attention and induces quite a few belly laughs.  The whole idea of Ron Burgandy (Ferrell) fighting to keep his position as the favored anchorman after the hot young thing Veronica Corningstone (Applegate truly holding her own against this hilarious cast) comes into the station and threatens to steal his thunder.  Aided by his all male posse, including Paul Rudd, David Koechner (gets a bit obnoxious and annoying at times) and the hilarious Steve Carell, Ron does his best to distress Veronica in an attempt to get her fired and or to quit.<br /><br />The whole erection scene (sorry, I had to bring it up) while at first had me thinking "not again, does every comedy have to do this" really turned out to be one of the funniest scenes in the film...that whole "It's an optical illusion" line was brilliant.  I've only seen the unrated version so I'm not sure what all is different so if I mention a scene that you haven't seen or that you don't see after renting it then I'm sorry...must not be on the theatrical version.  Just look for the Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins cameo scene...it's outrageous, unrealistic and brilliantly hysterical.<br /><br />Great Ferrell comedy that is sure to please any of his true fans, and just might gain him new ones.  I'd recommend `Talladega Nights' over this film only because it never lets up and never gets even the slightest bit annoying...</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>I'll get this out of the way immediately, this is not a film that will appeal to everyone. It is what could be only described as a 'marmite' film. Some will adore its comic irreverence, and some will quite frankly 'not get it'. To me personally this is my favourite comedy of all time, and quite possibly my favourite film in general. I will attempt to not use any of the classic quotations from this film as it will spoil the brilliance of hearing them for the first time.<br /><br />The story is set in a sexist news studio in San Diego, America. The lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) falls for a woman at a party, and she incredibly, to Ron, rejects his not so subtle advances. The next day that very woman, Veronica Corningstone is appointed as a journalist in their very newsroom. Cue brilliant pick-up attempts, witty one liners, emotional breakdowns and scenes that don't leave the mind for weeks. Brick is the lovable fool, who interrupts with odd - yet hilarious - lines at random parts of the movie, he is the weatherman. The sports commentator Champ Kind, is a more roguish persona, who suffers a mental breakdown after Ron decides to go on a date with Veronica instead of attending their monthly pancake breakfast. Yes it's that irrelevant. Bryan Fantana is the 'man on the scene' and is the typical ladies man. All the acting in this film deserves to be noted, they all convey the different personalities of the charchters superbly and somehow without laughing.<br /><br />All in all I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone with an irrelevant humour or in need of something up-lifting, which this film oddly fulfils. A cult classic in the form of Zoolander. Do watch out for the battle scene and a cameo from Jack Black. Pure comic brilliance.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years ? translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne?s World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn?t recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn?t until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.<br /><br />As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn?t matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego?s top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron?s world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given ?female? oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego?s top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.<br /><br />The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny ? it may not be gut-busting but it doesn?t come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy?s news world. It wasn?t that she doesn?t work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn?t as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependant on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn?t have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner?s Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material is more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell?s Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don?t live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.<br /><br />Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such as Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film?s main problems is that there isn?t anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn?t get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it does graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn?t what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn?t shown in the comedy. Remember the film?s trailer? Some of the trailer?s more entertaining moments don?t make into the film (?Well, I?m getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again? ? ?Fantastic!?) but according to the film?s director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn?t expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>How could you not love this film? It has a 5 star cast! Will Ferril from old school, Christina Applegate from Married with Children, and special appearances by Ben Stiller, Vince Vaun, Jack Black, and Luke Wilson. The performances were hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing. As watching the film I noticed that there is other cast members from SNL in this film. Will Ferril plays Ron Burgundy so well. Will Ferril would have made a great anchorman for an actual T.V. These actors/actresses play there characters so well its hard to believe this is a movie. <p>[the plot] Set in 1970s San Diego, this is the story of local TV anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell), God's gift to the ladies and the area's most respected reader of the teleprompter of the news fit to be known, who finds his position challenged by an ambitious female newscaster Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) who, unlike Ron, actually knows something about journalism. Ron and Veronica then begin dating and fall in love. But when Ron couldn't make it on time for the news they needed a replacement, which was Veronica. Veronica nails it and Ron gets mad because he didn't really take her serious when she said she wanted to be an anchorwomen. Then it becomes a fued between the two. A hilarious film.<br /><br />If you love Will Ferril you will not be disapointed by his performance in this film. He is funny through out the whole film and doesn't get annoying. If you love comedies, this film is definitley for you.

Set in the 1970s, this biting satire does for the television news industry what Zoolander did for the fashion industry. Petty personalities, insipid news content about pregnant zoo animals, blow dried hair and toothy smiles, paltry humor, and blatant sexism remind us of the very thin border between film's fiction and whatever constitutes "real" news. Just last night on our "real" news the weatherman reported that San Jose had "four one hundredths of an inch of rain." And he was serious. Watched as parody and farce, this film works. Network news has come a long, long way from the comforting, paternalistic intonations of Walter Cronkite.</p></br><a href="../users/A17JVVAKWEB0M.html">A17JVVAKWEB0M</a><br/><p>Ron Burgundy would have made an interesting character on Saturday Night Live.  Will Ferrell's skills of observation and exaggeration create a familiar, self-absorbed anchorman ripe for satire.  In five minute sketches, Burgundy would have been yet another hilarious contribution to SNL from Ferrell.  But an entire movie?<br /><br />Unlike Buddy from "Elf" or other creations from SNL alums like Austin Powers, Ron Burgundy simply lacks the substance to carry a film.  After the first few scenes, he is just not funny anymore.  Without juvenile bathroom humor, crude sex jokes and a supporting cast filled with exaggerated, freakishly cliched sidekicks, not many laughs would be found in this movie.<br /><br />With that said, Ferrell should be commended for once again tackling a role that requires him to look foolish and unattractive, while asking the audience to laugh AT him (not WITH him).  After equally brave choices in "Elf" and "Old School", Ferrell really seems to be an actor who doesn't take himself too seriously and is without any fear of becoming labeled a "clown".</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than "Anchorman" is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Anchorman" is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day.  As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.<br /><br />"Anchorman" is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through.  That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces.  Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.<br /><br />Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the "sidekick" role.  In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay.  "Brick Tamland" provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.<br /><br />Overall, I consider "Anchorman" to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce.  There are so intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film.  Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration.</p></br><a href="../users/A2INL3AYAT6325.html">A2INL3AYAT6325</a><br/><p>I had caught this film on pay cable when it came on in 2005.<br /><br />Surprised me I liked it.<br /><br />At the time of release, it was original idea for a film I thought.<br /><br />It is the ONLY Will Ferrell film I like where he is the lead character.<br /><br />Now of course EVERY ear he does a similar film like all the sports films basketball, NASCAR & ice skating where this good Anchorman idea keeps being repeated.<br /><br />The cast were perfect in their roles.  Did NOT need Luke Wilson though.  Unnecessary.  And, I do NOT like the Wilson brothers.<br /><br />Now, the DVD package it's.<br /><br />I expected more since it is a "Unrated, Uncut, & Uncalled For!".<br />1.  Has those HORRIBLE little flaps tat are a pain & terrible to have to open up.<br />2.  NO chapter search list or any information on the film inside.<br /><br />Good soundtrack for the film</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>This is one of will ferrells best movies, thi movie is hillarious it down right funny, if you have'nt seen it then you should</p></br><a href="../users/AE4JNORCLW8F6.html">AE4JNORCLW8F6</a><br/><p>Anchorman has an out-of-the-box, totally hilarious flow that can't be denied. The cast is perfect, writing and plot development is excellent and the laughs don't stop coming. It's difficult to wrap up this film in a review, but if you're familiar with the unconventional humor of Will Ferrell, you won't want to miss this one. One of his best. Watch with friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>Anchorman just happens to be one of those movies that have a very interesting concept but it can seem incredibly stupid at the same time. I can't lie because I am a big Will Ferrell fan so I was very hype to see it when it came out so I went right to the theatres. I came out with a lot of anger and all I could say was it was horrible. After seeing it in the theatre for some reason I bought the DVD and now I can't stop watching it. See these types of movies need a tremendous amount of nothing to watch them. What I mean by nothing is you need no intelligence, thinking, or even concentration because everything in Anchorman is easy to get.<br /><br /> It's hilarious but to people that actually watch movies like this or Napoleon Dynamite and every other movie like them while being in a smart mode they fail to see it for what it really is. That's the problem today, people are too concerned with everything but what's actually funny in the films and they get mad at them. You have to be laid back and relaxed for a movie like anchorman and most of all you need a huge goofy sense of humor. I leave you with this advice; movies like this are always better when you have a goofy buddy to watch them with. If you have someone that laughs with you at what would seem to be dumb situations things become a little more worth watching. Anchorman will most likely not be funny the first time you watch it but it will grow on you and get funnier and funnier.</p></br><a href="../users/AJ9W09EUQPAKE.html">AJ9W09EUQPAKE</a><br/><p>70s throwback movies seem to go through a minor vogue period last year - as well as 'Anchorman', 'Starsky and Hutch' made it big last summer. Will Farrell stars as Ron Burgundy - scotch loving, smooth haired, charming, big fish in a small pond newscaster in 1970s San Diego, loved by all with his catchprase 'Stay Classy San Diego'. He bestrides a ludicrous team of reporters such as the retarded weatherman Brick and sexist primal jackass reporter Brian. This absurd assembly is shattered by the arrival of the stereotypically glamorous Veronica Corningstone. Ron preposterously seduces her, despite her obvious intial misgivings and this upsets the boys culture around the newsroom. Things go badly wrong for Will after he accidently hits a moustacioed biker with a burrito, leading ultimately to Veronica taking over as chief anchor.<br /><br />The movie is, primarily, a comedy, and it is funny. So it succeeds. But it could have been so much better. Instead of being a tight, acerbic satire of early feminist breakthroughs in sexist, boys dominated 1970s institutions. Instead, it is dominated by Farrell (who tailored the script himself) to such an extent that it becomes a showcase for him to experiment with all his goofy comic talent. Thus the comedy falls from the rank of those that are both funny and meaningful and holds itself shabbily together as a reduculous goofball romp. Shame.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Will Ferrell is one of the few actors from Saturday Night Live that actually has some talent and will have a very long movie career if he so desires (most of the other SNL actors who could have long movie careers are dead, though).  ANCHORMAN was a movie that Ferrell helped write and his comic touch is all over the screen play.  Ferrell can get laughs, but he also knows when to restrain himself and not play things so over the top. In fact, in some ways Ferrell is one of the most British American comic actors around.<br /><br />The subtitle of ANCHORMAN is "The Legend of Ron Burgundy" because the main character in the story is Burgundy (Ferrell).  Burgundy is the lead anchor for channel 4 news in San Diego during the mid 1970s.  The people of the city love him and he is adored everywhere he goes. But Burgundy lives a very lonely life, spending most of his nights alone at home talking to his dog Baxter.  Burgundy's closest friends are his co-workers from the station: reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).  The four friends make a formidable group and are the top rated news team in San Diego.<br /><br />Burgundy's life changes the day that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) appears at a Channel 4 party. Burgundy immediately falls for the mysterious woman but she leaves him cold. The next day Burgundy and company learn that the studio heads have hired Corningstone as a bow to the changing times as their newest reporter.  What follows is one bizarre boy meets girl story and a slight warning about romantic relationships in the workplace.<br /><br />When I first saw the previews for ANCHORMAN, I thought it was going to be a dumb movie like DODGEBALL. However, as noted earlier, Ferrell knows when to draw the line and though there are a few sexual jokes [...],the movie isn't that raunchy. Ferrell, well, Will Ferrell is Will Ferrell and he's a great comedian. Applegate turns in a great performance as the lovestruck/career-ladder climbing Corningstone. Steve Carell steals just about every scene he is as the mentally-challenged Tamland, as does the Burgundy's dog Baxter.<br /><br />ANCHORMAN has a fun time mixing up movie genres and throwing in pop culture references. In one of the best scenes of the movie, a major gang fight breaks out between the news teams at the 3 major networks, the public broadcast station, and the Hispanic station. During the fight, movie references as varied as PLANET OF THE APES and SPARTACUS are thrown in.  Later in the movie, Baxter, in a Lassie-like moment, saves some people from being ripped to shreds by a ferocious bear. Nevertheless, even with such humorous scenes such as these, ANCHORMAN remains like a typical boy meets girl story.  Keep it classy, San Diego.</p></br></body></html>

If you show your co-workers up, you could end up eliminated--either transferred or fired.  That's what PC Nicholas Angel found out.  When he got 9 Commendations in one year, the London officials promoted him and sent him to a model village, Sandford, where there hadn't been a murder in years.<br /><br />Angel quickly discovered Sandford was too good to be true.  His predecessor probably found out the same thing--but he went loony.  Angel, with the help of his cop-movie loving partner, Danny, decides to clean up the town instead.<br /><br />I laughed so hard at points my sides hurt, but there were also a couple of places where I felt a little ill.  "Hot Fuzz" poked fun at just about every US police film notion. The puns flew and sometimes so did the blood and gore.<br /><br />What _wasn't_ funny was how possible murder could be passed off as an accident in a small town.  It's been 4 hours and I'm still shaking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Simon Pegg is a hoot as Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a Metropolitan copper so good at his job, he makes everyone else look bad. He's transferred to the supposedly quiet village of Sandford, Gloucestershire as punishment for his success -- where, of course, he stumbles onto a series of murders made to look like accidents and can't get the local constabulary to take him seriously. But everything changes when he puts on the dark glasses and puts the hammer down. From there, it's an unbelievable mix of shoot-outs, car chases, slo-mo action, and numerous similar homages to the films of John Woo and others. It's unusual for a film to be successful as both a high-octane action flick AND a dryly hilarious comedy, but this one manages it.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>From the creators of Shaun of the Dead come this great police comedy/parody.  Every bit as clever as Shaun with even greater polish.  This movie is very funny..though some of it is dry British style humor that doesn't always appeal to everyone.  For horror fans that are thinking about giving this one a try, I would certainly recommend it.  This is a murder mystery movie and some of the deaths are pretty graphic.  The R-rating comes from the blood.  The language and the sexual innuendo are very mild.  All around good story from a great team.  Certainly worth checking out.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>I was expecting this movie to be just ok even though I read so many great reviews becouse I liked Saun of the Dead but it wasnt that funny to me but it was still ok.So going into to this I thought it would probly be good but not great.Come to find out it was the latter.Through the first hour of this two hour film I thought I was right it was good and pretty funny up to that point and then it just totally took off for the next hour I was totally caught by surprise how funny it was and there was alot of off the wall action and some crazy death scene's in there so be for warned there is some violence in this movie but it's really cool violence.For me the second part of this movie is the most fun I've had with a movie in a long time I watched it again the next night.A must buy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Hot Fuzz(released Apr/07)stars everyone's fave English sensations Simon Pegg and Nick Frost starring as Constable Nicholas Angel and Constable Butterman,respectively.Pegg and Frost are closerthanthis in real life and they also brought in their friend director/writer Edgar Wright,and when all is said and done they whipped up a winner of a movie.<br />The plot takes place in London,England(I had to say that because I live in that city in Ontario!).Const.Angel is a supercop of sorts,graduating highest in his class from the police academy,earning all sorts of awards in his career and basically showing up every other living and breathing person to put on a cop uniform within the greater London area.One day he is pulled into his superiors offices to be told that he is to be transferred to a sleepy little town miles north of the city,called Sandford.<br />He arrives in town only to almost immediately arrest the entire clientele of a local there,thereby,for all intents and purposes,shutting it down.One of the people he arrests that night happens to be the son of the Police Chief Frank Butterman.The town(and the movie as a whole)is populated with a plethora of off the wall characters and Angel has a tough time of it fitting in.One day he stumbles onto a clue that something is very amiss in Sandford after a local business man gets blown up in his own home,and that the suspected perpetrator might be the owner of a local supermarket.Then the local writer of a newspaper is killed trying to provide Angel with an important clue and Angel soon after witnesses the murder of a shopkeeper,dying horribly by gardening shears.The perp is a hooded figure and when Angel gives chase,as fast as he is,he cannot fathom the  unbelievable speed of the pursued who he loses.<br />Circumstances are now rolling along like an out of control snowball with his colleagues all sneering at his bravado and no one in which to turn to for help.He is jumped upon at his apartment but manages to survive the attack and he eventually uncovers a meeting situated at the old churchyard with all the local business leaders gathered around a table like a witches coven,in hooded garb.He runs but is captured by who he thought was his only friend Constable Butterman,who takes him outside the village to send him packing back to London.As he is about halfway back he is at a rest stop and it is there he decides to stop running and return to clean up the town once and for all.<br />Upon arrival he immediately enters the police station,obtains a load of illegal weapons,straps them on,obtains a horse and rides down the main street to stop near the towns square.Wearing shades and ready for action he is in short order shot at by all of the business people involved in the twisted plot in Sandford.Constable Butterman didn't believe Angel before but he quickly realizes there has to be something to it as he rises to the occasion to help his friend.They take down most of the opposition but the Police Chief and the local supermarket owner escape by car.The Police Chief runs into a tree while Angel and the supermarket owner duke it out in a miniature village.It all ends as the owner gets impaled on a miniature church's steeple.<br />The movie comes to an end as all the towns business men and women involved are arrested and booked and Angel and Butterman,a year on,are close friends and keeping the streets of Sandford safe from any and all criminal element.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable from more than a few different angles,this film is both funny and irreverent and boasts a wonderful supporting cast of actors to help them in their 121 minute romp on celluloid.Timothy Dalton is among the cast and his impalement on the church steeple is nothing short of cringing....ouch! Kind of a turnabout is fair play thing,as it was Dalton's character that sent a church steeple down upon the reporter who was to clue Angel in,earlier in the flick.<br />This three disc set is nothing short of fantastic.The first disc is pretty much what is contained in the single disc release but it gets much better.Into the second disc and third you will discover facts,trivia and behind the scenes info that will keep you enthralled for literally hours,in fact FIVE to be exact!I can't possibly list all the features in detail but generally you are looking at:the video of their pre-release tour of the U.S. with the movie and its reactions at various points along the way with its two main stars and director Wright,and it's,well...you'll just have to watch to see,a plethora of deleted scenes and outtakes,commentaries on almost all the features,eight featurettes,a look at the S/FX,23 vid blogs,a look at Wright's first cop film,many other inside looks at just about every angle of the film making process including stunt driving training for the cars used in the film,etc,etc.Whew! If you loved the film you will love all of this stuff as they couldn't have done it up any better.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp,along with the dynamite sound.<br />All in all,this is as good as it gets folks for all fans of this movie;and I can't imagine who wouldn't or couldn't be one.A funny and irreverent look at the life of an overzealous English cop,Hot Fuzz has what it takes to get your adrenaline going but at the same time have you laughing in the aisles.Get it while the getting is still good.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AFXJ8U72MD6L.html">A1AFXJ8U72MD6L</a><br/><p>This is a fun, goofy film that delivers on the fun and is a satire on the buddy action films of our recent past.  Fans of SHAUN OF DEAD will recognize Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, and, for trivia buffs did you see two supporting actors who were Roman Patricians in HBO's ROME?  According to the inside rumors  Santa Claus was Peter Jackson and the ex girlfriend was Cate Blanchett but since both of them are masked its hard to verify.  Lots of gags and other such jokes with physical humor included.  Helps if you like British humor.  Timothy Dalton, former James Bond, plays a smarmy villain.  A lot of the story points are way way way way (waaaaaayyy!!!) over the top but if you go in knowing this is a goofy satire, well, you should be okay.  It helps if you've seen a lot of movie references they are making but it's not required for you to enjoy the film.  If you are a total movie buff a lot of the supporting cast were villains and foils in older action buddy pictures.  My favorite movie reference was in regards to what a cop said to Jack Nicholsan in CHINATOWN.  In closing what more is there to say but "Yarp" and you won't understand that reference unless you see the picture so check it out. HUMOR: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were great in this, just like Shawn of the Dead. Simon is a cop who is re-assinged to a small place where the crim rate is very low, yet the accident rate is so high. There are great and funny moments in this film. The main shootout at the end of the film was amazing. Nothing like an old lady using a machine gun.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>This is definitely the funniest comedy of 2007. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost make a great trio. With their knowledge of action movies deemed both good and bad, they make a motion picture that's filled with high-octane action, impressive suspense, magnificent slapstick humor, and tons of blood and guts. It may be a bit too long for some (two hours can be too much for a comedy), but I didn't find any tedium anywhere in the film. Mostly it's because I was too immersed in the characters and the comedy. Speaking of characters, Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and Danny Butterman (Frost) has to be one of the most popular duos of this generation. Like in Shaun of the Dead, they sure know how to be loved by those who're into action, suspense, and comedy. Timothy Dalton, along with the rest of the supporting comedic ensemble, makes this even more memorable. And David Arnold's score really something worth mentioning: the synthesizers along with the orchestra is a perfect combination for this sort of movie.<br /><br />If you love Shaun of the Dead and the Spaced TV series, then you'll probably get a kick out of Hot Fuzz if you're into mindless action and smart comedy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>This may be my first time coming out of a movie and not knowing whether I loved or hated a film. On one hand HOT FUZZ gave me a headache with it's loud action and constant inclusion of loud noises, caused by close-ups of several artifacts, constantly shown to irritate the very uptight lead. On the other, not too often do I laugh out loud at a movie several times, including at scenes where the joke is telegraphed well in advance (fascist............. hag!). In the modern Hollywood movie machine, the hardest thing to find is a comedy with actual laughs and HOT FUZZ is certainly that, just make sure to bring along a couple of aspirin !</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>We are very nearly through the first half of 2007 and I'm happy to report that HOT FUZZ is easily the funniest movie that I have seen so far this year.  I loved Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous film, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, and am delighted to report that this is every bit as funny at that one, if not funnier.<br /><br />The film concerns a highly decorated London police officer who is so good at his job that he is shunted off to an assignment in the country because he is so good he makes the rest of the force look bad.  Sanford would seem to be an impossibly idyllic place, winner several times of the top village in England award.  But it is a town that houses mysteries, which our hero Nick Angel gradually uncovers.  Most of the film should be predictable, but it is a credit to Wright and Pegg that it isn't.  Even the big ending, the week point in most such movies, is a delight.  Despite a lot of action and special effects and explosions it is never taken over by them.  It remains fresh and surprising to the very end.  Although the plot is surprisingly interesting for a comic romp, this would be a fun film without it.  The gags are consistently brilliant throughout and every one is executed marvelously.  This is a much slicker film than SHAUN OF THE DEAD was, though that wasn't in any way unpolished.<br /><br />The cast is a large one and they manage to bring the village of Sandford to life in convincing fashion.  Pegg is paired with Nick Frost, his costar in SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  The cast is littered with well-known actors such as Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward, Billie Whitelaw, Bill Nighy, Stephen Merchant, and Martin Freeman as well as a rich and varied cast of lesser-known performers.  The great thing about this is that the actors really enhance the film.  What I mean is that the success of SHAUN OF THE DEAD meant that they could hire a cast of better-known performers. Sometimes this can lead to a decline in the quality of projects (watch Robert Rodriguez's EL MARIACHI and DESPERADO back to back and you'll see how a no name cast can free up a director while a big name cast can inhibit one), but that absolutely didn't happen here.<br /><br />The film is littered with in jokes and cultural references.  There are also a number of references to SHAUN OF THE DEAD, but it isn't important to get any of these to enjoy the movie.  There are also, according to Edgar Wright, a couple of nice cameos, though we have to take his word for it since neither is recognizable.  The crazed Santa that stabs Angel near the beginning of the film is, says Wright, Peter Jackson, while his ex-girlfriend Jeanine is Cate Blanchett.  Again, we have to take his word for it because her entire scene is played with a surgical mask over her face so that all we see are a pair of eyes that do indeed look like they could belong to Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />As anyone can tell, I loved this movie.  I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AN8M401S8Y6DA.html">AN8M401S8Y6DA</a><br/><p>Home theater enthusiasts this could be your reference disc for sound.  I own about 40 hd dvds now and going by memory this is the best sounding one yet.  The 5.1 Dolby digital plus ex sound gives all speakers a thorough workout and  has your sub delivering tight bass for the majority of the movie.  Your receiver need not be turned up during dialogue that is also spot on and delivers crisp sound from the center channel.<br />As for the movie itself, director Edgar Wright re teams with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost along with a host of other actors from his earlier film Shaun of The Dead.  Hot Fuzz like Shaun pays homage to a genre of films, in this case the action film as opposed to horror.  However there are kills in Hot Fuzz that could rival most horror movies.  Homage is payed to the action genre, yet Hot Fuzz still creates a totally unique and creative spin all on it's own.  I like Shaun of the dead very much and I found Hot Fuzz to be more creative as there are plenty of plot twists and turns.  It is not a spoof at all and Edgar Wright takes his material seriously.  I would also mention Hot Fuzz is a great deal better than the action films it pays homage to.  Toss in a ton of laughs and this is one entertaining movie.<br />The picture quality was also dead on, i mention the sound quality so much because it was so amazing.<br />Hot Fuzz is already ranked on the internet movie database's top 250 films at number 140 currently.  It is also one of the highest reviewed films of the year earning a tomatometer of 90% out of 173 critic reviews.<br />Thanks for reading, share any thoughts.<br /><br />Hd-Dvd Bonus Features<br />-Outtakes<br />-Deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary<br />-The man who woudl be fuzz - Simon Pegg and Nick Frost act out a hilarious Hot Fuzz scene as Sean Connery and Michael Caine!<br />-Fuzz-O-Meter Select this feature and the trivia meter will run as you watch the film<br />-The fuzzball rally- U.S. tour piece-John Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright on their outrageous nationwide press tour<br />-And Many more hilarious features</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>British comedies remain an ilk of their own - smart, sassy, full of quips rendered so quickly that many are lost in the ether that propels the plot, and characters who often are such finely-honed parodies that they make us laugh at ourselves.  HOT FUZZ is a fine example and it is a film brimming with a cast of some of England's finest talent who seem to be having as much fun as the viewing audience.<br /><br />Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is one of London's finest new policemen, expecting a smart career in the big city, but instead is transferred by jealous superiors (including Bill Nighy) to a little village where his rigorous training seems wasted on the sleepy town.  After a first night's arrest of youthful pubsters and an inebriate driver, he reports to duty to discover the that his first 'arrest' is to be his partner PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) who just happens to be the slow son of the chief, Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent). The staff at the police station resembles a vaudeville team played by such fine actors as Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Timothy Dalton etc, not exactly what Angel had in mind as a career advancing  opportunity.  But soon enough the threads of evil that are beneath the silly facade of the village begin to unravel and what follows is a hilarious, almost Keystone Cop attack on the loonies in this take off of an Agatha Christie plot that curdled.<br /><br />And that only touches the surface of this witty little farce: the innuendoes pop up out of every situation, giving the astute viewer quiet chuckles throughout the film.  Hidden from obvious view are little vignettes by such luminaries as Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, and Peter Jackson! Director Edgar Wright, who wrote the script with Simon Pegg, knows his way around the genre and the result is an hysterically funny evening's entertainment.  Grady Harp, March 08</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg have proven that lightning can strike twice with their 2007 comedy "Hot Fuzz."  As was the case with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B2YR8I">Shaun of the Dead</a>," they are following in the grand tradition of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks in "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6BLWE">Young Frankenstein</a>" by embracing the genre they are spoofing and taking everything that happens dead seriously, which is what makes it hysterical.  Plus, once again Pegg and his sidekick Nick Frost have created characters that have heart, so that we care about them as well as laughing at their antics (of everything that happened in "Shaun of the Dead" the part I remember most is Shaun being upset over the fate of his mother).  So when we get to the final act of "Hot Fuzz" and the film actually slips into an even higher gear, we get to root them on all that harder.<br /><br />This time around Pegg is Sergeant Nicholas Angel, a guy who is no bumbling Inspector Closseau.  In fact, Sergeant Angel is so competent that his bosses want to get rid of him because he is making everybody else in the police service look bad.  So Angel is banished to Sanford, a perfect little English village supposedly devoid of crime.  Of course Angel finds cause to arrest just about everybody he runs into, only to be informed by his new boss, Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), that they look at things differently in Sanford.  Everybody is town speaks of "the Greater Good," and it seems that we are being set up for your standard story about a hard core true believer learning that the spirit of the law is as important as the letter of the law.  Angel is partnered with PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), and we have the requisite pair for the buddy part of the picture and it looks like all of the pieces are in place.<br /><br />However, there is something rotten in the village of Sanford, personified by Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton), the local rich guy.  There might not be any crime in Sanford, but there sure are a lot of accidents and Angel quickly figures out that these suspicious accidents might be sneaky murders.  The payoff for this whole bit is most decidedly English in nature, which is part of what makes it so funny, especially when old hands like Billie Whitelaw and Edward Woodward are playing some of the eccentric characters.  I do not know what the record is for most cuts in a film, but with "Hot Fuzz" film editor Chris Dickens has got to be in the running.  This movie is not just cut like an action film, it is cut like an action film on speed, which becomes another part of the fun.  An hour into this film I thought there was only a half-hour left, but it turned out we were only halfway through this entertaining film.  As for what I shall remember most from this action comedy, it would have to be the fate of the villain Skinner and one of the more memorable "boy, that has got to hurt" moments of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>That's kind of a surprising thing to hear, no? When you consider how many romantic comedies and whatnot that have been released this year, you'd think I'd have laughed more. Well, sort of. Some of them, such as Catch and Release and Because I Said So were not that funny or even charming (although I can stare at Mandy Moore all day). But now and then you see one that makes you forget all the bad ones you've seen and while it does have its flaws, Hot Fuzz is probably one of the funnier movies this year, and strangely enough, one of the better action ones too.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel is a remarkably talented police officer with exceptional skills and a strong devotion to the law. However this creates jealousy among the other London cops since he makes them look worse by comparison so they ship him off to the small town of Stanford, known for its low crime rate and multiple "Village of the Year" wins. Many in town are not too excited to have him there and friend Danny is the only one who follows him which is helpful since a number of murders have been happening. Who's behind it and can Nick get through the town's ineptitudes to solve the case?<br /><br />The last time director Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost made a comedic film was with the surprise hit, Shaun of the Dead. Combining horror violence with comedy, it was a nice mix although at times the horror kind of overtook the comedy parts. Now they've combined comedy with action movies, namely the buddy films with 2 cop partners having to solve a case and blow stuff up too. Here, it's used to great effect and while some jokes don't work (a mumbling farmer for one) you have others that are just hysterical. I bet lot of you will start quoting the "yarp/narp" thing after watching this.<br /><br />But how about the action? Well it mainly pops up at the end and until then we get some graphic murders that while nowhere the level of Hostel (although one involving a rooftop is a doozy), the film picks up at the end where it actually becomes exciting. Imagine that: a great shootout in a comedy movie. Sacre bleu! While it does do that quick editing used by a lot of new directors. you never lose track of the events. If there's one thing that slightly takes the film down is the pacing at the beginning. While I don't mind films that take awhile for the "real stuff" to get going such as Aliens which took near an hour for the first sign of the thing to show up, here it feels kind of long.<br /><br />Acting-wise you can always rely on the group to be funny without being less than real people. Simon Pegg for instance who played kind of a well-meaning slacker in Shaun plays the serious-as-hell Nicholas and he pulls if off without being unintentionally funny. We also get cameos from Bill Nighy of Dead Man's Chest/At World's End fame, Martin Freeman of the British version of the Office, Timothy Dalton and apparently even Peter Jackson in a quick cameo.<br /><br />Funny enough, released the same day as this on DVD was 300, a movie that wanted to be an epic even though it was strictly base entertainment. But for some reason Hot Fuzz is a comedy movie that kind of becomes a bit more. It's probably not the most important comedy this year but it's surely the funniest.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>A big "Yarrp" to the very English action movie Hot Fuzz. No, it's not as good as Shaun of the Dead, but it's not really a disappointment either even if the laugh count is a lot lower. Much of the film really isn't that funny, yet it gets by for much of its running time on sheer enthusiastic likeability. At times Edgar Wright's direction tries a little too hard and few of the many cameos have much to do (though a heavily disguised Cate Banchett makes a real virtue of her anonymity and Peter Jackson does turn up as a psycho Santa), but it's one of the very few films where the fun that the filmmakers seem to be having actually seems to translate to the finished product. As with Shaun, it's an inspired bit of gene-splicing, in this case a wonderful yet surprisingly logical cross between Agatha Christie and Jerry Bruckheimer, with a series of very English crimes - motivated by nothing so sordid as monetary gain or as logical as a criminal conspiracy but rather by something infinitely more respectable - culminating in 20 minutes of virtuoso mayhem that sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost shooting up the kind of quaint and picturesque village more used to the genteel Sunday teatime likes of The Vicar of Dibley and All Creatures Great and Small. Even the casting of the local Neighbourhood Watch is truly inspired, consisting of (among others), James Bond (Timothy Dalton, whose `supermarket slasher' gets my vote for Best Supporting Actor this year), Callan (Edward Woodward), Bellocq from Raiders of the Lost Ark (Paul Freeman), the nanny from The Omen (Billie Whitelaw) and the villain from Lethal Weapon 3 (Stuart Wilson). And there's been some real thought put into the disposal of the bad guys, which mirror the various murders in gruesomely exaggerated fashion via bear traps, model villages and sea mines. Very pleasing indeed - even the extras on the DVD are unusually entertaining. Yarrp.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this film.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" on HD DVD has great picture and excellent sound quality.<br /><br />Plenty of great humour...awesome action...very much a captivating work!<br /><br />This film is quite funny, and I highly recommend seeing it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I had never heard of this movie until it came out on HD DVD.

The characters were great while just trying to do their jobs as law enforcement officers in a small English village. The supporting cast was great. Timothy Dalton was an extremely slippery villain who facilitates all the killing within the town. The movie does serve as homage to some of the recent crime movies produced in the US. IN the process what you get is a silly take on the depressed state of filmmaking within the United States.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>this film is pretty damn funny, most people will not understand this film because they dont have a movie IQ. a great comedy to watch if IF your not dumb. the reason i say this is because there are alot of people who don't understand what a spoof is ( u know why you are) and so they overlook it.<br />but if u cant understand this then dont bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>****This review may cointain possible spoilers****<br /><br />I have not seen "Shaun of the Dead" and can't compare the two but I am sure that "Hot Fuzz" is screamingly funny. The contrast between the first hour of a gentle comedy and the second part with the outrageous twists and turns and bizarre jaw-dropping events is hilarious by itself. The idea of keeping the picturesque sleepy charming village of Sandford the safest and the most perfect place in the country no matter what even if not original was clever. Two main characters, Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, the finest cop London ever seen but could not take for too long and Nick Frost as Danny Butterman, Angel's partner in Sanford, the loyal Sancho Panza to Angel's Don Quixote, are great together because the film took its time to develop their relationship and to make them real and interesting enough to root for them. There are not just the references to and the parodies of the big budget American actions flicks. No, if you look closer, you'll find the homage even to a Woody Allen's film and to the works of John Waters -"Serial Dad", anyone? The acting is universally good and for me the movie that stars Jim Broadbent, Martin Campbell, Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy and my favorite Mr. 007, Timothy Dalton is definitely worth watching. Oh, I almost forgot - there is a very compelling performance by a swan!<br /><br />IMO, the creators got a little carried away in the final part and made it a little too long but "Hot Fuzz" is still one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time and I don't remember the last time I was laughing in the theater so hard and so loud.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VABWDOUQLULZ.html">A1VABWDOUQLULZ</a><br/><p>I love Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.

You need to know that, because some people in the audience were shocked to see several people die in, well, clinical detail, shall we say. When the second half of the movie descended into all out war, many (myself included) were swept away by it. Others, unfortunately, staggered out of the theater a bit ... shell-shocked. Visually smart and filled with winks and homages to other films, this is a fat-free film. Everything's a set up, and everything has a pay-off. So pay attention class! (Okay, pay attention the second time you see it. There's enough gold to be mined that you'll be back.)</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>It's definitely not in the "hysterical" category. Moments of understated humor throughout, nothing side-splitting; more overt in the second half. The main character spoofs action movie staples and lines. The main plot point, though, the reason for all the killings, when finally revealed, *is* hilarious indeed, one of the funniest concepts ever, almost worth watching the whole movie.<br /><br />Some quite grisly denouements, one or two of which are guaranteed to make you wince. The explosive ending is completely unnecessary. Timothy Dalton is wonderfully greasy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I couldn't help but to laugh throughout this film. The beginning of Hot Fuzz presents us with a cop called Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) who has the best arrest record in his station (400% better to be exact). But while in America this would be a cause for admiration and pats on the back, here it's bad form. He's making everyone else look bad. So therefore he's sent to the country, to a place that has no crime and a place that has won the village of the year competition. Which he later found himself bored in and became part of a ragtag police force... umm... service and teamed up to a childlike Police Constable Danny Butterman (Frost). Their differences take most of the first half of the movie and just turn out to be hilarious. The later parts consist of gruesome deaths and action packed gun fights which blended very well with the story line. Also, what I found funny here are the reasons behind the deaths of some locals which are very ridiculous compared to a more logical explanation rendered by Angel (well illogical deaths happen a lot in slasher films... correct me if I'm wrong). Though the film took two hours but the unlikely duo will not disappoint you, their mere presence makes the movie entertaining.<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes occurs quite early in the movie. The plot if is rather silly, too crazy to be true. Though it serves well since its a parody in the first place. But the portrayal of these British actors makes the film believable. They have filled it with so many distinguishable actors that contributed very nicely for the greater good of the film.<br /><br />Aside from the main characters, my personal favorites is the baritone-voiced Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) and the jolly yet creepy Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent... he acts so natural that something in him makes me believe that he was one of my past bosses. Plus only few movies can manage to make likable villains. However, despite the wonderful parodying and the enjoyable action-comedy, there's something lacking in this film, and I think it's a matter of heart. The characters do develop and grow and we see glimpses of the same heart that we saw in its predecessor, but it's all been glossed and the film, I think concentrates a little too much on the parody, the action and the comedy and just a tad too little on the relationship between Nick and Danny. That's not to say it's not believable that they are friends, but it's just not the core of the film. I think that's what made "Shaun" very strong, on top of the comedy and homage. Hot Fuzz doesn't center in on it, more centering on the action and the homage than the buddy and loses a little because of it. Nonetheless, it's highly enjoyable, especially for movie lovers and I still recommend it as a high mark in buddy action comedies, even as a parody.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>While I really enjoyed Hot Fuzz, it falls well short of Shaun of the Dead. To me, the humor in Hot Fuzz wasn't as funny as the previous film, but the action sure made up for it. This movie also boasts ample gore and a couple of inventive death sequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funny guys and I hope to see them team up many more times in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>Another Simon Pegg I love! very funny, Hot Fuzz is a different and silly movie that I enjoyed, you should give it a try on netflix or rental :)</p></br><a href="../users/A3B87UZLPCF0HW.html">A3B87UZLPCF0HW</a><br/><p>Hot Fuzz is as much fun as I've had in a movie theatre all year.  A send-up of American action movies, particularly those made by noted hack Michael Bay, Hot Fuzz achieves what Bay's films could only imagine, they're both awesome and entertaining. This is one of the few films where your side hurts from laughing, but you have to stop clutching it, to cover your eyes from sudden explosions of gore or brutality. Filled with scene stealing performances, from Jim Broadbent as the chief, to Timothy Dalton as a diabolical supermarket supervisor, Hot Fuzz is easily the best comedy and action film of the year so far, and shouldn't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>From the makers of "Shaun of the Dead" comes "Hot Fuzz," a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force.  Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect?  Heavens no.  In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him.  Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England.  At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond.  And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions.  Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.<br /><br />In its initial stages, "Hot Fuzz" is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values.  The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact.  It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon.  Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it.  Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as Angel's inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like "Point Break" and "Bad Boys II" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford.  There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others.  And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences.  Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.<br /><br />Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of "Hot Fuzz," but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company.  And that's saying quite a lot these days.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NYQCLFQRTI74.html">A2NYQCLFQRTI74</a><br/><p>His superiors being jealous of his perfect record, Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is transferred from London to the seemingly crime-free village of Sandford.

Well, its good, but a bit long. I really wanted to see how the movie ended, so the story was good, and the humor was there, but about mid movie, I had figured it out and just wanted to see the ending.  The movie revolves around London's best police officer getting transferred to Samford because he's to good, I.E. he makes the rest of the cops look bad.  Well, little did he know he was going to walk a nice country villiage and discover a hidden secret about the population and the smoke and mirrors the town is built on.  Anyway, if you liked Shawn of the Dead, then the humor in this one is perfect for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>From the same crew that brought us the smashing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz gleefully satires the mainstream, tough guy, bug budget, bullet-laden action films that big studios always push out on us.  Simon Pegg stars as supercop Nicholas Angel, whose action filled career in the big city comes to an unexpected end when he is reassigned to a quiet, quaint, and overly boring village.  Or so we think.  Soon enough, people start meeting mysterious, and bloody, demises, and Angel suspects foul play is afoot.  Teaming up with the dim-witted Danny (Nick Frost), Angel soon finds himself over his head to say the least.  Make no mistake that Hot Fuzz is incredibly funny and instantly enjoyable for those who enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and longtime action movie junkies alike.  Director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Pegg clearly have a love for the genre that allows them to have such casual fun, even though the film never feels like the labor of love that Shaun of the Dead did.  Despite that though, Hot Fuzz is a blast (if a bit overlong) and features a bevy of star talent including Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Cranham, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Cate Blanchett.</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Sergeant Nicholas Angel is good.  Too good.  An expert in virtually every aspect of police work, Mr. Angel is an example of the kind of supercop that Bruckheimer & Friends make fireball-fueled and car-chase-crazy movies about every day of the week.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DKDUR">Bad Boys II</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GUJZ4G">Point Break</a>, for example.<br /><br />These kinds of flicks provide the grist for Edgar Wright's "Hot Fuzz," a movie that takes almost every buddy cop cliche in the book and adds the same dose of wry humor and half-glimpsed sight gags that made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a> an equally delicious satire of horror films.<br /><br />"Fuzz" has some of the same faces as "Shaun of the Dead."  Simon Pegg returns as Angel, a man whose jealous London peers (including acting heavyweights Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman, and Steve Coogan) send him packing to the quaint cottage community of Sandford, a village so tweedy and polite that a man's missing swan is big news.  You half expect Sgt. Angel to turn the corner and see locals crafting homemade ranch dressing.<br /><br />Of course, things aren't exactly as they seem, and that goes double for the town's stellar lack of crime.  Angel, who is incapable of "turning off" his brain, joins his partner, the stumbly, bumbly, chummily Danny Butterman (Nick Frost playing, yet again, a man whose brain hardly ever seems to be on) as they work to unravel the mystery behind the town's cobbled, rustic veneer.<br /><br />It takes awhile, but that's only because "Hot Fuzz" doesn't want to leave any cliche unused.  Things get a little ludicrous, but, in spite of its frenetic music video editing and vicious murder scenes, this movie is all about ludicrousness.  The twists and turns are part and parcel for this kind of happy homage, which even gives a nod to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006HBUA">Scooby-Doo</a>.  Listen carefully and you'll hear a line that's too close to "I would've gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids" to be an accident.<br /><br />Watch carefully, too.  Wright and Penn have stacked jokes upon jokes, which is a good thing, since the movie appears to have about five different endings, each one more outrageous than the first.  Although things drag a bit near the end, it's the subtle background winks (a set of twins you don't know are twins until the end), the script's subtle finesse (listen and watch for someone named Aaron), and the super-duper subtle cameos (Cate Blanchett who you probably won't recognize, and an uncredited Peter Jackson as a blink-and-you'll-miss-him Santa Claus killer) that really make this flick work, in spite of its sometimes-ridiculous excesses.<br /><br />Anyway, the kinds of films "Hot Fuzz" is riffing off of aren't known for much more than their ridiculous excesses.  And although subtlety is an odd thing to look for in a film that is all about men with guns jumping sideways through the air, you don't need to worry.  There's still plenty of in-your-face action to light up the screen, including a very graphic head crushing, a critical car chase (there's that swan again!), and even a few great, big, chubby fireballs.<br /><br />Bruckheimer would be proud.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>Hot Fuzz has won a lot of critical acclaim. It is not the sort of film you would dislike. Simon Pegg is absolutely great as a police officer who's been transferred to a small town in England from London. He is a thorough professional and takes his job a tad too seriously but he's stuck in a peace loving place like Sandford. At Sandford (small town) , he manages to find a few clues here and there as to murders which are made to look like accidents. The film is really fast because there are many one second shots and the movie dictates it's own pace. It is a good watch for almost all kinds of viewers. However, I felt the film was a tad too self indulgent in terms of it's comical structure. There are no overtly funny scenes because the storyline doesn't leave much room for humor. Humor is however squeezed out, almost cheesy sometimes. This is not a bad film, just isn't a standout either. One might disagree but "Death Proof" is my film of the year. Watch that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If you enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006A9FKA">Shaun of the Dead</a>, you're going to feel an irresistible pull toward HOT FUZZ. Done in similar fashion and with familiar names, Hot Fuzz is an action flick that loves to take jabs at those cop and western films we so loved growing up with. Everything from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304698682">Pale Rider</a> (an old Clint Eastwood film) to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004STUL">Bad Boys</a> is referenced in some fashion, and they will most likely tickle your funny bone.<br /><br />Instead of deadbeat zombies, though, this time we've got a sleepy little town with a deadly secret. Feeling very <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002W4UDE">STEPFORD WIFE</a>-ish, a highly successful police officer named Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is forced out of his undefeated duties as London cop-extraordinaire and into the dull and mundane town of Sandford. Partnered with the chubby and inept Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel learns to slow down but not before discovering a few strange things about his new town. They've won, every year for some time now, an award for being the best town in England. Not much to argue with there. But Nick Angel soon sees death lurking here and there (and when I say death, I mean scythe and all!) Townsfolk are cut down and the local constabulary simply wave them off as accidents. But to Nick these are NOT plain old mishaps.<br /><br />A conspiracy theory soon engulfs Nick's solo investigation and we find our lone hero riding a pale horse into town while loaded for bear (queue whistling Eastwood soundtrack here). The big question, though, is can he trust his lame partner, Danny, to back him.<br /><br />Battles and bloodshed fill the screen as Nick finds himself at odds with everyone in Sandford. From blowing away the clergy to drop-kicking an octogenarian in the face, Nick has his arms, legs and other appendages busy keeping himself alive as much as solving these supposed murders.<br /><br />There are a ton of great lines in the film, showing that writer/actor Simon Pegg has some significant screenwriting abilities (one of my favorite lines was after Nick and Danny watched Bad Boys and Nick said, "Well, I wouldn't argue that it wasn't a no holds barred, adrenaline fueled thrill ride. But there is no way you can perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork." And I enjoyed Danny's, "By the power of Greyskull!" moments, too.)<br /><br />Making parodies of previously serious or scary films seems to be Pegg's and Frost's forte. And they do it exceptionally well. Although I think Shaun of the Dead is the gauge by which their future works will be judged, including this one, I also think they've hit upon something that isn't bathroom humorish like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004Z4WQ">Scary Movie</a> films/franchise. The dialogue and action fit together well and are meant for those who enjoy their laughter with a little more thought and quite a few in-jokes.<br /><br />I still hold Shaun of the Dead as a much more entertaining film, but this one rates up there well enough, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>I loved "Shaun of the Dead," Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's previous collaboration.  It was a wonderful homage to horror movies--both a parody and, oddly enough, a horror movie in and of itself.  "Hot Fuzz" takes that concept one step further--by combining parody and action, it creates a self-aware action movie that stands as both a parody and one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see.<br /><br />Nick Angel is a top London cop--he's so good, he's making the rest of the force (excuse me, that's SERVICE) look bad.  So they ship him out to Sanford, a peaceful village that hasn't seen a murder in 20 years.  Or has it?  As Angel befriends the Inspector's son (and fellow policeman officer), he begins to see that Sanford isn't what it seems; the murder rate is nill, but the accident rate is astronomical.  And when a local business owner keeps showing up at the scenes of accidents...could something fishy be going on in this peaceful English village?<br /><br />Indeed, something is.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver knock-out performances yet again, as does the superb supporting cast (including Timothy Dalton, who manages to steal most of his scenes--not an easy task, considering the talent in this movie).  Pegg and Wright's writing remains top-notch; the movie is witty almost to the point of being unbearable.  I rented it Friday night, went out and bought it Saturday, and watched it twice more.  It's that good.  "Hot Fuzz" is quite simply one of the best comedies to come out in years; it is smart, funny, and just damn FUN.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that starts out great, in fact, the first hour & 25 minutes are fabulous & very witty!!<br /><br />Then this movie goes down hill and fast, as the last 30 minutes were the cheesiest and most unbelievable ever! The last 30 minutes of this movie totally ruined this movie for me. It just didn't jive with how the main character would act or the rest of the movie in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>Pegg and Wright have penned another side-splitter! Following the daunting success of "Shaun of the Dead," it seemed this duo was doomed to failure (just in the same way that Broken Lizard could never SEEM to live-up to their epic-success "Super Troopers"). Nonetheless, "Hot Fuzz" is equally as clever, insightful, and hysterical as their popular zombie flick. And, equally as niche: comedy-mystery! What's more, if you are hesitant to purchase this film for fear of not understanding "British humor," you can dismiss those worries entirely!! While this film's humor transcends cultural-boundaries, you may find it amusing that it makes constant reference to popular American film ("Point Break" and "Bad Boys" being the most obvious) and popular American culture (like Judge Judy). Moreover, it is helpful to watch the film with the captions on ... this way some of the  subtle word-play will be more easily caught (like the Judge Judy bit!!)<br /><br />Stylistically, the film is a gem! If only American comedy was this slick! The framing is spectacular! As well as the repetition of shape!! (Like the spiral of the tombola drum juxtaposed with the spiral of the church stair-case ... so smart, so funny, so very pleasing!!) And in "Hot Fuzz," you will find echoes of "Shaun of the Dead." Most prominent, you will note an emphasis on day-to-day rituals: "What will it be? (The pub)" "Do you want anything from the shop?" ... and then how these rituals are "turned on their head" by the film's conclusion. The result is deeply satisfying for the viewer. Likewise, you will find a similar soundtrack and use of cuts (like the "swish" sounds and quick cuts to indicate ritual). Again, both are tremendously successful and a hallmark of either Wright's direction or how this team elects to communicate ideas.<br /><br />If you dig cop-comedy, buddy-flicks, the previous works of Pegg and/or Wright, or (one of my favorite Broken Lizard films) "Club Dread" (another comedy-mystery), you should thoroughly enjoy "Hot Fuzz."</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>Talk about your 'twisted comedies'!

He starts to notice some unusual accidents around village life and starts to investigate them with both hilarious and chilling (as far as the film is concerned) consequences. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both excellent in this film and I found it to have a lot more laugh out loud moments in it than 'Shaun of the Dead'. Pegg is his funniest when he is being frustrated and pedantic when not utilizing his top policing skills in this sleepy, laid back village. Frost reminds you of a big soppy dog, as he eagerly learns from Peggs character and tries to emulate him, often to hilarious effect. Overall this is a fun film, with many hilarious scenes and gags, and although some of the violent scenes are pretty gross, they take a back seat to the humour in this film.

It's heartwarming, charming, outrageous and super memorable. If you've seen "Shaun of the Dead" expect the same smorgasbord of genres here. There's a little parody, a little "British TV" comedy, a little drama, a little mystery, a little horror... It's all here! I can honestly call this one of my favorite films.<br /><br />A CAUTION<br />There are a few comments in this film that I felt were incredibly misplaced. First off the use of the "c" word towards the middle of the film was uncalled for and somewhat that I believe will shock most american viewers. Not tasteful...<br /><br />Secondly, there are some extremely off color "double entendres" by the female cop that are just flat out gross. These moments are so scarce, you barely remember them when the film ends, but they're always annoying and most uncalled for.<br /><br />Thirdly, the film is extremely violent... Gushing blood and decapitation are played up for laughs (and I didn't find this element offensive) but if you are squeemish, I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Awesome movie!

The worst thing about the movie is that it drags too often. I can stand a few slow spots, but it occurs frequently in the movie. What saves the movie from being a complete bore are the few scenes that are absolutely hilarious! When it's funny, it's really funny. Nick Frost, once again, does a great job at playing the bumbling side kick who has an obsession with Action movies (particularly Point Break). Simon plays his character dead serious, as the character is ment to be played, but it makes the character not interesting. Overall, an average movie. It just leaves me wishing it was better than it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of SHAUN OF THE DEAD are back in this film of a spoof of a buddy cop blockbuster. Simon Pegg plays a London police officer that is so good at his job that he is forced to transfer to an assignment in the country in order to no longer make the rest of the officers in London look incompetent. Once in the country he is paired off with Nick Frost who plays a sad sack of the little village's police force who only has his job because his father is the chief of police.<br /><br />For a spoof this is a well-produced action adventure film. They have made good use of their bigger budget and this films R-rating comes from strong language. Even so this is fun to watch as the action picks up in the small and idyllic village of Sandford. A series of murders start Pegg's character investigating them though all others in the village believe they are just a series of accidents.<br /><br />There are many clich&eacute;s and homage's to other films, they are so numerous I could not possible list them. You will also see and hear references to their previous movie, SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Watch the movie and try to keep track of them. A funny spoof filled with action and worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Having never seen 2004's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B2YR8I">Shaun of the Dead</a>, I didn't know what to expect from director/co-screenwriter Edgar Wright's latest movie, which plays out like an Ealing Studios only-in-Britain comedy amplified on Tarantino-level steroids. The 2007 action farce achieves the impressive feat of being silly and smart, quite often at the same time, as Wright and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pegg show themselves to be cineastes with a sharp eye and nimble ear for satire. There are lots of derivative plot turns to track in this fish-out-of-water story, which shifts into a blazing, gun-toting thriller as a tribute to testosterone-driven, Jerry Bruckheimer-genre buddy movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005A3KS">Point Break</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J4X34">Bad Boys II</a>. Even the intentionally exploitative title fits the tone of this eminently enjoyable popcorn flick perfectly.<br /><br />With laser-sharp precision, Pegg stars as a straight-arrow aptly named Nicholas Angel, inarguably the best police officer in London. However, he is so good that he makes the rest of the force look ineffectual, which leads to his unceremonious transfer to a sleepy hamlet named Sandford. There he carries his duties quite seriously, which naturally puts him at odds with the casual townsfolk. But then a suspicious car accident occurs, and the plot escalates into a wild ride of contrived but often hilarious developments leading to an ambitious, cartoon-like series of exciting finales. Angel naturally needs a partner to succeed, and Nick Frost (looking a lot like Mark Addy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305622914">The Full Monty</a>) winningly plays schlubby Danny, a wannabe action hero who happens to be the devoted son of Frank Butterman, the village police chief. Together they uncover a plot that upends the entire community.<br /><br />There are lots of familiar faces in funny supporting turns - Timothy Dalton at his smarmy best (and looking well poised to inherit Christopher Plummer's villain roles) as the suspicious supermarket owner; Jim Broadbent as the seemingly benevolent Frank; Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall as a couple of sarcastic, mustachioed detectives; and in bit parts, Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan as a couple of London's befuddled finest and an uncredited Cate Blanchett as Angel's put-upon girlfriend Jeanine conveniently hidden by a forensic mask. The one-liners are funny enough, but what really resonate are the subtle, often throwaway shots that make fun of American movie conventions. Even though the film runs for over two hours, Wright and Pegg have paced the story with a dexterous mix of thrills, intelligence and laughs. Much of this successful hat trick is due to Chris Dickens' propulsive editing and a nifty combination of over-the-top stunts and visual effects. This film is quite an unexpected kick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H22I2RWE0HOV.html">A2H22I2RWE0HOV</a><br/><p>When you see the previews for Hot Fuzz and you look at the ridiculous title, you think that this is going to be Reno: 911 all over again.  When you buy the DVD on a whim and check it out, knowing that it has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost from Shaun Of The Dead in it, you are pleasantly surpised that it's not all that tongue-in-cheek, as the title and the previews suggest.  In fact, Hot Fuzz is a very well done movie chockful of English humor and bits and pieces of ultra-violence.  Much like Shaun Of The Dead, minus the zombies of course.  Definitely wasn't the dumb but funny movie I was expecting, Hot Fuzz is well-plotted with intelligent humor and over-the-top situations.<br /><br />Seargeant Nicolas Angel is sent to a sleepy little country village from London because he's literally such a great cop that he's making everyone else look bad.  Trying to fit in, and finding it extremely hard to do so, Angel is face with several grisly accidents that make him suspect the sleepy little village is not all that it seems.<br /><br />Written by Edgar Wright & Simon Pegg, this movie is not quite a classic, but definitely one I would recommend and watch again. If you liked Shaun Of The Dead or are just a fan of dry English humor, this will be a treat for you.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>Officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's top police officer.  He's the best at everything he does and in just a few years on the force has achieved more than the rest of the department put together.  He's an excellent officer, but is so good that he's making everyone around him look bad.  He's given a promotion that virtually exiles him to the sleepy, dreamy village of Sandford.  He's assigned Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) as his partner, a junior officer and son of the local police chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Everything appears to be quiet in the small village until a couple of local actors are found decapitated.  Their deaths are ruled an accident, but Angel thinks there's something more going and soon discovers that the residents of the sleepy little village are hiding a dark secret.<br /><br />HOT FUZZ begins like a typical comical mystery movie.  There are some elements that are purposely overdone for comic effect, but the film still retains an aura of mystery and suspense.  That is until the last twenty-minutes of the movie. That's when the action-factor of the film kicks into high gear as well as humor meter.  When I saw HOT FUZZ for the first time, I was laughing so hard during the last part of the movie that there were a few times I had a hard time breathing.  In my opinion, the movie is the funniest film released in 2007.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD, people who like action movies, and anyone with a decent sense of humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>My only gripe is that it goes on a tad too long; however, the movie is very funny. Some of the gags are subtle. It reminds of a "Fawlty Towers" script. Some of the gags don't really come into fruitition until the end of the movie. The good cops were likeable characters and the villians were funny. The plot made no sense really, but it flowed pretty well and the laughs kept on coming so that I didn't care. Timothy Dalton was very good at being obviously evil and smarmy. Edward Woodward was good to see as well.  Broadbent and Cranham played off each really well in sort of a Laurel and Hardy team. The actors took the movie fairly seriously so that added to the charm as well.<br /><br />The movie is laugh out loud funny in spots.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>great movie to enjoy. The brits make a farce about US action flicks and nail every stupid reason why their idiotic. I love how the plot unravels from something typical to something- whoops. almost wrote a spoiler.

I don't just mean extras separate to the movie, there are lots of in jokes, which may be a little bit of the problem with some people not finding some things funny. One thing I found not funny after purchasing the DVD, was the partially confirmed rumour that HOT FUZZ is coming out on a multi-disc version later this year, one reference can be found in the current commentary on this release where Simon Pegg refers to the "other commentary", well there is only one.And I completed a survey which refers to a Multi disc version coming out on a specific date.<br />Anyways, its clear that the guys are experimenting with development, since a bigger budget allows this, as well as getting Edward Woodward, although I did not spot Edward until I read the credits went back and saw who Tom Weaver was... seems like Edward is the Frenetic star you have when you just want a damn fine actor. And the other key point is that they have some of Britains finest Thespians.<br />The Movie, the Comentary, the Text info track, and etc all mean many hours of repeat watchings.<br />ENJOY</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>hot shot london police officer angel is getting a promotion;police sargeant.......in the sticks.turns out that his excellence is making a mockery of the force.<br /><br />he begrudgingly accepts his new assignment with the same vigor that got him that assignment.1st day on and he ends up arresting half the town and a fellow officer (unbeknownest).as agel becomes more adjusted to the normalcy,''accidents'' begin to mount.seems that the quaint little countryside retirement village that wins best town awards is anything but.theres something amiss and its killing off residents in gruesome fashion.<br /><br />this is a movie which i hope turns into a franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a perfect cop.  So go that he has been transferred from London to the town of Sandford.  He is making them look bad, and they want him out of their hair.  Upon arrival, he brings big city justice to the small town, until his superior, Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent) encourages him to relax a bit.  Angel is partnered with the inspector's son, Danny (Frost), an enthusiastic cop who isn't really that good.  He is fascinated with Angel and the stories he shares.  A sudden rash of deaths in Sandford are put off by the inspector as accidents, but Angel fears something more is happening, and feels that Simon Skinner (Dalton), the local grocery store owner, is behind it.  Angel must get to the bottom of what is going on in Sandford, and find out if Skinner really is the bad guy.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" is an excellent and very funny movie.  Pegg and Frost are hilarious together, playing off each other with ease.  There is a long setup that pays off with a final 30 minutes packed with action.  "Hot Fuzz" lampoons the action genre with great skill, and unlike most action movies, there is real character development that makes us care for the duo at the heart of the movie.  Dalton, as the apparent bad guy, seems to be savoring every moment of his screen time.  He is delightfully evil, and about as far from his James Bond days as he has ever been.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  The only drawback is that the movie runs a little too long.  Still, those looking for a smart, funny action-comedy will not be disappointed with "Hot Fuzz".</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>Officer Nicholas Angel is an over-the-top overachiever on the London police force. In appearance, he looks a bit like Daniel Craig's James Bond. And, like Bond, Angel seems to be master of every skill a person could name - the list of achievements becomes ludicrous after a while. Then we see official recognition and reward for his single minded dedication. The department promotes him to sergeant, and ship him out to a sleepy little village halfway to nowhere. He was making the rest look bad.<br /><br />The village of Sandford probably hasn't changed since Elizabethan times, and like it that way. It's peopled by enough eccentrics for a brace of britcoms, but utterly peaceful - at first glance. Oh, there are a few alcohol-related incidents, but the Neighborhood Watch turns apoplectic at the first stroke of grafitti or street performer. Then people start dying in bloody ways under bizarre circumstances. And, for some reason, the population and even the police detectives seem happy with any convoluted logic that can explain the deaths away as accidents. But Angel knows there's more --<br /><br />-- and saying more would say too much. You just have to see the rest for yourself. All the town's weirdness comes to a head, and bursts like a boil of social corruption. It includes the most laugh-out-loud running gun battle I've ever seen. It also satirizes the extremes of small-town pride, which only seems to grow larger as the reasons for pride grow smaller.<br /><br />Viewers with sensitive stomachs might find some of the mayhem a bit gory. That aside, it's skewed look at stereotypes that deserve to be skewered. After a slightly slow start, it had me rolling. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>I watched Hot Fuzz on the strength of 'Shaun of the Dead', which was a marvellous breath of fresh air from Hollywoods bloated excesses. HF has a great cast. One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.<br /><br />Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I loved Shaun of the Dead, so I expected that same magical combination of action, humor, and homage in Hot Fuzz.  And that's mostly what I got.  Mostly.<br /><br />Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a super cop that is driving the London bobbies mad because he's so good at his job.  To keep him out of their hair, the London office sends Angel to a little town known as Sandford.  There, he is teamed up with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a bit of a slob who wants to be a good cop but learned most of it from watching movies like Point Break and Bad Boys.<br /><br />Life's pretty boring in Sandford, but there's more than meets the eye. Like every good film made by British blokes, the city folk are secretly suspicious of the common people. And that of course means there's a cult lurking about that must be stopped. It all has something of a Wicker Man feel to it.<br /><br />The first half of the film is something of a murder mystery, as black clad assailants reminiscent of Scream brutally off witnesses. Once Angel and Butterman discover the truth, the film degenerates into an all out gun-fest, including acrobatics, car chases, foot chases, and wicked one liners.<br /><br />The problem with Hot Fuzz is that it's shot exactly like Shaun of the Dead, complete with the cut scenes, character dialogue, and gore.  Frost is playing almost the exact same character from the first film, except that instead of being a useless drug dealer he's a useless cop instead.<br /><br />And then there's the gore. I've seen a lot of buddy cop shows and none of them are as disgustingly gory as the murders in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the movie was filmed by horror buffs who like action films, but they didn't know precisely how to create an action film so they went with what they know best - whenever a scene calls for gore, the movie goes way over the top. This includes one victim's head exploding on screen as a church spire drives down into his ribcage (we get to watch him stumble about a few seconds, sans head) and another church spire, this time in miniature, stabbing through a man's throat and up through his tongue and out his mouth. I mean, seriously...Scream wasn't this gross and it was a horror movie.<br /><br />The movie wraps up with our intrepid cops blowing up a bunch of old people.  Which is either hilarious or a little tiresome, depending on what you thought of the film up to that point.<br /><br />Although the interaction between Angel and Butterman are entertaining, Hot Fuzz's pacing is uneven, which is a shame.  Pegg and Wright's enthusiasm for the genre is infectious, but in this case they'd be better off renting cop movies than making one.<br /><br />Those church spire scenes still give me nightmares. *shudder*</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>I liked SHAUN OF THE DEAD but somehow I didn't rush out to see this one when it hit the theaters, maybe the title was too blah and the premise too confusing; it's a high concept picture all right, but somehow the concept was a little over my head.  Anyway thank heavens for DVD where I could stop and pause and ask "What did he say?" without making too much of a ninny of myself.  Simon Pegg is twice as good here as he was in the zombie movie, and Nick Frost keeps up with him every step of the way.  (There's a cute DVD extra in which the two play up, and over the top, the homoerotics of the script--and the script, by inference, of all the buddy action movies the film is satirizing.)  Pegg is extraordinary in his affect, heck, I'd hire him for a real action adventure!  It's a strange movie in that it doesn't even have the merest hint of a romance for our hero (maybe that's why Danny, the constable played by Frost, gets so much of Pegg's amorous energy).<br /><br />Among the big (by British standards) names hired here to make supporting appearances, Jim Broadbent doesn't seem like they let him 100% into the joke, but Tim Dalton does his very best sly Alan Rickman as the manager of the local supermarket, Skinner, the man who becomes the leading suspect in a series of murders almost immediately.  It seems so obvious he had something to do with it, but if I were Timothy Dalton, would I bother cloaking my beauty with a the hooded cowl of a grim reaper?  That's how I knew it wasn't him!  It just wasn't making sense.  Billie Whitelaw, Samuel Beckett's favorite actress, has a blink and you'll miss her part, shame in a way because she can be very very funny and they might have given her more to do.  Martin Freeman, Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, all play little bit parts rather the way that Bing Crosby shows up in ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS, perhaps as a gesture of goodwill rather than actually contributing anything of substance.  It's the kind of movie you wind up watching twice or three times to catch the hundreds of zany verbal and visual cues and jokes you missed first time around.  The mystery plot isn't much, and Ira (STEPFORD WIVES) Levin, if he's still alive, is probably consulting with his plagiarism lawyers right now, but it's all in good fun and I hope the team continues for another round, next time I'll make it to the cinema opening night, instead of waiting for the DVD release.<br /><br />Oh, avoid those deleted scenes--yet again you see why editors make tthe big bucks and the writers, not so much.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Hot Fuzz" is one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while.  Although it's British, you need not be a fan of British humor to love it; indeed, most of its comedy derives from making fun of quintessentially American cop movies - particularly, the fun but reality-challenged "Point Break" and "Bad Boyz II".  From the first minute, the script is packed full of comic gold.  There is no shortage of laughter from this movie!  In many ways, it's as if "Evil Dead II," "Dead Alive," "Shaun of the Dead," and every American cop movie were combined into some perfect mutant stepchild.<br /><br />In addition, "Hot Fuzz" is the most tightly-written and directed movie I've seen in years.  Literally every frame and every line in the first and second acts sets up, and is important to, the third act.  Not a single line could be cut without affecting the final act - something you can't say about virtually any other movie, unfortunately.  The movie is even better, and even funnier, for being written and directed with such economy.  And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have never been funnier.<br /><br />If you liked "Shaun of the Dead," you will love "Hot Fuzz."  If you never saw "Shaun of the Dead," then trust me, you will still love "Hot Fuzz."  Rent it, borrow it, buy it; but watch it somewhere, somehow.  You will be glad you did.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>"Hot Fuzz" takes a while to really hit its stride, but eventually builds to a wonderful parody of action films -- think the climax of "Desperado," as set in a bucolic English village.<br /><br />Lots of quality extras, as well. The tour documentary is especially worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of cop movies or British comedy. Heck, it'd even be worth a look for those Agatha Christie fans who enjoy a good action film, just to see the two collide so wonderfully here.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Best movie I've seen so far this year. Edgar Wright is a genius at parody, this time taking on the cop buddy genre. The quips and puns fly at 100 miles an hour here, it'd probably take three viewings to catch all of it. The film's central joke may get lost on some American viewers-this is a vicious dig at provincial rural locales in England and how petty and nasty their citizens can be.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how clever this film is. Even the camerawork and cuts make you laugh because you know you've seen this type of stuff done with utmost earnestness in action/cop films-the swooshing of a gun into a holster, the click of a gun belt, the shifting of gears in a tense chase,that look of fierce determination on the hero's face as he prepares to get even-it's all done completely over the top and it works. Sergeant Angel is baaaaadassss.<br /><br />My next door neighbor said it "starts out slow". What this means is that people talked alot. The lines are nonstop jokes and I guess nothing went kaboom for a little while. But there's even fun for the dimwitted here, with lots of gory death scenes and interesting weaponry being used. Wright and Pegg still love the horror genre, and somehow managed to graft that into Hot Fuzz as well.<br /><br />I'd say this is like a Tarantino film or a Kevin Smith film. Not that I'm comparing the two. What I mean is that if you love movies as much as these people do...well, if you do, you already saw Hot Fuzz, didn't you? But anyway, if you think you love film, take this flick close to your heart. I would so use this as a litmus test for friends.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Hot Fuzz" is a parody of hot shot cop movies about a police officer who is sadly ignorant of cop movies. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an overachieving London policeman with an arrest record 400% better than anyone else. He makes everyone else look bad, so he's promoted to Sergeant and shipped off to the town of Sandford, repeat recipient of the Village of the Year award. Under the laid back command of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent), Nicholas' unrelenting "procedural correctness in the execution of unquestionable moral authority" ruffles some rural feathers. When a series of gruesome deaths disturb Sandford's idyll, the consensus opinion is that they are accidents. With his affable and eager partner Danny (Nick Frost) in tow, Nicholas sets out to prove otherwise.<br /><br />Writer/director Edgar Wright and writer/star Simon Pegg leave no cop movie clich&eacute; unspoofed. "Hot Fuzz" succeeds because there is a real mystery, and Nicholas is a real character whose perspective is at odds with his new surroundings. Everyone thinks Nicholas' compulsive law-enforcing is irrelevant in a village with such a low crime rate -and a bizarrely high accident rate. Nicholas is out to prove that his values are correct and necessary. Beyond that, "Hot Fuzz" is funny most of the time and smart much of the time. It's made for multiple viewings, as you won't catch all the references and jokes the first time. I think it runs 15 minutes too long, but "Hot Fuzz" is top notch parody - not of the police, but of fastidious, busybody citizenry and, above all, of other cop movies.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): Lots of bonus features. You can choose to view the film with a Storyboard option or a "Fuzz-O-Meter" (trivia track) option. In "Storyboard", a gray police badge appears in the upper right during some scenes. When it does, press "enter" on your remote to see the storyboards for that scene. The "Fuzz-O-Meter" displays facts about the movie and explains references in a subtitle below the film (in the black band). There is also a conversational but informative audio commentary by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. The commentary is constant and discusses actors, the references, directorial decisions, and various recollections of filming.<br /><br />Other bonus features are: "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz", which is a 30 second snippet that looks like an outtake. There are "Outtakes" (10 min). 22 Deleted Scenes with optional commentary.  2 trailers. 2 television spots. "Danny's Notebook" (15 sec) which is a flip book not shown in the movie. "The Fuzzball Rally: US Tour Piece" (28 min) is voluminous behind-the-scenes footage of Wright, Pegg, and Frost on the film's US tour. "Hot Funk" (4 min) are some scenes with the dirty words replaced, allegedly for television viewing. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in Spanish and French.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Although I enjoyed "Shaun of the Dead" with Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, I didn't keep my copy of it. I absolutely loved "Hot Fuzz" and will definitely be getting the DVD. Pegg has shown some maturity and chops development and continues to make me want to see him in more roles. Wright is a competant actor as well and I'm sure they will both go on to bigger and better roles. This particular comedy had much more development and far more funny moments than "Shaun of the Dead". So along with the great acting from the cast I must applaud the writing and directing behind it. This is the funniest movie I have seen in a couple years. There are some obvious spoofs of movies like "Point Break" and "Bad Boys" which they even watch one evening.<br /><br />An officer, played by Pegg, that had graduated at the top of his class, is so good at his work in London they don't want him making the rest the service looking bad. They send him off to a rural town to get him out of the way. Wright plays the officer that is his partner at the town. The rural town seems peaceful enough and at first it seems the worst he can expect are some unruly kids. But murders soon start occurring and his investigations run deeper than he ever imagined. A sinister plot becomes evident and he must declare war and go no holds barred into the town to see that justice is served. If you enjoy cop movies or comedies be sure to catch this wonderfully funny movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>When I lived in England in the late 70's a popular phrase for something that would work out just right was "Magic".<br />If you enjoy satire, and or British humor, and aren't offended by TERRIBLE language, then this is a fabulous send up of the "Action / Cop/ Buddy" genre of film.<br /><br />If you enjoyed what these blokes did to the "Zombie" genre in "Shaun of the Dead"  you should love this movie, which starts abit slower, but when it gets going... Magic!</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>The creative forces behind the comedic take on zombie flicks, "Shaun of the Dead," give us their interpretation of "every action movie ever made" with "Hot Fuzz."  Fans of "Dead" will immediately notice headliner Simon Pegg as Nicholas Angel, a London policeman who's excellence in service forces his superiors to ship him to a small country town in order to protect their own reputations.  "Dead" fans will also recognize his bumbling sidekick played by Nick Frost.  The duo quickly find plenty of trouble in their normally quiet town.  A large number of "accidents" occur that peak the interest of supercop Angel.  As the body count grows, Angel's list of suspects gets even larger.  Who's causing the accidents?  What action film isn't referenced?  It's all here in this superb comedy.<br /><br />Edgar Wright's hard-cutting, musically driven direction style is all over this film.  Once again, fans of "Dead" will pick up on all of Wright's nuances as the story rolls along.  The action is fast, loud, and over-the-top.  It's also pretty gruesome and hilarious at the same time.  Pegg is dead on as Angel.  Despite his small stature you honestly believe that he's the ultimate police officer.  Frost is perfect as the local idiot who only has a job because his dad's the chief inspector.  The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of British film.  Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Martin Freeman and Billie Whitelaw are just a few of the actors you'll find (some with large roles and others with just a blink of the eye's screen time).  Each and every person in this film hams it up perfectly and appears to have had fun with the film.<br /><br />The action sequences are all pretty convincing.  Even the scenes that involve sweet old ladies packing automatic heat on a bicycle come off superbly.<br /><br />The DVD is nice.  The extras are pretty decent, especially the Fuzz-O-Meter and "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz."  Overall, though, I'd buy this disc for the movie and not the extras.<br /><br />If you enjoy spoofs (but not silly ones like "Epic Movie"), check out "Hot Fuzz."  It's a lot smarter and funnier than you'd expect from a spoof.  If you're a fan of "Shaun of the Dead," consider this film already a part of your library.  It's only a matter of time before you buy it.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>The creative team behind the 2004 horror-comedy "Shaun of the Dead" takes on the action genre in the hilarious comedy "Hot Fuzz". Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's finest and most dedicated police officer who is reassigned by his superiors to the small crime-free village of Sanford. When a series of suspicious and gruesome accidents stuns this uneventful village, Sgt.

The 2007 action-comedy also stars Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent (Iris). "Hot Fuzz" received overwhelming positive reviews from critics and proved a commercial success earning more than twice of "Shaun of the Dead".<br /><br />If you missed "Hot Fuzz" in theaters, then I strongly recommend checking out this acclaimed comedy on DVD. "Hot Fuzz" is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a colorful and detailed video transfer. Its 5.1 EX Dolby Digital sound is clean and well balanced. The interactive menus are very appealing. Among special features, it includes the hilarious "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz" featurette, outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, trailers, "Fuzz-O-Meter" trivia option and a fun audio commentary with star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright.

Then when the movie heats up it really becomes a lot of fun.<br /><br />This movie is different and for those expecting an American type action movie you better turn away.  Hot Fuzz features a lot and I mean a lot of dry English humor.  It's good but don't expect any real laugh til your sides hurt moments.  Hot Fuzz is rather enjoyable if you approach it with an open mind.  The same main characters for Shaun of the Dead are here and the on screen chemistry is good.  This movie is almost unusual to be stranger than Shaun of the Dead.<br /><br />In the end I really liked this movie.  The acting is very good and action scenes are funny and intense.  The sound quality on my home theatre was very good and that helped add to the movie.  For any fan of Shaun of the Dead this is definately a must watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A30A5I8FG82M2E.html">A30A5I8FG82M2E</a><br/><p>I thought this was a pretty lousy comedy and that is coming from someone who did enjoy "Shaun of the Dead" - and if you're about to tell me that this movie isn't the same as that one, well you got that right buster.  "Hot Fuzz" is almost like attending a boring work seminar compared the party of "Shaun of the Dead".<br /><br />Maybe I'm not the target audience because I either didn't see many of the action/cop movies that "Hot Fuzz" references - and in most cases that I did see one, I don't remember it well enough.  Those movies are fun to watch because they are over the top and everything, but I don't see much point in making a movie that constantly references them.  I'd rather go back and re-watch movies like "Point Blank" or the Lethal Weapon series than watch another movie who's jokes depend on how well you have those earlier movies memorized.  I don't - and if the same goes for you, I say avoid this one.<br /><br />And oh yeah, how could I almost forget to mention - there is no reason for this movie to be two hours long, it seems to go on and on forever.  There are at least three separate climaxes, each one feeling like the movie is mercifully coming to an end.  What's the point in spoofing something if in the process you end up becoming just like your subject of ridicule?</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />With none of the wit and sharpness that characterized Shaun of the Dead, to say nothing of that film's hilarity, Hot Fuzz is a slow and plodding comedy that somehow lasts for over two hours despite its flimsy plot and lack of enjoyable character interaction--what a disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This 2007 British movie totally confused me.  It starts out slow and sets up a situation that is supposed to be funny.  Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is the star.  He acts and looks like the latest James Bond actor, a combination of Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood.  Nicolas Angel is an over-achiever cop in London.  His fellow cops are embarrassed by his perfection as it makes them look bad.  His arrest record is 400% higher than any of them.  He makes them all look bad, like they are not trying to do their jobs.  Angel's supervisors send him to a small remote village outside of London.  The name of the town is Sandford and Angel starts out doing trite and routine police work.  The feel of the movie is that it is a dry comedy, but you begin to wonder as Angel's crime sensing skills keep jolting you.  At first it is small crimes.<br /><br />He becomes partners with Danny (Nick Frost), the son of the the Police Chief, Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent).  Danny is a wanna-be gunfighter, action-oriented guy, and becomes fast friends with Angel.<br /><br />The story unravels from being fairly pleasant and tongue-in-cheek funny to a horrifying realization that practically the whole town is involved with murders, violence and sociopathic behaviors.  The blood and guts is not that funny and shocked and gagged me.  Many killings that were set up to look accidental were really murders planned by the town's "Better Good" shadow committee.<br /><br />As the mystery deepens, and grisly deaths continue through scene after scene, Angel and Nick work together to clean up the town - it morphs into a Western of sorts when Angel rides into town on a horse with enough guns to kill a platoon.  Some of the dark comedy gave me a laugh, but the last part of the movie dragged on and on, as one fight after another erupts, deaths mount and everyone that can double-cross another has had their scene.  It is supposed to be surprising but it only made me look at my watch - when is this overwrought fairy-tale hero going to win and move on?  He finally does, the town settles down, and it is a relief.<br /><br />If you like a lot of gun-totting frumpy villagers, car chases, bombs, back-stabbing, and grisly scenes this is for you.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>The first 15 minutes are funny. It has quite a few tickling dialogues. The rest is more like any other regular action movie. I mean it contains lots of action, explosion and nonsense.<br /><br />It's worth watching once.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>With all the hype for this movie I was expecting more.  Half the time I could not understand the British accents, and the movie itself was just OK.</p></br><a href="../users/A1129LM24YWSZV.html">A1129LM24YWSZV</a><br/><p>When we watched Hot Fuzz, we laughed our patooties off!<br /><br />The movie tells the story of police officer Nicholas Angel, a top cop in London. Because he's received so many commendations and made so many arrests (400% more than any other officer in London), he's making his co-workers (and supervisors) look bad. To get rid of him, management has him transferred to the sleepy little village of Sandford. There, he gets stuck with an inexperienced partner (who happens to be the son of the police inspector) and finds difficulty making the transition from lean, mean, policing machine to do-nothing keeper of a town where very little crime is ever committed.<br /><br />But then, odd things begin to happen. A philandering couple is found beheaded on a local highway. A man is blown up after a gas leak in his house. A reporter from the town's newspaper is killed by a piece of falling stone from an old church roof. Local authorities insist that all of these deaths are just accidents, but Nicholas begins to think there's more to it than that.<br /><br />For the rest of the movie, Nicholas and his bumbling partner try to unearth the thread that links all the murders. The truth behind the rash of deaths is comic gold.<br /><br />This movie is a hilarious send-up of the cop genre, but it's also a decent action flick in its own right. Pegg is marvelous as the orderly, buttoned-up Nicholas, and Nick Frost holds down his side of the script as the naive Danny Butterman (Nick's partner). There were knee-slapping lines and situations throughout, with character-driven comedy playing just as large a role as all the funny plot-driven stuff.<br /><br />You will recognize several other cast members as well: Bill Nighy as the Met Chief Inspector, Jim Broadbent as Inspector Frank Butterman, Timothy Dalton as Simon Skinner, even a tiny role by Cate Blanchett, who plays Nicholas' former girlfriend.<br /><br />If you're in need of a laugh, I highly recommend this movie! We loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>Simon Pegg oozes hilarity. He is a natural comedian, and he doesn't even need to try. I've always found that British comedies are much funnier and wittier than American ones. I think it has something to do with their overly dry humour and their love for the F-bomb. It just sounds better coming from a Brit.<br /><br />Anywho, Hot Fuzz starts off somewhat normal but then halfway through the film, it gets a tad weird. What you think the plot is about is not what it really is, and it just comes at you all of a sudden from a million different directions. It's just weird. Oh, and the excess of blood and gore is also a cool and unexpected treat.<br /><br />But it is also funny, for the most part. The gags are funny, the characters are even funnier and the film is stylised in the same vein of Shaun of the Dead, which is by far funnier than this. They even reused a few of the same actors. You gotta love the little cameo with Bill Nighy, that guy is just fabulous.  Nick Frost is also a great funny sidekick. I was also pleased to see Timothy Dalton in this. He has a nice little role here as well.<br /><br />The film certainly keeps you entertained and interested. Its a sort of who-dunnit with a funny twist. If you love British humour, you will probably like this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>The delirously funny crew that brought us comic zombies in SHAUN OF THE DEAD take on action movies in this clever film featuring marvelous performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who investigate a series of bizarre accidents in quaint little Sandford. Pegg is certain they are really murders, and with Frost at his side, he finds out he's not wrong at all.<br />The dialogue and situations are original and witty, and the movie is surprisingly graphic in its violence, but hey these are guys who gave us lots of blood in SHAUN!  The supporting cast is wonderful featuring nice bits from Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Timothy Dalton, Edward Woodward and Billie Whitelaw.  I actually enjoyed this movie more than SHAUN!</p></br><a href="../users/AV6QDP8Q0ONK4.html">AV6QDP8Q0ONK4</a><br/><p>This is a great comedy. It has that fun quirky indie feel to it with none of the low budget drippy music let down. Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel. Angel is London's greatest policeman. In fact he is too good and makes the rest of the force look bad. They promote him and railroad him out to Sanford, a village which constantly wins "Village of the Year" awards. They have a low crime rate, primarily because the police don't arrest anyone, a British version of Mayberry. This puts Angel at odds with everyone in town, whom remain polite as he seemingly busts everyone in the peaceful village. The comedy is greater good. While on duty and sitting in a pub with fellow policemen, they talk about firearms.<br /><br />Andie: "Everyone in town and their mum owns a gun."<br />Angel: "Such as who?"<br />Andie: "Farmers own guns."<br />Angel: "And who else?"<br />Andie: "And their mums."<br /><br />Nick Frost plays PC Danny Butterman who becomes Angel's sidekick. He loves police movies and admires Angel. Together they become a crime fighting duo in a village that has a secret.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, fake nudity. some blood and gore.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is an exceptional and very gung-ho London police officer. He's earned nine commendations within the past year alone. He owns the highest arrest record, and has been wounded three times in the line of duty. And he's making everyone else on the metropolitan police force look bad. Rampant resentment in the work room leads to Sgt. Angel's reassignment to the cheery, rustic village of Sandford.<br /><br />To an intense cop who can't let go of the job, Sandford is a living hell in which nothing much happens, and it happens all the time. But looks can be deceiving, first impressions are sometimes wonky. In the friendly confines of Sanford hides a murderous conspiracy, and it isn't too long before our newest town bobby catches a whiff of the shady. It begins with a series of grisly accidents...<br /><br />It's a delicate balance, what these guys come up with, and it's fantastic to see the mad geniuses behind SHAUN OF THE DEAD marvelously live up to expectations with HOT FUZZ. The whole thing could have easily tumbled like a house of cards, but the writers and the director and the actors - especially the awesomely deadpan Simon Pegg - play it straight, which adds resonance to the story, makes the comedy bits so much the better. It helps, too, that there's this edgy flavor to the action sequences, an intensity to the chases and the gun battles and to Angel's run-ins with the killer in that black hood cloak robe thingee.<br /><br />Pegg and Nick Frost - who plays Angel's bumbling partner in this picture - continue that most excellent buddy chemistry they had going on in SHAUN OF THE DEAD and even in the British television comedy SPACED. In a neat twist, Pegg abandons his patented sad nerd persona for that of an unflappable, unstoppable supercop. Meanwhile, ex-007 Timothy Dalton comes in as the diabolical villain of the piece. I like these topsy-turvies.<br /><br />You can appreciate HOT FUZZ either as a rollicking send-up of buddy cop pictures or as an action thriller in its own right, or even as both. The film earns its slickness via its rapid-fire edits and ungodly loud special effects, especially when it arrives at the final act as our hot fuzz and a cadre of heavily armed perps shoot it out in the quiet streets of Sandford and then in the supermarket aisles. There is also a swan. It's that kind of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I will admit that at times I go a little overboard when reviewing these `spoof' comedies.  I walk away from the movie thinking one thing and then, in the middle of writing my review, I change my mind.  The fact remains that these movies need time to settle.  The comedy in these films may not seem blatant and `laugh out loud' funny on the outset, but remembering the scenes can be more rewarding then actually seeing them.<br /><br />Case in point; `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is one of my favorite comedies.  When I first saw the film I hated it.  It wasn't until a conversation I had a few YEARS later with some friends that I realized just how funny that movie really is.  Another film that strikes me as funnier when `thinking' about it is `Scary Movie 2'.  The difference there is that, when watching the film a second and third time, it becomes apparent that the film should only be thought about, never seen.<br /><br />So, it's safe to say then that, when reflecting on these films and writing my reviews my initial reaction can, at times, get thwarted by my newfound appreciation for what I had previously witnessed.  This has caused my views to get clouded at times (thus resulting in 5-star reviews for films like `Slither', that, upon further reflection should have remained the B-Grade movie I had initially intended it to be), not always for the better.<br /><br />I loved this movie from the start, in through the middle, and in the end as well.  Upon further reflection I still love it, and yet I see its faults and am forcing myself to keep with my initial grade (B+) and fight the urge to give it an A.<br /><br />Ha, now that I've said all of that (sorry), I can get to my review.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' pairs Simon Pegg and Nick Frost up with their `Shaun of the Dead' director Edgar Wright.  This time Pegg is playing Nicholas Angel, an overzealous police officer who has made it a habit of making everyone around him look bad, so much so that he is promoted only to find himself relocated to the country where the crime rate is low and the villagers are, well, interesting.  Angel is furious but he quickly adapts and starts enforcing the law, to the dismay of those around him (especially the lazy police force).  His partner, Danny Butterman, dreams of living out an action movie, and once citizens start dieing, he finally gets his chance.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' is obvious, but it is supposed to be.  You kind of know who to suspect the minute you see him, but it's okay because you expect that.  The film moves along a little slowly in parts, but it makes up for that with clever (albeit stagy) dialog and performances (Pegg slips into David Caruso mode effortlessly).  The film is kind of cut like a slick horror film, or an upstaged episode of CSI, with quick editing and glossy visuals.  The gore is very present, but always in a comical and `airy' kind of way.  It doesn't feel gory because it is there for you to laugh at.  The ending is the films best feature and greatest detractor.  It layers it on thick (the action scenes are gloriously shot and surprisingly charismatic and funny) and that is a good thing and, eventually, a bad thing (it doesn't know when to quit).<br /><br />Despite that twist upon a twist upon a twist upon a twist, it still comes together very nicely in the end and certainly warrants our attention.<br /><br />I was one who strongly disliked `Shaun of the Dead' upon my initial viewing, found it slightly humorous upon reflection only to watch it again and conclude that, while it has its moments (that record tossing scene is just glorious) it remains overrated in my opinion.  `Hot Fuzz' blows that one out of the water, and quite frankly, if it had toned down the end a tad (even in its longevity it does maintain its comedic timing though...that swan!) I would have given it an A, without any hesitation.<br /><br />I don't want to seem overzealous here, so I'm restraining myself (my inner movie-lover is aching to give this an extra star now!).  See what I mean?  I started this review determined to go the way of a B+ and I've already talked myself into an A-.  No, no I must stick to my guns here.<br /><br />B+, x's 1000!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Hot Fuzz (Edgar Wright, 2007)<br /><br />I expected to like Hot Fuzz, the second feature by the same comedy team (Wright, Pegg, and Frost) who brought us Shaun of the Dead in 2004. What I didn't expect was that under the comedy, which we assumed we'd get from these very funny guys, would actually be a cracking mystery that would hold my interest just as much as Pegg and Frost's banter.<br /><br />Plot: Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a cop's cop, the kind of guy who can make a mugger put down the purse and back away just by cocking an eyebrow. Problem is, he's making the rest of his department look bad, so they conspire to get him sent to Sandford, a quiet town in the country well-known for its low crime rate. He gets off to a great start when he gets there by finding one of the town's rare crimes; he's not even on the force yet, but he ends up hauling in a guy for drunk driving. Of course, the next morning, he finds out that the guy he hauled in is his new partner, Danny Butterman (Frost). Sandford's police force is very laid-back; why shouldn't they be? After all, the town has almost no crime. That doesn't sit well with Angel's type A personality, of course, so he starts looking around to see if there's anything the lackluster bobbies around him have simply been overlooking. With Danny as his reluctant accomplice, Angel starts investigating a series of accidents he finds suspicious. Together, the two of them get closer and closer to what's looking like a major conspiracy. Their challenge then becomes figuring out who's behind the conspiracy before those unknowns can stop their investigation permanently.<br /><br />Put Pegg, Wright, and Frost together and you're basically guaranteed a good time. Shaun of the Dead was a brilliant send-up of zombie films, but really, when it came right down to it, it was a straight comedy, albeit one that was fantastically made. Hot Fuzz, while just as hysterical as Shaun, is not a straight comedy at all, and shows the versatility of Wright as a director, Frost and Pegg as actors, and all three of them as co-writers. Sure, you come for the comedy, and the movie delivers as expected on that front, but this is a whodunit that's got some teeth as well, and what a pleasant surprise that is. A definite recommendation, even for those who, for whatever reason, didn't like Shaun. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>Well, there is no actual romance in this movie - but there's almost everything else. There is good spoofing humor, an endearing buddy/sidekick relationship, some examples of astute crime detection, some grisly murders, a number of slam-bam car chases, and an over-the-top shoot-out.<br /><br />The shoot-out perhaps lasts a little too long, but it is inventively choreographed, so it will probably appeal even to those who generally prefer subdued, drawing room dramas. At the center of all this merry mayhem is a straight-arrow model of a modern police officer - played with super-hero stalwartness by Simon Pegg. He's a throwback to the old cowboy heroes in the movie/TV serials of the 1950's. And what a relief! He has no baggage, no "humanizing" flaws. He is not a recovering alcoholic; although he is divorced, he is not shown agonizing over parental failures; he's not a womanizer or a sadist.<br /><br />It's not that this is a dully PG film. Some pretty rough language swirls through the action, and there is a fair amount of blood spatter. In spite of this though, "Hot Fuzz" ends up being a feel-good, rejoice of a film.<br /><br />It also surprises audiences with cameo or supporting performances by some established British actors who haven't been seen much in films lately and about whom you just might have been wondering, "Where are they now?" For example, there's Billie Whitelaw. She's tackled some gritty roles in British films, starting in the 1950's. But I most remember her from hilarious romps such as "Make Mine Mink" with Terry-Thomas. She does a wonderful turn here - simply working a crossword puzzle. Then look for Edward Woodward of "Breaker Morant," "Wicker Man," and TV's "The Equalizer" fame.<br /><br />There's no Director's Commentary on this disc, but there is a "trivia" subtitle option. By clicking on this accompaniment, you can learn how a lot of the characters' names and place names are homages to characters and settings in other, often obscure, but hip films. One not-so-obscure film that is often echoed in this way is "Straw Dogs." A lot of these details really are trivial, but if you enjoy the kind of spoofing inherent in subtle cross-referencing and self-referencing - knowing that the film is rife with these will add to your enjoyment and will keep you on your toes trying to detect them. It will turn you into a name spotter.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>London policeman (sorry, police officer) Nick Angel (Simon Pegg) is good at his job. In fact, he is so good that he is making his fellow officers look bad and gets "promoted" to a position in the country in order to remedy this situation. However, all is not as it seems in the peaceful country town of Sandford, and pretty soon Sergeant Angel, with the assistance of his partner (Nick Frost), is tracking down a serial killer who is murdering the residents of this town and making the deaths look like accidents.<br /><br />"Hot Fuzz" is written and directed by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, who previously brought us "Shaun of the Dead", stars many of the same actors, and is even funnier than their previous movie. Essentially, "Hot Fuzz" is a parody of action movies, just as "Shaun of the Dead" was a parody of zombie films, but unlike a lot of recent parodies that have been made in the US (such as "Date Movie", "Not Another Teen Movie", the "Scary Movie" series etc), these films aren't made up of a series of recreations of scenes from other movies. Instead, these films parody the conventions and clich&eacute;s of their respective genres, but in the context of an original story. If you look back at some of the earliest parodies, such as "The Naked Gun" or "Blazing Saddles", this is what the creators of these films also did, and this is the way that parody should be.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P9D22KDEXVMN.html">A3P9D22KDEXVMN</a><br/><p>Hot Fuzz is very funny, with some excellent action scenes.  Simon Pegg is just hilarious, and he has a great chemistry with the other actors, especially Nick Frost.  The English humor - or should I say humour - is fast and furious in this movie.  The Sleepy Hollow of a town and its excellent scenery are an unusual location for the fast moving criminal activity that follows.  Not for kids with its R rating, there is plenty of violence and off color jokes.  A 4-star thrill ride with laugh after laugh.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (director and co-writers) nailed the zombie spoof with the uber-witty "Shaun of the Dead."  Re-assembling much of the same cast and keeping the understated yet hilarious send-up theme, they turn their sights to action flicks of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Tony Scott variety with "Hot Fuzz."  And the results couldn't be better.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel (Pegg, the lead from "Shaun) is the top kick-butt sergeant in the London police force.  This is in itself high comedy, because Pegg only resembles an action hero the way Rudy represents a Notre Dame football player - I half expected someone to remind Angel that he's five-foot-nothin' and a hundred-and-nothin', with a weak chin to boot.  His success only earns him the enmity of his fellow cops (including the hilarious Bill Nighy) who reassign him to the country to keep them from looking bad.<br /><br />Once there, Angel finds a police force who couldn't assemble a two-car parade and haven't been asked to do much more than that.  Eventually, though, Angel stumbles upon a massive criminal enterprise and brings it down with the help of not-so-trusty sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, also the fat sidekick in "Shaun").<br /><br />Like "Shaun," "Hot Fuzz" has the usual combination of subtle and not-so-subtle humor wrapped around some shocking-yet-comical violence.  A larger budget means that explosions are bigger and deaths are bloodier and more elaborate, but at its heart "Hot Fuzz" remains an ingenious comedy more than an action movie.  While the movie stands on its own rights, it means a heck of a lot more if you've sat through more than your share of "Lethal Weapon" or "Bad Boyz" flicks - these guys feel your pain, too.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>This film has such a funny light heart that it can make some amazingly gross violence seem innocuous and quite funny.  I am not sure how it is pulled off, but, really, it is FUNNY.  It is a British film so you might have a slight accent problem (I do not) and you will have to get used to the driver being on the opposite side of the police car than you expect.  But other than some turns of phrase, the movie takes on the cop genre in a way that is thoroughly understandable to anyone who has ever seen a cop film or show.<br /><br />Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a stereotypical supercop.  He has never wanted to be anything else, passed the schooling with superb scores (a double first in British terminology), and has racked up a tremendous and heroic record on the force.  His reward?  Being sent to a bucolic village far from anything requiring the kind of police work Nicholas has ever cared to do.<br /><br />But we all know that villages are not always as they seem, right?  I don't want to talk about the movie's plot because it isn't particularly difficult to figure out, but going through the parody is much more fun  than having it described to you is.  Sgt. Angel's partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is terrific (Frost and Pegg are friends and often work together).  The movie uses every, and I mean EVERY cop show clich&eacute; and makes them all fun.  Just be willing to put up with a bit of swearing (there is a swear box to raise money for the church roof, after all) and some amazing violence.  Timothy Dalton plays a terrific slimeball named Simon Skinner.  Jim Broadbent, whom I always love on screen, is superb as Inspector Frank Butterman (Danny's dad).<br /><br />Enjoy!

When seemingly random citizens start meeting with untimely "accidental" deaths, Angel suspects foul play and sets off to expose a dangerous serial killer and uncover the dark conspiracy surrounding Sandford's tranquil facade - all whilst shooting two guns and jumping through the air.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz pays tribute to every staple of the action film genre, from high-speed car chases and blazing shoot-outs to slow-motion stunts and hard-to-kill villains. Every fundamental is addressed and astutely parodied with several key films in mind. The homage to Point Break and Bad Boys is crystal clear, but the genre-spoofing duo have done their homework - scenes derived from Rambo, Die Hard, Hard Boiled, Lethal Weapon and the Man With No Name trilogy await the action film connoisseur.<br /><br />Reprising his role as the serious character in a bizarrely comical situation, Simon Pegg once again provides plenty of laughs as the take-charge fish-out-of-water who unwittingly becomes involved in the sinister conspiracy at Sandford. Nick Frost also lends a familiar persona, this time as a bumbling police officer pining for the extreme action he sees in movies. Other regulars include Bill Nighy as the London Chief Inspector and Martin Freeman as a desk sergeant. Veteran actor Timothy Dalton appears as Simon Skinner, the devilish manager of a local grocery store, while Rafe Spall and Paddy Considine bring a refreshing sarcasm to the two mustachioed officers Cartwright and Wainwright.<br /><br />Hot Fuzz takes a decidedly R-rated approach to the action, dialogue, and violence, but somewhere between brutal decapitations and roundhouse kicking an old lady in the head comes a sadistically stylish brand of comedy as diabolically entertaining as it sounds. Blood flies as fast as the ingenious jokes and even priests and handgun toting cyclists aren't spared from Pegg's ruthless blend of fuzz and fireworks. Much in the same way Shaun of the Dead tackled its subject with a clever tongue and na?ve characters, Fuzz pits Nicholas Angel against the elements of an action movie, though this time he's far more qualified for the job. While the intricate murder mystery furthers the plot along, all the events are really just a methodic build to the explosive final showdown with the bad-guys - a culmination any action movie worth its salt would provide. And what a conclusion it is, with high-octane explosions, insane duels, and fantastically over-the-top stunts that perfectly exaggerate the outlandish beauty of the movies that inspired it.<br /><br />Whether trading zombies for action films is an upgrade in your book, it's hard to deny that Pegg, Frost, and director Edgar Wright have proven once again that they know how to get a laugh. Hot Fuzz is a raucous riot of sharp quips and glorious carnage, bloody battles mixed with cunning caricatures and witty mimicry- a sublime combination not seen since the classic action films it so eloquently parodies.<br /><br />- Joel Massie</p></br></body></html>

Pierce is a little out of his element, but take his beard off and he looks a little more at home.  The movies has a pretty complex story, and makes it a very good ending.  I think they did a little TOO much with this movie, but it still works.  The CGI gets a little outrageous, BUT WATCH OUT FOR THE CAR CHASE-TRUE EXCITEMENT.<br /><br />And oh yeah halle berry wears a bikini in this.</p></br><a href="../users/AATKF0HDBQL86.html">AATKF0HDBQL86</a><br/><p>Die Another Day was an excellent Bond film.  It had all the gadgets, a great story, lots of action, and a new Q (John Cleese) who, although he can never replace the late Desmond Llewelyn, is a very worthy successor to the title because of his wisecracking sense of humor and ability to give as good as he gets from Bond (Pierce Brosnan).  Dame Judi Dench returns as M, Bond's boss, and Samantha Bond is back as the ever efficient Moneypenny, along with Colin Salmon as Robinson.  Halle Berry turns in a wonderful performance as Jinx, Bond's American counterpart, and Toby Stephens is awesome as Gustav Graves, Bond's latest enemy.<p>My biggest complaint about Die Another Day is the theme song performed by Madonna (who also had a small role in the film).  I came in expecting another title song in the grand tradition of Bond themes, complete with horns, guitar, and whatnot, and what do I get?  A piece of dreck that would not be out of place in Saturday Night Fever.  Don't get me wrong; I like Madonna, but a piece of techno-pop like the song she did for Die Another Day has no place whatsoever in a Bond movie.  If they wanted a real Bond theme, the creative people should have gone after someone like Shirley Bassey or kd lang, whose song "Surrender" in Tomorrow Never Dies is the quintessential Bond theme.  Even the group Garbage would have been acceptable, because their title theme for The World Is Not Enough sounded more like a Bond theme than Die Another Day.<p>All in all, Die Another Day is a wonderful addition to the Bond franchise, and definitely a keeper once the DVD comes out.  Just ignore the theme song, and you'll enjoy the ride.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>While Pierce Brosnan taking on the role of James Bond inarguably reinvigorated the franchise, in his latest outing as 007 he looks tired, and the film certainly feels like the creative staff agree.<p>There are some high points -- the use of North Korea, Bond in captivity, adventures in Cuba -- but the moment the film shifts to the wintery setting for its last half, it's as though we're watching Roger Moore circa &quot;Moonraker.&quot; The film becomes cliche, camping and outright silly, and even the ice palace -- clearly meant to be impressive -- just looks like a leftover from a cheap 1970s science fiction movie.<p>While I hope Bond is never fully retired, it feels like it's time to put the franchise on the shelf again for a decade or so, and let a new generation of creators find a way to make him the hero he's meant to be, and so often has been in the past.<p>Recommended only as a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>Some things just get better and better with age, examples would be wine, legends, rare trinkets, and even some movie franchises.  One movie franchise that would be a prime example of this statement would have to be the `James Bond' franchise.  After 19 movies, technically 20 if you count Sean Connery's final appearance in "Never Say Never Again" which occurs somewhat outside of the recognized 007 continuity.  In 2002 MGM went back to the well that just keeps on giving for what turns out to be the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as the suave secret agent in "007:  Die Another Day".<br /><br />When one of his mission's gets sabotaged, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) finds himself in a rare predicament, captured and tortured for an extended period of time, and to top things off it appears that MI-6 has completely abandoned their top agent.  After M (Judi Dench) finally secures the release of 007, by swapping him for another prisoner, Bond uses his renewed freedom not to relax and heal, but to seek revenge on those that betrayed him.  Upon his reinstatement in the ranks of MI-6, Bond is given a chaperone to ensure that he cause as minimal trouble as possible.  Knowing that this chaperone will slow him down, Bond eventually strikes out on his own once again and follows his leads to the source of his betrayal.  With the help of an American spy (Halle Berry), Bond discovers that the person responsible for his mission's sabotage is a multi-billionaire whose business is diamonds; however, that is just a cover as his true business is that of terrorism as he is now in the possession of a devastingly powerful new weapon that could bring the world's superpowers to their knees.<br /><br />After 21 total `James Bond' films in the franchise, one would think that there would really be nothing new the filmmakers could come up with.  Well, sometimes it's really nice to be surprised, because with "007:  Die Another Day" not only did the writers and the director, Lee Tamahori (director of "xXx:  State of the Union") deliver what could very well be one of the greatest `James Bond' adventures yet, but Pierce Brosnan also delivered his most powerful performance as the capable-as-ever Agent 007.  Sadly, as I stated earlier, this terrific entry into the franchise also served as the final appearance of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  The reason this was Brosnan's final appearance isn't because he died or quit, it's because the producers of the franchise felt he no longer fit the part.  While I understand their reasoning to an extent, Brosnan was starting to show his age, and he did go out with one of the best installments in the long-lasting franchise.  But I would have liked to have seen him as Bond again, mostly because between him and Connery, they are the only two actors that I feel portrayed the character the best.  Anyways, back to the task at hand, other factors that assisted in making this one of the best `Bond' films ever is the raw emotions that are evoked throughout the story, the entire cast really did an amazing job, and the dramatic side of the story was well-paced, and the action served to propel the story for a change.  Another asset would have to be the perfectly cast Halle Berry as the new scantily clad, incredibly sexy Bond girl.  She is definitely enough to make any secret agent let all his secrets spill out.  Not to dote solely on Halle, the entire cast was excellent, and John Cleese as the new `Q' is just hilarious without being over the top or out of place in this franchise.<br /><br />Well, as I've said numerous times in this review, this terrific entry into the `James Bond' franchise is definitely not one to be missed, especially by any of the fans of the series.  If you haven't ever gotten much out of this series of films, you should really give the franchise another chance, and make "007:  Die Another Day" one of the first on your list to see.<br /><br />"007:  Die Another Day" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Wow. This was cinematic vomit for sure. I saw Quantum of Solace earlier tonight and it was kickarse. Since this was on TV I decided to watch it since there was nothing else... and boy, this movie SUCKED!!!!!! Worst 007 movie ever. There's so many bad things about the movie I'm not even kidding. Such as:<br /><br />- The Gunbarrel opening scene- stupid bullet and the calypso version of the theme...<br /><br />- That god-awful Madonna song... Techno and Bond do NOT mix!<br /><br />- Halle Barry. Wasted actress. She was AWFUL as a Bond girl. Sure she was hot, but she was AWFUL.<br /><br />- CG CG everywhere... I'm not lying, this is the most godawful CG-laden film I've ever seen. The plane??? The scorpions??? That car???<br /><br />- The stupid vanishing car.<br /><br />- LAME WRITING. I don't think I've ever met someone named "Mr. Kil"<br /><br />- The lair looked like a disco with lasers everywhere<br /><br />- As if Madonna's theme wasn't bad enough, her totally pointless cameo. Not only did she suck, but did Tom Jones or Shirley Bassey get a cameo???<br /><br />There's more I can name, but there's WAY too many...</p></br><a href="../users/A1J2931UBBJPXM.html">A1J2931UBBJPXM</a><br/><p>James Bond aficionados will be delighted to hear that 007 is not only back, but with renewed vigor, a great new villain who wants to dominate the world (surprise!), lots of gadgets, girls and Action! a-plenty, in "Die Another Day," directed by Lee Tamahori.  Pierce Brosnan suits up for the fourth time as Secret Agent Man, joined this time around by a lady named Jinx (Halle Berry), who is not only beautiful but demonstrates early on that she can definitely take care of herself; a decidedly capable match for Mr. James Bond.  But whose side is she on, anyway?<p>The film opens with 007 insinuating himself into an operation transpiring in North Korea, where a certain Colonel Moon (Will Yun Lee) is attempting to negotiate a deal to buy South African diamonds in exchange for weapons.  Our man Bond, of course, has replaced the contact and holds the briefcase containing the loot.  As expected, the enterprise quickly deteriorates into an explosive situation, and from that point on the action never stops.<p>Working from a story and screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (who also teamed for 1999's "The World Is Not Enough," along with Bruce Feirstein), director Tamahori digs deep into the All-Things-Bond box to make this James Bond film...well... everything a James Bond film should be, from the fast paced action (it goes without saying) to the snappy repartee rife with bons mots and double-entendre (at which Berry/Jinx also proves to be a match for Brosnan/Bond) to one of the best "henchmen" (Zao, played terrifically by Rick Yun) since Goldfinger's Oddjob.  There is also a touch of nostalgia thrown in for good measure:  As Q (John Cleese) gives his dissertation on the latest gadgets, Bond casually ferrets through the Quartermaster's cache and comes across the lethal shoe that once belonged to Rosa Klebb, as well as a signature item from "Thunderball."  It's a nice touch that perhaps for the first time tangibly links forty years of "Bond" history together and goes far in dispelling the quite noticeable changing incarnations of 007 over the years; finally, rather than naturally, if subconsciously, categorizing the character into a Connery/Bond, Moore/Bond, Lazenby/Bond, Dalton/Bond or Brosnan/Bond, he's just "Bond."  James Bond.<p>Visually, this one has a lot to offer, with some extravagant sets, a memorable sword fight and special F/X that are, for the most part, top notch.  There is one scene near the end (suffice to say involving a lot of water and some huge waves) in which the F/X seem to dip somewhat below par and actually take on an almost "60s" look (intentional, perhaps, as an homage that would be in keeping with the rest of the film's nod to "Bond" history?) but overall it's a quality production, and the cinematography (by David Tattersall, who also did "Star Wars, Episodes I & II") is brilliant.<p>If ever an actor was meant to play a specific role, it's Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.  From his initial outing as 007 (in 1995's "GoldenEye") he's been a perfect fit, but here he seems to have at last actually settled into the part and made it his own, in a way that Moore, Lazenby and Dalton (for all the individual and unique strengths they brought to their respective portrayals of Bond) were, even at their best, never able to achieve.  Brosnan credibly brings Ian Fleming's unflappable, stalwart hero to life with seemingly effortless aplomb, striking a chord in which the seriousness and the levity that defines the character mesh perfectly (Moore, on the other hand, played up the lightness too often, almost into parody at times; Dalton was altogether too serious; Lazenby was simply an anomaly).  Simply put, Brosnan has all of the qualities that personify James Bond, and he uses them all to the utmost effectiveness.<p>Following up her Oscar winning portrayal of Leticia Musgrove in 2001's "Monster's Ball," Halle Berry, meanwhile, makes her mark as arguably one of the finest "Bond Girls" since Honor Blackman's performance as "Ms." Galore in "Goldfinger" in 1964.  She definitely makes one of the most memorable first entrances from among the rank and file of the Bond Beauties; emerging from the sea in an orange two-piece suit she looks absolutely stunning, calling to mind Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in 1962's "Dr. No."  Pulchritude aside, however, Berry most importantly makes her character believable, which in no small part lends the necessary support to the anticipated outlandishness of the fiction.  <p>The one female in a recurring role who has yet to be given her due as a "Bond Girl," is a consummate actor who has added significantly to the Bond legacy with her portrayal of "M."  Dame Judi Dench came on board along with Brosnan in "GoldenEye," empowering women everywhere by taking on a highly visible role of absolute authority, albeit fictional, and helping to revitalize the "Bond" series.  Casting her as Bond's superior was a stroke of genius, and the way Dench took over the role and made it her own should at last be acknowledged.  She is, without question, a big part of the renewed strength of the "Bond" of the new millennium.<p>Making her motion picture debut here, Rosamund Pike also adds her name to the roster as Miranda Frost, but though she adds beauty and poise to the film, she is less than charismatic and her performance lacks the kind of spunk that would have made her character more than just adequate.  Still, it would be hard for any actor to get a toehold playing against the radiant Halle Berry, and on a positive note, Pike does lend a decided elegance to the role.<p>As Bond's nemesis, Gustav Graves, Toby Stephens gives an energetic performance and carves out a niche for himself in the annals of Bond bad guys; and with a physical oddity sustained in the opening sequence of the film, Yune makes a lasting impression as Zao.  In the final analysis, "Die Another Day" is the best "Brosnan" Bond yet.</p></br><a href="../users/AZAEJB1ECT9HC.html">AZAEJB1ECT9HC</a><br/><p>Die Another Day was the film released to celebrate Bond's 40th anniversary in the movies.  It was also Brosnan's 4th and last appearance as Bond.  To be honest, its a fairly average Bond film and the weakest of Brosnan's 4 films.  Brosnan's James Bond films started at the top with the terrific Goldeneye and slowly worked their way downward with each film.<br />Each Bond film since Goldeneye have been incredibly successful.  However, the 2 best Bond films "Goldeneye" and "Casino Royale" have been directed by 1 man:Martin Campbell who did a fabulous job on both of those films.  The other 4 of the last 6 have been directed by different director with varying results.  This one was directed by Lee Tamahori, who not long afterward was arrested for solicitation.(Remember the good old days when Terrence Young directed 3 out of the 4 first great Bond films and John Glen directed Roger Moore's last three and Timothy Dalton's 2 excellent Bond films.  I do not like having a different director on each new film and hearing how great they've done because the film makes money.  The last Bond film "Quantum of Solace" was as mediocre as this one.  Yet I've heard the director Marc Forster proclaimed a genius because the film made boatloads of money. I hope he never does another one.)  As stated the film is average with the high point being a vicious swordfight between Bond and the villain.  Low points of this film included a terrible CGI sequence of Bond basically surfing over a tidal wave (don't even ask how this occurs) and Bond driving a stealth (invisable) car.  The film got a lot of publicity by having Halle Berry as the leading lady, right after she won her Oscar.  She is okay but I prefer the frosty Rosamund Pike as the secondary female lead.  The pre-credits sequence and conclusion are average by Bond standards.  (The film does try something new by having Bond captured at the end of the pre-credits sequence and tortured throughout most of the opening credits.)  The very average theme song was done by Madonna, who has a cameo in the film as a fencing instructor lusting after the lovely Rosamund Pike.<br />As stated, by Bond standards this isn't even close to the great films in the series.  It also was not a great film for Pierce Brosnan to go out on.  I always felt he had at least 2 more Bonds in him.  I guess the producers got tired of hearing him badmouth each film afterward and talk about things like wanting Quentin Tarantino to direct a Bond film.  However the producers have got to be jumping for joy after the grosses of Daniel Craig's 2 Bonds.<br />The extras on the blu-ray are basically the same as on the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This was typical of many summer blockbusters, but it fell below par for most James Bond films. Like other summer films, there were too many scenes of unnecessary explosions (too obviously contrived), pedantic sensuality and loudness. I enjoy those things when they are done well -- they just were not done very well here. However, the movie gets back on track to the plot just in time to keep you watching it. Not the best Bond flick nor the best Brosnan one, but not the worst either.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though Die Another Day suffers from its inclusion of bad CGI effects and a tendency to go all-out preposterous, it does enough things differently and enough things right to make it barely worth a recommendation, especially if you're a Bond aficionado who wants to catch all the references to previous Bond outings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GD9BKIUT3I89.html">A3GD9BKIUT3I89</a><br/><p>The last and weakest of the Brosnan Bonds.

The pre-title sequence is particularly strong, and the film is plot-led with a good premise that it explores far more effectively than License to Kill - Bond screws up, gets captured and finds his license to kill revoked and has to go it alone. But to many wrong choices are made in the casting of those both in front of and behind the cameras to do it full justice.<br /><br />Brosnan is certainly a major problem here, getting lazier in the role far sooner than his predecessors. He takes too much for granted and doesn't seem to be putting much effort into it in the assumption that he's got it down pat, when in reality he's starting to go to seed - certainly he must be the only man to come out of 14 months of torture in a Korean prison chubbier than when he went in, something his tendency to spend much of the opening of the film with his shirt off and hidden under a bushy Monty Python castaway beard only exacerbates.<br /><br />He's not helped much by his co-stars either: Halle Berry, who seems to become a worse actress with each successive film, really can't handle sass or wisecracks, which is a shame since that's almost all her part consists of, and their initial meeting exchange of innuendoes seems more like eavesdropping a married man picking up a hooker to prove he's still got it than anything else. Rosamund Pike's other fatale femme fares a little better purely on he grounds that, while an extremely one-dimensional performer, to least her limited abilities fit the part. Toby Stephens' villain is a bigger problem. While it's a neat touch that he models himself on an unflattering portrait of Bond's vanity, Stephens actually seems to be basing his performance on Rik Mayall's caricatured MP Alan B'stard from sitcom The New Statesman, and the results aren't pretty - a largely ineffectual screen actor, it's no accident that he needs to don an electronic suit of armour to become a credible foe for Bond in the final punch-up. Curiously, two of the better performances on display come from bit-players John Cleese (pleasingly restrained) and Michael Madsen as a distinctly unimpressed company man. Even Madonna's unnecessary cameo as a lesbian fencing instructor is considerably less painful than her terrible title-song, easily the series' worst. Still, the resulting overly enthusiastic swordfight is okay but would probably have been even better had they hired William Hobbs to choreograph it instead of Bob Anderson (Anderson may have coached Errol Flynn, but only in some of his worst films).<br /><br />The direction adds to the problems. Lee Tamahouri is a maddeningly variable director, and too often its his weaknesses on display here. For a series that prides itself on globe-trotting, he has a very poor sense of place (aside from the Iceland scenes, this is the first Bond film that really looks like they were afraid to leave the studio backlot) and his handling of action isn't always effective - indeed, the car chase actually looks like several shots are missing. Still, at least they manage to just about get away with the science behind the invisible car more effectively than the awful CGI that undermines the series' reputation for doing daring stunts for real: along with the occasionally slo-mo or sped up scene intros, it just seems horribly out of place without ever quite ruining the film.<br /><br />Another big problem is the tone. As the 20th entry in EON's series, the desire to celebrate its heritage threatens at times to overwhelm the film as it becomes increasingly self-referential. With almost every scene having an homage, a prop or an audio or visual reference to a previous movie, it stops being fun and becomes labored long before the halfway point. Bond is feeding off himself so much here that at times it reminds you of one of those animals that, when caught in a trap, gnaws its own leg off. It just about gets away with it, but it gets messy. There's fun to be had, most of it in the first half before it goes all Diamonds Are Forever, but there's still the feeling that this could and should have been much better.<br /><br />The extras package is superb, but strangely ommits the 50-minute documentary about the writers' struggle with the script that is on the UK disc.</p></br><a href="../users/ALR35EFI69S5R.html">ALR35EFI69S5R</a><br/><p>This is by far the most interesting and best-produced of the recent James Bond movies, with an interesting plot, breath-taking photography, and a smart, sassy, and able cast making it work. Pierce Brosnan has finally made the part his own, escaping the long shadow of our much-love Mr. Connery by creating a new visage and a new, hipper style for the intrepid Mr. Bond. Here he is joined by the eye-popping Halle Berry, whose emergence from the surf is a welcome sight for these old male eyes. They connect well on the film, with the twist that she is the first Bond conquest ready to love him and leave him, too. <p>The story here is credible and appealing; sent in to assassinate a North Korean general, Bond is captured after successfully and rather spectacularly killing the target. By the time he is exchanged for an opposite number months later, his reputation has been sullied, his loyalty questioned, and his -00 sanction to kill revoked. Bond decides to take things into his own hands, and stepping away from his guarded hospital ward where he is being held under security, begins to unravel the mystery to regain his reputation and his job. Brosnan and Berry are ably aided by a top-notch supporting cast, including Dame Judi Dench, John Cleese, Rick Yune, and a number of notable others. <p>I was, for example, amused to discover the material girl, Madonna herself, popping up in a brief cameo appearance mid-film, and she played her part well enough, but hardly lit up the screen. As usual for a Bond-flick, the action and the pyrotechnics are superb, especially an intriguing use of multiple lasers in a fight scene that has an unusual rhythm to it that is quite well shot, and also a number of interesting and diverting chase scenes that I found quite entertaining. The script is well written, and the usual Bond banter and repartee is as good as ever.  All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment, and the only disappointment I had with it is that the credit only alluded to the fact that James Bond would be back, but without mentioning the name of the next film. For we die-hard Bond devotees, that was a disappointment. Otherwise, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>Enjoyable James Bond film--one of the best.

Kids who went to see "Die Another Day" were sitting alongside grandparents who saw the original movies ["Goldfinger", Dr. No", etc.] when they themselves were kids. This newest installment is unlikely to be on many people's list of the best Bond movie ever made. It lies somewhere in the middle. What it may best remembered for is its sometimes ridiculous attempts to align Bond with today's teenagers' cinematic tastes. The car chases, the explosions and the special effects in general tend to overwhelm the witty dialog that has always been one of the movies' trademarks. The result is a film that tries too hard to be all things to all people. It isn't that it isn't fun; it's that it isn't as much fun as many of the earlier efforts. This isn't to say that the franchise is dead. It may well outlive all of us. Any series this long-lived goes through periods when it has to evolve. This has happened to Bond before and will happen to Bond again.<p>The plot of "Die Another Day" concerns the evil son [Toby Stephens] of a North Korean leader. Thanks to the wonder of DNA surgery [whatever that is}, the guy has transformed himself into an evil European who has made a fortune in the diamond trade. He has used his money to launch a satellite that has a powerful laser beam capable of mass destruction. It is up to 007, aided by CIA agent Jinx Jordon [Halle Berry] to stop this madman's plan for world domination. <p>Pierce Brosnan gives his usual competent performance as Bond, and Halle Berry is lovely to look at. Stephens almost steals the show as the bad guy, but Bond movies are famous for their memorable villains. <p>There's not much going on in this movie - no subtext, no hidden meaning. It's pure escapist entertainment. There's nothing to think about. It's a ride you either enjoy or you don't.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>4 stars 15th of 23. After some thought and after seeing it 3 times, I decided to rank this 15th of the 23 bond movies made so far. It was different. Bond is actually captured and tortured following a traitor on the inside setting him up. The action and sets are spectacular. The story was a little rough to follow and the characters not as developed as a typical bond movie. At this time, I'm leaving this one as 15th, which puts it ranked between Moonraker (14) and The Spy Who Loved Me (16). This would also leave it ranked as my least favorite of the 4 brosnan films.<p>This is still a tremendous action movie, it is just that i like 14 bond movies more.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>The creative action is tremendous.

In the Fleming books, he was captured and tortured in two books, including the second book.  They made 20 movies before bond is captured and tortured.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Ok, so it's not "Tomorrow Never Dies" but Die another Day impresses more than people give it credit for.

Die Another Day really is classic cinema, and it should be apprieciated as so. Pierce Brosnan pulls of a stunning performance as James Bond, and Halle Barry is very good as Jinx.<br /><br />My only reservation is reccomending this film is some sexual content (much like any other Bond film.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>Ok, the lines are cheesy, no one can deny that, and the romantic picks up lines used by Bond are actually quite nauseating!<p>Though there are more witty plays on words like the name of the island where Cuban doctors' harvest stolen human organs-Isla Los Organos.<p>Having said that there is plenty of fun and thrilling action. The North Koreans and Red Chinese make such perfect villains (because they are in reality total villains (even if it is no longer politically correct in the sad post-cold war era to recognize that reality).<br />Pierce Brosnan plays the role of James bond with great panache.<br />I thought Haile Berry was incredibly sexy and thrilling in her role as American agent, Jinx you would think butter wouldn't melt in her mouth), as was the gorgeous fencer Rosamund Pike as the treacherous Miranda Frost.<br />John Cleese and Judy Dench are great as M and Q respectively.<p>Then of course there are all the gadgets and the exotic locales like the Ice Palace in Iceland.<p>A lot of Bond filled fun. I enjoyed it , especially seeing those North Korean Stalinists get chopped up.<br />That's why the movie was banned in that prison camp state-which makes it worthwhile seeing for that reason alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"Die Another Day" is a reasonably entertaining installment in the seemingly endless James Bond series - provided you don't go into the theater expecting too much that is.  This edition boasts an utterly preposterous plot (that goes almost without saying in films of this type), spectacular stunts and special effects (except for one really badly done shot of Bond boogie boarding down an ice floe), cool gizmos and gadgets, and one of the most beautiful Bond girls of all time in the person of none other than Academy Award winner Halle Berry.  Ms. Berry is not the only Oscar-winning actress to lend her talents to this venture, however.  Dame Judi Dench brings her own touch of class to the festivities as Bond's brittle, starchy boss, known only as M (one does get the sense, however, that the British grand dame is doing a bit of slumming appearing in a work of this caliber).<p>Like most Bond flicks, this one runs about a half hour longer than it should.  And one does begin to feel that these films have gone so far over-the-top in their plotting and style that there really isn't a whole lot of humanity left in the series.  That's where Pearce Brosnan comes in.  He provides enough of a down-to-earth quality to help keep the film at least somewhat grounded in reality, which is certainly necessary considering just how cartoonish in nature many of the action scenes are in this picture.  The fact that the North Koreans serve as the arch villains of the story might have lent the film a patina of social relevance were the sociopolitical issues not dealt with in so utterly absurd a way.<p>There is one amusing scene wherein Bond looks with wry disdain at the retinue of  "high tech" spy devices from the past, including many used in the very earliest 007 pictures.  That kind of bemused self-ribbing is all to the good in a film as lightweight in substance as this one.  <p>There are plenty of better films playing out there right now that could certainly use even a smidgen of the box office proceeds that will be generated by this movie, but "Die Another Day" is must viewing for any hardcore fanatic of the Bond called James.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C21DQ4FQARGV.html">A2C21DQ4FQARGV</a><br/><p>I love this movie. To me this is the best bond movie to date. i love the action and the romance between Pierce and Halle. The ice scenses were fun. Really great movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Die Another Day&quot; can certainly be said to be the best of the last four Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan.  The script is a very good one with clear starting points and carry through; the acting by all involved is a perfect match for the script and the overall feel of the movie harkens one back to the earlier days in the line of 007 James Bond movies where it's all about a big script and big action sequences that leave an audience stunned as James Bond does the impossible time after time and gets a babe or two in the process.<p>Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan is the perfect actor for James Bond and just as &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is the best of his first four Bond films; with this one he gives his best performance yet as Bond, James Bond.  Halle Berry's performance as Jinx, an NSA agent with the same goals as Mr. Bond is perfect.  At the time of this films theatrical release there were rumors about a spin off film with the character of Jinx and Halle Berry in the lead role, since that time &quot;I've&quot; heard little about it though.  John Cleese stepping in as Q is a good pick as well, replacing the dearly departed, lovable Desmond Llewelyn in that memorable role.  One of the best scenes in the film is John Cleese's scene as Q and seeing many of the props from earlier movies.  As usual, Judi Dench is perfect as M and ever so gorgeous Rosamund Pike's performance as Miranda Frost is quite memorable.<p>Lee Tamahori steps in as the director for this great Bond film and does a great job, his previous credits includes directing &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; and episodes of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;  Much of the credit for the success of this Bond film can most likely be attributed to his view on Bond and how he aptly displays this film.<p>The Premise:<p>As with all Bond films, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; starts off with a huge action sequence, setting up the rest of what the film is about.  James Bond infiltrates his way into North Korea, in certainly what can be described as a most unusual way.  He's there to assassinate a North Korean Army Colonel who's selling weapons on the black market.  His cover is blown and yet, through some pretty amazing action sequences, he seemingly accomplishes his mission.  In doing so though, he's captured by the North Korean Army and in particular, the father of the Colonel he's seemingly assassinated.  After spending several months in a North Korean prison being tortured, he's traded back to the British for a North Korean agent.<p>What follows from there is most certainly the most exciting Pierce Brosnan Bond movie yet!  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of Bond movies or people who are fans good action/drama films!

If this was the story of 002 or 006 I'd be satisfied with it but it's not and I wasn't. A couple of things bothered me. First, why is Bond, a 00 man on a such a simple mission when he falls into enemy hands? Where was the fun? Bond movies are supposed to be escapist thrill rides. Bond hardly gets to put on his tux. Die Another Day was darn near grim throughout. MI6 does several sloppy things before and after Bond's mission that don't make sense. Q makes only a tiny appearance and Moneypenney is appallingly miscast. <p>What's good about the movie? Pierce Brosnon. He makes you forget the Timothy Dalton years completely. Halle Berry is a classic gorgeous Bond girl whose also quite capable of kicking butt on her own. Judi Dench as the frostiest M ever, and we finally get a villain whose crazy and evil enough to stand in the same room as the classic Bond villains. The Cuba and Iceland scenes are  quite good too. <p>Ultimately too much of the Bond legend is left on the cutting room floor. This wasn't much more than an oridnary spy flick. I liked it mostly but it wasn't a Bond film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY is the 20th in the bond series. It has a nice twist in that in the beginning 007 fails and becomes a POW. It the twists in the story that make this film very interesting. Pierce Brosnon (Remington Steel, The Thomas Crown Affair, The World Is Not Enough) does a great job in this film and seems to play vulnerability well. The story is that of a terrorist and diamond collector wanna-be that develops a device that could - you guessed it - destroy the world. Directed by Lee Tamahori (Mullholland Falls) this is the technically finest of any of the Bond films. Score by David Arnold ( )<p>This film has action and gadgets like you wouldn't believe. The star prop in this film, is, as in most of the Bond films, his car. This one is invisible. Not to mention his high tech watch and incredible stunts like you haven't seen before. The effects and technology have changed so much that you can't tell what's real and what is digital. Oh, and did I mention that James Bond always gets the girl? Or, "Girls" rather?<p>Now the cast is very cool. Halle Berry (X-men, Monsters Ball, Bullworth) is really good and an American Agent and she can really strut her stuff both in the bedroom and when she is dodging bullets. There is swordplay and fighting, chasing, car crashes, airplane explosions, laser destruction, high-speed ice battles and so much more. The villains are played by Toby Stephens (Space Cowboys, Orlando) and Rick Yune (The Fence, Fast and Furious) .  <p>And, you could expect nothing but the best from British Secret Service Leader - Judi Dench ( Shakespeare In Love, Iris, The Shipping News ) as "M" and the ever and always funny John Cleese (Holy Grail, A Fish Called Wanda ) and "Q".<p>Overall this film had action and adventure and an extreme adrenaline rush from beginning to end. The only thing that was a little "out of place" was the opening titles. They were not as "Bondish" as they usually are. Not as interesting and more abstract. However, who could be the title song sung by Madonna - who also makes a cameo appearance as a Sword Play expert. She looks good. If you are a bond fan, you'll enjoy this experience and if you are not or never seen a Bond film - you are in for the ride of your life. The film is for the whole family. (11-22-02)</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>I'm laughing at all the people who think that this movie was worthy of 5 stars or more, No, no, no. Halle Berry is terrible, she was trying to imitate Ursula Andress's famous bikini moment. And failed miserably, her acting was of the worst kind. Brosnan looked bored. Of course after the movie came out, he mentioned how that he wasn't going to do another Bond movie unless they focused less of CGI and more on the story. And that's all this movie is, an Ice hotel. Really?!, Really?!, invisible cars. And a fight between two souped up cars, One of the many problem I have is that MI6 has had an agent shadowing the bad guy for awhile. And amazingly she hasn't been able to come up with anything yet, that would raise a red flag with me. And surprise surprise surprise, turns out she's working with the villain all this time. This movie is on the same level as Moon Raker, A view to a Kill. I have to agree, when Brosnan went to cuba. You could tell he was trying to look cool and sexy, but he just came across as old and creepy. No, No, No, this movie is bad. The main plot you ask, why to use a laser in the sky. That's right, a laser in the sky. This was Brosnan's last movie, and I don't really blame him. Halle Berry was NOT, that good. Sorry, a terrible movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I firmly believe that the best thing Pierce Brosnan ever did was retire from playing James Bond.  Sure, he was great at it, but his career was better than the hokey movies his Bond flicks turned out to be.  Yeah, they have some merit, and overall they are entertaining, but this is a new age and a new Bond was needed, and the material that Brosnan was getting was just beneath him.  I mean, most people don't even realize that Pierce Brosnan is a good actor; but he is!<br /><br />That said, this was his final run as the legendary womanizing secret agent, and it's certainly fun in its own right.  Brosnan still holds firm to the character he created in the mid-90's, not skipping a beat.  He's every bit as influentially charming as he was ten years prior.<br /><br />In this installment, Brosnan (er, Bond) finds himself saddled between two sexy young things in the bodies of Halle Berry (yeah, Oscar be darned...I'm doing a Bond movie) and Rosamund Pike (by god, this woman has bloomed into one amazing actress over the past few years).  Go figure, Bond has to contend with hot women.  So, the villain is as unbelievable as the last one, and the hookups are outrageously twisted (in that Bond always has a knack for sleeping with the enemy that is almost surely pretending to be the friend).  The final catfight is worth the wait, despite its overt campiness.  It's that campiness that I was referring to in the outset of this review.  I'm glad that the reigns have been passed over, and despite the fact that the last Bond film wasn't as successful as `06's `Casino Royale', I strongly feel that the new direction is exactly what was needed to revamp interest in this decades old character.<br /><br />Brosnan and his lady friends (including Dench, who was so born to play M) are all in fine form here, and the special effects and action sequences are up to Bond standards; and yet, the film is rather forgettable when you get passed it all.<br /><br />It's fun, but nothing special.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Madonna sings the theme song and makes a cameo as Verity, the domanatrix-styled fencing instructor during this 20th rendition of James Bond. There isn't much chemistry between Brosnan and Berry but they make a good enough duo to fight a North Korean mercenary in Iceland. The plot plays on the Icarus Theme in Ancient Greek myth whereby a wayward son's overarching ego flies too high enough to the sun that he burns and crashes. A good old 007 time and the swan song of Pierce Brosnan and he sails into the Bond son for the last time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>While on a mission in North Korea, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is betrayed by an unknown informant and imprisoned there. When he is released in exchange for a North Korean agent, he is suspected by his own intelligence service of having divulged sensitive information, and his "00" status is rescinded. Bond sets out to find the person who betrayed him by way of finding the North Korean terrorist who was traded for him. His search leads him to Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens), a publicity crazed diamond magnate whose gemstones are of suspect origin. Following the same trail is a beautiful American agent named Jinx (Halle Barry). Graves invites all the relevant parties to his Ice Palace in Iceland for the grand unveiling of "Icarus", a new satellite technology which will allow the sun's light to be focused anywhere on Earth at any time. James Bond and Jinx must discover Grave's true identity and purpose, find the mole who has compromised their agencies' security, and prevent Icarus from being used as a weapon of mass destruction.<br /><br />"Die Another Day" celebrates the 40th anniversary of James Bond films by placing little references to Bond history in the movie: Jinx' first appearance closely resembles that of Ursula Andress in "Dr. No". Some of Bond's old gadgets reappear in Q's storage room. And I'm sure there were a lot of references that I missed., but this homage to past Bonds is neither fulfilling nor distracting. "Die Another Day" does quite well on its own and joins the list of thoroughly entertaining Brosnan Bonds, carrying on the somewhat modernized traditions of this great franchise. The action sequences are creative, original and entertaining. The "Bond girls" are actually very pretty. Halle Barry is a pleasure to watch as the plucky Jinx. And Rosamund Pike does a nice Ice Princess as Gustav Grave's publicist. Carrying on a long tradition, there are a lot of new half-plausible, half-science fiction technologies that look really neat, anyway. "Die Another Day" is a special effects-driven movie, in contrast to Sean Connery's more character-driven Bonds. But, ironically, Pierce Brosnan's modern Bond is less of a super hero and more of a man than Connery's. This is particularly evident in "Die Another Day". We see Bond's vunerability...which he then uses his charming personality, skill and great determination to overcome. A solid, well-paced, entertaining Bond.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>The thing with Bond is that the premise of the movie never changes and the actors who play Bond either make it or break it.  Thankfully Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job at being the suave, debonair 007.<br />The story begins in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea with a highspeed hovercraft chase and continues via Hong Kong to Cuba and London where Bond meets up with the two women Jinx (Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) who play such important and differing roles in his quest to unmask a traitor and to prevent a war of catastrophic consequence.  Hot on the trail of the villains, Bond travels to Iceland where he experiences at first hand the power of an amazing new weapon before a dramatic confrontation with his main adversary back in Korea where it all started.  Although this was an ok Bond flick, I wouldn't rush out to buy it and add it to my collection.  No one will ever compare to Sean Connery.</p></br><a href="../users/AB2AQMK9PCWWX.html">AB2AQMK9PCWWX</a><br/><p>...Halle Berry fans are gonna hate me for saying this, but this movie was like "Halle Berry has a cameo in a James Bond film? Ke-ull!" Period. Yeah, she looked great. But what James bond movie doesn't hame good looking ladies in it I askya?<p>And to her credit, she kicked a lil butt, too.  <p>But like many of today's action films the emphasis is on *action* not chemistry between the majors, not character development. The banter between Halle and Brosnan was too corny for even James Bond standards. And the chemistry? They had as much chemistry with each other as two lovers the morning after a one night stand and the daylight is showing a bit more than needed. (Hey, wait a minute. Lemme rethink this analogy.) (Forget it.) Anyhoo, we know she can do the witty repartee thing 'cause we saw it in Boomerang and later on in The Flintstones. And Pierce? Banter was his middle name on the television series Remington Steele. We want to see that Je ne sais Qua between our majors. What happened here?<p>Well, for one thing, there was over sixty minutes of non-stop action...groovy ice capades, fun and games in Korea, clowning and cloning and makeovers in Cuba and sparring with two ladies called M. <p>Plus, I daresay Pierce would prefer to be seen nowadays as a Serious Auct-torah as he moves into the Sean Connery graduation stage of his career. Maybe next he'll do a remake of Zardoz, who knows?<p>But for non-stop fun where the hero kills all the bad guys, destroys the massive headquarters of the villians, again saves the world form certain annihilation and then has time to bury the female lead with loads of jewels in a love nest, you cannot beat this...</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan is back in his 4th outing as the tuxedo clad suave English spy, and looks set to have sealed his name in  connection with Bond, in almost Sean Connery fashion.<br />Heavily SfX laden action sequences break up the usual one liners, and witty inuendo but this time, for a change there seems to be a real underlying tenacity and gritty toughness to the Bond character. The opening 5 minutes is almost brutal (and a little different in style compared to the usual openings) albeit a tiny bit annoying being overladen with the titles, but apart from that is extremely enjoyable.<br />A big problem with all Bond movies, is the comparison factor to those that went before, and although Brosnan is definiteley the right man, the plots seem to be relying heavily on older movies. In this outing James must save the World (again) from a madman who is using diamonds, to build a super space laser weapon, to eliminate the free world - sound familiar? Well yes it does, and the story is more than a little similar to Diamonds are Forever.<br />The next minor criticism would be the high tech gadgets, which are always usually pleasing (if a touch incredible), I found an Aston Martin that becomes invisible, something of a stretch and if one looks back, the really succesful movies in the series have not relied too heavily on high tech, or made them too fantastic. These minor grumbles aside, strap yourself in for plenty of action, high jinks, and good solid acting performances all round. Haley Berry is particularly fetching, and the latest bond girl (who has a brain as well as a body) adding much to the script and story.<br />The real measure of this movie is it's undoubted success had it NOT been a Bond movie, one feels that if the lead character had been Harold Smith instead of James Bond, the story and production would still have been great, and very watchable, even if the razzmattaz associated with it's release, would have been probably non existent. Let's hope the super spy keeps going for another 20 movies. Enjoy !!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan makes a great Bond, with the right blend of poncy suaveness and cruel steeliness. Nice to see him getting a little long in the tooth as well, which helps lend depth to his character.  In its opening scenes, this promises to be a transcendant Bond film, taking an entirely different tone from those that came before: this time around, 007 gets caught on a mission and, astoundingly, spends over a year in a brutal torture camp hidden somewhere deep in North Korea.  When he's traded back to the West in exchange for one of the baddies who did him in, James finds himself unwelcome at MI5 -- for unexplained reasons, they seem to think he had something to do with his own capture and the failure of the mission.  Relieved of duty, Bond briefly becomes a rogue agent, driven by revenge and perhaps just a little bitterness towards jolly olde England.  It's a nice set-up, but quickly devolves into a typical flurry of car chases, big explosions, glib dialogue and improbable, campy plot twists, along with every new extreme sport known to man.  A fine Bond film, but not the radically new approach hinted at in the beginning.  Can't say I was wild about Halle Berry as the latest Bond girl, Jinx, but overall the movie was good, clean fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>It is useless to state that after Sean Connery, Pierce Brosnan has been the most charismatic Bond until the date. And this is probably the most realist Opus of his whole set of entries about 007. The script inside what Bond terminology represents has to do with the real menace that represents North Korea inside the geopolitical map.<br /><br />This inner conflicts are far to be resolved, there are many involved and mingled issues to be discussed here. But this is the departure' s point to establish the rules of the game, in which hidden foreigner interests will be in struggle.<br /><br />The visual feast will load the screen with impressive sequences of high caliber tension; the imaginative audacious, the fabulous special effects become a true parade of technological exhibition. And the brilliant inclusion of Halle Berry adds a major quote of dazzling talent and beauty. You will watch to Bond in an mesmerizing fencing' s duel, delirious car chases on the ice and an electrifying persecution of tanks in the first section of the film.<br /><br />The rest of the cocktail is planned according Bond paradigm: beautiful girls, the unavoidable casino and a fantastic soundtrack performed by Madonna.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In some ways, DIE ANOTHER DAY is the best Bond movie ever. I mean, after the action-packed opening scene through the 49th Parrellel in Korea; James Bond is captured by the North Koreans and sent to type of POW camp. The plot remains fairly tight (considering this is a Bond picture), there are all sorts of new gadgets (and glimpses of ones from the past), lots of witty one-liners and double entredes, great action, and two stunningly-beautiful babes.  The movie constantly play on the Bond-format, but does so in such a way that it shakes things up and makes the franchise seem more alive and current.<p>Nevertheless, with all it has going for it, there is one major flaw to the film.  James Bond movies used to be fairly believable (see the first two Bond movies), but it seems that as each new film is made, the creators see just how far they can go to push the believability button. There aren't a lot of things in this movie that question one's suspension of disbelief. However, there are a few and they are so huge that it counters all the good things this film has going for it.  For instance, the plane/helicopter escape at the film's climax. I felt like I was watching a bad sci-fi movie when that scene happened. There could have been several other more crafty ways to have Bond escape, but instead they went for the most extreme.<p>However, other than that, DIE ANOTHER DAY is one heck of a good James Bond adventure.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is a typical James Bond flick which means a lot of good things and some bad ones but at least, if you're a fan of the series, you get what you expect.<br /><br />In other words, you get outrageous action scenes, Rambo--like mentality, a wild and fun villain, a "hot" female lead helping Bond, a bunch of sexual innuendos, a hokey-but- interesting story and some outstanding opening credits. I never had any complaints with Pierce Brosnan playing Bond. I thought he very credible in the role, sincerely macho and debonair at the same time. Halle Berry was at her peak, so male viewers had no complaints watching here. She wasn't in here just for looks; she was in fighting shape, too.<br /><br />Is the story far-fetched? Yeah, a little! Ludicrous? You bet. Entertaining? Sure. Who watches these films for their intelligence?</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>I have to say that I loved this Bond film.  I loved the gadgets, cars, the women (who doesn't love Halle Berry?), the villains, the stunts and the effects.  This addition of the DVD is loaded with bonus features with special focus on the car stunts (the glacier chase).<br /><br />This Bond film has him making a mistake here and there (unlike most Bond films), and having a partner of sorts (Berry) through most of the film.  In addition, the style of direction is very different and highly stylized which was better than the typical "paint-by-numbers" of the previous directors.  This was just all around fun escapism and doesn't pretend to be more than that.  If this is Brosnan's swansong as Bond, then it is a fitting end for him unlike both Connery (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9C9">Diamonds are Forever</a>) and Moore (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W9CD">A View to a Kill</a>) who had lackluster finishes as Bond.<br /><br />This was financially (at the time) the most successful Bond film raking in over $400 million until the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MNP2KI">Casino Royale (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a> which has hit the $500 million mark.  Brosnan has the role down and looks great for his age.  He certainly had plenty of Bond left in him and I am sad to see him go, but he should be onto bigger and better things now as he's really proven to be a fine actor.  Check out his marvelous performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EQ5UIC">The Matador (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He has proven to be a diverse actor beyond the Bond films.  You might wanted to check him out or recall his performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IFQLIM">Mrs. Doubtfire</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225547">Dante's Peak</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305657947">The Thomas Crown Affair</a> to see what I mean.  I think his later years will mirror Connery's, if he continues as he is.  I also think it's in the realm of possibility to see him as Bond again just as Connery revisited the role later and successfully in his more mature years in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004WEJZ">Never Say Never Again</a> where he is an intentionally aged Bond, but still smooth.<br /><br />Although this Bond film was the best by my standards, I realize there are many who have tired of this successful formula and I am one also to some degree.  I would have loved to have seen one or two more Bond flicks with Brosnan as he is a youthful looking 54, but I have no trouble with the direction the producers went with "Casino Royale" (see my review there if you are interested).  Just because something is very successful, doesn't mean it can't use some improvement and/or change.  Of course, none of this justifies the Bond producers terrible manner of firing Brosnan by fax message after they have always said "he can have the role as long as he wants it."  I think that is Hollyspeak for "until we change our minds . . ."</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Tnis 20th James Bond movie really fails to deliver on its promise. After a rather flat and tired precredits sequence the movie sets into a comfortable pace and looks to be heading  to be one of the best movies of the series.<br />But, somewhere around 007s arrival in Iceland the movie seems to lose both focus and intelligence and what we are left with is the feeling of a movie with a definite split personality. A great beginning and a terrible, boring conclusion.<br />The writers also seem to be devoid of new ideas blatently copying ideas from previous entries. They called them 'homages" but I don't buy it. It's clear that Purvis and Wade are tired with 007 and just wanted a paint by numbers Bond movie to churn out.<br />Very disappointing - especially after a three year wait following the (even worse) The World is Not Enough).</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>The name is Goldberg....RUBE Goldberg! This is EASILY the most gadget-ridden Bond film, hands down, of the entire series! It is also, alas, the second weakest Brosnan Bond by far, ahead of "Tomorrow Never Dies", which I've never liked. Things are a little TOO fantastic here and there are far too many "nods" to earlier Bond films, (so many, in fact, that you can lose count!) for this to actually qualify as its own movie, even! You will recognize "Dr. No", "Thunderball", "Diamonds Are Forever", "You Only Live Twice", "The Living Daylights" and others as this "plot" unwinds.<br /><br />It's a complex "plot", too. Bond travels to North Korea, (not a great idea for a westerner these days,) to assassinate a crazed NK colonel who has been smuggling diamonds and generally screwing up the international scene with his shenanigans. To make a long story short and not to produce too many spoilers, Bond gets captured after a rousing chase involving hovercrafts and advanced artillery, gets tortured, released, forsaken by MI6, chewed out by "M" and again, as in "Licence To Kill" has to go renegade for the rest of the movie. Along the way, he meets a woman named "Jinx", played by Halle Berry, who also works for the West, and who is after the same North Korean colonel Bond is. They travel to Cuba, then to Iceland, get captured again, have some cutlery tete-a-tetes with the bad guys, run into double and triple crosses, find the true meaning of plastic surgery and get to use the most amazing Bond car ever conceived of.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the Aston Martin used in this film is equipped with a CLOAKING device, fer cryin' out loud...something that would have the entire assembly of Bond-o-philes themselves going "you're joking", upon hearing this. Otherwise, it's just about as tricked out as Timothy Dalton's was in "Daylights". There's also a nod to Brosnan's run in "Remington Steele", as he walks up to spiffy hotel desk in Hong Kong and asks for "his usual suite" drenched to the bone, with long, scraggly hair and a beard, basically filthy. This is a straight steal from a scene in the two hour, fifth year "Steele" episode, "The Steele That Would Not Die".<br /><br />Anyway, though it is witty, as usual, and though it's got some nice tense moments, this is easily the hokiest Bond film since Moore's laughable tenure as "Suave, Joe Suave". One of the things that was so refreshing about Dalton and Brosnan's Bond films is that they were TONS more realistic than all of Moore's and even Connery's later Bond films, (post "Goldfinger",) with relevant villains in post-cold war dust-ups or drug kingpin situations. This one harkens back to the bad-old days of ridiculous gadgetry, kaleidoscopic plots that owe too much to earlier movies and a general "Bond-parody" feel, rather than a genuine, glamorized espionage adventure.<br /><br />You know, Ian Fleming's novels bore more of a resemblance to Len Deighton's or John Le Carre's work than they did to "The Man From U.N.C.L.E" or Matt Helm. They really should have kept the "realism renaissance" going with this character.<br /><br />Don't even talk to me about Daniel Craig.<br /><br />Palooka...JOE Palooka!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>I was hyped and excited this being the 40th Anniversary and 20th film in the James Bond series. The first 25 minutes of the movie is "attention-getting". Great idea Pierce Brosnan had for a story. The delightful Samantha Bond is back as "Miss Moneypenny". They gave her a scene you may never forget. Dame Judi Dench is nice to see again. John Cleese returns this time as the Quartermaster. Desmond Llewelyn passed away in 1999 from a car accident.<br /> Halle Berry as "Jinx" did not impress me.<br /> Toby Stephens, you might dislike as "Gustav Graves" from the beginning. However, I just adore his mother, Maggie Smith and the work she has done.<br /><br /> This film had some special effects that really was too much and unbelievable to take. Let's not get too carried away with the CGI effects. James Bond on the glacier ice water-skiing with parachutes effect looked so fake. It even looked computer animated. And it was.<br /> Advancing technology is fine. Creating new, interesting gadgets is fine too. Some of the "Q" gadgets in past films have become reality in the present. Keep it real, guys.<br /> What I thought was really cool and possibly the coolest villain yet was Rick Yune as "Zao". Great invention of a villain with a diamond-pelted face.<br /> Rosamund Pike as "Miranda Frost" was refreshing.<br />  All in all I was disappointed with Die Another Day (2002), but I thought Pierce Brosnan deserved to make one more movie as "James Bond". This is his last as 007.<br /> If you have seen this film before, click on "Q Branch". Then select "MI6 Database" below. Click "MI6 Database" "ON".

Film-goers are perhaps setting their expectations a bit too high, but there is little doubt that the 20th outing of the debonair British secret agent will clean up at the box office come November 22. Pierce Brosnan returns for the fourth time as 007, along with returning cast members Judi Dench as M, John Cleese (Q) and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. From the previews and trailers, it looks set to be a great action ride filled with homages to earlier Bond films (Halle Berry as the seductive villian Jinx is very similar to Ursula Andress in DR NO). After the overly-glossy THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, one hopes that this entry will match the very high bar set by 1995's GOLDENEYE. Director Lee Tamahori (Along Came A Spider, TV's Sopranos) is an excellent choice for such a fast-paced and exciting action film. But action alone won't make this a sure-fire winner. Since the film-makers ran out of Ian Flemming books to base the movies on, things have been somewhat shaky, especially with TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Goldeneye, TND and TWINE have all had impressive action, but lack the charm and wit of earlier films (Bond gets wet from a female water-skier, she says "I've got you all wet" and Bond's sly retort is "Yes, but my martini's still dry"). It's classic lines and oft-quoted innuendos that make a great Bond film great. And of course, the man himself, Mr Brosnan, who, depsite being involved in the last two so-so entries, has hardened his performance and he's looking great in this one, which many people are getting very excited about. Plus more good news, 007 is ditching the Bema for the classic Aston Martin! And David Arnold returns to compose the film's score (Brilliant!). But specultion aside, we can only hope that it will be as exciting and cool as the classic Bond films of the 60s. Like many fans, I am waiting with great anticipation...</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Who would have dreamed in 1963 that Dr. No would be the first of twenty James Bond films?  There have been some misses in those 20 films (Moonraker, Octopussy, to name two), but overall the series has aged quite well, and moves into the 21st century quite adroitly.<br />While ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE remains my favorite Bond film, Pierce Brosnan has done well in his Bond role.  He's dashing but vulnerable, and he is a good actor.  He's joined in this technological brouhaha by the talented Halle Berry.  While this is certainly not Halle's best performance, she shows the versatility and dedication that eventually led to her Oscar win in MONSTER'S BALL.  She's a beautiful woman and she holds her own in the fight game too!  Rosamund Pike is delightful as Ms. Frost, the double agent who battles Halle in the climax.  Toby Stephens does a good job as Graves, but he's not the most memorable of the Bond villains.  The action sequences and effects are stunning, except for the obvious blue screen used when Bond escapes from the supercar.  And the laser in the sky threat has been used twice before in Bond movies:  You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever.  John Cleese is cool as Q; Madonna is silly in her cameo, and DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of the worst themes of any Bond movie.  No one will ever replace John Barry as the master of the Bond themes.  And it wouldn't hurt to see Judi Dench soften a little in her role as M.  Nice touch in having B movie actor Michael Masden as the American NSA chief.<br />All in all, a worthy entry in the Bond series; if Brosnan and crew can keep up this kind of pace, we may see Bond hit 50!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job as James Bond and Berry is another pretty face amoung many others(not her best preformance in a film).  However,  the film does hold its own and is worth seeing by even the people who don't care for a Bond movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY is a Bond movie in which everybody tried hard to come up with something special. The predictable result of all that striving was, of course, that DIE ANOTHER DAY is mostly ordinary Bond du jour.<br /><br />This, the 20th in the Bond series and the 40th anniversary Bond film, was consciously crafted to be a "supermovie," and it is--in spots. Hard-core Bond fans will appreciate all the nods and winks to the earlier films. Halle Berry's sudden appearance on a beach in Cuba complete with diver's knife, is pure DR. NO. And again, Berry being strapped to a laser table to be cut in half is straight out of GOLDFINGER. A diamond-powered spacecraft is the legacy of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Bond plays idly with his THUNDERBALL jet-pak in Q's laboratory, and so on. Taken all together these scenes form a kind of retrospective melange that is fun to watch. How many can you identify...?<br /><br />The movie begins on an interesting but unusual note: Bond is captured and tortured by the North Koreans. After more than a year a dirty, long haired, battered Bond is released in a prisoner exchange. Kept in an isolation chamber by MI-6, he is stripped of his 00 number. Managing a quick escape he begins to hunt for whoever betrayed him.<br /><br />His travels lead him to Jinx (Berry), an American NSA agent who is also hunting the turncoat. Together with fellow agent Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike), they target the bizarre billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens) whose right-hand man turns out to be Zhao (Rick Yune) the man Bond was exchanged for.<br /><br />The usual gadgets make their appearance. Best of all is an invisible Astin-Martin Vanquish, which, when visible, is easily the most-lethal looking car Bond has ever driven.<br /><br />Brosnan once again reprises the Conneryesque "dark Bond" of DR. NO and FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. Brosnan has aged a bit, and his face has developed character. In the seven years since GOLDENEYE he has finally made the role his own in a cool open-neck buttondown manner. The Havana beach scene underscores this by having the "James Bond Theme" played in the background with a Latin beat.<br /><br />There has been talk that Berry deserves her own Jinx franchise, and it certainly would sell. Jinx is a female Bond, wisecracking, irrepressible and endearing.<br /><br />The difficulties with DIE ANOTHER DAY are all the result of overexuberance on the part of the production team. They tried to create an epic, but the story drags its feet after a very promising beginning. The script quickly becomes predictable and so there's virtually no tension. The bad guys are bland (a mark of recent Bond films). Graves is too fey to seem dangerous and Zhao looks as if he mistakenly stepped off the set of THE MATRIX. Director Lee Tamahori consciously patterned this film after that franchise, and his derivative filmmaking leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The producers need to spend more time crafting a storyline and less on the set-action pieces that define Brosnan's Bond. They also need to bring back the Bond who knows which champagne to order at what temperature. In this styleless era such touches would have a life all their own.<br /><br />The title of the film grinds on the mind, coming so soon after TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Worse yet is the eminently forgettable Madonna title song, a piece of techno-pop throwaway that couldn't even survive in the dance clubs. Madonna's bad cameo as the owner/instructress of a fencing school is hopefully not the augry of a 21st century trend to having the title song artists appear on camera.<br /><br />There is a hyperreliance on special effects. Bond parasailing off a glacier is nothing more than the most heavyhanded CGI imaginable, exactly like a video game. It looks cheap and unconvincing in the midst of this high-budget project, a film with otherwise beautiful location shooting.<br /><br />The DVD is a two-disc set that is loaded with production goodies. It's all great fun. Though DIE ANOTHER DAY is "Bond 20" it definitely ranks in the top ten.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>I'm being sarcastic, so I hope you noticed. I never was a big Bond fan. They're all the same thing basically, Bond meets girl, Bond beats up bad guys, Bond is invincible. These movies really demonstrate the same invincibility tis man has. But, here we've gone too far. To call this movie unrealistic is unfair. It is the father of unrealism. There are maybe only two Bonds that are 5 star babies to me and this ain't one. It was in the "so called classics" that some were good. I say some. But, some of Connery's were great action flicks that you've gotta love. This movie is pathetic. It has Bond doing the usual but in horrible fashion. We see him go to prison, get his but kicked for what purpose? We all know he's going to live! Then he shows us that he is a master fencer (?), great with women, great with cars, great with guns, great with everything. Everyone would love to be this guy. I mean he survives the sun (which was somehow controlled?!?! I mean am I an idiot? Isn't that a little too unrealistic and absurd?!)jumps off a cliff making a parachute somehow and then using a little platform to surfboard in HUGE waves! What this? Sounds similiar to that idiotic scene at the start of Batman and Robin where they surfboard in mid air?! I guess so!<br /><br />So, if you like Bond and want to watch him do the same thing for the billionth time, then watch this pathectic movie, but if you're like me and want to see actually a good movie, then don't watch this horrid movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A20JYIHL1W1U54.html">A20JYIHL1W1U54</a><br/><p>DIE ANOTHER DAY catapults James Bond into the Twenty First Century. This movie is fast paced and cram packed with action on the land, in the sea and in the air. Pierce Brosnan is James Bond and he does it everywhere. Brosnan's Bond is more relaxed, confident and deadlier than all his previous outings as 007. The new Aston Martin has some really great innovations and plays a major part in the movie as its predecessor DB5 did in GOLDFINGER. That being said this film combines both the reality base of the recent Bond films with the larger than life plots for world domination from the older Bond films but with enormous amounts of technological advances added. The result is a whole new frenetic and furious look. David Arnold's pivital score as a whole reflects this new direction as he updates his approach to the music with increased electronic mind blowing audiotronics that really pushes the envelope. The movie's only shortcoming is Halle Berry as Jinx. Jinx is a bit of an enigma. Is she there as Bond's friend or foe? They really don't work together but instead just happen to be around to pull each other out of a jam. Jinx works for the NSA. It is clearly seen that the NSA and MI6 aren't exactly on congenial terms. The movie never really addresses any relationship between Bond and Jinx. That's one fault. Also, the villain's plot was a little uninspired since it involved a virtual duplicate of Blofeld's diamond refracting satellite from DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. However, DIE ANOTHER DAY does not fail to entertain and it delivers far more action than any other Bond film to date. Besides, it's the first time we get to see Bond smoke since LICENCE TO KILL!</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>In 2002 Pierce Brosnan returned for the fourth and final time as James Bond, in the twentieth official Bond film.  I enjoyed this film more than "The World Is Not Enough," but less than "Tomorrow Never Dies."  I find it interesting that so many Bond fans dislike this movie so much.  There are things about this movie to dislike, but this movie has as much going for it as the other Bond movies with a strong science fiction flavor, and perhaps more than some.<br /><br />This Bond movie begins with Bond penetrating North Korea.  However, something goes wrong and North Koreans capture Bond.  During the opening credits we see bits and pieces as Bond is tortured and Madonna sings a song from her electronic period (can we say "yuck?").  Soon after the credits are finished Bond is traded for diamond decorated Zao (Rick Yune).  Bond is not pleased that he was traded, but is even less pleased that he is being considered a traitor.  Bond is not one for waiting for things to happen, so he escapes from custody to discover that he is in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Bond slowly discovers that Zao and Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) are somehow linked.  Gustav demonstrates the Icarus solar satellite in Iceland, both for its ostensible purpose (providing light in dark regions of the world when needed) and for a far more nefarious purpose.  Bond never waivers from his goal, helped along the way by Halle Berry as Jinx, Judi Dench as M, and John Cleese as the new Q.<br /><br />Several things about this movie annoyed me.  I thought Madonna's role in the movie was okay (though others did not think so; read more below).  However, her song was annoying.  I would have to nominate Madonna's song in this movie as one of the worst Bond theme songs ever.  I was also displeased by the CGI used when Bond escapes from being drowned.  The escape looked like a video game, and was cheesy by Bond standards.  The escape should have been handled in a fashion that did not required animating Bond.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie had a lot of cool stuff.  The opening scene was filmed for real.  The surfers were taken out to the waves on jet powered wave runners which enabled them to ride the big waves.  The invisible car was a major coup for the film makers.  In fact, the military has been experimenting with techniques to make people and vehicles literally invisible for several years, and though they are well behind Q, one of the approaches is similar.<br /><br />The CGI of the Icarus satellite was excellent; one of the best CGI spacecraft ever.  I enjoyed the car chase between Zao and Bond in the ice hotel.  In the making of features there is lengthy discussion of the changes that had to be made to accomplish the car chase.  I also enjoyed the fight scene in the laser room between Bond and Mr. Kil (Lawrence Makoare).  The robot and laser combination was a stroke of genius, and Halle Berry's peril appeared real.<br /><br />Last, but not least, is the sword fight between Bond and Graves.  Most of the scenes were filmed with Brosnan and Stephens, a tribute to both men's abilities.<br /><br />This movie edition also includes an array of extras on two discs.  There are commentaries, pictures, making of features, and much more.  I found it strange that some of the better features from the previous version were replaced with less valuable features.  What appears to be most noticeably missing is a feature listed on the box, the "Ministry of Propaganda" from the previous release.<br /><br />This movie received an incredible 25 award nominations of all sorts from various organizations and countries, winning 5.  The only downside was the Razzie Award to Madonna for Worst Supporting Actress, and the Razzie nomination for Worst Original Song.  I think this may have been the Bond film with the most award nominations ever, and possibly the most award wins ever.<br /><br />"Die Another Day" marks 40 years of "official" Bond films.  Bond films are a microcosm of western technology, showing what we thought of as high-tech in five different decades.  I find it interesting that what we considered cutting edge in the early Bond films has been surpassed by what we have in our homes today.  I also find the changes in styles and mannerisms interesting as well.  Yet, through it all Bond remains suave and self-assured, seemingly invincible and with vast knowledge and capability.  While there are no real supermen of which we are aware, if there were such a being, Bond would have to be one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X1CEGHTHMBL1.html">A1X1CEGHTHMBL1</a><br/><p>Three surfers, including James Bond (Pierce Brosnan), enter North Korean by the sea.  They trick a helicopter to land in the wrong place and steal a passenger's brief case.  James Bond enters a North Korean military base posing as a buyer for weapons and paying with the briefcase full of diamonds.  The deal goes badly as he is recognized by Zao who is Colonel Tan-Sun Moon's assistant.  The briefcase is filled with African conflict diamonds.  In trying to escape Bond blows up the briefcase and Zao is injured as diamonds imbed themselves into his face by the force of the explosion.<br /><br />Colonel Moon tries to escape Bond by using a hover craft as Bond commandeers another smaller one and chases after him.  In typical James Bond style a battle ensues and Colonel Moon goes over a waterfall in the hovercraft while Bond is captured and imprisoned in North Korea.  He is in prison and tortured for 14 months and then released in a prisoner exchange for Zao....<br /><br />This is an action packed 007 movie with a high tech plot.  I didn't mention but Halle Berry in the story as Jinx a NSA agent.  As in most Bond films the movie is filmed in exotic locations around the world and the story line is very good.  Halle plays a perfect match to Pierce Brosnan's 007 and the chemistry is sultry.  Pierce has always played a good role as Bond and he doesn't disappoint us in this movie.  Even Madonna appears in a cameo role in the middle of the movie and she has an encounter with Bond while she introduces him to the antagonist of the film.<br /><br />This movie has spectacular special effects and stunts that will really hold your attention.  There are several plot twists and turns and this movie is really a good one.  I recommend it to you.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>I have watched this several times before I wrote anything.  The movie takes repeat viewing well.  Frankly, Bond was, and always will be Sean Connery.  But, time marches on.  We have been through Lazenby, Moore, Dalton and now Brosnan. Each bring their<br />own touch to the role.<p>Pierce is losing his pretty boy look as he ages, a plus in my opinion.  He is finally growing into the new age Bond.  Halle Berry is great as Jinx, naturally gorgeous to look at, but she also brings a much need touch of humour.  Toby Stephans is a strong Bond foe, and his fight scene in the fencing school with Brosnan is one of the highlights of the movie.  Very impressively staged scene that has great tension.  A bit more believability than a lot of the typical Bond action sequences.<p>Sadly, with Q's Desmond Llewelyn passing, you have dry humour in the form of John Cleese assuming the role of the gadget master, who outfits Bond for his cases.  There is a cute homage to the original Connery films with Brosnan tinkering with old props from Thunderball and From Russia With Love.<p>Face it, Bond, like Star Wars is showing it's age.  Neither seem to impress audiences as they once did.  With that in mind, I did not expect this to be a grade A Bond classic.  Brosnan, while doing justice to the role, fails to make it his own, and each film he has done, just fades in my mind, even after watching several times.  <p>This Bond film is fresh, it will stay with me, so basically, I think it's the strongest of Brosnan's efforts.  He really seems to hit his stride in the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PCTD8QM1BIXI.html">A3PCTD8QM1BIXI</a><br/><p>Die Another Day is another great Bond flick. Piece Bronosan proves to me once again that he makes a great Bond. The action sequences are tight and not over blown like in Tommrow Never Dies.

As the creidts always say James Bond will return.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>SAd. I used to like James Bond movies. even with Timothy Dalton I liked them. even the first one with Brosnan.<p>But this DIA ANOTHER DAY is a bomb. A utterly, silly, ridiculous "action movie", where Bond is not a character anymore, it's just a killing machine, an assasssin, a kind of RAMBO. We simply cannot care about his character and that of Halle Barry, so empty and, in the ultimate case, more cruel than the villains! The movie is an endless series of explosions, explosions, fire, death and more death. All that using a unbeliavable bad taste plot about North Korea, since the actual diplomatic situation with this country.<p>I'll not talk about the lies, they were some of the charm of this franchise, but here they are so stupid that I wanted to puke.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>The ante for just about everything has been upped for Die Another Day; the 20th film in the James Bond film franchise.  Pierce Brosnan once again reprises his role as the suave secret agent as we find him imprisoned and tortured in a Korean prison camp for 14 months (which begins with a slam bang action sequence).  Later on, Bond is out for revenge against his betrayers, and soon runs into the mysterious Jynx (Halle Berry) who herself is a spy with an agenda.  Brosnan is at his usual best as 007, while Berry provides ample eye candy, but her acting talents aren't necessarily put to use.  The rest of the cast includes the returning Judi Dench and John Cleese as M and Q respectively, and also Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Rick Yune, Michael Madsen, and Colin Salmon.  Director Lee Tamahori manages to keep the film packed with enough momentum even without action on the screen, and even as the action scenes and situations borderline on the ridiculous, you can't help but keep yourself glued to the screen.  Die Another Day is far from being the best Bond film, but compared to the previously disappointing The World is Not Enough, this is far superior.  MGM has assembled a fantastic DVD package here; Disc 2 is packed with loads of special features while the film itself looks and sounds fantastic.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Even in a world full of hyperbole, calling this frankly rather shoddy downgrade an `Ultimate Edition' is taking liberties with the language that border on the actionable. Whereas the first 2-disc release of the 20th EON Bond film boasted a huge array of extras, this supposedly new and improved version drops nearly all of them and merely throws in a few scraps of filler instead. Gone is the 76-minute documentary `Inside Die Another Day,' replaced by a couple of shorter featurettes and some video footage of the location scout. And while the excellent 51-minute `Script to Screen' documentary on the difficult screenwriting process previously only available on the R2 DVD is retained along with the `Shaken and Stirred On Ice' featurette, gone are the storyboard-to-film comparisons, multi-angle action sequences, title design and digital grading featurettes, gadget briefings, music video and featurette and even the 8 TV spots a 3 theatrical trailers from the original issue to be replaced by an exotic locations featurette. With so many of the extras being dumped, it's a wonder that the film itself (in apparently exactly the same transfer as previously available) still contains the same audio commentaries and interactive featurettes it had first time round. Frankly, there's no reason whatever to buy this if you already have the original 2-disc release.<br /><br />As for the film itself, Die Another Day seemed surprisingly impressive first time round but doesn't hold up well to a second viewing for a number of reasons - and not only because Daniel Craig and Casino Royale have taken the series to new heights since. Initially at least DAD seemed to be trying to make one of the series' periodic efforts to take itself more seriously. The pre-title sequence is particularly strong, and the film is plot-led with a good premise that it explores far more effectively than License to Kill - Bond screws up, gets captured and finds his license to kill revoked and has to go it alone. But too many wrong choices are made in the casting of those both in front of and behind the cameras to do it full justice.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is certainly a major problem here, getting lazier in the role far sooner than his predecessors. He takes too much for granted and doesn't seem to be putting much effort into it in the assumption that he's got it down pat, when in reality he's starting to go to seed - certainly he must be the only man to come out of 14 months of torture in a Korean prison chubbier than when he went in, something his tendency to spend much of the opening of the film with his shirt off and hidden under a bushy Monty Python castaway beard only exacerbates.<br /><br />He's not helped much by his co-stars either: Halle Berry, who seems to become a worse actress with each successive film, really can't handle sass or wisecracks, which is a shame since that's almost all her part consists of, and their initial meeting exchange of innuendoes seems more like eavesdropping a married man picking up a hooker to prove he's still got it than anything else. Rosamund Pike's other fatale femme fares a little better purely on he grounds that, while an extremely one-dimensional performer, to least her limited abilities fit the part. Toby Stephens' villain is a bigger problem. While it's a neat touch that he models himself on an unflattering portrait of Bond's vanity, Stephens actually seems to be basing his performance on Rik Mayall's caricatured MP Alan B'stard from Britcom The New Statesman, and the results aren't pretty - a largely ineffectual screen actor, it's no accident that he needs to don an electronic suit of armour to become a credible foe for Bond in the final punch-up. Curiously, two of the better performances on display come from bit-players John Cleese (pleasingly restrained) and Michael Madsen as a distinctly unimpressed company man. Even Madonna's unnecessary cameo as a lesbian fencing instructor is considerably less painful than her terrible title-song, easily the series' worst. Still, the resulting overly enthusiastic swordfight is okay but would probably have been even better had they hired William Hobbs to choreograph it instead of Bob Anderson (Anderson may have coached Errol Flynn, but only in some of his worst films).<br /><br />The direction adds to the problems. Lee Tamahouri is a maddeningly variable director, and too often it's his weaknesses on display here. For a series that prides itself on globe-trotting, he has a very poor sense of place (aside from the Iceland scenes, this is the first Bond film that really looks like they were afraid to leave the studio backlot) and his handling of action isn't always effective - indeed, the car chase actually looks like several shots are missing. Still, at least they manage to just about get away with the science behind the invisible car more effectively than the awful CGI that undermines the series' reputation for doing daring stunts for real: along with the occasionally slo-mo or sped up scene intros, it just seems horribly out of place without ever quite ruining the film.<br /><br />Another big problem is the tone. As the 20th entry in EON's series, the desire to celebrate its heritage threatens at times to overwhelm the film as it becomes increasingly self-referential. With almost every scene having an homage, a prop or an audio or visual reference to a previous movie, it stops being fun and becomes labored long before the halfway point. Bond is feeding off himself so much here that at times it reminds you of one of those animals that, when caught in a trap, gnaws its own leg off. It just about gets away with it, but it gets messy. There's fun to be had, most of it in the first half before it goes all Diamonds Are Forever, but there's still the feeling that this could and should have been much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TXR85WQLE32N.html">A2TXR85WQLE32N</a><br/><p>2002's "Die Another Day" ended up being Pierce Brosnan's last turn as James Bond, Agent 007, of British MI-6, but what a way to go.  "Die Another Day" pulls out all the stops with a globe-trotting, action-packed story and a solid cast.<br /><br />When a secret mission into North Korea is betrayed, Bond is captured and tortured.  When exchanged for another spy, Bond is put on ice on suspicion of being the traitor who compromised the mission.  Bond promptly strikes out on his own to prove his innocence.  An unofficial visit to Cuba gets Bond reinstated, and introduces him to Jinx (an excellent Haile Berry), an American agent on the same trail.  That trail takes Bond to London, Iceland, and eventually back to North Korea in search of a clever villain with two faces, and a traitor inside MI-6.  The concluding sequence in North Korea is an over-the-top hailstorm of fisticuffs, sword fights, and special effects, as Bond tries to head off another Korean war.<br /><br />There is a lot to like in "Die Another Day."  All the familiar elements of a James Bond thriller are here.  John Cleese as "Q" serves up an arsenal of high tech tools.  MI-6 headquarters gets some real (and humorous virtual) screen time as Bond trades quips with his boss (a returning Judi Dench as M) and her secretary Miss Moneypenny.  The menacing villain of the story has the usual twisted backstory.<br /><br />There is also a sense the movie is trying too hard; too many exotic action sequences blur the plot, while the pile of self-referrential 007 jokes becomes distracting.  Brosnan really was starting to look too old for the role.  Nevertheless, "Die Another Day" is recommended to fans of the James Bond franchise.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"Die Another Day" was the 20th James Bond film and coincided with the franchise's 40th anniversary. The plot is pretty simple when compared to other Bond films: upon being released from captivity in North Korea Bond is determined to find out who was behind the kidnapping believing someone in the British government was behind the plot.<br /><br /> The film received very mixed reviews upon release, but became the highest-grossing Bond film at that point making over $431,000,000 at the box office.<br /><br /> I also must say Oscar-winner Halle Berry does a superb job playing the latest Bond girl.<br /><br /> This was also Pierce Brosnan's final outing as the British super agent before heart-throb (and my personal favorite Bond guy) Daniel Craig took over.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>Sadly, Brosnan's fourth and last outing as Bond is as tired, cheesy and over the top as Roger Moore's 4th Bond movie was.. Given that original script ideas for this story were taken from Moonraker, the symmetry is ironic.<br />Bond is captured in Korea, but is released as a prisoner transfer because the Americans suspect he has broken under torture.  Removed of his 00 status (what, again?) he goes renegade to track down the mole that betrayed him.  Along the way he crosses paths with a CIA agent (Halle Berry) and the trail leads to Gustaf Graves (Toby Stephens).  Graves' unlikely Iceland diamond mine is a cover for the development of a powerful satellite based weapon which uses diamonds to focus the sun's energy to... oh, who cares, its all as ridiculous, if not more so, than a compilation of Bond's worst moments.<br />The movie muddles through feeling like someone forgot to shake OR stir, until the awful moment when the movie becomes irredeemably lost.  A cgi Bond surfs on a wave using a parachute for guidance, in one of the most abysmally poorly executed special effects scenes put to film.  Bond movies are always fantastic, sure, but they always have a veneer of reality - the gadgets look like they COULD work, the stunts you see are done for real, even if the stuntmen do have safety wires.. but here, all that heritage is thrown out the window, and the movie never quite recovers.  Indeed, a few scenes later Bond gets into his invisible car just to seal the deal.<br />On the plus side there is a stunning set piece car chase on ice, with the Jaguar and Aston Martin going tete a tete, a pleasing sword-fight ina gentlemans club in London, and David Arnold puts in his usual excellent score with multiple references to previous movies for the fans.  Indeed, the numerous references to previous movies (most notably in the `Q' sequence, with gadgets from previous movies littering the background) are one of the few real pleasures of the movie.  Halle Berry performs her task of looking hot in leather, and doing `that' walk out of the sea emulating Ursula Andress but with none of the mystery or charm.  Rosamund Pike puts in a decent performance, and Judi Dench does what she is supposed to... but John Cleese is just not quite right yet as Q (though better than TWINE), and cameos from Madonna and Michael Madsen are an embarrassment.  Toby Stephens does his best to make his hard to believe character believable, but none of the actors can rescue the movie from some of the most painful one liners and simply awful lines for many a year.  A large chunk of the blame has to go to director Lee Tamahori, whose propensity for slowing and speeding up events is more `The Matrix' than Bond's classic style.<br /><br />With an overblown budget and anticipation running as high as it had for a Bond movie, Die Another Day didn't just lose the race, it fell flat on its face somewhere along the way.  Sure, you have to watch it to complete the Bond saga, but be grateful that just as Moonraker's excesses inspired the makers to return to basics in For Your Eyes Only, we can thank Die Another Day for bringing the producers to their senses and whittling Bond down to the basic ingredients again for Casino Royale.<br /><br />For an Ultimate Edition, this is the least well stocked disc in the extras department - no trailers, few documentaries, no music video etc.. however, it has to be said the extras included do cover the making of process from script through to realisation pretty well.  An hour long documentary on script to screen is moderately revealing, and the other half hour documentary gives a fascinating glimpse into what it takes to get an Aston Martin to slide like that on ice - and what happens when it goes wrong. Extras are rounded out with a 3 minute peek into how British Airways helped out, and Peter Lamont's home video of location scouting and a video diary of one day in the shoot, giving a glimpse into Lee Tamahori's directorial style.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>The majority will agree that this is one of the lesser successful of the Bond films, and I will have to agree with that.  Things begin with an explosive start at the pre-credits scene, but slowly and surely, it all falls apart until the dreaded finale.  Like even the worst of Bond films (which are very few) there are still going to be some highlights, and with Die Another Day, that mostly consists of some fun action scenes.<br /><br />A great story is told here with some good ideas and originality, but execuation is the problem.  While on a mission in North Korea, Bond is actually captured and abandoned by MI6 for well over a year.  Frightened that Bond may have given information about MI6 while under torture, the service exchanges one of the Korean's - "Zao" - for Bond.  Bond is held in a hospital in Hong Kong by M, but escapes and decides to go on a personal vendetta that we don't see too oftenin a Bond film.  Eventually, we learn that both Bond and MI6 are after the same man "Gustav Graves", and decide to work together again.<br /><br />Graves is an interesting villain in that he is not quite himself.  I would explain more but that would give away one of the better parts of the film.  The trouble with Graves is that his character seems to go downhill throughout the film, to the point of wishing to finally see him die.  His henchman "Zao" was pretty decent, and though not nearly the best henchman in a Bond movie, I enjoyed his presence more than Graves, and his facial features were most unique - diamonds embedded in his face from an earlier explosion.  Zao has several small fights with Bond, but its an extremely fun car chase on ice that is the highlight.  The other charcaters in the film, mainly the Bond women, were very uninteresting.  Though Halle Berry has the role of a secret agent herself, I felt she could have done so much better with the part.  One would think Berry was capable of more than the performance she gives.  As for the other girl - Miranda Frost - something about her personality never clicked from the start, though it was interesting to see exactly whose side she was on in the end.<br /><br />Exotic locations seem to have gone the way of the dodo in this film.  Locations include North Korea, Cuba, and Iceland.  However, its obvious that the North Korea in the film is a made up set. The Cuban shots were actually filmed in Spain, and the Iceland scenes were made up as well.<br /><br />There are some great action scenes in the movie, but all heavily relying on digital effects, lossing that classic Bond action feel.  The car chase scene on the ice is excellent, and so is the hovercraft chase before the credits in North Korea.  There is also a fun swordplay scene between Bond and Graves thats fun when it gets out of hand.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan's last film as 007 sadly hit a sour note.  His charcater got a litte more interesting this time around, but its too bad Brosnan couldn't put a little more into it.  While he seemed to have finally gotten comfortable with the role of 007, he has now gotten a little too relaxed.  Oh well.  Casino Royale with Daniel Craig has come to pick up the Brond franchise and put it back on its feet after this.<br /><br />Action - 4<br />Acting - 3.5<br />Charcaters - 3<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 3.5</p></br><a href="../users/A1J03J0HZ7KU5T.html">A1J03J0HZ7KU5T</a><br/><p>The James Bond series reaches another crossroads with "Die Another Day" (2002). Despite some new wrinkles to the rather tired 007 formula, the reliance on computer-generated effects makes the film look like a cartoon. Pierce Brosnan remains a solid Bond, with a memorable assist from Halle Berry as Jinx. However, the actors and director Lee Tamahori are shortchanged by a weak script. "Die Another Day" offers some nice homages to previous Bond films, but cannot escape the overall sense of deja vu. Brosnan's 007 deserved a better finale and his recent criticisms about the franchise were justified.</p></br><a href="../users/A17BT73RVRQYSP.html">A17BT73RVRQYSP</a><br/><p>This is an excellent Bond movie with great stunts, plenty of action and of course the women.<p>A lot was made of Hale Berry she was interesting and a good character but didn't take over the movie as suggested.<p>I'm really getting sick of M being played for a fool in these movies.  This never happened before Ms Dench took the Job.<p>The sword fight in the center was quite awsome and I didn't recognize Madona dressed she should try it more often.<p>Bond Locked up for over a year was interesting.<p>However this movie hit a brick wall for me when John Cleese came on the screen.  Cleese plays Q as Basil Faulty and the result is SO good and SO funny that it frankly eclipses the rest of the movie.  I find myself smiling just thinking about it.<p>There is an excellent comic moment at the end tangently involving Cleese as well.  Both of those scenes are worth the price of the movie.</p></br></body></html>

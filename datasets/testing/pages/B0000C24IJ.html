On the one hand, Wrong Turn is touted as a "70s style horror film" (according to the director in the featurettes and commentary) so it's to the point, introducing the cast and then killing them.  On the other hand, this isn't the 70s, movie audiences are savvier and more jaded, and you need some kind of original element and/or post reflexive sense to pull this off in the post-Scream era.  <p>Wrong Turn resembles one large part Texas Chainsaw Massacre, one part Deliverance, and one part Predator, baked in a Friday the 13th 'Dead Teenagers in the Woods' pie crust.  The cast looks smart, but their fate is sealed in an extended sequence detailing a tour through the 'Terrible Place', you know, that place in horror movies where bad things happen and would-be victims linger for a long, long time.<p>On his way to a job interview in Raleigh, our hero Chris rams his Mustang into an SUV that has been taken out by barbed wire purposely strung across a backwoods road in the mountains of West Virginia.  Enter victims: two couples and a single girl who is trying to...gasp...sob...get over a recent breakup by going on a fun camping trip.  Trying to find a phone (the cell phone device of modern times rendered useless by being in, well, the backwoods) they get rocketed back a few hundred years when they come across a cabin that, it becomes obvious in a few seconds, is inhabited by some truly scary creatures.  This sets up a long, long sequence of finding all sorts of neat things in this house of horrors like teeth in a jar, stolen merchandise from past victims, and a fridge full of organs and meat.  Infuriatingly, one girl insists on using the bathroom in this disgusting hovel, even after it's painfully obvious that INSANE KILLERS LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.  Even for a slasher flick, you have to wonder...<p>The killers in question are a group of mutants who, through generations of inbreeding, have turned into a truly vile cast of deformed, homicidal, cannibalistic savages.  They can't speak any known language, they have three fingers, humpbacks, and generally look like characters from The Dark Crystal on crack, yet they can drive, fire guns, and somehow not get discovered despite the regularity with which people disappear in the area.  Just in case you were thinking that this is a deeply cynical, ridiculous job of stereotyping by the filmmakers, the DVD featurettes inform us that ALL THE DEFORMITIES ARE BASED ON REAL MEDICAL CASES!  Whew!  And there I thought they were taking artistic license.<p>The film borrows heavily from the aforementioned films.  The Predator bits are the extended hiding and moving in the tall tree tops, bathed in shadow to mask sets.  And what a surprise, the film was even made in Canada, to shave yet a few more dollars off the clearly low budget.  The cast is mostly game, and in particular Jeremy Sisto stands out as better than the material (before he inevitably checks out after uttering the line "We are never going into the woods again!")  The approach the filmmakers seem to be taking is that this genre and setting is "new", and there is hardly a wink from the players to the audience to lighten it all up.<p>At least the DVD is heavy on features, though quantity does not equal quality.  The commentary is awful.  There are long stretches of utter silence as it's obvious that director and two stars just have nothing to say about this movie.  Unless you want to hear the gorgeous Eliza Dushku give a shoutout to her "Albanian peoples" you'll want to skip it.  And the deleted scenes?  Think about it, if they weren't good enough to make an 84-minute movie...<p>Actually, only scene is really cut, but it's just an alternate take of Dushku's big acting moment.  'Acting' here means some fake tears, and a...lot...of...pausing...between...sighs...and...gasps...when...she...talks...about...her...dead...friends...&lt;Pattract tourists.  <p>This was decent fare for a slow day.  Knock off a star if you don't like slasher flicks.  Recommended for die-hard genre addicts, else this is strictly rental fare.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>The original part 1 'Wrong Turn' movie is quite suspenseful and intense horror film.  I am not really a fan of horror movies but sometimes if they are on basic cable channels I will watch one every now and then.  For me they are good to watch only once unless there is a good true story to it that I can take something away from it.  There are movies that might have some horror like scenes to them but are not true movies of that category.  'Wrong Turn' is a true horror flick that should satisfy the average horror movie fan.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Wrong Turn had potential to be so much more.  That's the feeling I got after it was over.<br /><br />I actually watched this movie about four years ago, and tonight decided to watch it again after realizing I never bothered to submit a review.<br /><br />The plot felt really incomplete.  That's obviously the main problem.  You have six young adults in their early to mid 20's running through the woods and climbing trees and watch towers trying to avoid these... really ugly and disgusting looking murderous critters.  Actually they're half people and half trolls or whatever.  They navigate through the woods during the day and night holding torches in the air and killing innocent people using shotguns and bows.<br /><br />Of course you know what to expect as far as a plotline is concerned- everybody is going to die, eventually... except for one or two of the lucky ones.  And that's exactly what happens.<br /><br />I just felt the film didn't provide enough suspense and was totally predictable, however some of the kills were gruesome enough to justify a watchable movie.  A good example of lacking suspense is in the beginning when everybody was walking around on back roads.  Nothing memorable happened here because the entire segment rushed forward too quickly.  In real life, walking down back roads definitely provides an uncomfortable feeling, but the writers apparently felt it wasn't necessary to include such a creepy feeling in the movie.<br /><br />Another problem is suspense included when it's not needed, such as the log cabin where the creatures were living.  The young adults decided to hide inside the cabin when it was discovered they wouldn't be able to escape the moment they looked outside and noticed that the troll creatures were pulling up in the driveway.  This scene felt WAY overlong.  Let's not forget the entire "make our way across the top of a huge, maze-like tree" segment that appears later on.  It was incredibly too long as well.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film, but it was certainly in desperate need of having more time devoted to it to increase the suspense factor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>2003's "Wrong Turn" tells the story of a dude who turns down the wrong dirt road in the backcountry of West Virginia and runs into five other youths (literally). They soon discover they are prey to inbred hillbillies who may be mutant and resistant to pain. Will they get out alive?<br /><br />My wife's response to the film was a disturbed "I'm never going in the woods again!" By contrast, I felt it was entertaining and compelling but not scary or horrifying. Why? Because, although the story is presented in a serious, non-campy manner it's not realistic. The reason "Deliverance" (1972) was so unsettling is because the story actually COULD happen. "Wrong Turn" starts out this way but becomes increasingly unbelievable as the story unravels. Hence, unlike "Deliverance," I could never buy that I was viewing a potential reality.<br /><br />Yet it starts out with enough believability that I was drawn into the story and the characters. By the time the unrealistic stuff starts happening it didn't matter because the film successfully captures and maintains your attention. It's not a great film by any means, but it's decent for what it is, a slasher-in-the-woods flick.<br /><br />I'm not usually a fan of slasher flicks in general, nor am I a gorehound, but I do love the "Friday the 13th" movies and films of the same ilk. I enjoy the youthful casts and the deep woods setting. It brings fond memories of my younger years (camping, hiking, etc.). The fact that there's a mad killer(s) on the loose just adds excitement and suspense. However, I never find these films scary. Fun? Yes. A little creepy? Yes. A few shocking moments? Yes. Scary or horrifying? No. But my wife obviously disagrees because, again, she never wants to go in the woods again, lol.<br /><br />"Wrong Turn" was filmed in Dundas and Uxbridge, Ontario, with additional footage shot in Toronto and Hamilton (which I'm assuming is studio work since there are no urban scenes in the film). This area of Ontario has deep forests but is largely flat as many of the geographical-overlook shots reveal, but there are a couple of shots where you'll see hills in the background (which I'm not sure are authentic or cgi). There's also some nice footage of cliffs and a waterfall at the 1 hour 5 minute mark that I really enjoyed. These locations are fine but it would have been better if they actually filmed in Appalachia (it's only about 500 miles south of Ontario, after all).<br /><br />As far as the cast goes, Desmond Harrington is a great leading male protagonist. He has character and isn't a smart-axx delinquent. He should go on to better things. Eliza Dushku is good as his main companion, not to mention easy on the eyes, although she has no booty (maybe if she ate more). Jeremy Sisto and Emmanuelle Chriqui are also good protagonists. It's just nice to have a group of people you can care about and root for, rather than a bunch of unappealing and crude punks, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Another good thing about the film is it only runs an hour and 20 minutes before the credits role. Movies like this should't go on too long; it's unnecessary. Speaking of the credits, they feature a really good modern rock/metal song.<br /><br />One other aspect I enjoyed is a 10-15 minute sequence that takes place high up in the trees at night as three of the kids try to evade the hillbillies (which I'm assuming was shot in the studio, but I'm not sure). The sequence isn't believable at all but it is quite original. I wasn't expecting that.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: C+</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>Everyone is attractive, everyone is rather foolish but not everyone is killed. The ones I liked the most (save for the guy that plays Brenda's crazy, crazy brother in Six Feet Under) end up surviving with scratches, bruises and twisted nightmares as memories.<br /><br />To be honest, this movie was one of the most disturbing that I've ever had the chance to view. Deformities aplenty, chaos everywhere you turn and blood, blood, blood is running along the ground again...<br /><br />The ending was nice but nearly everyone dies...<br /><br />Cover Art: B+<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Characters: B+<br />Story: B-<br />Scares: B+<br />Length: A-<br />Overall: B<br /><br />4 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>This is a nice add to the lost in a horrible horror genre. It almost is like a cross between "Breakdown" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". A group of young men and women are stranded in the hills of West Virginia when they wreck their cars on a barely passable side road. Out comes the locals that look inbred enough to scare even their mother. Most people either love or hate these movies. Personally I find them entertaining if they don't overdue the gorefest and if there is a decent enough original story. Even though parts of it seem familiar, it is different enough to get credit for some originality and I'm glad to say the gore is outdone by the suspense. If you enjoy this be sure to catch the classics "Deliverance" and "Southern Comfort".</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>see, these are the reasons you stay away from the woods, the mountains, the backwood town, places you don't know where the hell they're going. one wrong turn might just be one dead end. a young hot group of people, inbred monsters, missing hikers, and nowhere near civilization can make for a very interesting horror flick. not to mention it hits close to reality. you know there's just some kind of stuff like this in the world somewhere. this group gets stranded, they go out to find some help, instead they find a few cannibals. now they have to run for their lives, all of them not making it of course. good story, nice thrills, good actors. eliza dushku, she's a bad girl in this flick. i give her respect, and desmond harrington, man that boy does his thing here. my hero. he manages to keep the light on him. and jeremy sisto, no i didn't like his ending. his acting was good, as always, but he didn't have to go out like that. other than that, enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SGR7LE899LGG.html">A2SGR7LE899LGG</a><br/><p>This is a loose remake of texas chainsaw massacre.

The execution of WRONG TURN is even more banal than the premise, which, given assured direction and a twisted script should've been a slam dunk creepy slice and dicer.  Lo, it aint.  Instead we get a group of the dumbest woodland victims ever filmed and a group of disfigured redneck cannibals that aren't as scary as REAL disfigured redneck cannibals.  The result is a film that offers little atmosphere and a few cheap jolts that just qualify it as a horror movie.  Back to the dumb woodland victims- they go exploring a shack in the middle of the woods that contains several clues to the grizzly inhabitants activities, yet take time to make sure they check every room whilst looking for a phone and/or toilet.  They wanted to die, obviously.  Everyone who gets it (you know who they are right off the bat) dies in a FRIDAY THE 13TH fashion that's all blood and latex, with little creativity, and even less originality.  The main characters are even more cardboard than the supporting bodies and are never developed in the short running time (WRONG TURN clocks in at 80 min. AFTER the end credits).  Every horror cliche is played; from the main chick the villians decide to change their M.O. for and NOT kill instantly down to the clueless cop who you know is going to get it before he is even introduced.  ELIZA DUSHKU plays the &quot;tough girl&quot; to a new annoying extreme that forces one, like in most run-of-the-mill slasher flicks, to root for the bad guys.  So many genere films have started with a similar plotline and all fail in the shadow of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  With a remastered DVD now out, watching LEATHERFACE and his twisted clan scare up the creepy horror WRONG TURN lacks would be a turn in the right direction.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>This movie is similar in tone to the recent remake of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although not nearly as gory as "Hills", the theme of mutation runs through both. During the opening credits, we see images and newspaper clippings reporting the mutations. This time, however, the mutations are due to good ol' fashioned inbreeding in the mountains of West Virginia, rather than from nuclear fallout.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a decent scene. After the initial havoc is wreaked, you hear the haunting, maniacal laughter that will follow through the rest of the ride. Our main character, Chris, is running late for an appointment. He takes a "shortcut" and "runs" into a car containing two clueless guys, a redhead and two pieces of fine, stranded @ss. They go looking for a phone and stumble upon a shack that is reminiscent of the house in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: creepy, filthy, full of trash and hidden stashes of gore.. nasty.<br /><br />This is where we get our first look at the maniac who is responsible for what we have been seeing in the woods. He is deformed and seemingly handicapped, mentally. We soon see, though, that he has two siblings (or friends) that join in on the fun. These three hideous grotesqueries spot the four remaining characters and the hunt is on!<br /><br />These mutants are twisted. Their actions are as repulsive as they are unexplained. Stan Winston does a wonderful job of creating mutants that are not so freakish as to be ridiculous, but that are unsettling enough to make you cringe. You will very quickly despise these mutant characters for their lack of reason and unquenchable thirst for innocent blood.<br /><br />The movie achieves a good level of suspense, with some good scares and a few nasty scenes. I will say that it turned out to be better than I was expecting it to be and for anyone who enjoyed "The Hills Have Eyes" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (not that this movie actually compares to TCM), you should at least check this movie out. The ending was not as strong or freaky as it probably should have been, but the movie is worth seeing.<br /><br />The DVD includes a few very short featurettes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>I rented this film after viewing a trailer for it, because it had reminded me of two horror favorites: the film &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; and an episode on the X Files about a backwoods inbred family.  I was not disappointed, as it certainly seemed to be a cross between these two favorites.<p>While there were no real surprises, other than a very effective opening scene, the production values were first rate. The inbred family was certainly creepy and their house certainly was appropriately macabre and revolting, as befits such a family that enjoys dismembering and eating their victims. It is these hospitable folks that Eliza  Dushku and her friends meet up with in the backwoods of West Virginia with predictable results. <p>The film simply offers a few thrills, some average acting, and, as I said, some first rate production values, thanks to film production veteran Stan Winston. It offers nothing more and nothing less, which is too bad, since it had those great production values going for it. The problem with the film is that it copied too much from other films without offering something of its own to give it that certain edge and make it memorable in its own right. Tobe Hooper did this better in &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, as did the X Files television show. Still, notwithstanding its predictability, fans of the horror film genre should find this film enjoyable. It is, at the very least, worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PN7Z2VTHICL8.html">A2PN7Z2VTHICL8</a><br/><p>Chris Finn is late for an appointment and stops at a gas station to use the phone (doesn't work) and checks out a map that shows a dirt road that leads around the large traffic jam blocking the only highway to his destination.  Taking this backwoods shortcut, a short way up the road he literally runs into another vehicle in the middle of the road.  Two couples and the requisite single female are stranded there when their car ran over a strand of barbed wire seemingly placed in the road on purpose.  Finn, the single woman, and one of the couples leave the scene of the accident to try and find assistance, leaving the other couple behind at their vehicle.<p>Now we have the formula of city folks looking for excitement in the country both stranded and divided, in the backwoods of West Virginia.  Why would anyone look for a phone where there are no power lines whatsoever?  Simple, to create this kind of suspense in a slasher/thriller movie in which the blood will soon fly and the city folks soon die.<p>Spectacular mutants, a squealing stupid girl, stupidly brave and clueless men, and some nice knife and axe work blend together to give us this bloodily entertaining movie with just the right allotments of gore, cheese, and stupidity.  Definitely entertaining splatter for those who appreciate the genre.<p>Mmmmmmm.  Long Pork.  Don't check the fridge for any snacks!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>Jesse (Eliza Dushku) and her four friends (two other hot women - Filet and Ribeye, and two guys - Sirloin and Porterhouse), are on a trip in the wilderness of West Virginia when they run over some barbed-wire, destroying their car's tires.  Soon thereafter, a young doctor named Chris rams their car.  The six are stranded on a seemingly abandoned dirt road; however, they just happen to be trespassing.<br /><br />The six interlopers are on the ol' Johnson land.  Brothers Bubba (nicknamed Three Finger, he's the young one who likes to climb trees and laugh), Cletus (nicknamed Saw-Tooth, he's the middle one who's fond of archery), and big brother Bobby Ray (nicknamed One-Eye, he's the brain of the family who likes canning and preserving) soon see the six outsiders, and become rightfully enraged.  Forced to fend for themselves from a young age - their parents dying young as a result of "bad genetics" - the three brothers were left with no other kin to help with cookin', cleanin', and learnin'.  As a result of this harsh upbringing, and the fact that not one is smarter than the average chimp, they manage however they can, following in their family's traditions of inbreeding and cannibalism.  Knowing only what they have picked up through trial and error, the brothers decide to not only defend their land, but also pick up lunch in the process.<br /><br />The rest is predictable of most slasher flicks.  The women drop clothes, get wet, and scream a lot.  The men do heroically stupid things.  Blood flies, and all the right people die miserable deaths.  Incredible tension and struggle takes place, especially a great battle in the forest ceiling, as the three brothers defend their home valiantly, but ultimately unsuccessfully.  In the end it's a heart-warming story of three misunderstood brothers who just happen to enjoy dismemberment and the taste of human flesh.<br /><br />With great production value, believable gore, beautiful people like Eliza Dushku throughout, a hilarious cackle from Bubba, and a few great surprises, even those who don't appreciate the horror genre should like this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"Wrong Turn" is familiar but potent horror material, as a shortcut down a little-used back road strands two cars - one carrying a group, the other a lone passenger - deep in the woods and away from phone lines or normal human habitation, and, unknown to the travellers, in the territory of a long-isolated band of inbred mountain cannibals.  This kind of thing has been done a lot, and "Wrong Turn" doesn't re-invent the wheel, it just works that wheel better - much better compared to some of its peers  - than 90% of the similar horror movies before or since.  If you love the likes of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" films (especially the early ones) or "The Hills Have Eyes" (original or remake, although the remake's my personal pick) you're going to enjoy "Wrong Turn"<br /><br />  It's not as extreme as most of the entries in the above-mentioned series, but it's not watered-down either; it's direct and violent at times, more focused on suspense at others, hitting a really good balance overall.  One of the reasons it's better than much of its kin is that the larger budget (small by today's theatrical release standards; huge compared to many of the more obscure direct-to-video entries in its vein) is that it's able to attempt - and fully pull off - things that many of its peers probably couldn't even try: the cannibal assault on the wooden lookout tower high above the forest, for example.  Well acted, great effects, great location for this kind of a movie in the vast, seemingly endless and seemingly so benign green forests; very taut and engaging.  No horror fan should miss this.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>I give this 4 stars.  But it was a very strange and weird movie.  The mutants were so freaky looking.  I think the special effects guy should get major kudos.<br /><br />I would give this 3, but the weirdness and creepiness of the movie made it worth the 2 hours to me.<br /><br />I recommend this highly.<br /><br />MC White said:  Hinky!</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Wrong Turn gets a semi-favorable assessment in my view because director Rob Schmidt isn't quite as desperate to show off camera trickery as most of his modern-horror peers, like William Malone.<p>That doesn't make Wrong Turn a good horror movie.  As a chase/adventure movie it fares okay, but you won't feel any of the gut-wrenching sense of doom that you'll get from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Night of the Living Dead.  For one thing, the characters talk too much, as if constantly afraid that we won't know what they're trying to do.  Their exploration of the cannibals' house is obviously ripped off from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it contains none of the freakish horror of that horror classic because of the characters' running commentary.  They are also not an interesting bunch to watch because of their complete lack of back story.  Not even the enormous charisma of Eliza Dushku can rescue this one, because aside from the fact that she's on the rebound, we know nothing about her character Jessie other than that she's capable of feeling fear and can fight back if she needs to.  Hardly the stuff of complex, engaging characterization.  The other characters fare no better.  Lead Desmond Harrington is colourless and uninteresting, and Emmanuelle Chriqui as Carly is especially irritating, just begging to be killed off but unfortunately keeps on surviving.<p>The worst part about the film, though, is the makeup.  The cannibals in this film look more goofy than horrifying.  One glimpse at Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface and there's no comparison.  Makeup whiz Stan Winston scored poorly this time, and he isn't helped by Schmidt's crafting of these characters into grunting, giggling, monkey-like boys who just don't command respect.  They can kill three dozen more people in this film and we still wouldn't be that scared, not in the same way as we're scared by The Shape, Leatherface, or Damien.<p>A semi-adequate horror film, free of the ridiculous bells and whistles of its contemporaries, but still missing the mark.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>I first discovered "Wrong Turn" when I was scanning through my TV late one night and saw it on a movie channel. I had never heard of it but read the info on my television guide and decided to give it a try. I am a sucker for a good scary film and I was not at all disappointed by "Wrong Turn". The film is about a bunch of young people in their early twenties whose car breaks down in the backwoods on a long deserted stretch of an abandoned road in West Virginia. What happens to them as the movie unfolds is horrific as these people come in contact with a bunch of in-breeders who feed off human beings. The scenes are excellently directed and acted, the action is bone-chilling, and the suspence of it all will leave you breathless. If your a fan of films like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Wrong Turn" will not let you down. This film, which was a huge boxoffice hit, was followed by "Wrong Turn 2" that was released directly to DVD. Also, just in time for Halloween, "Wrong Turn 3-Left For Dead" arrives in DVD stores in October, 2009. This particular DVD version of "Wrong Turn" features both the widescreen and full screen editions of the movie as well as many bonuses. There is commentary by director Rob Schmidt and its stars Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku, 4 featurettes are included on the making of the film, and much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The '03 release 'Wrong Turn' is a fun watch if you're into horror/splatter films. The cast is strong containing several well known rising stars, the production values superior and the villians particularily unnerving. Of course all splatter films must conform to and ultimately be judged by the tried and true, time tested splatter essentials.<br /><br />Splatter Essentials:<br />1- Sex Factor: The six targeted young victims are equally divided into three attractive girls (Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Lindy Booth) and three good looking guys (Desmond Harrington, Jeremy Sisto and Scott Zeger) providing the viewing audience a nice selection of male and female favorites to root for.<br />2- Creep Factor: The backwoods cannibals are very high on the creep meter, especially Three Fingers (Julian Richings). You're certain to see that face in your dreams a few times after watching the film.<br />3- Gross Factor: There are some very graphic and violent scenes that score high on the gross meter, be prepared.<br />4- Predictability Factor: Yes, it is predictable but that's part of the beauty of this genre of film. You know who's going to die, you're just waiting to see who gets it next and what's the method of their demise.<br /><br />While this is not one of my favorite film genres I have to admit that I liked this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I would have liked to find out who the crazy killers were and how they got to be that way and why they kill. But the movie did its job through the rest of the film. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Great fun movie. 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The plot is a familiar one: several hapless people, mostly young couples in love, are lost among the deep wilds (like West Virginia), and wish that they shouldn't leave their home.  For it is the place haunted by ... er ... man-eating 'mountain men.'  Right?<br /><br />So, these unlucky people are Desmond Harrington, Eliza Dushku, Emmanuelle Chiriqui, Jeremy Sisto, Lindy Booth, and Kevin Zegers.  Not great acting from any of them, but all just adequate.  Strangely, Eliza Dushku, who looks very sexy on and out of screen, does not look so in this film.<br /><br />Anyway, they run for their life in the deep forest, and the photography (actually done in Canada) succeeds in capturing the sinister feelings of the place.  Maybe, somewhere in these thick forests, you might meet canibals weilding hatchets, and the images, with the good production designs, almost make us believe in their presence.  Almost.<br /><br />If I am not mistaken, this is the first film produced by make-up wizard Stan Winston, who must have experienced lots of sadness in the past, seeing his great works wasted in bad films.  Though 'Wrong Turn' is not the perfect showcase for his ingenious art, it is still a good starting point, where he again displays his skills in the gory, grotesque face-make ups of the man-eaters.<br /><br />Even the die-hard fans must admit that what you see in 'Wrong Turn' you have seen in other films of the genre.  But for all its familiarity, 'Wrong Turn' is not a bad film.  It may still be a waste of time for some people, sure, but I wasted my time (if I ever did) not in a bad way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Four twenty year olds get stranded out in the woods after their cars broke something, they stumble to find help but discover a cabin that has a band of deranged manical hillbillies that crave for human flesh, only they can escape out of the woods alive or end up on the menu.<br /><br />A clever, exciting and violent horror suspense thriller with a feel to those 70's horror flicks, atmosphere, gore, make-up effects by special effects wizard Stan Winston, and a twist in the end makes this a good viewing for fans of horror flicks, evil hillbilly movies, cannibal flicks and gore movies.<br /><br />The DVD provides a good commentary by director Robert Schmit, featurettes, poster gallery, and trailer with widescreen/fullscreen presenations.<br /><br />Also recommended: " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 and 2003)", " Re-Animator", "Cabin Fever", " Final Destination 2", " Moutaintop Motel Massacre", " From Dusk Till Dawn", " Demons", "Cannibal Ferox", " Cannibal Holocaust", " Freddy Vs.

That's what you get when you watch this quick and unrelenting trip into road trips gone haywire. The movie is a decent little throwback to the 70's type of horror films with a splash of "The Hills Have Eyes", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and yes, "Deliverance", although there is no Ned Beatty in sight. Desmond Harrington is the main lead. He plays Chris, a young doctor in training on his way to a meeting. When he gets stuck in a traffic jam, he goes back to try to find a different route. Big mistake. When he goes through what's known as Bear Mountain, trouble starts. But after the opening, we already knew that. Taking his eye off the road for a second has him crashing into the back of a parked car in the middle of the road. Five friends who were out for a little nature trip got their tires sliced by wire laid in the road. The five personalities here are Jess(the bodacious Eliza Dushku), who is the tough heroine chick. Carly, who is the annoying one that gets even more annoying as the horrors continue. Her boyfriend Scott(Jeremy Sisto), the most likeable one of the bunch, and the expected horn dog couple(Kevin Zegers, Lindy Booth). Thinking that the wire was laid out on purpose, Chris and 3 of the friends set out to find a phone or someone to help. What they find is a shack lived in by three inbredded, cannibalistic killers who don't really like anyone coming into their neck of the woods. What ensues is a chase to find help and safety in the neverending maze of the woods, and to elude the killers. There is nothing overly original here, but the filmmakers keep it interesting fun and entertaining. There are about 7 deaths here, and 3 of them you only see the aftermath of. The deaths you do see are quite brutal and gruesome. The backwoods killers themselves are nasty and creepy, and make-up hero Stan Winston does a good job with their look. There are a number of interesting and harrowing scenes. The best of the bunch being the chase and fight through the watchtower and into the trees above. The acting is pretty solid. Harrington is a little wooden, but he gets the job done. Sisto is the shining star here as his character is nice, funny, and instantly likeable. Dushku is a worthy heroine, and as anyone who has seen "Buffy" can tell you, she can be tough, vulnerable, scary, and tragic. She does a pretty good job here as well. The script adds nothing new to the proceedings, but it does keep things moving along with enough of the good stuff coming up pretty quick. Director Rob Schmidt keeps things moving along at a nice pace, and the movie is pretty much a rollercoaster from start to finish that never really drags. It's over quickly and the end result is a pleasing and entertaining little horror film, but it won't remain long in the psyches of anyone who watches it.</p></br><a href="../users/A30TK6U7DNS82R.html">A30TK6U7DNS82R</a><br/><p>She's able to climb the tallest trees in the forest, but the thing that is coming after her is faster, larger, infinitely sadistic . . .  If you liked seeing Eliza Dushku in ANGEL or BUFFY, you'll be happy she decided to take a similar part in this cheap, low budget and mindless thriller.  She is tough and sexy, and her amazing body gets quite a workout in the course of a few short hours, as she and a number of other young people stumble across a twisted family of serial killers who entrap the unwary and kill them, selling off their cars for parts and other junk.  It could happen to you!<br /><br />Also in the show is Jeremy Sisto, whom I know best from seeing him play the turbulent, talented Billy Chenoweth, the schizophrenic photographer on SIX FEET UNDER.  I wanted to see Billy and Faith get together but alas, after a mere twenty minutes into WRONG TURN, you knew this was not going to happen.  Alas.  Still the movie pairs Eliza with Desmond Harrington, who's got his own kind of charm and some serious survival skills.  On DVD you can stop the action on a dime and see where the "strings" of the monsters are, but that just adds to the fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>I bought this because i thought it was going to be good like texas chainsaw massacre due to the misleading reviews on here. It wasnt. It was nowhere near as good as tcm. The acting SUCKED, the plot predictable and the story has been done before. The only 2 decent actors were Jeremy sisto and the other guy who was going to the interview in the begining. I do not recomend this. I would rent this if you want to see it but definetly do not buy, especially for 25 bucks! Its not even worth the 7 bucks i paid used for it. I shoulda just stuck with the horror classics. I recomend you do the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>I knew I needed to see &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; when I learned Eliza Dushku, Rob Schmidt, and Stan Winston were involved in the project. Dushku's allure to those males familiar with this actress needs little elaboration. Rob Schmidt directed &quot;Crime + Punishment in Suburbia&quot; a few years ago, a movie I saw a several months ago and enjoyed immensely. And Stan Winston, well, he is the guy behind the special effects in a slew of big budget films which, if not exactly intellectual masterpieces, nonetheless are enormously entertaining movies worth watching. Winston helmed the effects work in the recent &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; as well as that movie's predecessor. He also does an occasional turn as a producer, as he did with &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; when he wasn't putting together the gooey effects. Even if these three people provide little incentive to potential viewers, the idea of a gang of inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies running amok in backwoods West Virginia ought to bring out the hardcore horror hounds in force. &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; has its share of problems, of that there is no doubt, but the picture moves beyond its shortcomings and creates a memorable movie experience. In a day when low budget, straight to video (DVD?) horror productions appear on store shelves like pustules on a plague victim, it is nice to see something stand a little taller. &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is one of those movies.<p>We learn within a matter of minutes something sinister is going on in the backwoods of West Virginia. A man and woman have a nasty, fatal encounter with some local residents during a rock-climbing excursion. As it turns out, these two unfortunate souls are only the latest victims in a spate of mysterious disappearances stretching back through the years, unsolved disappearances involving hikers, young children, and any other assortment of individuals unlucky enough to pass through this rugged region. When Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) zips through the area on his way to an important job interview, he has no idea he will eventually discover the reason for these disturbing disappearances. After learning an accident on the highway will hold him up for hours, he backtracks and drives down a dirt road that promises to get him to his destination on time. Yeah, right. Finn takes his eyes off the road for a second and promptly plows into a broken down vehicle on the road belonging to a quintet of young people. The wreck does not injure anyone, not seriously, but it means both automobiles are down for the count. Finn meets his fellow travelers in distress: mouthy Jesse Burlingame (Dushku), high strung Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), laid back Scott (Jeremy Sisto), and two stoners who die almost immediately.<p>After awkward introductions, Finn, Carly, Jesse, and Scott beat their feet down the road in an effort to reach a telephone. The two stoners stay behind and promptly retire from the scene in especially graphic ways. The four survivors, though they don't realize they are in trouble yet, discover what appears to be an abandoned farmhouse tucked away in a little valley. They go inside and realize whomever lives in this place probably rents a room at the local asylum. The place is a nightmare, with all types of gooey, mysterious substances in jars scattered about and some more vaguely unpleasant containers in the refrigerator. Even worse, the homeowners show up while the kiddies are poking around in the house. With no time to flee, our gang hides under beds and in closets as the residents bring some fresh meat in the front door. And whaddya know? Dinner consists of one of the freshly slaughtered stoners killed after our heroes headed down the road. Thus begins the lengthy stalk and slash sequences we horror fans know and love so much. Some will not survive the endurance test that lies ahead, will not last through a chase scene that involves fleeing through forests, climbing into a fire tower, or diving from that tower into some tall trees to continue the chase some seventy or so feet above the ground. All we know is that good will face down evil in the end and win. Or will it?<p>I enjoyed &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; because I like Eliza Dushku. That wasn't always the case, however. I remember first seeing this actress in the obnoxious and cloying film &quot;Bye Bye, Love&quot; back in the early '90s and despised her whiny character in that movie. Since then young Dushku grew up, put on a skintight white tank top, and developed a rich, husky voice that melts the heart. She has a lot to do with the allure of this film, but the excellent gore effects from Winston certainly didn't hurt, either. We get a fancy, on the half shell decapitation (watch and see what I mean), a grotesque garroting, and a few other sickening scenes. Moreover, you have the mutated hicks to contend with, gruesome looking brutes with a taste for human flesh and a love for the hunt. Lots of good stuff here, but a few problems reared their ugly heads from time to time. The overall idea of the film isn't original and I didn't buy the idea of deformed hillbillies possessing superhuman strength. Still, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is entertaining enough.<p>The DVD overflows with extras. You get fullscreen and widescreen options, featurettes about Dushku, Winston's special effects, and a behind the scenes documentary. There is also a commentary from Dushku, Harrington, and Schmidt, some trailers, and deleted scenes. Good stuff, especially the look at Winston's lengthy career in the biz. This guy's been involved in so many big movies it simply boggles the mind. If you are a horror fan, you will want to check out &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; soon. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a sequel arriving at a theater in the next year or so.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington), a recent graduate from Medical School, is on his way to a interview when he is held back in traffic by an accident.  Consequently, he turns back in order to find a detour to his interview, and on his merry way through the back roads of West Virginia he gets into a car accident with a group of five preppy college students.  Chris and three of his newly gained friends begin to hike to a location where they can find a phone, since their cellular phone won't work.  However, something malevolent is lurking in the woods around them that has been brought about through decades of inbreeding.  Chris and his friends realize that they have been thrown into a hellish nightmare where death seems to be the only way out.  Wrong Turn is a gory throwback horror film that offers several gruesome shots that can be compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the recent House of 1000 Corpses.  However, this film does not offer much more than deaths of the characters through the actions of some grotesque evil inbreds.  Overall, it is a gory film, but it is not sufficient for a good scary cinematic experience</p></br><a href="../users/A2M1N8G4W4END8.html">A2M1N8G4W4END8</a><br/><p>In October 2003, New Line Cinema and director Marcus Nispel offered up a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic horror film THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  Ardent fans of the original were curious, but skeptical.  Would the new TCM match the rawness and realism of the original?  Could the new film raise adrenaline levels to the same soaring heights?  Was it possible that this remake would finally wrest the mantle of terror from the scariest slasher film ever?  Hardly.<p>Like the majority of film remakes, New Line's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a huge disappointment to ardent fans of the original.  In spite of some promising acting talent, Nispel and crew seem oblivious to the elements that made the original film so great.  Simply throwing out lots of disturbing or repulsive images does not a horror classic make.  The TCM remake will never assume the place of honor held by its older namesake.<p>But it can be convincingly argued that the year 2003 has offered a promising contender.  Although it is by no means meant to be a remake or an update of the original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, director Rob Schmidt's WRONG TURN is, in spirit at least, the heir apparent to Hooper's classic.  It offers the same basic plot elements: A group of young adults unwittingly stumble into the territory of a family of backwoodsy, cannibalistic southerners who relentlessly strive to place the young folk on the evening menu.  And unlike the ill-begotten TCM remake, WRONG TURN offers genuine chills, thrills, and scares rather than mere repugnant imagery, and it also shares the same dark sense of humor that permeated Hooper's film.<p>The characters in the original TCM were based in reality.  Tobe Hooper has said on many occasions that he based his cannibalistic family on Edward Gein, the real-life ghoul from Plainfield, Wisconsin, whose necrophilic and cannibalistic atrocities were discovered after his arrest for murder in the late 1950s.  Hooper also used his film to caricature southerners, specifically Texans, and to satirize their rural mores.  <p>In a similar vein, the villains in WRONG TURN are also founded in reality.  The venerable Stan Winston, producer and FX supervisor for the film, explains in one of the DVD featurettes that he and his crew did extensive research for the make-up design, and all of the physical deformities depicted in WRONG TURN are medically documented defects caused by generations of inbreeding.  Add to that the fact that there have long been legends about familial groups in the southern mountainous regions of the United States who have been sequestered away from civilization for generations, and it's not too much of a stretch to believe that inbred grotesqueries like those in WRONG TURN could really exist.  In a sense, then, the subtext of this film, like that of Hooper's TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, is a darkly wry satire or caricature of the rural southern lifestyle.<p>In the feature commentary on the DVD version of WRONG TURN, director Schmidt states that, with this film, his aim was to re-create the atmosphere and scares of a 1970s-style horror movie.  In that, he definitely hit the bull's-eye.  So those who miss the horror flicks of the '70s will love this film, though any horror enthusiast will find it good fun.  And fans of Tobe Hooper's original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE who were rightfully let down by the recent remake should forget that film and, instead, consider WRONG TURN to be the TCM for the new millennium.</p></br><a href="../users/A3U5JCXIXTGSLN.html">A3U5JCXIXTGSLN</a><br/><p>I really had no interest in &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; when it came out because I thought it was just another movie about stupid teenagers who get hunted down and killed in the woods. Well, I was exactly right. The only different thing that I wasn't expecting is that the teenagers are hunted by inbred killers in the woods and mountains of West Virginia. While this premise is far from original, it is the mutant inbreds who make the film.<p>In the opening credits, the audience gets bombarded with images of missing people as well as news articles about mutation. We never quite understand if these mutation articles have anything to do with the killers in the film or if they were just used as a foundation for what we were about to see. <p>In the film, a group of teenagers and a doctor get into a wreck and must find help in the desolate woods. They split up, of course, and then people start dying at the hands of the cannibalistic killers. Overall, the story isn't that great, but there is a lot of gore and plenty of gross-out moments throughout.<p>Eliza Dushku, once again, plays the &quot;tough chick&quot; in the film. It seems as though she's becoming typecast. It would be nice to see her in a different role.<p>&quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is an okay film. I wouldn't suggest it, mainly because there are many other films with this storyline that are much better. However, fans of this genre might want to check it out and compare.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Wrong Turn is a surprisingly well crafted film that delivers chills and suspense in several places.  It isn't bad when compared to other slasher/gore films, but it isn't a mature horror film.<p>I have two majorissues I have to take with the film: the script and the motive.  Since the motive comes out of the scripting, I guess we're looking at a point and a subpoint.<p>The opening credits treats us to a series of photos and newspaper articles flashing by (ala Se7en).  It is these photos and articles, I assume, that is supposed to suffice for the motive that I state is missing.<p>Before I go further, if you haven't seen the movie, skip to the end of my review, because I'll be giving away a few plot points.<p>The killers in this film are supposed to be deranged "mountain men" who murder unsuspecting victims in the woods of West Virginia.  That is what the newspaper tout in the credits and that is what happens.  That is not a motive!  That is just a statement.  Why do these guys kill?  The fact that they are "inbred" is not excuse enough.  Do the filmmakers intend to state that the people living in the mountains of West Virginia are all inbred?  Other than the policeman who answers a rescue call, we are not shown a single person from the area who is not obviously from inbred blood.  So ARE the filmmakers trying to make such a radical statement?  If this is the intent, then the people of West Virginia  - particularly those living in the mountainous areas - have quite a case for bigotry on the part of the filmmakers.  I don't think that was what was ultimately intended, but it does need some answering.<p>Now, here's my subpoint problem with the film:  Wrong Turn owes its existence in large part to the "Home" episode of the television series The X-Files.  In that episode we have a family of inbred people living in Pennsylvania who have kept to themselves for over a century, never bothering anyone.  It is only once the FBI is called in to investigate the burial of a deformed child that the inbred family resorts to murder - and only then to protect themselves from the outside world.  The people in this episode are severely deformed and very good at survival.<p>Wrong Turn takes several liberties with the television show premise:  there are three men, but no woman as in the TV show.  The three men apparently kill for the sheer pleasure of doing so, whereas in the TV show the men kill to protect themselves from the outside world.  <p>Yes, this film is shot very well - in fact, brilliantly at times.  Yes, the acting is superior - none of the old "drag anyone off the streets to star in the film" stuff that Friday the 13th had.  Eliza Dushku and Jeremy Sisto are particularly good.  The mood is right and the scare factor is there.  And, compared to early horror films of this type (Friday 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc.), it's just as gory, but in a more purile way.  There's no need for most of it.<p>It's just that I wish there was an answer to the "why".  Why did these guys kill people?<p>In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a terrible film.  I think it is a well made, well acted film that satisfies quite nicely for a night of gore, if that's your cup of tea (or blood, as it were).</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>Have you seen WRONG TURN? Here is a pop quiz.. (multiple choice) The psycho's in question are? A. They are inbreed. B. They are insane. C. They store body parts in the fridge. D. They have a junkyard of past victims cars. (or) E. All of the above. If you picked E you're right! The filmmakers in the commentary compare the film to "TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE" & "DELIVERANCE", another movie it reminded me of was the 70's horror classic "THE HILLS HAVE EYES". Which I encorage you to check out if you haven't seen it. Something must also be said about the remarkable FX that are on display here. Make-up FX are top-notch thanks to Stan Winston Studios. Also there are computer FX that I wasn't aware of 'till I watched the featurettes, they are amazing as well. "WRONG TURN" is worth your time ..pick it up as your next purchase. Horror fans will be pleased.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Right off hand I'm gonna tell that this movie isn't anything you haven't seen before. It has a typical horror movie set up: a bunch of young people in the woods in the backcountry of some state who run into a bunch of psychos who want to hunt them down and butcher them. If you're thinking " wow, that sounds a lot like the Texas Chain Saw Massacre", well, you'd be thinking right. There's even a gas station scene with a weird creepy hick. But I'm not trying to convey the message that is a Chain saw Massacre rip-off. Texas Chain Saw Massacre was awesome, so I see no problem in people wanting to make more movies like it. But anyways, Wrong Turn offers nothing new to genre, it's just a plain good ole slice 'em and dice 'em popcorn horror flick. It's not trying to be exceptional, it's just trying be a horror film with enough blood, gore and thrills to suffice any horror fan for the 84 duration time, and in that context, it succeeds.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>&quot;Wrong turn&quot; might not be cutting any new ground in its genre but it succeeds in what it wants to achieve as a film. Being a film that actually pays tribute to classics such as the &quot;Texas chainsaw massacre&quot;, &quot;The hills have eyes&quot; or the 70s cult film &quot;Deliverance&quot; it will be inevitably compared to these and it will stand very well.<br /><br />  With the &quot;familiar&quot; theme of inbred humanoid-monstroid incest products living in the &quot;woods&quot; who hunt down a company of unfortunate teens who happen to be lost in &quot;their&quot; forest with the intent to use them as body parts for their gruesome collection, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is both edgy and entertaining with more emphasis on the latter.<p>  It doesnt degenerate in an unwilling parody nor does it become a joke of itself because it's paced very well (the director rarely pulls the foot off the gas pedal) and because the cliches are actually working in favor of the film.<p>  As the inbreds pursue their victims through the forest the characters that &quot;fall&quot; first happen (...) to be the most annoying. But the game is set before that when the lost teens find temporary refuge in the bizzarohouse of the inbreds and while hiding in there they witness mutilations, human parts in the fridge, and the brutal chopping-up of one of their own.<p>  Where &quot;Wrong turn&quot; succeeds most is at the combination of humor with gore. It's not exactly simple to maintain a balance between these two but the film does walk the rope succesfully.<br />  For fans of this genre this is more than a welcome addition.<br />  Edgy, fun, pacey, and not cheesy it's a cool option for those Saturday night horror-video sessions with pizza.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Having watched "Jeepers Creepers" last week, a horror film with an awesome opening that disappointingly does not follow up on its promise, it was even more depressing to watch "Wrong Turn," a 2003 offering that has one of the least inspiring opening sequences ever.  A comely young couple are out in the woods of West Virginia doing some rock climbing when they are basically butchered off camera by unseen forces.  But any notion of mystery regarding who dunnit it is quickly dispelled by the film's credit sequences, which offers clippings and photographs about the problems of inbreeding and the legends of the backwoodsmen hiding out there in the forest.  By the end of the title credits the only question is how many of these crazy guys are out there in the woods and what specific genetic deformities do they have?  Do not worry, I will not spoil what limited amount of fun there is to have here by telling you the answers.<p>However, before those questions can be answered we have to meet the young folk fated to die horrible deaths.  Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) is late for an appointment and ends up on a dirt road going through them thar backhills.  After an abrupt encounter with a stalled SUV he meets up with the rest of the menu offerings: the hot to trot Evan (Kevin Zegers) and Francine (Lindy Booth), the happy couple Scott (Jeremy Sisto) and Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and the buffed but recently dumped Jessie (Eliza Dushku).  The group separates in an effort to find help and to make it easy for the first of them to die while the rest of the party finds the proverbial shack in the woods, which will get them up to speed on the danger they are facing.  Fortunately Chris is a medical student, so whether he is looking at road kill or opening up containers in a backwoods refrigerator, he can identify the sort of animal involved.  <p>Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy's idea of grossly disfigured mountain men hunting down young folks is a good enough idea for a slasher flick, although coming up with the cinematic in-breeding of "Wrong Turn" (cross basically any slasher film tha comes to mind with "Deliverance") is a bit diverting since you do not want to be repeatedly distracted during a film by remembering where you have seen similar things before (one episode of "The X-Files" kept coming to mind for me).  But director Rob Schmidt manages to make less out of the material on the screen than what appeared on the printed page.  The signature sequence in "Wrong Turn" is basically a single shot of an axe wedged into a tree (believe me, you will know it when you see it), but most of what should have been harrowing scenes of horror (e.g., the couple underneath the bed) just do not come off the way they should.  Usually when I watch a film I find myself focusing on how a script could have been improved, but this time around I spent most of the time taking the director to task.<p>For some reason I was hoping that the presence of Dushku and Sisto, who have enjoyed major supporting roles on two of the best televison series of the past decade in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Six Feet Under," was a sign that "Wrong Turn" was at least an above average slasher flick.  Maybe I am once again guilty of inflated expectations, but the results were very disappointing, because if this is just an average example of the genre that is an even more depressing conclusion.  The deleted scenes included on the DVD just provide additional nails in the coffin since watching your friends being butchered does not strike me as erotic and dailies of an actress being garotted with barbed wire is not exactly worthwhile.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>This dvd has one side were you watch the movie in fullscreen and other in widescreen.

The overriding purpose of this film was to scare people, but I didn't find it remotely frightening in the least.  It wasn't even as grisly as I expected it to be.  The evil &quot;mountain men&quot; of West Virginia are more comical than anything else, with little to offer beyond peculiar ways of walking, ape-like gibberish, terrible housekeeping skills, and a supposed cannibalistic nature.  But are these people really cannibals?  I think it is an important question, and I'm not convinced that they are.  They definitely have a fascination with body parts, assembling some lovely collections of jawbones and the like, they keep bloody bottles of something nasty in their refrigerator, they like to saw people up for some reason, and they make a pretty nasty kind of soup, but I didn't see anyone actually eating anyone.  When they bring one of the movie's first kills back to their cabin, do they immediately begin preparing a chili con human being feast?  No; they dump the body on a table and decide to go to sleep, in the middle of the day.  Maybe I'm belaboring a point here, but there are just a lot of little things about this movie that kept me from fully embracing the action taking place.  <p>There is really no evidence offered that any of the characters actually took a wrong turn in anything other than a metaphorical sense.  Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) voluntarily took a certain old dirt road through the wilds of West Virginia because it seemed to be a shortcut, and all we learn about the group of friends trying to cheer up Jessie Burlingame (Eliza Dushku) is that they are lost.  In any event, a collection of six worthy victims comes together (thanks to Chris' sadly deficient driving skills) on the all but deserted Bear Mountain Road, where things are just not right.  Barbwire intentionally placed in the road in order to blow out tires is the first clue, but there are plenty more to come.  Four of the six strike out on foot in search of help.  Things start to go bad for the two left behind early on, although we don't yet get a good glimpse of the bad stalking the woods.  After coming upon a dead end, our intrepid foursome investigates an old cabin in the woods, looking for a phone.  The place is a pig sty, yet they stay in there long enough to make some pretty gruesome discoveries and to find themselves trapped when the residents of the humble abode come home.  This is probably the best scene in the movie, as our heroes come face to face, quite literally, with true terror in the form of a mutilated friend tossed right in front of their hiding eyes.  From this point on, the chase is on, and no one is guaranteed to survive.  <p>Some of the kills are rather nice, as kills engineered by famed producer Stan Winston certainly should be, but I wanted more, to tell you the truth.  Even the decapitation scene that Winston is so proud of left me rather nonplussed.  The tension and suspense should increase as we work our way toward an ending, but I found myself constantly distracted by little things that bothered me.  It all starts with the trees; apparently, every tree in West Virginia has strong, hefty branches that are perfectly horizontal, connect to one another, and allow for easy human perambulation.  Heck, a person standing on a limb can even fall down and land right on her back without any need to grab hold of anything in order to avoid plunging to a most painful death.  Then there is the classic &quot;guy hiding underneath the truck&quot; scene.  First of all, these dirt roads of West Virginia are bound to have many a dip in them, and there is no way anyone could ride a mere inch or two from the ground holding on to the bottom of an old truck sporting shocks that saw their better days many, many years in the past.  Worse, though, is the fact that at one point I could detect no sign of anyone supposedly stowing away underneath the truck as it drove down the road.  <p>I really hate to give this movie a mere three stars. I love Eliza Dushku, and I really wanted to enjoy a movie that had such incredible horror potential.  I'm sure this movie can provide frightening thrills to many a viewer, but it just didn't do it for me.  An infamous episode of the X-Files built on a similar foundation of an inbred, mutated, disgusting family was far creepier and much more intense than Wrong Turn.  The DVD itself is nice, housing both full screen and widescreen versions of the film and tagging on four short featurettes, a little poster gallery, a few deleted scenes, and a commentary by the major players.  I just wish I could have truly enjoyed this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>WRONG TURN has great promise at the beginning.  I was even beginning to think that I had found a modern horror film that didn't rely on the cliches that other horror films of today rely on.<p>WRONG TURN started going downhill when the ridiculous looking inbred brothers appeared.  So unrealistic, too much makeup ...<p>I didnt even care for the characters after that, as they tried to escape from the evil.<p>Why are film makers still making silly movies like this?  What a sheer waste of money.  Why not make a film on something worthwhile?</p></br><a href="../users/ADKA2MJQQCMTO.html">ADKA2MJQQCMTO</a><br/><p>Generally speaking, I'm really not much a fan of just gratuitous violence or gore, but I MORE then understand its place in the world of horror movies.  Sometimes the point of a horror movie becomes more about its ability to shock and &quot;push the envelope&quot; of the imaginary borders of its 'R' rating then about the actual story within the movie.<p>I know how strange that sounds, but think of a movie like the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'  Tobe Hooper was less concerned with the audience building up any emotional attachment to his characters as he was trying to freak out the audience with scenes of death and dismemberment that you'd NEVER even think possible for an 'R' movie.<p>Where am I going with this?  Well, 'Wrong Turn' didn't do any of this.  I was really surprised this was as tame as it was.  I mean, if you're going to make a movie about inbred, mountain-men, cannibals, then take it all the way and try and do something really outrageous.  Why settle for something that movies like 'The Hills Have Eyes' or 'TCM' have done better before.  Your audience for this type of movie is DARING you to show them something they've never though possible.  Do something that would have the MPAA white as a sheet when the house lights come on.<p>I felt like this just was a movie that wanted to do a lot more, but, for whatever reason, pulled back its punch at the last minute.  It's a solid outing for (director) Rob Schmidt though, and I'm curious enough to see his next movie.  I want to know if he held back here or was he being restrained?  His next film may be a better indicator of his true creativity.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>I can't understand why people actually think this is a good movie.<br /><br />Let's start with the story first which is pretty straighforward. Group of young people get lost in the Virginia woods and get slaughtered off one by one thanks to some inbred mountain men. There's a great X-files episode about that too.<br /><br />Of course a few make it to the end. When I saw the first 15 minutes I had to think of "Deliverance" all the time and was  surprised to see that one of the persons actually referred to that movie.<br /><br />The acting is superficial and just not exciting enough. The mountain men are scary so that worked and the other make-up is not bad though not realistic. It always surprises me that in some movies the women still have the same lipstick after two days in the wilderness. Where did they get it?<br /><br />The camerawork is sometimes unbelievable. Unbelievable in the sense that you think to yourself: why?? There are some shots from underneath the passenger seat looking up at the driver, totally too much. There is also some random black and white in between, another thing I just don't get.<br /><br />Please go and see "Deliverance" or read a good book, this is 75 minutes of your life that could have been spend more wisely.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>If you blinked you probably missed this movie in the theaters but that's okay because it'll be in the 99 cent bin at your local video store really soon. Wrong Turn rips off Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance and every dumb, nubile teens in the woods movie ever made. I went the theater hoping for a good creepy time but ended up laughing at the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3A48XEYWLWH7T.html">A3A48XEYWLWH7T</a><br/><p>Sunday, February 13, 2005 / 4 of 5 / Above average inbred cannibal hillbilly saga.<br /><br />Eliza Dushku stars in this actually pretty good take on the genre popularized by Deliverance.  As usual we get a group of good looking kids stranded on the back roads of West Virginia.  Why anyone would be in the back woods of West Virginia in the first place is beyond me, but at any rate they are soon met by the male protagonist, a budding med student.  Members of the party are soon dispatched by a trio of good ol' mountain boys.  You know the type, deformed after generations of inbreeding, super strong, tough to kill, wily, good hunters, non-discriminatory eaters.  The plot is pretty linear and straight forward for this type of film, but it delivers a decently taut experience.  Above average.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>Some goofy kids take a &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; into some West Virginia woods and then all hell breaks loose. Those mountain men weren't that hideous, a lot of people look like that when they wake up in the morning. Really, this is a standard horror film, but it has its moments. The nasty brothers have a poor diet and they eat mysterious meat, tasty. There should've been a local dentist in town to help those poor boys. Well, everyone gets it except for the main guy (Desmond Harrington) and the main girl (Eliza Dushku) and they manage to blow up the incest house standing a few feet from the gas can. Is he crazy? He could've blown himself out of his own shoes. Kind of silly, but oh well.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>The gore is the best part. This movie is one cliche afetr the other, but that's what the director wanted. There are some inovated kills in this, that will keep gore fans entertained. Plot? You already know it. Teens go into woods, smoke have sex, get slaughtered by a family of imbreed cannabals. Believe me that IS the plot. No character development, no suspense, no scares, but the gore is great. My personal favorites are the arrow in the eye and decaptitation of the girl in the tree. Other than that, this is going to put you sleep.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KDGSZEJXSE9S.html">A1KDGSZEJXSE9S</a><br/><p>I was hyped for this flick because I like Deliverance.<br />After I seen this movie I realized Wrong Turn wasn't<br />much like it at all. Deliverance was about 4 city boys<br />going to the woods and two of them getting mentally<br />tortured and having to coverup the murders of the two<br />hicks they killed. This movie is a Texas Chainsaw Mass-<br />acre rip-off. It's just a stop and go gore fest with<br />lame looking hick folk. Come on! These guys don't even<br />look human! They look like some monster trolls or some<br />thing like that.<br /><br />It's just boring and uninteresting. There was one scene<br />that I really liked with an axe and a tree. Don't want<br />to give it all away. Other than that, the movie was just<br />a bore. I expected more from a movie that was supposed<br />to be out of the Deliverance mold.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Wanted to let y'all know, I just finished dinner before writing this, and my was it tasty..haven't had a meal from Connecticut for a while..ooops...got some hair in my teeth.  Yessirree, Billy Bob, I come from West Virginia, home of the cinderblocked cars, extra tv satellites and inbred kinfolks.  This here movie sure skeered the pants off of me and my wife/sister, but I don't think it was filmed here in West Virginia...didn't see any Dale Earnhardt Jr. license plates.  Oh, well, WRONG TURN ought to keep furners out of our hills, and if it don't , you can stop by our hut for dinner.....we'd love to have ya!</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Good concept. Good cast. Good scares. Good suspense. That being said, the good things about Wrong Turn are outweighed by the wasted opportunities to be unique.<p>Instead, Wrong Turn falls into the realm of typical, forgettable, predictable movies that are being mass produced these days. It doesn't take any chances, it doesn't do anything different and it doesn't leave a lasting impression.<p>The movie builds up into something that is gonna be cool, scary and unique, but eventually you realize that... nope... same old movie, different actors. Another movie that didn't have the guts to break the mold and thus is just ordinary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>As some have already mentioned, we've seen this all before.  There is really nothing new in `Wrong Turn' besides the cast and a ridiculous tree hopping scene.  That said, to me there was no point to watch this, to make it even.  It took the same scenario's of many of the `good' horror films (Hills Have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw for starters) and recycled them into pointless fluff.  If it weren't for Dushku being as hot as she is this film wouldn't have been worth the wasted two hours I spent last night, and even then it's a stretch.  I don't understand why cannibals have to be mutated and uneducated woodsman who look unhuman and grunt instead of speak.  Remember Hannibal Lector?  Remember the remake of Texas Chainsaw in 2003?  The cannibals where much scarier when they looked like you and me.  These inbreds looked so fake it was ridiculous.  I gave it two stars for Dushku and the few creative death scenes, especially the one in the trees and the barbwire thing...gruesome as they were, it's a horror film so gruesome is welcomed.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Wrong Turn (Rob Schmidt, 2003)<p>Poor Rob Schmidt. What a fantastic rags-to-riches story he was; he got his first big Hollywood job as a gaffer on the little movie that could, The Doom Generation, and worked his way up to director in five years, giving the world Crime and Punishment in Suburbia. Yeah, it was a first film, with all the hallmarks of same. But really, no limits, right? This guy could be the best.<p>And then came 2003, and he gave us Wrong Turn. There have been a rash of bad horror movies since the success of Jeepers Creepers, and not a one of them even has the fun factor of JC. Add Wrong Turn to the list. At least it tries to be slightly different, but it fails. Painfully. <p>Do you really need a plot summary? Take a passel of teens. Add in a creepy serial killer. Let the bodies hit the floor. In this case, the passel of teens is headed up by the delicious Eliza Dushku (Bring It On, This Boy's Life) and Desmond Harrington (Riding in Cars with Boys), along with other previously-rising Hollywood gen-y types like Jeremy Sisto (the title role in TNT's recent miniseries of Julius Caesar) and Emmanuelle Chiriqui (Snow Day), whose careers have likely been destroyed by their appearances in this movie. The Deliverance-style bad guys are played by three actors who are one step below character actors (you know, "I was in this film as `truck driver #3!'"), with the only one who might've been recognizable without the makeup being Julian Richings, the Trent Reznor-lookalike janitor from similarly silly late-nineties horror flick Urban Legend. (If you're a longtime fan of bad horror, though, Gary Robbins had bad-horror-flick child-star status in the early eighties. Remember Humungous? Eh, you're probably better off...)<p>Crossing your typical slasher film with Deliverance sounds like a good idea, doesn't it? Actually, it's a fantastic idea. And to be fair to the producers, they did line up a potential-wunderkind director, a cast of potentially above-average stars, and came up with some absolutely gorgeous rural-west-virginia scenery, even if it's the backwoods version of "we're trying to make Toronto look like New York again" ("West Virginia" actually resides in Dundee, Ontario, for the purposes of this movie). They went painfully wrong in not changing Alan McElroy's script nearly enough (when your first sold script is for the dreadful Halloween 4, and your newest script is for... Halloween 9, you're pretty well locked into clich&eacute; mode. Worse, he was also responsible for Left Behind and Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever). In fact, I doubt anyone changed a single word. So you have a director and actors who, if you remove the "potentially" part, are at least capable. Blame this turkey on the script. And hope someone make another Deliverance-style gen-y horror film that actually does it right, because this one ain't it. **</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>Wrong Turn is one of those fun B-movie gems all Horror fans look for, usually in vain. I mean, how could you NOT like a movie about a pack of inbred cannibals menacing a stranded group of city slickers? Chances are, if you're the type of person who goes to see something like this, you're going to be receptive enough to enjoy it. So leave the snobs at home, and let's go down West Virginia way.....<p>  Wrong Turn wastes no time getting out of the gate, as a couple of mountain-climbing doofuses get waylaid by our inbred trio. The title sequence lays out all you need to know (Inbreeding is bad! An unusually high number of disappearances take place in this particular stretch of West Virginia backwoods. Inbred people are scary looking and mean! They have LOTS of sharp knives and stuff!) On his way to a job interview, Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) takes that titular wrong turn to avoid a traffic jam (ALWAYS STAY ON THE MAIN ROAD, FOLKS!), and literally runs into a group of stranded vacationers (Headed up by the intense Eliza Dushku) wrecking both of their cars. The group sets off on foot to get help, but soon finds out that you probably shouldn't go barging into people's backwood shacks looking for a phone, and DO NOT look in their tupperware! <p>  Movies like this aren't exactly brain surgery, and saavy viewers will know exactly who will wind up on the menu and who will survive to see the final credits roll. The cast is appealing, the make-up effects are well-done (What else would you expect from the legendary Stan Winston?), and even if the movie doesn't offer any surprises, it's all competently done. My only complaint is the murderous trio isn't shown nearly enough; I would have appreciated a few more lingering shots of them so I could really absorb Winston's make-up designs. I guess that'll have to wait for the DVD, though. Wrong Turn is a fun popcorn flick that hammers home a point us city dwellers have known for a LONG time: STAY OUTTA THE WOODS!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Will you ever go camping again? Will you ever go into WOODS again? Will you think about which way to go?<p>This film was great. I bought it on the off-chance that I would like it, plus it had Eliza Dushku in it. I couldn't find any DVDs that I literally had to buy - plus I had plenty of money! - so I closed my eyes and made a grab for one. And this was in my hand! I wasn't sure what to expect from this - I vaguely remember publicity for it coming out, but didn't know the storyline or anything.<p>I was quite surprised to discover that Stan Winston had a hand in producing this movie. I was disappointed when I saw his inbred &quot;monsters&quot;. They weren't up to his usual standards from great movies such as Jurassic Park and the Terminator movies. I didn't find them scary at all, and they have very little screen time for the amount of makeup the poor guys have to sit through. Quite often the inbreds are seen from far away, or from behind. <p>It's your typical 'teen' slasher flick, but with a more interesting approach to the film itself and the killings. The killings are very well thought out, and not your usual killings that you find. The best killing has to be Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), who is decapitated through the head. This is a very freaky scene, as it's shown how they managed to do it in the extras. They also mention wanting the eyes to blink before you realise what's happened, which would have been absolutely wicked! But they don't do that unfortunately. Also, everyone gets separated, which is a must in these kind of films.<p>Jeremy Sisto is very hard guy to place! He is so familiar, and I had to look him out before I discovered he played the mum's boyfriend in Thirteen - duh, only like one of my favourite films!<p>Eliza Dushku is a great actress. She has a terrific screen prescence, and can certainly act her little socks off! She's lit up the screen before in True Lies and Bring It On, and hopefully will appear in lots more films.<p>There is NOT a lot of cast in this when you think about it, and most of them get killed off pretty quickly. Most of the girls are wandering around in too small tops, with peanuts stuffed down them by the looks of it! (They're called bras, wear them)<p>I tend to find from the start of these films, I know who's going to still be alive by the end of the movie. I was right with this one.<p>As shown during the deleted scenes, there's a deleted scene between Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku, which shows the attraction between them. This scene would have been better left in, as I was rooting for them to be together!<p>There are quite a few extras on this, although don't expect much, they're short and sweet just like me. The featurettes are pretty pointless, they're barely a couple of minutes of screen time. The extras include: an audio commentary by director Rob Schmidt and stars Desmond Harrington and Eliza Dushku; deleted scenes; four featurettes: &quot;Making of Wrong Turn,&quot; &quot;Eliza Dushku: Babe in the Woods,&quot; &quot;Stan Winston,&quot; &quot;Fresh Meat: The Wounds of Wrong Turn&quot; and a poster concept art gallery. (The latter is very dull). There's only four deleted scenes if I remember correctly, and most of the time, they are slight extensions of the original scenes. Pretty basic.<p>It's also a short and sweet movie, only 80 minutes. It's simple and straightforward, which means it doesn't take a lot of thought.<p>This is definitely a must have for any horror movie fans collection. Don't believe reviews that say it's rubbish. Even for someone who hates it, has to give it stars at least for Eliza Dushku (or Desmond Harrington, depending on which way inclined you are).</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>Which one of us hasn't been traveling and made the wrong turn? Did you ever have that thought in the back of your mind of just what kind of people you are going to encounter?

Gross!<br />This movie has many heart stopping moments, lots of gore and was fast paced.  I think what troubled me the most is the fact that we do not know who lives in all these little tucked away areas of our land now do we? Remember that next time you travel, it could stop you from being someone's dinner!  A movie all horror fans will enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>No new ground is broken in this horror thriller, but the film is shot rather beautifully with Toronto and its surroundings doubling for West Virginia.  <p>Eliza Dushku and some other impossibly good-looking cast members are stranded and then hunted down by a trio of inbred mountain men.  Standard horror film format then ensues.  <p>The film runs a little under 80 minutes (not including end credits) so it at least benefits from somewhat tight pacing.  <p>Make-up whiz and creature creator Stan Winston is a producer on this film, and much of the Electronic Press Kit info (passed off on the DVD as "bonus featurettes") features Stan the Man fawning over his make-up designs for the hillbilly inbred mountain men.  "I wanted them to look more like real people than horror creatures", he says.  Sorry, Stan.  You swung and missed on that one.  They look a little TOO creature-y and not enough like real people.  You took the facial and body disfigurations just a little too far.  One of them just looks like an evil elf.<p>Ironically enough, not enough attention is paid to these murdering, cannibalistic mountain men.  We get only a few teasing glimpses at what they do (or intend to do) with their victims.  The film really only fun and creepy when we (and our hapless heroes) are getting a look at the mountain trio's handywork.  Shades of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", 1974 version.  <p>The director says in the lackluster commentary that he wanted this film to be like a cross between "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Deliverance".  To some degree he succeeds, but everything that made the hillbilly rednecks in "Deliverance" so shiveringly believable, namely that they could pass for "ordinary" but were in fact brutal and scary, is covered up in "Wrong Turn" with so much make-up and prosthetics that the villains look too "Hollywood".  The make-up draws too much attention to itself.<p>All that aside, the film is a decent rental though probably not one to purchase for the home library.</p></br></body></html>

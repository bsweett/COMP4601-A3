Her acting talents to me have always seemed pretty run of the mill.  And she can occasionally appear to be stunningly beautiful at most times she appears remarkably average.  So i've never understood the hype<p>We are treated here to an extraordinary performance.  She brings genuine honesty to the role.  I would highly recommend that you read the review of 'RESOLUTE' which I found to be particularly poignant and accurate.  To RESOLUTE: I wish that you would include your email and that you would write more reviews because you really seem to know your stuff ie: Independence Day<p>What I enjoyed most about this film is that the story and the performances carried the day rather than production tricks and hype.  In short the movie is very low key.  It's understated in it's visuals and drama.  The viewer is not forced to like or dislike (the character) Erin Brockavich although she is certainly a sympathetic presence as are Albert Finney and the victims of the dumping.<p>In short I did not expect to like this film and viewed it with reluctance but was treated to a real gem of a film and all involved are to be commended.  It's got all of the elements a great story, well acted, enough laughs and plenty of drama plus ultimately vindication.<p>Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Inspired from a true story (which does have a few differences from the movie), this movie is a fun one with Julia Roberts and her boss vs big corporations. The plot is well-paced and it is so much fun to see Julia Roberts mouth off - to the police, to her lawyer, to the people she is suing, and so on and so forth. If you like Julia Roberts, you'll love this movie. And if you like stories of little guys vs big, bad corporations, you'll also enjoy this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't THIS the movie where Julia Roberts really became the great movie actress that we think of today?  The movies I've seen released before this one starring Julia Roberts show an actress on the verge of greatness, but never quite reaching that point for whatever reason.<br /><br />Well, Erin Brockovich is definitely a movie I have no problem calling fantastic.  Perhaps it's the memories of when the film came out and how I remember my family really enjoying how Julia's character develops into a strong and intelligent woman, or perhaps it has more to do with the writing of the story, which is both interesting AND moving.  Not to mention the kind of storyline anyone of any age can understand and appreciate.<br /><br />I will always remember Erin Brockovich as the movie that got me into paying more attention to movies as a whole more than anything else, and I recommend everyone watch it at least once and see if you too are able to discover the same kind of enjoyment that me and my family once did.<br /><br />This is also an important movie that women should take notice of, because it shows women can do absolutely anything if they set their minds to it.  I believe Erin Brockovich sets an example for everyone though, men and women alike, to stand up for what you believe in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The film opens with an interview of a young woman. "Look." She leaves disappointed, and her car is hit when someone drives through a red light. The testimony in court doesn't go well; inappropriate language for this young mother may prejudice the jury. [Unfair, but that is life.] She applies for jobs over the phone. No experience? Erin gets a job at that law firm. She meets the new neighbors. Does she have problems at work? Erin learns why there are medical records in a real estate file. The Jensen family has medical problems. Chromium is involved, it can be deadly. There is a factory a few hundred yards away. Erin searches the records at the water board and finds evidence of pollution. Was she a beauty queen? [Looks aren't everything, manners count.]<br /><br />Lawyer Ed Masry drops by for information. Erin gets even more information. Did PG&E pay for that doctor? The illnesses of the Jensen family can be explained by exposure to chromium hexavalent-6. "Wow!". Former neighbors of the Jensen's visit the office for advice. Lawyer Ed explains the laws, Erin explains the costs of litigation. Erin wears sandals in a barn yard! She talks to other neighbors. There are four more families involved. Can Erin find the evidence for law suits? Will she be threatened? Will the case become too large for a small firm? The judge upholds the suits, they will go to trial. Erin's job made her respected by people. [Feared rather than loved?] Masry has a new partner with the most experience in toxic tort law.<br /><br />PG&E wants the case settled by arbitration. Erin still has a problem in dealing with people. Lawyer Theresa does not have the common touch. There is a problem in their suits, all of the plaintiffs must agree. If they don't use binding arbitration the case can go on for 15 or 20 years. Erin gets the signatures of the plaintiffs. Would a chance meeting bring new evidence? "How did you do this?" The judge decides for the plaintiffs, the amount is on the high end. Erin, ever abrasive, gets a surprise from Lawyer Ed. "Do beauty queens know how to apologize?" The settlement in Hinkley vs. PG&E was the largest award in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. Other suits against PG&E were pending.<br /><br />This film dramatizes the events behind the law suit. The real Erin plays the part of the waitress early in this film. Note how the story of this law suit was boosted by personal drama. Compare it to "A Civil Action".</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>Erin Brockovich with Julia Roberts is a film about a woman who stands her ground against all odds, as the divorced single mother who works as a clerk for Ed Masry, an attorney played by Albert Finney and they join forces to champion clients that are wronged by a powerful corporation.<br /><br />Erin takes on the case against this corporation that is spoiling the environment with toxic substances, not only poisoning the water supply of a town in California, but also responsible for the illness and death of many residents.<br /><br />Erin is a woman who has lived through hardship, so she is able to relate to those suffering. She earns the trust of these clients, as they tell her all about their condition. Soon, we see Erin gaining ground against corporate greed and secrecy as she uncovers the details necessary to win a court case against the company that, while not returning individual claimants to health, at least they gain the financial strength necessary to withstand the consequences of exposure to toxic chemicals.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>This is the best movie starting Julia Robert I've ever seen so far (2008).<br />It's engaging, disturbing and touching. It deeply moved me seeing Julia struggling to raise her kids by herself and doing a good job at work. It vividly potrayed the cruelty of the corporate which knew their waste was killing people. But they arrograntly denied it.<br /><br />Julia's acting is superb. The fact that this film is based on a true story does increase its entertaining value.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>But certainly a good message, and excellent acting. Roberts has always been better at the romantic-comedy, but she does well in the role of Erin. Yet the acting is overtaken by the plot; one gets more involved with the story than with the actors (which can be good) and is good in this case. Not a family film, but certainly inspirational.<p>DVD is good, movie is great. Well deserved A.A. and long overdue.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KALHQD4LWAKO.html">A1KALHQD4LWAKO</a><br/><p>Ordinary folks triumph in this quite pleasing look at big corporate greed and how the quest for the almighty dollar puts human life in the back seat.  Stellar performances from Roberts and the rest of the cast make this an affecting piece.<p>Very highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Based on a true story, Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three takes on PG&amp;E to prove that they are poisoning the town's water supply.  She manages to get a job with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history.  After a lot of hard work, no family life, and insulting everyone in her path, she wins the victims $330 million dollars and herself a hefty two million dollar bonus.  The movie is not as much about the courtroom battle with PG&amp;E as it is with the battles that Erin was facing in everyday life, a single uneducated working class mother raising three kids on her own in a very uncooperative world.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BSZPRBKYAB2K.html">A2BSZPRBKYAB2K</a><br/><p>What a great movie Erin Brockovich is.  I usually don't write reviews on DVD's/Movies unless they are typical guy movies, war movies, etc.  However, I had to make an exception for this wonderful, outstanding acted movie.<p>Julia Roberts portrays true life Erin Brockovich.  A lady who came from a not so glamerous background who with the help of the law firm she worked for took on big and powerful Pacific Gas And Electric (PG&amp;E) and won a huge settlement for the townspeople of Hinckly, California.  This is a true life case where PG&amp;E used Hazardous Chemicals in their electric turbines and took the waste from the turbines (Chronium) and instead of safely containing them in lined waste ponds, decided not to make the ponds safe and thus the Chronium seaped into the ground soil and contaminating the town's water supply.<p>Erin Brockovich (Roberts Character), needed a job desperately and was able to work for a law firm who had the case &quot;pro bono&quot;.  THANK Goodness for the law firm and Hinckly that Brockovich worked for the lawyers (even though she isn't a lawyer). <p>Overcoming a tremendous burden (single mom, low paying salary), Brockovich researched the cases, got to know the townspeople, gathered evidence, and to make a long story short, won for the &quot;little people&quot;, over 300 Million Dollars!!<p>This is a movie that everyone would enjoy.  Roberts rightfully won the Oscar for Best Actress from this movie.  All actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job.  The plot is true life captivating, intelligent, and will keep the viewers interest from the very first scene. <p>Highly Recommended!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), a hard-working single mother, manages to get hired as a lawyer's assistant and ends up spearheading a multi-million-dollar civil suit against PG&E.  Though not in the same league as a great film like the similarly-themed "Silkwood," I found this to be an entertaining and satisfying tale of the little guy triumphing against the system.  Roberts is very good as a tough, tired, disappointed woman who flaunts what she sees as her only asset--her physical beauty.  Albert Finney fleshes out the underwritten role of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry.  The character of George, however, is a misstep.  He is some kind of working woman's fantasy man--a tough, good-looking biker who is also sensitive, domestic, and good with kids.  He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.  Aaron Eckhardt never really figures out what to do with the part.  Nevertheless, it's an entertaining film.</p></br><a href="../users/A34XPZS5DXA6HA.html">A34XPZS5DXA6HA</a><br/><p>Wow!  This is not another Pretty Woman by any means.  Julia's character is a struggling mother who has no question in her mind as to the right and wrong of a whole town's situation, and she isn't afraid to hunt down the evidence and the answers she needs. Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a woman at the end of her means who is scratching and clawing to keep from drowning while supporting her children, and saving a town.  Roberts does an exceptional job portraying Brockovich.<p>Kudos to both Julia for a job well done, and Erin for making her life what she wanted it to be, while helping those who couldn't have done it on their own.</p></br><a href="../users/A84UFSF2SZS2W.html">A84UFSF2SZS2W</a><br/><p>Unfortunately for this film, the ads that came out to promote it told too much of the story and gave away a lot of its really outstanding humour. This film actually was great. Soderbergh's direction was excellent and perhaps unexpected. Julia Roberts turns in a powerhouse performance as Erin Brockovich who uses her quick wit, perseverance and aggression to fuel her drive not only to wheedle her way into a job for which she is not at once qualified but uses it even more convincingly when she investigates the case for which she is well known and around which this script is built. A compelling story of a regular person who uses what skills and assets she does have to discover a cover-up and to get compensation for those whose lives were adversely affected or altogether destroyed by the information covered up. The cast was great, and Roberts deserves accolades for this performance. It was great to see the chameleonic Aaron Eckhart here also as Brockovich's boyfriend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GB5CG77LGQRB.html">A2GB5CG77LGQRB</a><br/><p>Erin Brockovich<p>Score: 85/100<p>Wow, what a surprise. We didn't really see this one coming. Mostly with names like Erin Brockovich or Joan of Arc, you'd expect there was going to be some kind of war hero who dies in the end and has never been noticed before. But, in Erin Brockovich, it focuses on a classy new kind of hero that brings a small town to it's feet and huge business to it's knees.<p>Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother desperate find a job but is having no luck. This losing streak even extends to a failed lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully browbeats her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one takes her seriously with her trashy clothes and earthy manners, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.. What she discovers is that the company is trying to quietly to buy land that was contaminated by hexavalent chromium, a deadly toxic waste that the company is improperly and illegally dumping and in turn poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her lawfirm in one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-billion dollar corporation<p>In Erin Brockovich, you can no longer expect the romantic-comedy type of Julia Roberts. Here, she shines in her role as Erin, a feisty and determined single mom with a plan. It's the first movie in which Roberts really deserves the `career-best' nod, and it will be a movie that she will be remembered for in the future. She is well supported by Albert Finney who handles Ed Masry's anger and happiness perfectly. There is also Aaron Eckhart, who stars as Erin's love interest, to keep us occupied and he is cast nicely and has promise for future roles. Hats off to director Steven Soderbergh (nominated for Best Director twice this year!) and Susannah Grant, who put mindblowing effort into this great picture.<p>One more thing: look out for the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress, and don't miss this film!</p></br><a href="../users/A139ZF7CJVVTJU.html">A139ZF7CJVVTJU</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.<br /><br />And I don't mean that literally.<br /><br />Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.<br /><br />There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.<br /><br />They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray!<br /><br />I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre.<br /><br />With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.<br /><br />Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.<br /><br />And she won't take none of your lip, neither.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>It is often hard for a movie about a landmark legal battle to capture the public's interest, especially if it is based on a true story. Examples include A Civil Action in 1998 and The Insider in 1999. Despite much critical praise, these movies were apparently perceived by audiences as being too dry. Such was not the fate of Erin Brockovich, which became the first smash hit of 2000. Perhaps having Julia Roberts as the title character fighting for justice helped make the difference. I know it didn't hurt. <p>The picture opens with Erin desperately looking for a job. She's twice divorced from no good husbands and has a child to support. After one interview, she is injured in a car wreck when another driver runs a red light. She decides to sue the other person, not because she is greedy, but because she needs to be compensated for her medical expenses. She turns to a lawyer named Ed Masry [Albert Finney], a very busy man who virtually assures her that she will win. Ed does not factor in Erin's flashy, almost trashy taste in clothing or her tendency to spew out four letter words when she is angered. Her appearance on the witness stand is a disaster, and they lose the case, which brings forth a tirade on the lawyer from Erin. Meanwhile, she meets a decent guy who winds up frightening her. She has had such rotten luck with men. In an ironic turn of events, she ends up working for Ed Masry. The other women in the office are pretty hostile, since Julia's style is hardly what we expect in a staid law office. Erin persists, and one day she discovers a case that has been on the office's back burner. It involves a group of people who live adjacent to one of Pacific Gas and Electric's plants. There is a probability that these people have been poisoned for years by chromium the company has allowed to seep into the local drinking water.<p>There are several things which make the movie work. Much of it concentrates on two very interesting characters, Erin and Ed, rather than on the workings of the legal system itself. It also plots the progress of a remarkable woman. Erin starts off as an intelligent woman with vitally no marketable skills. Also lacking any skills at dealing with other people, she seems destined to be someone who works a lifetime just to eke out a living. For some inner reason, this legal case mesmerizes her. It requires her to learn a whole lot very fast and to put her personal life aside for a cause worth fighting for. In the process, we watch as a whole new woman emerges. Her progress is at least as interesting as the legal battle's. <p>Julia Roberts and the great British actor, Albert Finney, are splendid as Erin and Ed. The way they play off of each other reminds me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. There is no sex involved, but this is decidedly a battle of the sexes. She's too brash and outspoken for him, and he's too stuffy and cautious for her. It is a case of opposites attracting. As for the movie itself, it's a case of a job well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>OK....I've always found Julia Roberts pleasant, but figured her acting range was probably somewhere in the same force as a Daisy Air Rifle (I DID see Mary Reilly, after all!).  I was amazed.  She fleshed out a seriously flawed character and gives her warmth, charm, and grit.<p>My one flaw with the movie is Erin's full-force bravado that comes with little reproach.  She manages to fire off some SERIOUSLY mean things, but yet is never really heald accountable for them.  Hard to suspend my disbelief when most real life situations calling for this would probably get you belted.<p>Overall, a seriously well acted film that horrifically depicts the corrupting power of a large corporation and it's ripple effect on a community and on lives.  But it also shows how much power one person really can have.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore.  We love her.  She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised.  She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder.  She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder).  We love her.<p>Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)...  How about...no, no, NO.  Give her someone near her equal.  How about a real actor twice her age?  How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))?  Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance.  Not only does it work, it's a triumph.  Finney really is brilliant.  His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character.  Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses?  For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion).  For the first time in her life she is doing something important.  For the first time in her life people respect her.  There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.<p>Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth.  She neglects him and her kids for her obsession.  Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife.  Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her.  It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts!  She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real.  That's her gift.<p>A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (&quot;and all his relatives,&quot; as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the &quot;little guy&quot; versus the corporate behemoth.  I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending.  But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim.  I haven't seen any of his latest movies,  (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, &amp; Videotape from 1989.  I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CWH6VKCTJAD.html">A3CWH6VKCTJAD</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck  mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto  accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law  firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that  utility giant PG&amp;E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents  are getting gravely ill.<p>The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin  looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes  of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the  investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a  powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and  smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the  victims.<p>Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this  after his extremely avant-garde effort in "The Limey".  His key strength  here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert  Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my  only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was  presented.  George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left  shoulder says &quot;DIRTY&quot;) who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a  ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and  kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems  inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this  package.<p>Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any  myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her  accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was  gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from  manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant  crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her  as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.<p>Albert Finney also  gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a  lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good  contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific  chemistry.<p>Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned  above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his  rebellious culture.  However, I put more of the responsibility for this on  the director than on the actor.<p>The DVD has some excellent comments by  the real Erin Brockovich that lend credibility to the story.  However,  Brockovich is so toned down in these interviews, it makes Roberts'  portrayal seem like an exaggeration.  <p>This is an excellent story that is  well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy  strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity,  I recommend it highly.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L43KWWR05PCS.html">A1L43KWWR05PCS</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining, well directed movie with an excellent performance by Albert Finney and a notable one by Julia Roberts who plays the title role of Erin Brockovich. The rest of the cast, likewise, give excellent performances. <p>The story is a compelling one. A down and out single mother of three young children, Erin Brockovich, gets into an auto accident. Her personal injury suit goes down the tubes, when she alienates the jury with her checkered past and salty language. Angry and desperate, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry, disarmingly played by Albert Finney, into hiring her, after he loses her personal injury case. He does so, to the consternation of his other employees. You see, Erin marches to the beat of a different drummer. She dresses like a tramp and talks like a longshoreman. <p>Which only goes to show you, that one should never judge a book by its cover. Beneath the vulgar exterior, lies a steel trap mind, which Erin put to good use when she goes through a pro bono real estate case, only to discover that there is more to the real estate transaction than meets the eye, a whole lot more. Intrigued by the fact that extensive medical records are included in the real estate transaction paperwork and wondering why that should be, Erin lets her natural curiosity and interest in people prevail. She goes about and investigates the matter. <p>What she ultimately discovers is that toxic waste is very clearly affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants of the town of Hinckley, California. It appears that the utilities giant Pacific Gas and Electric has been letting highly toxic chromium seep into the ground, affecting the water which the inhabitants of the town use. The utilities giant has compounded the problem by telling the townspeople that they should not worry about a little chromium, despite the high incidence of cancer and other illnesses which abound in Hinckley.<p>Erin, outraged on behalf of the townspeople, discovers through her research and investigation that Pacific Gas and Electric knew about the toxicity of the Chromium, but continued with business as usual and set about deceiving the unsuspecting townspeople to their ultimate detriment. Eager to right a serious wrong, Erin persuades her employer, small time lawyer, Ed Masry, to take on this big time case. This ultimately leads to one of the largest monetary class action settlements in history. <p>This is a true life David and Goliath story. Julia Roberts gives a sassy and brassy performance. Albert Finney does his part justice, as the beleagured small practitioner who decides to do the right thing, even though it could end to his detriment. His low key performance is a perfect foil to that of Julia Roberts'. It makes for a film well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts gives an excellent and Oscar worthy performance of real-life character Erin Brockovich who in finding a way to make ends meet stumbles upon a case of big corporate bully and exploiter of the innocent against the simple folk and serves as the catalyst in putting ambulance chasing to good use for a change.  In stark contrast to the beginning of the show where Erin fails to take advantage of ambulance chasing on the small scale with her traffic accident claim the huge payoff she gets at the end of the show where she presumably helps more people than just herself and her kids seems to argue a case for the necessity of this particular form of legal practice to protect the little guy who would otherwise have no way to seek proper justice.<br /><br />It is indeed amazingly hypocritical for Americans to decry poisonous Chinese-made toys and/or melamine laced candy when they themselves are poisoning their own citizen's drinking water however this in no way excuses the Chinese situation naturally although it is interesting to see just how if given a chance American companies would happily kill innocents for the almighty dollar without a second thought.<br /><br />This dvd has good special features such as interviews with Erin herself as well as a making-of documentary.  The picture and sound quality are both good without any obvious blemish to report.  It's hard to resist an underdog makes good story like this one and for this reason, this film ages pretty well.  Not the best film I've ever seen but certainly not the worst either.</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>Despite the merit of those films that won all the 2000 Oscars, this film deserved more. Soderbergh's film was my favorite that year. It was totally entertaining, gripping, and handled the serious subject with humor and a straight-forward drive. There is never a dull moment. (I don't understand why &quot;Traffic&quot; won the Oscar for its choppy, coarse editing, while this wasn't even nominated). I've also never understood the standards involved in the Best Sound category, but every subtle whisper &amp; utterance of Susannah Grant's brilliant screenplay was clear, crisp and understood; also not nominated for Best Sound.  What the Oscars got totally right was Julia's performance. This was an example of total control and commitment. I haven't been so impressed in many years. I was also very impressed with the kid performances of Scotty Leavenworth &amp; Gemmenne de la Pena as Erin's kids. They were real and natural. I can't tolerate bad kid actors. I was impressed with the performances of Marg Helgenberger and Cherry Jones, and Jamie Harrold (as Scott) was perfectly dorky, a real treat. Then there was the great Albert Finney who seemed to be the centering force in the whole spiel. He was customarily excellent. This is, quite simply, an excellent film, and deserved a lot more credit than Julia's flawless performance. I find, lately, that this is the film I play when looking for a real &quot;feel good&quot; movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Despite its terrific performances and excellent pacing, "Erin Brockovich" proves most of all that no matter how trashy, foul-mouthed or self-absorbed a good-looking white woman is, she will always come out on top, especially if she puts her best boobs forward.  Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility.  Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault.  After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility.  The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a "common" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior.  For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around.  Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems to be more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible.  And she expects a big check in the end.  I just don't buy into the cockeyed moral center of the movie, no matter how much gritty charm Roberts brings to the lead role.  Ultimately, of course, Brockovich triumphs, but the movie makes it clear that its her looks and aggression that open doors for her.  True to life?  Probably.  But so is cancer.  Doesn't mean I want it or need to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A91LE0MPYE8GJ.html">A91LE0MPYE8GJ</a><br/><p>I liked, Erin Brockavich Julia Roberts performance was, good she did good  in this also in Pretty Women I liked it alot.

Well, yes it is. Hollywood likes to turn out  these &quot;little-man (or more recently, woman) against the system&quot;  spectacles, and they can be counted on to have many in the audience  cheering on the quixotic main characters in their fights against a.  corporate polluters b. union busters c. corrupt politicians d. the powers  that be in any of their permuations.<p>So in that regard, ERIN BROCKOVICH  is not especially original. It is, however, effective--as good an example  of the genre as any you're likely to find.  As a tough-but-sensitive broad  with a heart of gold, Julia Roberts turns in another winning performance.  She cements her much vaunted &quot;comeback&quot; with a somewhat more  serious role than she usually gets and may well walk off with an Oscar for  her efforts. (Think of MASK-era Cher with a social cause.) And the rest of  the cast is very good indeed.  Much attention has been paid to Albert  Finney, who is very good as Erin's irascible boss.  More attention should  have been given to Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger and the all too briefly  seen Cherry Jones.  <p>Following on the heels of THE LIMEY and OUT OF  SIGHT, the film represents another step forward on director Steven  Soderbergh's comeback trail as well.  It is, of course, a much less daring  film than Soderbergh is capable of.  But he is entitled to enjoy the  success (both artistic and commercial) achieved here. So it's a tad  formulaic, EB is solid work all around.</p></br><a href="../users/AO3JW5VHT2GQ.html">AO3JW5VHT2GQ</a><br/><p>Summary:<br />Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an ex-beauty queen with three children, two ex-husbands, no job, and no job skills. The movie begins with Erin flubbing a job interview and getting in an accident. She hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to sue the other driver. When Ed loses the case Erin demands he give her a job. He does and when she takes a personal interest in a pro bono case that turns out to be a major civil suite, Ed and Erin push it through to victory landing a multi-million dollar settlement against Pacific Gas and Electric. Though Erin isn't a legal expert, she is a people person and it's through her efforts that the case is really won.<p>My Comments:<br />The movie isn't particularly quick, suspenseful, or exciting, but it is remarkably well-produced. The cinematography is great; some of the scenes are even shot in Hinkley, CA, giving the movie a very authentic feel. Ed, Erin, and George (Aaron Eckhart) - the three main actors - are great and well-portrayed.<p>I felt like I was left not knowing what turns out with George, Erin's boyfriend, and there is only one scene of Erin informing people of the court's decision. Too much time was spent on Erin collecting plaintiffs in Hinkley and not enough on her relationship with George and her kids, unless, of course, she really was incredibly neglectful of her family and friends.<p>I'm doing my best to not comment on the story itself, because it is a true story, but I couldn't help but see Erin as an annoying pain. Perhaps that means Julia Roberts did a good job, nevertheless, I wouldn't mind avoiding someone as caustic as Erin was portrayed in my personal life.<p>Overall, the movie is entertaining and well done with just a few flaws. If you like Julia Roberts or legal films, you'll probably enjoy this film. Otherwise, you might find it a bit boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A26JGAM6GZMM4V.html">A26JGAM6GZMM4V</a><br/><p>As is so often the case with a film based on a real person, this film continues to be at the center of controversy. I have no idea how  &quot;true&quot; its screenplay is and now comment on the film itself.  First off, I think Roberts's acting is solid but hardly worthy of the  lavish praise it has received. True, it's hard not to notice her but she is  hardly in the same league with Field and Streep who portrayed similar  characters. Albeit less photgenic and certainly less energetic, Albert  Finney (as Ed Masry) does much the better job. Given the tragic and  potentially tragic circumstances presented in the film, I expected them to  be the primary source of tension rather than whether or not Erin will get a  job, win the lawsuit after the automobile accident, etc. As is, the film's  priorities seem to suggest that Erin's sense of self-worth is more  important than a cancer which has killed or will kill less glamorous folk.  I enjoyed the movie. I wish I could admire it more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a nearly destitute single mother of three who while working for a small lawyer, Ed Masry, has an almost forgotten a pro bono case the lawyer is working on for a family in Hinckley, CA thrown on her desk for her to file.  The case involves possible chromium contamination in the water due to negligence on the part of utilities giant Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  Erin becomes intrigued by it and through her tireless effort and Masry's support, they ultimately win the case and receive the largest class action settlement in history.  Director Steven Soderbergh takes what could have been into a television movie of the week story and turns it into an intelligent, funny, dramatic and thought provoking film.  Julia Roberts is absolutely magnificent in the title role.  Her wardrobe in the film (pushup bras and tight clothing which are nice) garnered alot of attention, but they are merely a sideshow to the best acting job of her career.  She makes us feel for the situation Erin is in and through her compassion for the people of Hinckley, we too become involved and concerned for them as well.  Albert Finney contributes his usual first rate acting to the role of Ed Masry.  He perfectly plays off Ms. Roberts, absorbing the rants and abuse she heaps on him and then returning the favor with a few zingers of his own.  Aaron Eckert plays Erin's boyfriend George with the right amount caring and support that gets tested throughout the film.  Marg Helgenberger is great as a Hinckley resident who family is being broken down due to the chromium poisoning.  Ms. Roberts recently won the 2000 Best Actress Oscar and despite all the hype, it was a well deserved award.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T17LMQABMBN5.html">A1T17LMQABMBN5</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts is known for her romantic comedies. Even though she hasn't exactly been typecast, films like Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway  Bride stand out in her film r&eacute;sum&eacute;. However, she has proven that her acting  is definitely worthy of an Oscar with Erin Brockovich. <p>This is a true  story about a struggling single mother whose only wish is to have some  financial security for her three children. Having suffered a minor car  accident, she persuades her lawyer into hiring her. She begins to take  interest in a particular case. Several families have suffered from diseases  because their water is contaminated with chromium -- the Multi-billionaire  Company responsible has offered to buy their homes for a lot less than the  market value. The lawsuit, of course, is a big one for such a small law  firm, but neither Erin nor Ed (Albert Finney) has given up on the fact that  the company must be punished. <p>Julia Roberts has brought a dynamic  heroine to life.

Doesn't mean I want it or need to see it.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground. Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A  Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale  of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or  compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly  quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath. All the above five films  expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that  have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as  well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities. In the case  of `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&amp;E electrical plant located  in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California. It seems  that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a  mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that  PG&amp;E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at  their site. The company has even brought in medical professionals and  toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears. Almost by chance,  Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge  of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&amp;E's gross  malfeasance in the process.<p>Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must  concede that there really isn't much that is new here. However, thanks to a  pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney  and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven  Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph. This may, in  fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine. First of all, she is often  abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor. Dressed more like a fashion  devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal  executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades  at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent  to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion. Yet, it  is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the  people she is trying so desperately to help. A twice-divorced mother of  three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in  the defense of her case. Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of  internal contradictions. Much as she loves her children, she has made a  shambles of her life in recent years. Rootless and lacking the skills  necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get  hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a  traffic accident case. Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down  her rhetoric or her temper - or to adopt the more `professional' attire of  the business world - even if it might mean that she would be taken more  seriously by those around her. She assumes that no man would be willing to  consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and  marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her  insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is  fighting begin to drive him away - and her children as well. Most  fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the  suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she  herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks  into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an  issue. All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of  believable paradoxes. Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality,  wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth. Grant, by  making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the  incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.<p>And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly. Never  before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action  and statement. She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to  focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this  complex woman. This is definitely Oscar-caliber work. Equally brilliant is  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial,  easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls  colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with  withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&amp;E but the  seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case. One  of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity  harridan - a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does  us.<p>If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's  romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door. He  seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is  necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her  portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting  and believable part of the tale. We feel we are being too often distracted  from the meaty center of the story. <p>Still, this is a minor quibble about  a film that works so beautifully on so many levels. As Erin Brockovich,  Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous  talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2X6GEC6LCDN4S.html">A2X6GEC6LCDN4S</a><br/><p>Roberts makes a lot of formula pictures...but this one wasn't too bad.

Too dummed down!</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>If you watch this film more than once, you find yourself sitting back, and letting it wash over you. This isn't one of my favourite Julia Roberts movies, but it's an OK one. OK, sure, some people talk about her big mouth, and she works it out quite a bit. But we have to give a big hand to Wonderbra - they worked wonders on Julia!<p>This film gets bogged down by a lot of jargon about the world that Julia's character works in. Not enough attention is paid to her attention of her kids, or their father(s). Some will say the highligh of the movie is Julia prancing around in a low cut top, belts, and sky scraping heels. True. But put that aside and you've got a potentially good movie on your hands. It could have been cut, and been much more interesting. I wouldn't have given Julia an Oscar for it though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Great movie! Nicely told with great acting! I love the fact that Ms. Brockovich made this case happen! She was the underdog here when no one wanted to employ her because she didn't have the right look or the job experience. But Brockovich made things work to her advantage. The same can be said of the case in this movie which Brockovich helped her employers research and win!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>It's my sister who's the REAL fan, and while staying at her house for 3 days last summer, I 'got' to watch this movie 5 times, so I think I can speak from some experience when saying I enjoyed it anew each time. Plus: I've seen it twice on cross-country plane trips, once in the local theater, and once on home video. Lordy!<br />Anyway...<br />This fact-based movie earned Julia Roberts an Oscar, deservedly. It captured her ability for slapstick, pathos, drama, etc. Twice-divorced and flat broke Brokovich forces her way into a job in the office of a lawyer who failed to win her a big award in a traffic accident injury case, then goes on to make herself indispensible in the investigation of toxic chromium contamination of the groundwater of little no-place, no-count Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a plague of pain, death and disease. With her common-folk ways, she succeeds in winning the confidence of 100% of the distrustful and jaded populance - and a huge award in a personal injury case against big business.<br />5 stars for the movie, 5 stars for Brokovich and J. Roberts, 5 stars for the little guys of the world who triumph against the big bucks of corporate arrogance.</p></br><a href="../users/AK81WLVD5KGUX.html">AK81WLVD5KGUX</a><br/><p>It's sure hard to find any opinions about this movie that aren't knee-jerk. On the one hand, the movie and its hero are attacked by people who don't seem to think corporations can do any wrong. On the other, it's defended by people who seem to think having a Good Heart is all that's necessary to Defend The Environment and the Public Health.<p><p>Well, the true story involves _both_ junk science _and_ sleazy corporate practices. And whether or not the &quot;science&quot; in the movie is defended by actual scientists (which it isn't), Erin Brockovich was and is a hero.<p><p>One hard fact is that hexavalent chromium probably wasn't responsible for all the injuries attributed to it in this film. Yes, it's a carcinogen and it's dangerous when inhaled. But so far as I know, there's no evidence linking it to all the problems detailed in this movie when it's ingested as part of the drinking-water supply. (Not that I'd want to risk it myself, mind you.)<p><p>But another, and equally important, hard fact is that Pacific Gas and Electric _did_ screw up big-time. The company knew Cr(VI) was a health hazard, _didn't_ know exactly what the risks were (at that time nobody did -- in fact we still don't), failed to take obvious (and, for better or worse, EPA-mandated) precautions against polluting the local groundwater with the stuff, and then lied to everybody about everything. They were not heroes, and Brockovich did uncover their wrongdoing.<p><p>Brockovich, as I said, was and is a hero, and she is well portrayed in this film. I am not ordinarily a fan of Julia Roberts (in fact, frankly, I haven't liked her in anything but _Steel Magnolias_). But she does a nice job here.<p><p>The movie, while (I'm told) varying in places from the facts of the actual story, manages to avoid falling into at least _some_ obvious cliches. Far, for example, from portraying a triumph of the &quot;little guy&quot; over the big corporate baddies, the film makes clear that the law firm for which Brockovich works _could not have won_ without the aid of a big-corporate-baddie lawyer (Peter Coyote) with both money and toxic-torts experience.<p><p>Brockovich doesn't much like this, but it's one of several points on which her knee-jerk, legally inexperienced judgment is simply shown to be wrong. Another is in her initial opposition to binding arbitration, a point handled nicely by Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who is marvelous throughout). And there's another cliche successfully avoided: refreshingly, the fact that Brockovich's &quot;heart is in the right place&quot; doesn't magically make her an expert who out-lawyers the lawyers at every turn.<p><p>It's probably impossible to avoid comparing this film to _A Civil Action_, which involves a somewhat similar set of facts. But unlike that other movie (which heavily fictionalized Jan Schlichtmann in any event), at bottom this is a character study of Brockovich herself. And, presented &quot;warts and all,&quot; she is much more interesting than ideologues in _either_ camp would like to allow.<p><p>She is most assuredly a very refreshing movie hero. Sassy, foul-mouthed, and occasionally downright mean (watch, e.g., her nasty comments to Conchatta Ferrell's character), she is also hard-working, (mostly) responsible, and hungry for justice. No cardboard cutout, she's a complicated person with genuine flaws, and Roberts plays her as such.<p><p>The real fun is in watching her learn to put her &quot;flaws&quot; to work on the side of the good guys. It's a joy to watch her win -- against the usual Hollywood gang of weaselly attorneys (including a condescending Miss Priss who has a hard time believing Brockovich has anything on the ball at all), against PG&amp;E itself, and against the shortcomings that have thus far kept her from success. It's impossible not to like her and root for her.<p><p>A satisfying film overall, then (and one that incidentally succeeds in many respects in which the heavy-handed and absolutely pathetic _Pay It Forward_ fails utterly). Many reviewers will probably disagree with me here, but I hope Julia Roberts never goes back to romantic comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ.html">A2TAPSNKK9AFSQ</a><br/><p>Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it.

This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records.  Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case.<br /><br />What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history.  This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being.  The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the "deleted scenes" feature).<br /><br />The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth.  A&E has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form.  Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances.  The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high.  The acting and dialogue alone are enough to carry this film.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the little guy taking on the giant, or a fan of Julia Roberts, either way you won't be disappointed.  Like Grisham's fictional 'The Rainmaker', you'll feel satisfied that sometimes the little guy can win ... in real life.  I recommend a 'buy'.

Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was an unemployed, poorly educated, single, twice-divorced mother of 3 young children trying to find work to make ends meet.  Following a car accident, her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), was unable to win her lawsuit against the other driver in part due to Erin's irascible and antagonistic demeanor.  Frustrated, Erin storms into Ed's office following the trial and demands a job from him.  He reluctantly hires her and sets her to work on a seemingly simple real-estate deal, but the deal is anything but simple as medical records of the involved homeowners are included in the file.  As Erin investigates, she meets the homeowners, Pete and Donna Jensen (Michael Harney and Marg Helgenberger respectively), who have been repeatedly sick for a long time, as well as their children.  The potential buyer is not an individual, but a major corporation that has an industrial plant very close to the couple's home.  Erin's investigation leads her to some potentially damaging information about the corporation's doings near the Jensen's home that has also affected many more people within the immediate area.<p>Though the story about sick homeowners and corporate doings is powerful and thought provoking, the time in the film devoted to Erin's homelife is far less compelling in part because of Julia Roberts' acting.  Julia Roberts earned the Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Erin Brockovich, but that was probably due more to the politics surrounding the film rather than the quality of actual acting.  The film was also nominated for four other Oscars including Best Supporting Actor (Albert Finney), Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Picture and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Other notable actors in the film include Aaron Eckhart as Erin's unemployed biker boyfriend George and the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo as a waitress.<p>Overall, for its engaging story about sickened residents in a small community but less than stellar acting, I rate "Erin Brockovich" with 4 out of 5 stars.  If you have never seen the film, I highly recommend seeing it at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK.html">A2OXDJP1Z3LNOK</a><br/><p>I avoided Erin for a long time but was pleasantly surprised when I finally broke down and watched it.  Normally, I equate Julia Roberts with fluffy no-brain movies and I was so happy that a serious movie with a good plot was actually produced from her.<p>This story really grabs you and you truly feel for those poor people.  Roberts and Albert Finney give terrific performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts is superb in portraying the very real, very fiesty Erin  Brockovich. Brockovich has a wit and intelligence that has been untapped in  her struggle to make ends meet as a twice-divorced single mom of  three.<p>Not only is it great to see someone down on their luck triumph,  it's even more cathartic to see that person achieve success beyond their  wildest dreams.<p>In the film, Brockovich is an endearing, caring mom, and  a bristly, spitfire hot-head to those who are in her way.<p>She ends up  being the instrumental researcher in a tainted water lawsuit that  vindicates hundreds of families that were taken for a ride by the local  water company - not to mention reaping great financial rewards for her  lawyer employer.<p>Albert Finney is phenomenal as the attorney that hires  her. His American is so flawless, it was hard to believe a British man was  playing this role - not to mention his perfect performance.<p>Nearly every  4-letter word in the book is spouted out in this movie, so it wouldn't make  a good gift to your kids, your mom or your church group.  In addition to  language, there is implied live-in sexual relationships that some parents  may not want their children viewing.<p>For adults, however, this was an  extremely entertaining film, especially when you realize it  is a true  story. Even the ending offers a surprise no one will expect.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I don't understand how anyone couldn't love Julia Roberts.  I mean I guess I can see how maybe she just isn't your brand of actress, but truly, she is extraordinary.  She has turned out classic performance after classic performance and is a standup person to boot.  Her portrayal of Erin Brockovich may actually be one of her most challenging roles and she delivers it with such precise determination and dedication that she becomes so real and engaging and truly memorable.  The best thing about `Erin Brockovich' though is that Roberts is not the only reason to stay and watch.  Sure, she has everything a movie star needs to keep her audience at her beck-and-call, but Soderbergh (who had such a marvelous year in 2000) doesn't rely solely on Roberts to carry his film.<br /><br />`Erin Brockovich' sports a brilliant script penned by Susannah Grant that utilizes fact with Hollywood drama and peppers in enough humor and charm to make the film stand out apart from your everyday biopic.<br /><br />The film tells to story of Erin Brockovich, a brash young single mother who winds up working for attorney Ed Masry.  Erin doesn't always rub people the right way, but her blunt self-confidence carries her a long way in the legal world, especially when she takes it upon herself to investigate further a case involving a power company and their blatant disregard for the health of the citizens of Hinkley, California.  As Erin becomes absorbed in the case her personal life starts to take a turn as she meets her kind-hearted yet gruff-exteriored neighbor George.  `Erin Brockovich' does a masterful job of melding this woman's personal and professional life together in a way that makes both sides of her interesting and entertaining, never once waning.<br /><br />One of the main reasons to watch this film is to witness the rapport between the actors on the screen.  Julia Roberts is a standout, obviously, but everyone involved pulls their weight and works wonderfully together.  Albert Finney is flawless as Ed Masry and should have won that Oscar.  His chemistry with Roberts is beautiful to witness, just beautiful.  In infuses this sense of paternal concern into his performance that makes Masry a likable and relatable character.  Another standout is Aaron Eckhart who marvelously captures the heart of George.  He plays to Roberts strengths and helps keep the personal side of this story lively and tender.<br /><br />In the end, `Erin Brockovich' is a film that stands on its own, a film that deserves to be seen and lauded.  Roberts received countless amounts of praise for her performance (and a much deserved Oscar to boot) but I think the Academy Award nominations for Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Director and Best Picture speak for themselves in declaring just how impressive this film really is.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>Julia Roberts gave a brilliant performance here as Erin Brockovich, a single mother who's temper is about as short as her skirts.  When she loses her case against the doctor who caused the car accident she was involved in she somewhat forces her way into a clerical job at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney), the lawyer that lost her case.  After reading a few files and growing genuinely concerned about a few clients Erin decides to investigate a case involving poisoned water supply that is slowing killing off the residents in Hinkley, California.  Julia gives such an effortless performance here that she doesn't even appear to be acting.  Everything is so natural, and that can be said for her cast mates as well.  Albert Finney is brilliant as the lawyer who's as offset as he is intrigued by his new employee's personality.  He perfectly compliments her in every scene they share, and the same can be said for Aaron Eckhart who plays George, Erin's neighbor who falls in love with her and offers her the stability she's always needed and never received.  This film, if nothing else, is a beautiful canvas for these talented actors, but acting aside, the script helps move the film along effortlessly and smoothly offering a top notch movie experience that never grows weary or tired.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one.<br /><br />We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions<br /><br />On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.<br /><br />One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and "Requiem for a dream". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.<br /><br />Excellent edition and magisterial direction of Steven Soderbergh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>What makes Julia Roberts' Oscar winning performance as Erin Brockovich so meaningful is that unlike fellow winners Charlize Theron (Monster); Nicole Kidman (The Hours); and Halle Berry (Monster's Ball), Roberts didn't hide behind makeup or non-glamor to win her trophy.  She utilizes her physical attributes and then some in playing the scrappy, but somewhat tawdry, young woman who brings down a corporate giant.  Roberts is brilliant in the role and shows a wider range than ever before.  She is backed by a wonderful supporting cast including the marvelous Albert Finney as her lawyer boss and friend; Aaron Eckhart as the biker boyfriend who feels cheated in the relationship; Marg Helgenberger as the cancer-stricken client that starts the ball rolling; and Conchata Ferrell as the "krispy kreme" office worker who she spars with.  Director Stephen Soderbergh (an Oscar winner for TRAFFIC) wisely keeps the focus on Brockovich's determination and her single motherhood dilemma.  It's a very entertaining, and thought-provoking, movie, a showcase for one of Hollywood's modern icons.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>Erin Brokavitch is one of the best &quot;true to life&quot; movies I have ever seen.  Julia Roberts gave the performance of her career in this film about a young woman who strives to save a dying community and still handle three kids ans a relationship.  The other performances that were played really well were the roles of Aaron Echeart and Albert Finney's.  The movie also has a good score and soundtrack.  The film is definately one of the best films of the 2000s.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"Erin Brockovich" proves that you don't need a college degree to make a difference in the world.  This true story was wonderfully written and directed By Stephen Soderborgh.  He has his unique styles in displicting certain important scenes so the audience can understand the deeper atmosphere that these characters are in.  Julia Roberts was well-deserving of her Oscar for Best Actress for the portrayal of this feisty, strong-willed woman.  Her emotional and financial struggles prove that there is always hope for a brighter future.  The real-life Brockovich isn't a bad actress as performed in her small role as a waitress.  The screenplay has many creative words giving it a broader emotional edge.  Some are funny.  This will force the audience to listen closer to what every character says, especially Brockovich.<p>I've owned this movie for two years, and I still find new and better reasons to love it everytime I watch it.  I'm sure you'll think the same.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>We all know what happened to the real Erin Brockovich &amp; we all know what happened to the actress that played the role.  The real Erin landed a partnership position in the law firm &amp; Julia, the actress, bagged the Oscar's.  Now, that's what I call 'real girl power'!  If you're looking for role models, there's no need to further look around, you've finally found them.  The real &amp; reel Erin Brockovich.</p></br><a href="../users/AS7B4W4KOPQNV.html">AS7B4W4KOPQNV</a><br/><p>I wasn't expecting much from this film at first, having a bad opinion of Julia Roberts's acting abilities.  However, I was pleasantly suprised to find that she infact does have talent.  The film is based on the true story of a big company contaminating the water of a town with chromium 6 and telling the residents that it was good for them.  Erin (Julia Roberts) finds out about it, and makes the company pay $334,000,000 to the residents that were affected by the contaminated water.  Roberts definately deserved the Oscar for this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AM2PV53UX1JEQ.html">AM2PV53UX1JEQ</a><br/><p>I was genuinely surprised to find Julia Roberts, who is difficult not to enjoy in any movie, immersing herself into the role of Erin -- her entire body language is different, as is her demeanor. She deserves an Oscar nod for this rousing movie, which only sporadically becomes a Hollywood-ish version of the truth.  The story, mostly true, is richly compelling, as are the characters of Erin, Ed (her boss, deftly played by an older, jollier Albert Finney) and George (Erin's too-good-to-be-true biker boyfriend, who is dashingly handsome beneath the ponytail).  For all of her alarmingly, and entertainingly over the top costumes, Julia's personal beauty has never radiated with as many layers as it does in this terrific story of a &quot;nobody&quot; who has the guts, determination, pride and smarts to take on the Establishment in a big way.  Her natural warmth works spectacularly well with the sad victims she tends to; the movie as a whole makes you want to cheer!</p></br></body></html>
